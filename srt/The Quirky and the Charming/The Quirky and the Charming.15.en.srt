2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,320
No, thanks.

4
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,440
Don't go! Take one.

5
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,960
Over there.

6
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,866
It looks pretty fun.

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,800
Yi Ran, come with me.

8
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go over there.

9
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:52,800
They have scarves there.

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,760
Hey, beautiful.

11
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,560
See if there's anything you like.

12
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,240
A green one.

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,680
It actually matches your outfit.

14
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,320
Do you want it?

15
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,680
Take a look.

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,680
What do you think?

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,400
Yi Ran?

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,329
This is way too green.

19
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,720
- Too green.
- Have you tried that?

20
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,320
Look at this.

21
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:17,911
- So cute!
- I'm returning the scarf.

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,560
You...

23
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:25,400
Let's go.

24
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
This is obviously awful.

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,680
What's this?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,560
Let me see it.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,520
Free samples!

28
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,440
These are chicken feet.

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,840
Try some.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,022
Yi Ran, let's keep browsing.

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,280
Look at that.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,680
A toy store!

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,600
Thanks!

34
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:43,920
Just a little bit.

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,680
See that?

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,960
I didn't expect it to be this nice.

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
A cake shop!

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,640
That...

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
Look up there.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,480
That's fun.

41
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,200
It's lively there.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,680
Come on!

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
That sign looks amazing!

44
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,200
Let's go!

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
How about we grab a coffee there?

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,440
Sounds good.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,440
Let's go in a bit then.

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,360
Let's take a selfie!

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,120
- Let's take it over there.
- Let's just take it here.

50
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,150
I'll take it for you.

51
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:10,720
No need.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Yi Ran.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,960
Do you remember?

54
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,160
We used to dance like this
when we were kids.

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,960
You call that dancing?

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,240
That was an exercise routine.

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
And you always dragged me into it.

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Same thing.

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,360
Come on, let's join them!

60
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,040
One, two, switch!

61
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,880
It's raining!

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,720
Yi Ran!

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Yi Ran!

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,720
Hurry, hurry!

65
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Let's find shelter!

66
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:46,200
Over here!

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,340
=The Quirky and The Charming=

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,880
Why are you here alone?

69
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,080
Where's Ling Yishu?

70
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:18,777
We got separated.

71
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:19,920
Where's Lin Youjia?

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,760
We got separated too.

73
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,200
Nice.

74
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,000
I mean...

75
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,720
What a coincidence.

76
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:37,960
There's shelter over there.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,711
Come on, let's go.

78
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,040
Get inside, hurry!

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,640
Alright.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,880
This rain is really coming down hard.

81
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,760
It's been raining nonstop
these past few days.

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,111
It starts pouring out of nowhere.

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,560
Thankfully, it only lasts a while.

84
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Do people still believe

85
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,040
in these love locks?

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,720
The love locks here
are incredibly effective.

87
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,840
That's just superstitious nonsense.

88
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,920
You can't just dismiss fate.

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,880
Look at this situation.

90
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
You two are stuck here together.

91
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,680
That's not just a coincidence.

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,280
If you ask me, you two

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,080
were probably connected
in a past life too.

94
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,640
Or maybe we had some
bad karma to settle.

95
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
What's wrong with you?

96
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
You ran for shelter

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
and forgot about Yi Ran!

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,160
Where is she? You lost her?

99
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,720
How is that my fault?
The rain came out of nowhere.

100
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,880
It was crowded and chaotic.

101
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,360
You couldn't even
keep track of one person?

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,680
Like you're any better?

103
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
Where's Xiao Mucheng?

104
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,360
Don't tell me you lost him too.

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,560
Mind your own business!

106
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,760
This place is crowded.

107
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,120
Just go find out
which tent Yi Ran is in.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,760
You should just admit when you're wrong.

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,000
Apologizing won't hurt your pride.

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,320
Think about it. Decades from now,

111
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,822
you'll be nothing but ashes.

112
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:07,377
All you'll have left is
a grave to keep you company.

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,800
By then, regret will be useless.

114
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,520
Listen to me, young man.

115
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:13,466
Trust my advice.

116
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,840
Madam, I understand your point.

117
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,880
What's this?

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,880
This is a love lock.

119
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,480
It's incredibly effective.

120
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,920
It will lock your love together.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,560
Forever and ever.

122
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,480
Just buy one to help me
make my first sale.

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,880
Take it for forty.

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,640
I thought you were an enlightened sage.

125
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,080
Even sages need to make a living.

126
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,600
Right?

127
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
The rain stopped.

128
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,840
Thank you, madam.

129
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,280
Thanks.

130
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,160
Young man!

131
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,440
Love requires effort and commitment.

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,400
- Forty.
- But...

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,760
- No.
- Come on.

134
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,640
I don't have cash.

135
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,440
And also...

136
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:55,600
Scan the code.

137
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
This color is a bit...

138
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,120
Gold?

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
Gold symbolizes prosperity.
Scan the code.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,760
Alright, thanks.

141
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,520
Great, great.

142
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,840
I...

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,880
Watch out!

144
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Don't step on me!

145
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,080
Be careful.

146
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,952
Sorry, sorry!

147
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,520
Are you okay?

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,400
You're unbelievably clumsy.

149
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I got a different color.

150
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,980
(Love Lock. Eternal Bond.
Two hearts beat as one.)

151
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,880
No, no, no!

152
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
I can't handle this!

153
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
You're giving up already?

154
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,622
Then, do it yourself.

155
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,560
Keep going!

156
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Go on!

157
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,840
Are these hands or pliers?

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,120
Who are you calling pliers?

159
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,511
I'm giving you a foot massage!

160
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,150
You should be grateful
for this blessing.

161
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,400
And you're still complaining?

162
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,040
You're back. Help him with the massage.

163
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,111
What happened to your foot?

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,000
I...

165
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,240
Someone stepped on it.

166
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,000
Does it hurt?

167
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
A lot.

168
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
When I got hurt as a kid,

169
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,520
you always blew on it for me.

170
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
It doesn't hurt anymore.

171
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,840
That feels so nice.

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,760
Why did you stop?

173
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,720
It hurts again.

174
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,640
Yi Ran, keep going!

175
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,840
This massage feels amazing.

176
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,355
You're really good at this.

177
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
It hurts, right?

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,422
Let me straighten it for you.

179
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,400
Go away!

180
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,520
Help!

181
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,000
Does it still hurt?

182
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,066
Does it still hurt?

183
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,640
Help!

184
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:04,480
Alright, sir.

185
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Here's your room key.

186
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,280
Alright, thanks.

187
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
Ms. Gao Xu just arrived.
She's over there.

188
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,280
Welcome to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

189
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Sorry for the wait.
Here's your room key.

190
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,440
Ms. Gao, all set.
Let's head up. This way.

191
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,040
Lu.

192
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,720
Send two guests up to room 2027.

193
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,200
Ms. Gao Xu and her assistant.

194
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:37,733
Housekeeping, be ready to assist.

195
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,360
Got it.

196
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
How does she maintain
such a youthful look?

197
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,160
Cheers!

198
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,760
Cheers!

199
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,520
Cheers!

200
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,880
Each of us was supposed to cook a dish.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
You barely put in any effort!

202
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
What? It's salmon!

203
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,200
You call that cooking?

204
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
It's salmon! Look...

205
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,440
I sliced it beautifully.

206
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,640
You just put it on a dish.

207
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
Plating is an art too!

208
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,120
Enough arguing.

209
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,000
Let's eat already. I'm starving.

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,600
Don't be so picky.

211
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,080
Why are you fighting me for fish balls?

212
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
I grabbed them first.

213
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,600
You need to learn to let go.

214
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,360
I claimed these fish balls
when they were

215
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,280
still fish.

216
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:22,755
Did you ask the fish for permission?

217
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,320
Are you two serious right now?

218
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,760
There's premium salmon
right in front of you,

219
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,422
and you're fighting over fish balls?

220
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,720
Can we just sit and eat

221
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,600
like normal people?

222
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,960
Fine.

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Salmon is obviously better.

224
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,080
Not bad.

225
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,022
It melts in the mouth.

226
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,360
You should try it too.

227
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
It's sweet but not overwhelming.

228
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
See? I'm generous.

229
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,400
Here, this one's top-tier.

230
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,080
What is it?

231
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:06,560
Does it taste good?

232
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,440
Yeah, not bad. What is it?

233
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,360
It's better if you don't know.

234
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,400
Why?

235
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,440
Stop being mysterious. Just tell me.

236
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,080
You asked for it.

237
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
It's chicken tail.

238
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,760
It's chicken butt?

239
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,160
It's pretty tasty.

240
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,088
I should study the recipe.

241
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,888
You said you'd save that piece for me?

242
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,120
The mood is just right here!

243
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,720
Why are you two fighting
over a chicken butt?

244
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,577
- So uncultured.
- So uncultured.

245
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,600
Cheers!

246
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,440
I saw everything just now,
and you're still denying it?

247
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,240
You were obviously filming.

248
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,222
Who gave you permission?

249
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,040
I wasn't!

250
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,040
Perfect timing.

251
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:53,355
She's been secretly filming me.

252
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,555
How do we deal with her?

253
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,080
Miss,

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,560
could you please show us your phone?

255
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,280
I really wasn't recording.

256
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,777
Check it if you don't believe me.

257
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,920
What about these photos?

258
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,088
I didn't even notice
what was behind me.

259
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
I don't even know who she is.

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,320
Cut the act.

261
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,440
I've seen plenty of people like you.

262
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
You take photos
while pretending to take selfies.

263
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,760
You're a fan of Miss Bei Lala,
aren't you?

264
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,600
She already checked out.

265
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,320
I know.

266
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,320
I just wanted

267
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,600
to take one last picture
of where she stayed.

268
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,360
Miss, could this all
be a misunderstanding?

269
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,200
Misunderstanding?

270
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
Stop playing peacemakers.

271
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:36,888
She was caught red-handed.
How is it a misunderstanding?

272
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
She has to delete the photos

273
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,120
and apologize.

274
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,160
Ai.

275
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,880
Ms. Gao.

276
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,200
Just delete the photos and let it go.

277
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,880
Ms. Gao, I only saw one photo.

278
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
Who knows how many more she took?

279
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,320
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,000
As a public figure,

281
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,640
I have to be strict with myself

282
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,760
in all aspects.

283
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,040
Image management

284
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,640
is part of my job,

285
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,840
and I don't want my fans

286
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,280
to see me looking unkempt

287
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,000
in my private life.

288
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,960
So I hope you can understand.

289
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,040
Forget it,

290
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:26,711
it was just a misunderstanding.

291
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
Sorry for taking up your time.

292
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,400
No worries.

293
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
This is our job.

294
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,800
Please get some rest,

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,640
and let us know if you need anything.

296
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,120
Alright.

297
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,800
Goodbye.

298
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
Who is Bei Lala?

299
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,560
She's an internet celebrity.

300
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,200
Miss.

301
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,400
Who is Gao Xu? Is she really famous?

302
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:15,040
Keep your voice down.

303
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,800
She's a washed-up actress.

304
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:19,800
But her assistant acts
so high and mighty.

305
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,480
I thought she was an A-list celebrity.

306
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,040
However, she actually seems pretty nice.

307
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,280
You don't get it, do you?

308
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,240
A lot of celebrities
and their assistants

309
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,080
are like this.

310
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,200
Like what?

311
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,720
One plays the good cop,
and the other plays the bad cop.

312
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,240
Yi Ran.

313
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,040
I'm jealous of you.

314
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,080
You're the first person in this world

315
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,240
who's ever been jealous of me.

316
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Funny, isn't it?

317
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,960
You're also the first person

318
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,600
I've ever been jealous of.

319
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,960
I can understand you do not like me,

320
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,080
but what are you jealous of?

321
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,320
I envy how free-spirited

322
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,600
and unrestrained you are.

323
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,320
You do what you want without worry,

324
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,800
and you never pretend
to be someone you're not.

325
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,400
But I also admire you.

326
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:41,160
An executive at Bright Platinum Hotel,

327
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,600
smart and capable,

328
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,888
a rich, successful woman
everyone envies.

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
Your life peaked
the moment you were born.

330
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
And I'm just an ordinary nobody,

331
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,600
with no money and no status.

332
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,040
I don't even have a home.

333
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,280
But, you have Vincent.

334
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,680
Can you give him to me?

335
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,080
Do you realize

336
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,800
you sound like a child

337
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,800
talking about losing a favorite toy?

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It doesn't matter, as long as you agree.

339
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sorry,

340
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,200
but I can't.

341
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,000
Yi Ran.

342
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,280
Come on, let's go back
and get some sleep.

343
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,200
Slow down.

344
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,080
I understand how you feel now.

345
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,400
We're just two

346
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,160
pitiful clowns in the same boat.

347
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,040
I won't curse you anymore.

348
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,240
And I won't mock you for acting cool.

349
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,760
Good night.

350
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,400
Hello, the restaurant is empty now.

351
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,960
Ms. Gao can go down for dinner.

352
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,160
Alright, thank you.

353
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,360
Ms. Gao, the restaurant is empty now.

354
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,560
We can go down.

355
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,360
Did they send over the contract?

356
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,400
Not yet.

357
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,640
In that case,

358
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,600
tell them
that even though I'm already here,

359
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,320
if the first payment isn't made,

360
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,200
I won't be attending this event.

361
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,080
Got it, I'll call them soon.

362
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,400
How's the thing I asked you to arrange?

363
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,560
It's all set.

364
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,622
Don't worry, Ms. Gao.

365
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,280
Have you seen Yi Ran?

366
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,200
No.

367
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,240
My right eyelid has been
twitching for days.

368
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,800
I have a feeling
something bad is coming.

369
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
Let's hope it's something good.

370
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,600
- Two two three four...
- Madam Qin.

371
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,400
Five...

372
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,040
Madam Qin.

373
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,360
Look what I brought you.

374
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Ran.

375
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Not bad.

376
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,320
You recognized me instantly.

377
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,040
Grandma, hello.

378
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,200
Why haven't you come
these past few days?

379
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,320
Grandma, this is my first time visiting.

380
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,760
She must have mistaken you
for someone else.

381
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,200
Come on, try it.

382
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
I bought it just for you.

383
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:41,150
The water temperature
should be just right.

384
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,640
Here.

385
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,480
This one can heat up automatically
and even massage your feet.

386
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:50,520
Oh, right, Grandma.

387
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,800
I bought you some fruit.

388
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,480
Pick the ones you like.

389
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,240
I don't eat fruit.

390
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,800
My teeth aren't good.

391
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
I want cake.

392
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,360
Cake?

393
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,600
I'll buy you one.

394
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:06,000
She has diabetes.
She can't eat anything too sweet.

395
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,560
Does this feel good?

396
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,440
Yes, it does.

397
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,000
You work hard to earn money,

398
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,400
so don't splurge.

399
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,200
Just let Cheng

400
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,960
come over
and give me a massage instead.

401
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,680
Which Cheng are you talking about?

402
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,320
The one

403
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,360
who paid for my hospital bills.

404
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,640
Didn't you tell him to come?

405
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,280
Does he come often?

406
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,200
He used to visit a lot.

407
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,560
Lately, not so much.

408
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,480
But...

409
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,240
His massage technique is pretty good.

410
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,640
Better than your dad's.

411
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,520
Grandma.

412
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,600
Are your teeth hurting?

413
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,360
My teeth don't hurt.

414
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,560
It's yummy, right?

415
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,520
Who is it?

416
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
Did you order roasted sweet potatoes?

417
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,000
Where did this sweet potato girl
come from?

418
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:52,644
Which one do you want?

419
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,840
I'll take the big one.

420
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,360
Alright.

421
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,600
It smells so good.

422
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:01,911
This tastes amazing!

423
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,400
How's yours?

424
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,520
Oh, right.

425
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,760
Take this vitamin.

426
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,320
Take one whenever you remember,

427
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:12,822
but it can't replace a real meal.

428
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,280
You still need to eat properly.

429
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,880
I knew you cared about me the most.

430
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Don't be silly.

431
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,840
Who else would I care about?

432
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,040
I want to leave this place.

433
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,760
Why?

434
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,560
Is your family pressuring you again?

435
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,600
If it's about money, just tell me.

436
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,111
I'll help you figure it out.

437
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,280
It's not about money.

438
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,920
I'm just tired.

439
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:54,244
I can't keep wandering.

440
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
But you said

441
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,760
there were things we can't give up

442
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,039
even when you were exhausted.

443
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,640
Are you sure you want to give up now?

444
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,560
Of course not.

445
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,040
But what can I do about it?

446
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,320
Teach me, then.

447
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,000
I used to think
having a dream was so cool.

448
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,960
But now,

449
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
having a dream feels like a joke.

450
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,880
Look at me.

451
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,440
I livestream every day,

452
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,680
but my viewers

453
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,400
never go past fifty.

454
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,920
I sing at bars,

455
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,200
but people only care about looks.

456
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,480
I don't see a future.

457
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,320
I don't see hope.

458
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,640
Yiyi.

459
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,480
I know all these years

460
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
haven't been easy for you.

461
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,480
And I haven't exactly been much help.

462
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,280
Don't say that.

463
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,560
Having a friend like you

464
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,920
is more than enough.

465
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,440
So you're really sure about this?

466
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,600
(If your heart races)

467
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,040
(when you're near someone,)

468
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,040
(then you like them.)

469
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,720
Ow.

470
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Do you really not like me even a little?

471
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,560
Lin Youjia.

472
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,200
I won't curse you anymore.

473
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,480
And I won't mock you for acting cool.

474
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,880
Not looking good.

475
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,600
It's time for you to step in.

476
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,200
Let's lay it all out.

477
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,480
Release the news tomorrow.

478
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,400
Would you accompany me, this old man,

479
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:49,600
to a place?

480
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,880
I hope you didn't
take the last incident to heart.

481
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,680
To be honest,

482
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,200
I've been working
since I was a teenager.

483
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,520
I've seen my fair share

484
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,560
of trouble.

485
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,240
Besides, I wasn't the one who lost out.

486
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
You're pretty open-minded.

487
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,520
Chairman Xiao.

488
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,440
Every second of your time is precious.

489
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:18,080
Don't waste it on small talk with me.

490
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,840
Please get to the point.

491
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,000
I've collected these
from all over the world.

492
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,840
Every piece is worth a fortune.

493
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,000
If I hadn't brought you here,

494
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,244
you wouldn't have
had the chance to see them.

495
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,800
I appreciate the invitation,

496
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,560
but I'm not interested.

497
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,400
Of course.

498
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,400
Everyone has different tastes.

499
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,200
But those differences

500
00:29:54,555 --> 00:29:55,320
are exactly why

501
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,080
people aren't the same.

502
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,000
And sometimes,

503
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,280
those differences are insurmountable.

504
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,080
Mucheng grew up using a knife and fork.

505
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,000
And you?

506
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,920
Knife and fork, and chopsticks...

507
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,440
They are just tools for eating.

508
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,200
As long as you're full, does it matter?

509
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,680
You're smart.

510
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,680
But reality isn't
something you can ignore.

511
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,640
You and Mucheng were born

512
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,360
in completely different worlds.

513
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,320
Your lifestyles,

514
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,160
your perspectives,

515
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,920
and even your values do not align.

516
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:39,520
Mucheng has never

517
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,400
met a girl like you in his life.

518
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,360
A little fascination is only natural.

519
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,520
But what happens when that fades?

520
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,020
(Live News 24h)

521
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,640
Breaking news.

522
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,920
Today, two major corporations,
TY and Gaosheng,

523
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:10,100
(Strategic Cooperation Framework)
have formed a strategic partnership.

524
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,079
(TY Group, Gaosheng Group)
This marks a new chapter

525
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,000
for the hotel industry.

526
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,440
TY is securing a partnership
with Gaosheng

527
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,840
and taking in big capital...

528
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,000
They must be planning something big.

529
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,240
Boss,

530
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,520
you've been close
with Mr. Lin Jr. lately.

531
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,840
Any inside scoop?

532
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,760
Hello?

533
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,400
Alright.

534
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,720
Bring them up.

535
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,720
Boss, they're here.

536
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,044
Good morning.

537
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,800
Apologies, Mr. Xiao.

538
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Sorry for the wait.

539
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,560
No problem.

540
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,160
Have a seat.

541
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,920
Mr. Lin Jr., what's this about?

542
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,800
Haven't you figured it out yet?

543
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,280
Beisiman is just a front.

544
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,000
The real player interested in us is TY.

545
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,000
We're not strangers.

546
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:22,160
I'll get to the point.

547
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Out of respect for you,

548
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,920
I will increase my offer

549
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:29,111
by 20 percent on top
of the original deal.

550
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:30,666
The shares remain the same.

551
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,600
All conditions stay unchanged.

552
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,880
A 20 percent increase is substantial.

553
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,200
Mr. Xiao,

554
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,680
think it through.

555
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,400
There's one thing
I'm really curious about.

556
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,480
Spring Sea is just
an old hotel with a 20-year history.

557
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,280
Why are you so interested in it?

558
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:53,560
I have my business considerations.

559
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,320
We're new to the hotel industry.

560
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,680
Big brands won't bring us in.

561
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Small brands don't meet our standards.

562
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,480
A hotel like Spring Sea is well-known,

563
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,400
high-end, and cost-effective.

564
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
It is our ideal choice.

565
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,520
Besides, you need funding.

566
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,720
Wouldn't this be a win-win?

567
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,000
It could be...

568
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,680
I'm sure you saw

569
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,320
the morning news.

570
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,240
We've already partnered with Gaosheng.

571
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:25,955
You know what it means.

572
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm sure

573
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,600
you understand.

574
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,920
As long as you agree
to go public within three years,

575
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,520
we'll fully support you in every way.

576
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,400
Mr. Xiao,

577
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,080
are you

578
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,960
going to turn me down again?

579
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,880
Sorry.

580
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,120
I refuse.

581
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,480
Mr. Xiao,

582
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,480
if it's a matter of time,

583
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,160
we can...

584
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,080
Xiao Mucheng.

585
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,560
Are you going to reject

586
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,800
every offer I make?

587
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,640
I'm practically handing you free money.

588
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Anyone can see that.

589
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,560
Why turn it down?

590
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
A grudge against money?

591
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,680
Mr. Lin Jr.

592
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
Just like last time,

593
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,640
we're not meant to work together.

594
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,800
Xiao Mucheng.

595
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,320
You'd better think this through.

596
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,720
This opportunity

597
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,640
is your last one.

598
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,680
Miss it, and it's your loss,

599
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,560
not mine.

600
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,000
It's getting late.

601
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,880
Have you two eaten yet?

602
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,080
I hope you won't regret this.

603
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,880
Boss.

604
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
I just don't get it.

605
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,440
Why did you turn him down?

606
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,440
Gaosheng took over Bailun.

607
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,080
At this rate,

608
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,400
we might be next.

609
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,560
But we're running out of time too.

610
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,680
You know how the board is.

611
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,880
If we don't hit the targets on time,

612
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,200
even if we're not bought out,
we'll be replaced.

613
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,120
I'll handle it.

614
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:28,720
I'll figure something out.

615
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,360
Let's take a selfie!

616
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,160
Action.

617
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,370
No... No...

618
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,670
Hurry up over there.

619
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,260
Where is...?

620
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,800
Talking about you, my good friend.

621
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:06,481
