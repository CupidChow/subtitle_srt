Everything's fine.

9
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
I don't look that ugly.

10
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,000
I must be mistaken.

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm loyal, humorous,

12
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,000
and gentlemanly.

13
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm that nice.

14
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,400
This makes no sense at all.

Were you even listening to me?

16
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,360
You're so annoying.

17

You're a man,
yet you're this long-winded.

Listen.

Things will only make sense
to those who are equal to you.

20
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,290
Have you ever seen a lion
trying to reason with a sheep?

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,680
You think I don't resemble a lion?

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,600
At best, you resemble a hyena.

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,960
Hello.

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Ms. Ling, Spring Sea is in trouble.

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,280
I heard that the girl named Yi Ran

26
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,577
fed a kid some random food,
causing an allergic reaction.

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,088
The kid is in the hospital right now.

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Perfect timing.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Notify the press.

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Promote this news
on Spring Sea's behalf.

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,440
And,

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,600
find some figures

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,760
who talk about supernatural rumors.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,160
I have materials for them.

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
This time, I must turn the tides.

36
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,066
Yes, Ms. Ling.

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,840
What's wrong?

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,360
That friend of yours, Yi Ran,
is something else.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,160
She fed a kid some random food.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,840
Now, the kid is in the ER.

42
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,555
Why did you find the media, then?

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,880
Aren't you putting
Yi Ran right in the crosshairs?

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Don't worry.

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
At most, she'll only be fired.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
That's all.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,280
Besides,

48
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:17,444
you wanted her to leave
Spring Sea as well, right?

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,440
There's an opportunity
right in front of you now.

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,160
I do hope for her to leave.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
But not in this manner.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,680

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,000
I...

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,720
(ER)
Didn't I tell you already?

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,960
My daughter is in the ER.

56
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
Deal with the issues yourself!

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,760
How could you guys

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,400
feed a kid some random food?

59
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm truly sorry.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,120
This is truly our fault.

61
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,000
Doctor,

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,920
how's my daughter?

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,480
Look at parents like you all.

65
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,577
You knew that your daughter
was allergic to mango.

66
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:01,777
How could you let her eat it?

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,680
Although her life is out of danger,

68
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,933
she took something
that triggered her allergy reaction.

69
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:09,710
We need to observe her
for a little longer.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,560
Thank you.

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm truly sorry.

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,840
Why are you hiding here?

73
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,800
The incident has already occurred.

74
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,440
It's pointless to punish yourself.

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
But don't worry.

76
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
If you need any money...

77
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,400
There are many issues
that money cannot resolve.

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
If that kid is in danger
because of me...

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,880
I truly suck at everything.

80
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,600
Now, the hotel is implicated as well.

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm sure God of Plague hates me.

82
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:09,488
Are the opinions of Xiao Mucheng

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
that important

84
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,800

(Outpatient)

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Niu, are you awake?

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,240
How do you feel?

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
Do you feel unwell?

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,160
You scared me, you know?

90
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,200
Go back to work. Just ignore me.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,840
Look at you. What are you saying?

92
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,360
I'll pour you some water, okay?

93
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,960
Hello, Mrs. Yuan.

94
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
You guys are?

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
All of us are victims.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,200
We must uphold justice for us.

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,680
However...

98
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Don't worry.

99
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,440
Leave the rest to Mr. He.

=The Quirky and The Charming=

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,480
Mrs. Yuan,

102
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,760
now,

103
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,133
the culprit will contact you
in one way or another.

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,288
No matter if it's a phone call
or an appointment,

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,760
you must reject her.

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,800
Just leave the rest to me.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,240
Alright.

108
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,466
Ms. Ling, everything
has been arranged for.

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,720
Excellent.

110
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,933
Right now, there are two things
that are important

111
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,120
to Xiao Mucheng.

112
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,560
One is the hotel.

113
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,520
The other is Yi Ran.

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,480
I'll see how you can
defend her this time.

115
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,000
I've already notified

116
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
all of the employees.

117
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,160
Under no circumstances should

118
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,044
last night's emergency
be discussed anywhere.

119
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,120
Right now, we need to control
public sentiment.

120
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,760
We mustn't let any trouble occur again.

121
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,200
Alright.

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,360
This is bad.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,640
Rumors about the haunted hotel

124
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,800
are on the Hot Search now.

125
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:21,840
And, our Legal Department

126
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,533
received a lawyer's letter
from Mrs. Yuan.

127
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:26,000
Not only is she demanding
a compensation and an apology,

128
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:27,866
but she's also demanding
Yi Ran's sacking.

129
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,800
In my opinion, Yi Ran

130
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,200
has caused huge trouble for us.

131
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,688
We have to deal with her
and fire her immediately.

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,520
But speaking of which,

133
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,577
Yi Ran's good intentions
led to bad results.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,280
It seems inappropriate
to deal with her like this.

135
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,440
But if we don't fire her,

136
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
we can't give Mrs. Yuan an account.

137
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,480
Should we deal with her, then?

138
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:07,688
Why don't we put it aside for now?

139
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,800
Yi Ran is in huge trouble this time.

140
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,080
I think

141
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,800
Yi Ran is just unlucky.

142
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,240
How could she get into
trouble all the time?

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,440
I was finally taking a liking to her.

144
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,120
Don't tell me
she's going to leave again?

145
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,840
Touchwood.

146
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:36,866
It's definitely a blessing in disguise.

147
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:38,444
She can definitely overcome this trial.

148
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,920
I hope so.

149
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,400
She has always been the one
helping us out.

150
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,880
How can we help her out?

151
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,360
How about we write a joint petition?

152
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,400
That won't do.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,920
It won't work.

154
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,840
You're such a kid.
This won't help her out.

155
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,920
Boss,

156
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,440
this is Yi Ran's resignation letter.

157
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,640
She said she has
to bear responsibility for this.

158
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:12,320
But she's not brave enough
to hand it to you herself.

159
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,440
That's why she wanted me
to hand it to you.

160
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
This is our joint petition.

161
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,560
Yi Ran thought the kid was too pitiful.

162
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:23,155
That's why she bought a cake for her.

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,133
Who would've expected her
to be allergic to it?

164
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
Boss, please spare her.

165
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,533
The HR Department will issue
a notice soon.

166
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,440
Yi Ran will be suspended for now.

167
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:34,288
You guys should return to work.

168
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,360
But Boss...

169
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,880
We just received news from Spring Sea.

170
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,288
Yi Ran has been suspended from work.

171
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:55,920
I think she'll leave in a few more days.

172
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,466
(Notice of Termination of Labor Contract)

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,320
He still chose to protect the hotel.

174
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
Seems like Yi Ran
isn't that important to him.

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,440
If so, regarding Mr. He...

176
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,639
Of course we have to grab hold
of the opportunity.

177
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,911
This is a rare chance, you know?

178
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,480
Alright.

179
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,800
How's the child?

180
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,040
She's fine now.

181
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:37,511
She can be discharged by tomorrow.

182
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:38,844
This incident has impacted

183
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,600
the company negatively.

184
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,560
According to the rules,

185
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,640
Yi Ran should be fired.

186
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,960
Although she did wrong,

187
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,360
she did it out of kind intentions.

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,360
You actually care about
other people's feelings right now?

189
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,133
I didn't come here to find you

190
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,560
for you to mock me.

191
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
I hope that you can provide me
with a standard answer.

192
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Everyone has

193
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
a different standard answer.

194
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
It depends on whether you see the rules

195
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,200
or the guests' feelings
as your standard.

196
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,222
I need to give you a reminder.

197
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,880
Even children are our guests.

198
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,000
Here. Have a banana.

199
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,120
Why don't I peel an apple for you?

200
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
This child is...

201
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,520
Sorry for the interruption.

202
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,444
I bought something for your daughter.

203
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:40,755
I hope that you can accept it.

204
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,800
Haven't I made myself clear?

205
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,755
I said, contact my lawyer
if you need anything.

206
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:51,866
Don't you understand?

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Please be appeased for now.

208
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,360
I know you're very angry.

209
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:55,520
Let me show you something.

210
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,511
I'll leave after this.

211
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,480
Please take a look.

212
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,320
Why are you showing this to me?

213
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,111
Do you want me to thank you
for saving my daughter?

214
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,800
Don't forget,

215
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:18,000
my daughter was sent
to the hospital because of her.

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,088
My daughter is alive now.

217
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
Do you expect me to thank her for that?

218
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,960
That's not what I mean.

219
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,320
Hurry and leave.

220
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,022
If not, I'll call the security guards.

221
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:28,533
Take it with you.

222
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,840
Don't worry.

223
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll deal with everything.

224
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,320
I'll make sure
they won't bother you again.

225
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,440
Actually,

226
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,840
I was the one who wanted
to eat the mango cake.

227
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:57,840
What did you say?

228
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,400
The big sister saw that I was all alone.

229
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,880
That's why she took me to buy a cake.

230
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,840
I chose the mango cake myself.

231
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,680
You chose it yourself?

232
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,640
Look at you.

233
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,888
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused for everyone?

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,960
Didn't you know
that you were allergic to mango?

235
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,080
Do you know how busy I am?

236
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,555
You always cause trouble for me.

237
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
Miss.

238
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Why are you apologizing to me?

240
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,680
I should be the one apologizing to you.

241
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,920
Are you okay?

242
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,000
Do you feel unwell?

243
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
I shouldn't have let you
eat that cake.

244
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,080
You scared me, you know?

245
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,720
Luckily, you're fine now.

246
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm truly sorry.

247
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,320
I was wrong about you guys.

248
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,520
I never expected things

249
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
to turn out like this.

250
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,440
It's not your fault.

251
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
We're partly responsible
for the incident as well.

252
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,080
Can you tell me something?

253
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,360
Why did you eat that cake

254
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,520
when you knew
that you were allergic to it?

255
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
After Dad and Mom got a divorce,

256
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
she started becoming busy.

257
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,520
She often didn't come back at night.

258
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,844
I was afraid to stay at home by myself.

259
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,120
Your mother is working hard

260
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,280
so that you two can lead better lives.

261
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
You can tell your mother about it.

262
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,480
I've told her so many times.

263
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,280
She always said, "Next time."

264
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,960
I only wanted Mom to come back
and keep me company.

265
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,960
Miss, I'm sorry.

266
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,080
You were the only one

267
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,280
who cared for me all this while.

268
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
Other people ran away when they saw me.

269
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,200
I didn't expect to implicate you.

270
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,200
Stop crying.

271
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,280
Stop crying.

272
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,840
Look at what I've brought for you.

273
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,160
Dried pineapples.

274
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,240
Don't tell me you're allergic to it too?

275
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
No.

276
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,400
Mr. He.

277
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,400
Did you make them
announce an official apology

278
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,355
and fire Yi Ran?

279
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,000
Mrs. Yuan, please listen to me.

280
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:18,840
It's like this...

281
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,680
Since when did I tell you to do that?

282
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,720
You're a lawyer, you know?

283
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:24,577
How could you do something under my name

284
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,960
without my permission?

285
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,622
I was trying to protect your rights.

286
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,720
Enough. Stop it.

287
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,880
This is the end of our cooperation.

288
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,560
I'm truly sorry about this.

289
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,640
I never expected things

290
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,840
to turn out like this.

291
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:38,840
It's all my fault.

292
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,960
It's fine.

293
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:42,150
It's fine as long as
the misunderstanding is resolved.

294
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:43,560
Sorry about this.

295
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,600
I've received your resignation letter.

296
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,040
And,

297
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,266
Mrs. Yuan has given up
on pressing charges against you.

298
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,840
If you're willing to obey the rules,

299
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:19,911
I can return
the resignation letter to you.

300
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,240
Are you still willing to be my boss?

301
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,520
Yeah.

302
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,920
However,

303
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,600
you still need to pay the price.

304
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,822
I thought you said
everything was arranged for.

305
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,520
Why aren't Yi Ran
and Spring Sea in trouble, then?

306
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,000
Everything was arranged for back then.

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,511
The lawyer letter was also delivered.

308
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,440
But for some reason,

309
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,680
Mrs. Yuan suddenly changed her mind.

310
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,120
I don't want to hear that.

311
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:57,622
What's the current situation?

312
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,360
Mrs. Yuan

313
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,000
clarified the incident herself.

314
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:03,755
As for the rumors of the haunted hotel,

315
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,977
it has also been confirmed
to be a misunderstanding.

316
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:07,640
What should we do now?

317
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,880
We're out of moves.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,520
No.

319
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,640
We have one last move.

320
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,000
I have something to report.

321
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,920
A guest was sent to the hospital

322
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,600
because Yi Ran fed her something

323
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,840
that triggered an allergic reaction.

324
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,320
She has violated
the employee code of conduct.

325
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,350
But considering
the timely handling of the situation

326
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,222
and no serious negative impact
of the incident,

327
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,680
taking into account the opinions

328
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,080
of all employees
and the patients' families,

329
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,320
we've decided

330
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,422
to impose a penalty on Yi Ran

331
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,960
by deducting her monthly bonus.

332
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,120
I hope all departments
can take this as a warning.

333
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
There's one more thing.

334
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,360
Our sales performance for this month

335
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
has grown by 17%
compared to the same month last year.

336
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,680
That's the result of
all of your efforts.

337
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,840
Great job, everyone.

338
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,955
Your bonus for this month
will be doubled.

339
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,960
Boss!

340
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,680
Hello?

341
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,440
What did you say?

342
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Madam Qin is missing?

343
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,640
Madam Qin?

344
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,280
Madam Qin?

345
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,200
Madam Qin?

346
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Madam Qin!

347
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,840
Excuse me.

348
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,044
I have something to ask you.

349
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,120
Have you guys seen this old lady around?

350
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:55,960
No.

351
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,160
No. Sorry about that.

352
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:57,840
Thank you.

353
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,560
It's fine.

354
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
(Beijing Dumpling King)

355
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
Mister, was my grandmother here?

356
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,844
She just left
after buying some dumplings.

357
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,640
The old lady is recovering well.

358
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,800
How long has she left?

359
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,600
Not long ago.

360
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,720
Just a few minutes ago.

361
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,520
Thank you.

362
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,520
Madam Qin?

363
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,760
Madam Qin?

364
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,960
Madam Qin?

365
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,560
Madam Qin!

366
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,720
Girl,

367
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,560
have you seen Ran around?

368
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,680
No. I don't know her.

369
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,400
Ran?

370
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,000
Ran?

371
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,360
Miss,

372
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,720
have you seen Ran around?

373
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,120
It's almost Chinese New Year.

374
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,680
She has to have dumplings.

375
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,680
If not, she'll be upset.

376
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,240
Grandma.

377
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm Ran.

378
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,960
You're not Ran.

379
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,280
She never calls me Grandma
in front of me.

380
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,160
Listen.

381
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,080
We're half-relatives.

382
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Ran?

383
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,280
Ran?

384
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,600
Ran.

385
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,320
Ran?

386
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,520
Ran!

387
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,560
Grandma, I'm Ran!

388
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,320
You're not Ran.

389
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
I am.

390
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,600
- Ran?
- Grandma, I'm Ran.

391
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,680
- Ran?
- Grandma, I'm Ran.

392
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,640
Grandma, look at me.

393
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,280
- You're not Ran.
- I am!

394
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
- Grandma, I'm Ran!
- Ran?

395
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,840
Let me go.

396
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,320
Ran?

397
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,000
- Ran?
- Grandma, I'm Ran.

398
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,880
Look at me!

399
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,400
I'm Ran.

400
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,480
Look at me.

401
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,800
You're not Ran.

402
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,720
She never calls me Grandma.

403
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,560
She never.

404
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,200
She never calls me Grandma.

405
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Ran?

406
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,400
Grandma!

407
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,320
Ran!

408
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,520
Where's Ran?

409
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,720
- Where is she?
- Grandma!

410
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,080
Ran?

411
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,120
Grandma.

412
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,760
Don't worry. She's fine.

413
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
The nurse on duty
went out to grab a food order.

414
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,333
The old lady used the chance to escape.

415
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:20,400
We were negligent.

416
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,520
Please, take good care of her.

417
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,160
Please keep a close eye on her.

418
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm truly sorry.

419
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,400
I promise

420
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,640
that this won't happen again.

421
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,240
Sorry for the trouble.

422
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,640
The old lady instructed us

423
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,960
to give this to you after she came back.

424
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,880
She said she bought these
celery dumplings for you.

425
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,440
Sorry for the trouble today.

426
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:07,240
Bottoms up. You can take your time.

427
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,840
It's cold.

428
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:32,440
Why don't you order something else?

429
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,320
My treat.

430
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,000
It's fine.

431
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,920
I like them cold.

432
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
When my father was still around,

433
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,200
during Chinese New Year,

434
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,880
he would prepare everything,

435
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,240
knead the dough,

436
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:57,400
prepare the filings,

437
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:58,577
and wrap the dumplings.

438
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,120
He would only eat
after everyone else was done eating.

439
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,840
When I asked him,

440
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,280
he said he liked them cold.

441
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
In the year my father passed away,

442
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:15,222
it was Chinese New Year's Eve.

443
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,640
Grandma was ill by then.

444
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,320
I was still young.

445
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,800
No one at home could cook.

446
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,280
All the restaurants were closed as well.

447
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,240
The two of us

448
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,080
would hug each other
and cry out of starvation.

449
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,840
At that moment,

450
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,000
my only wish

451
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,160
was for her to recover
as quickly as possible.

452
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,000
I didn't want to lose
any of my family members again.

453
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,640
But she couldn't forget about

454
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,866
the incident during Chinese New Year.

455
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,360
She didn't make dumplings for me
during Chinese New Year.

456
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Sometimes,

457
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,800
I suspect that she was tricking me.

458
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,520
I suspect
that she doesn't have dementia.

459
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,720
If not,

460
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,360
how could she remember that one meal

461
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,720
she forgot to prepare for me?

462
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,880
In the past,

463
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,640
you rarely talked about
your grandmother.

464
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,520
When we were running an inn,

465
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,560
she was our regular customer.

466
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
My dad saw

467
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,240
that she had no children.

468
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,400
He allowed her to live with us.

469
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,280
Gradually,

470
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
we became a family.

471
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Since my father's passing,

472
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,520
I've been living together with her.

473
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
To put it in her words,

474
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,320
"We're half-relatives."

475
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
She was truly nice to me.

476
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Yi Ran.

477
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,160
Good girl.

478
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,560
Stop crying.

479
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,560
Stop crying.

480
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,400
Don't be scared.

481
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
I'm here for you.

482
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,560
You can live with me in the future.

483
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,120
If she does snap out of it one day,

484
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,000
I assume she'll have
the same thoughts as me.

485
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,840
She'll surely wonder

486
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,960
who to contact

487
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,120
if anything happens to me.

488
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,600
Without her,

489
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,320
there's no way
I could make it until now.

490
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,200
Dad.

491
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Where's Mom?

492
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,320
Your mother isn't coming back.
Let's go home.

493
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,320
I want Mom!

494
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,080
I want Mom!

495
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,280
I want Mom!

496
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,040
You're a man. You cannot cry.

497
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,160
I want Mom!

498
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,800
I want Mom!

499
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,480
Ever since my father's passing,

500
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,840
I always felt like
my tummy was never filled.

501
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,960
I get hungry easily.

502
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,444
It's due to a sense of scarcity.

503
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,520
It's a normal part of life.

504
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,800
We'll only be content when we're loved.

505
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,560
Loved, huh?

506
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,120
To me,

507
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
that's an extravagant term.

508
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,480
My only choice is to love myself more.

509
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,960
Having food is the simplest way

510
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,000
of expressing love to myself.

511
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Let me tell you a secret.

512
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It tastes better if you use your hands.

513
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:27,120
Have you washed your hands?

514
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,200
A little dirt won't hurt.

515
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm returning the favor

516
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,400
and applying the things I've learned.

517
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,680
Morning.

518
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,200
Morning.

519
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Why was I sleeping in that room?

520
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,280
Great.

521
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,160
I always black out at critical moments.

522
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,720
Go and tell her.

523
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,120
No way. How can I do it?

524
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,600
Why aren't you telling her yourself?

525
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,120
Why should I?

526
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,640
- Of course it's you.
- Why me?

527
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,160
Lu, you go.

528
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,840
Why me?

529
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,280
There's no way I can tell her.

530
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,080
Will the three of you come in turns?

531
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:49,520
Or will you guys come at once?

532
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,680
Say,

533
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,200
what's your relationship
with Vincent?

534
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,466
He's my superior,
and I'm his subordinate.

535
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:04,622
That answer is too official.

536
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,680
Something's off.

537
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,880
What's wrong?

538
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,280
Are you two...

539
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,040
No.

540
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,800
You're denying it
before I finish my words.

541
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,133
Seems like it's serious.

542
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:14,133
What exactly are you guys
trying to ask here?

543
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,977
Don't you remember
what happened last night?

544
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,040
Let me give you a reminder.

545
00:33:17,044 --> 00:33:18,044
Last night...

546
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,120
Last night? What happened?

547
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,480
You were drunk last night.

548
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,560
Boss sent you back.

549
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,480
You two spent the night...

550
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,120
In the guest room together.

551
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,520
You guys saw that?

552
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,520
Don't worry. We'll keep this a secret.

553
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,880
You guys saw it, huh?

554
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:40,080
Did he do something to me?

555
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,320
Did he...

556
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,560
He didn't do anything to you.

557
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,520
You should ask yourself
what you've done to him.

558
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,320
Last night,

559
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,920
you tormented him

560
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,440
for as long as you two were together.

561
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,680
I...

562
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,560
Be careful.

563
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,080
Welcome to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

564
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:13,200
I'm Yi Ran from Housekeeping Department.

565
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,240
I'm glad to serve you.

566
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,000
Do you need any help?

567
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,040
I don't need any help.

568
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,400
Be careful.

569
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,760
What are you doing?

570
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,800
Don't touch me.

571
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,280
Ran, are you drunk?

572
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,240
Yi Ran?

573
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,400
This is a five-star hotel.

574
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,800
Be careful.

575
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,520
Be careful.

576
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,280
Ran, I'll take you to your room.

577
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,800
This is where I live.

578
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
Where are you taking me?

579
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,520
Lu,

580
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
I'll leave Yi Ran to you.

581
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,840
Okay, Boss.

582
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,160
- Ran.
- Mr. Xiao Mucheng.

583
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,400
As the guest of this room,

584
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,120
I hope you can provide me

585
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,520
with a turndown service personally.

586
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,360
Ms. Yi Ran,

587
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,160
I don't know what's a turndown service.

588
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,560
Boss.

589
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,520
A turndown service, huh?

590
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,520
A turndown service

591
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,200
is a service we provide...

592
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,040
Shut up.

593
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,120
Don't leave.

594
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,720
What happened after that?

595
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,410
Action!

596
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,210
Madam Qin!

597
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,050
Ran!

598
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,400
Just beat me up!

599
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,070
Let's go through it one last time.

600
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,660
Come on, get ready.

601
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,230
Action.

602
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,690
I'm sorry...

603
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,400
