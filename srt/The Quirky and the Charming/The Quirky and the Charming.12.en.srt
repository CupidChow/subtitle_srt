=Episode 12=

3
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,640
Let me hug you.

4
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,160
Just for a while is enough.

5
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,120
Miss Bei, please.

6
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,920
Please let me go.

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,760
Miss Bei, please stop hugging me.

8
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,440
- Miss Bei, please let go.
- Let him go!

9
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,000
Yi Ran.

10
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,360
Miss Bei, my apologies.

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,800
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,160
Sorry about that.

13
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,120
I didn't mean to be rude.

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,760
It's because he looks

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
so much like a friend of mine.

16
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,933
No matter how similar it looks,

17
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,066
you can't just touch him...

18
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,569
Yi Ran.

19
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,022
- Good thing I'm here.
- Yi Ran.

20
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,640
That's enough.

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,880
Miss Bei, I'm truly sorry

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,355
for causing you such an inconvenience.

23
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:02,466
Then we won't be taking
your time anymore.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Go.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,680
Go.

26
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,640
Go.

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,200
Come on.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,560
Go.

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,880
Move it.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Just walk.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,400
Come on.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,240
My apologies.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
You sure are generous, huh?

34
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:29,000
You kicked her earlier.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,640
You're lucky
she's not making a complaint.

36
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:31,800
What? Should I kick her out

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,222
or call the police to arrest her?

38
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,120
You are affectionate
to every woman you meet.

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,840
Scumbag.

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
So, are you done with the videos?

41
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,177
Is that the only comeback you've got?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,720
What did you say?

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,080
Yes, Boss.

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
I will get back to work.

45
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:49,200
You don't need to worry
about the Housekeeping Department.

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,520
Send the videos to Ms. Hua tomorrow.

47
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,080
Watch the expression of my eyes.

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,960
Pass this to Ms. Hua for me.

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,520
Ran.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,040
How did you manage
to watch all of the videos?

51
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,920
How?

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,480
I stayed up all night.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,760
That's unbelievable, Ran.

54
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
I cannot lose.

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
You look sleepy.

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,400
You should get some sleep.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,550
I'll send it over to her now.

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,120
It's finally over.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,320
Hello?

60
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,120
Yi Ran.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,240
There's a document
that needs Boss's approval.

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,577
But he can't come over right now.

63
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:43,977
So I need you to drop by to get it.

64
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,533
How about you get an instant delivery

65
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,280
or someone else to deliver it?

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,960
I haven't slept all night.

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,400
No, the document is too important.

68
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,711
Boss specifically asked you
to go in person.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,288
I'll forward the address to you now.

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,280
Please help out.

71
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,080
He is such a pain.

72
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:06,311
Is Yi Ran the right person to go?

73
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,080
Trust me.

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,120
For the sake of our safety,

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
this is the best solution.

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
What kind of document is this?

77
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,320
It's a very important document.

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,644
After you deliver this to Boss,

79
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,088
bring it back after he signed it.

80
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,760
Well, you don't have to rush back
after he signed it.

81
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Don't say that to her.

82
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,040
Why are you here?

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,160
Please sign your document.

84
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:32,244
What document is this?

85
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,720
How would I know?

86
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:37,444
Didn't you specifically ask me
to bring it over in person?

87
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:38,733
Chen Mo said it's important.

88
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,480
How about I leave first?

89
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,160
Come inside.

90
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,859
I'll take care of some work.

91
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,720
Help yourselves
with some drinks in the fridge.

92
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,000
Where's the bed?

93
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,820
(The End of Alzheimer's)

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,133
Something smells delicious.

95
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,040
Did I sleep that long?

96
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:27,711
Oh, you're awake.

97
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,660
=The Quirky and The Charming=

98
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,480
I accidentally dozed off just now.

99
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
So I'll get going now.

100
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:42,160
Oh, the document...

101
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:43,200
I made a lot of dishes,

102
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
and I couldn't finish them by myself.

103
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,622
How about you join me?

104
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,560
You've been working hard these few days.

105
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
You can consider this meal
as a reward for it.

106
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
Then I'll dig in.

107
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
I was starving.

108
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,640
Your Sweet and Sour Pork Fillet
is amazing.

109
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,210
Even up to par with my father's cooking.

110
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,266
How about you have some too?

111
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
In your room, I saw some books

112
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,320
about Alzheimer's disease.

113
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you usually read about it?

114
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:38,990
I was reading about it casually.

115
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,440
Eat more.

116
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Why? Are you planning
to take that rice home?

117
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,520
About that incident in the elevator...

118
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,533
I've forgotten about it.

119
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,400
Forgot about it?

120
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:20,320
But how can you forget about it?

121
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,640
Wasn't it you who said

122
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:23,866
to treat it like being bitten by a dog

123
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,240
and pretend it never happened?

124
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,680
That was before I knew we...

125
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,800
Knew what?

126
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,200
Nothing.

127
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:35,777
Just eat your food.

128
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
I like you.

129
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:53,466
Did I hear that right?

130
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,960
No, you didn't.

131
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
I like you.

132
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,280
I have a pretty thick face.

133
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,640
So I don't mind if you reject me.

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,760
Why would I reject you?

135
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,720
Didn't I

136
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
also prove it to you?

137
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,022
There's a grain of rice

138
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,160
on your lips.

139
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,920
Stay still.

140
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,777
Then I'll submit the documents
I have to headquarters first.

141
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,360
Having one more option doesn't hurt.

142
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,600
If Bright Platinum accepts our terms,

143
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
don't give her everything at once.

144
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,333
At the same time,
station the expert team here

145
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,840
for comprehensive coaching.

146
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:54,080
What if she rejects it?

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,560
That means the time is not right.

148
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:57,920
One more thing.

149
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,390
We need to hurry up
with the Spring Sea matter.

150
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,822
You know that Lin Sr.
is putting pressure on it every day.

151
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:04,222
We can't delay it anymore.

152
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,280
Okay.

153
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:09,600
Ms. Ling, you sure can hold your drinks.

154
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,000
I guess having a heroine like you

155
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,520
is like striking gold.

156
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,360
Mr. Song, we already had a drink.

157
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,040
So about the contract...

158
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,840
Whether this contract gets signed or not

159
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,880
depends entirely on your sincerity.

160
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm showing my full sincerity here.

161
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,400
I'll finish this drink.

162
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,560
Ms. Ling,
you can't just drink with Mr. Song.

163
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,400
If you don't drink this with me,

164
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,120
that would really not give me any face.

165
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:37,600
No matter who I refuse,

166
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,480
I can't refuse you, right?

167
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,400
Everyone here is Bright Platinum's
bread and butter.

168
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
I'll toast everyone again.

169
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,320
Good!

170
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,800
Refill Ms. Ling's glass.

171
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,560
Okay.

172
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:49,955
Excuse me for a moment.

173
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,080
I need to use the restroom.

174
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
Okay, go ahead.

175
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,000
If she can't drink, then don't drink.

176
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,444
Why is she trying to act tough?

177
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
A career woman, huh?

178
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Isn't it us men giving her a way
to survive in the end?

179
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,560
Exactly.

180
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,000
The market competition
is so fierce nowadays.

181
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,800
If she wants to secure the contract,
she has to sacrifice something.

182
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,280
We didn't order these.

183
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,100
Did you send these to the wrong table?

184
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,040
Wrong table, right?

185
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,080
I ordered it.

186
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:34,360
Mr. Lin Jr., what are you doing here?

187
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:35,355
Please take a seat.

188
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,044
Waitress,
bring another set of tableware.

189
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,088
No need for tableware.

190
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,977
Aren't you guys so fond of drinking?

191
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,760
Come, I'll drink with you.

192
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,240
One bottle each.

193
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,200
Why are you here?

194
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,320
Where are they?

195
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,488
I've sent them away.

196
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:37,600
If you're not drinking,
then why are you here?

197
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,520
Who's going to take you home
if you're drunk?

198
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,520
Excuse me, could I have some rock sugar?

199
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,680
Thanks.

200
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,360
Margarita

201
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,320
won't help you.

202
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,000
It'll only make your heart more bitter.

203
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,000
Add another one.

204
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,280
You're so good at everything.

205
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,480
But why can't you win over Yi Ran?

206
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,000
We're both just as bad.

207
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,320
And you're laughing at me?

208
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,520
I really want to ask you this.

209
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,133
What exactly do you like
about Xiao Mucheng?

210
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,080
No comment.

211
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,800
As expected,

212
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,622
he has no special qualities

213
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:35,480
in your heart either.

214
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,480
Listen here.

215
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,080
He's the best out of all the men I know.

216
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,520
I have no reason not to like him.

217
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
He should rightfully be mine.

218
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,280
That's the reason you like him?

219
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,480
Do you even understand
what it means to like someone?

220
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,440
Do you?

221
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,360
Liking someone means
that just seeing them

222
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
makes you happy.

223
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,760
But they can also drive you crazy
in an instant.

224
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:09,360
You want to get close.

225
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:12,288
Yet you don't dare to take
that step forward.

226
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,600
When she smiles,

227
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,760
you smile with her.

228
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,800
When she cries,

229
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,400
you feel like crying too.

230
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,240
Every angle, every habit,

231
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,320
tugs at your heart.

232
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,440
Most importantly,

233
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:30,240
no matter how much time passes,

234
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,680
that feeling

235
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,680
still makes your heart race.

236
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,760
People who usually fail
in action are the ones

237
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,360
who ace the theory.

238
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,200
However,

239
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,960
if you really want to know

240
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,360
whether you like someone or not,

241
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,240
there's a simple way.

242
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
What way?

243
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,280
When you are close to them,

244
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,800
and your heart starts racing,

245
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
that means you like them.

246
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,680
(Why is my heart racing?)

247
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,560
Waiter, another glass, please.

248
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:27,888
All right, coming right up.

249
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,400
We're almost there.

250
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,160
We're here.

251
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,440
We're here.

252
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,760
Watch your head.

253
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,880
What?

254
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,000
Ouch.

255
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,040
Don't you like me one bit at all?

256
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,320
I do. I do.

257
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,520
You're hurting me.

258
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,480
Let me go.

259
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,560
Should we get a bed?

260
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,440
Sure.

261
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,440
Hello, Ms. Ling.

262
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,160
Are you okay?

263
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,360
Send me to Room 1088.

264
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,560
We're almost there.

265
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,160
Where is it?

266
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,440
Who is it?

267
00:22:51,177 --> 00:22:51,955
Good morning.

268
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,080
Morning.

269
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,680
What's this?

270
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,560
Breakfast for you.

271
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,120
I didn't order this.

272
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,040
Boss ordered it early this morning.

273
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,880
Just leave it here.

274
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,977
I'll do it myself.

275
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,520
So

276
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,000
did the document yesterday

277
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,400
get to the right person?

278
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,680
Don't worry.

279
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:17,640
I understand.

280
00:24:45,822 --> 00:24:47,360
You both look pretty good today.

281
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,288
Good morning, Boss.

282
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,780
(Bad review!)

283
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:31,020
(Beauty serum)

284
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,680
Why are you in my house?

285
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,666
- Why are you wearing my bathrobe?
- Wait...

286
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,911
Do you want me to be naked?

287
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,600
Stop staring. It's just me here.

288
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,960
Don't give me special treatment anymore.

289
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,520
The employee handbook forbids
office romance.

290
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,320
I am the handbook.

291
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
Ran, the bed sheets in Room 5013...

292
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,360
See this spot?

293
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,920
You didn't lay them out properly.

294
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,560
If you do this again,

295
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,640
I'll deduct your pay.

296
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,960
Yes, Boss.

297
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,822
Make sure she gets it right.

298
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:12,000
- Yes, Boss.
- Have a nice day.

299
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,320
It's okay. He's always this annoying.

300
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
You'll get used to it.

301
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,720
It won't come off!

302
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,720
I guarantee

303
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
that you're dead meat today.

304
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,920
But it looks kind of cute.

305
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,800
A gentleman uses words, not hitting.

306
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
Ah, not hitting.

307
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,280
Yes, not hitting.

308
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,280
So I'll...

309
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,480
Eat.

310
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,520
I won't hit you. So eat.

311
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,240
Eat.

312
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,080
Okay, I'll eat.

313
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,320
That's a good boy. Eat more.

314
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,440
Uh...

315
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:44,760
About last night...

316
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:46,460
Don't you remember anything?

317
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:47,320
Of course, I don't.

318
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,120
Then I'll tell you what happened.

319
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,920
No need.

320
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,320
Some things are better cleared up.

321
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,080
Then think carefully before you speak.

322
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,400
Forget it. I'll just keep it to myself.

323
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,800
Say it.

324
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,160
What is it?

325
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,480
Really? When did you come back?

326
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,720
Okay.

327
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,480
What's the matter?

328
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,720
My trump card is back.

329
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,240
Chairman Xiao,

330
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:41,360
you came back
without telling us in advance?

331
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,133
The average daily rental rate

332
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,480
increased by 15%.

333
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,000
The OCC increased

334
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,520
from 50% to 80%.

335
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Overall, there's progress.

336
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,440
But do you think

337
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,480
this alone is enough
to save Spring Sea?

338
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
I said everything
I needed to say last time.

339
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,080
So

340
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,800
you're not planning to go back?

341
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,960
I will protect this hotel,

342
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,680
and I hope you will keep your promise.

343
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,400
Ah, youth.

344
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,080
So naive that it's almost enviable.

345
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,440
Of course, being young is great.

346
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,240
If it weren't for your youth,

347
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,888
you and my mom
wouldn't have founded Spring Sea, right?

348
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,760
Chairman Xiao,

349
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,400
if there's nothing else,

350
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,560
I'll get back to work.

351
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
Ms. Ling is here.

352
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,920
Let her in.

353
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,840
Mr. Xiao.

354
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,960
Yishu.

355
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,840
It's been ages.

356
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,120
I missed you so much.

357
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,920
It's been a while.

358
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,040
You look so pretty now.

359
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,520
You've grown so tall.

360
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,240
How's your father?

361
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,000
He's good.

362
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,640
He drags my mom out fishing every day.

363
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,080
He always talks about you,

364
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,920
telling me I should learn from you.

365
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
All right, everyone's here.

366
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,640
How about a meal?

367
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,840
Chairman Xiao,

368
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
I have a meeting.

369
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,760
Cancel it.

370
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,000
What meeting

371
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,480
is more important than this lunch?

372
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:09,480
Come on, sweetie.

373
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,480
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

374
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,640
Let's go.

375
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,555
Mr. Xiao, let's go.

376
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,280
Mr. Xiao,

377
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,000
how about extending your stay this time?

378
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,640
If you're free, I can show you around.

379
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,400
Sure.

380
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
Sweetie, eat more.

381
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,160
I remember these are all your favorites.

382
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,600
After so many years,

383
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,280
I can't believe you still remember.

384
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,400
We're going to be family soon.

385
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,640
No need to be so polite.

386
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,720
Come on, Mr. Xiao.

387
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,800
Sweetie,

388
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,760
your father and I are not young anymore.

389
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,920
One day, all this will be yours.

390
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,000
Is the food not to your liking?

391
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:47,640
Do you want me to order something else?

392
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,760
No need.

393
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,040
I don't matter anyway.

394
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,733
As long as both of you are happy.

395
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,240
Are you not satisfied
with my arrangements?

396
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,760
Do I have a choice?

397
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,680
You can eat whatever you want.

398
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,080
But only I decide
what dishes are served.

399
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,000
I have someone I like.

400
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,120
I don't care.

401
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
You only need to remember

402
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,480
that the only person I, Xiao Bohan,

403
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,840
acknowledge is Ling Yishu.

404
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:18,466
Take care of your personal matters.

405
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,200
You've decided everything

406
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,400
since I was a kid.

407
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,000
I never went against you once.

408
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,920
But don't decide this for me.

409
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,920
I'm leaving now.

410
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,960
Excuse me.

411
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,320
Vincent.

412
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,040
Mr. Xiao, I'll go and check on him.

413
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,080
Stop right there.

414
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,240
Can't you be a little patient with me?

415
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:53,920
You know

416
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,640
your father always hopes that we...

417
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,640
Yishu,

418
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
I already said the same thing years ago.

419
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:00,680
Do you want me to say it again?

420
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,320
Then I'll say this again.

421
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,320
I don't care if you like me or not.

422
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:06,680
It's fine as long as I like you.

423
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,160
The more you dislike me,

424
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,577
the more I want you to like me.

425
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:10,155
Yishu,

426
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,640
do you even know
what it means to like someone?

427
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,440
(When you are close to them,)

428
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
and your heart starts racing,

429
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:18,960
that means you like them.

430
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,844
What are you doing?

431
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,040
(Why don't I feel my heart racing?)

432
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,577
Hey, you're crossing the line.

433
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,240
I need to confirm something.

434
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,560
No, stop.

435
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,600
Hey, listen to me.

436
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,400
What are you doing? Don't push it!

437
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,000
Yishu!

438
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,880
What's this?

439
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
A rag?

440
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,680
This is a hotel,

441
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,080
not your private dating spot.

442
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:51,333
Yi Ran, don't get this wrong.

443
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,120
Am I?

444
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,560
I saw it very clearly.

445
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,520
Everyone here is an adult.

446
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,800
Be mindful of your conduct.

447
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,080
Yi Ran.

448
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,160
Yi Ran, let me explain.

449
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,000
Yi...

450
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:01,280
Don't go after her.

451
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:02,955
You know what your father is like.

452
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
You and her won't work out.

453
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,520
That's my business.

454
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,760
Yishu, I've always seen you as a friend.

455
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,520
You deserve a better relationship.

456
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,040
Stop wasting your time.

457
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,680
How's your appetite these past few days?

458
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,080
It's been great.

459
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,400
Your dad brought me food yesterday,

460
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,000
and I ate two big bowls.

461
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,360
What did he bring you?

462
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,920
He brought me...

463
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,840
He brought...

464
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,200
What was it again?

465
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,560
Why can't I remember?

466
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,440
He brought...

467
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,880
It's okay if you don't remember.

468
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,040
If you ask me what I ate yesterday,

469
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:09,240
I wouldn't remember either.

470
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,000
It's okay. I have my little notebook.

471
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,880
I wrote it down in my little notebook.

472
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,120
Ah, yes. My little notebook.

473
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,960
It's under my pillow.

474
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,080
Look.

475
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,560
I'm going to learn an eight-beat dance

476
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,000
from Mr. Sun today.

477
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,960
I made an appointment with him.

478
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,160
I have to go now.

479
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,480
Wait here for me.

480
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,960
You already learned it just now.

481
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,280
I did?

482
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:41,880
Really?

483
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,960
Do you have a thing for Mr. Sun?

484
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,920
Don't be ridiculous.

485
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
He told me

486
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,920
dancing is good for my health.

487
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,120
I have to keep my body

488
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,680
strong.

489
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,800
Only then can I be at peace,

490
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,000
knowing you find a good husband.

491
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,960
If your mom

492
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,680
could take you off my hands,
that would be great too.

493
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,920
Why are you suddenly bringing her up?

494
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,240
It's been over ten years.

495
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,800
Don't you miss her?

496
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,640
No, I don't.

497
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,280
About your dad and mom's divorce,

498
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
not everything

499
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,160
was your mom's fault.

500
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,440
If you're not eating that apple,
I'll take it.

501
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,240
Don't, I'll eat them.

502
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,960
I'll eat.

503
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,600
Here.

504
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,200
Have a piece first.

505
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,440
Eat one.

506
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,080
No.

507
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,720
If you don't eat, I won't eat it too.

508
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,400
Eat one.

509
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,640
You heard about Gaosheng
acquiring Bailun, right?

510
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,280
I had heard

511
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,520
KR and Heisen were making full

512
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,520
or partial acquisition offers
for Bailun Hotel.

513
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:15,000
But I didn't expect Gaosheng to come out
as the biggest winner in the end.

514
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,080
They were well-prepared

515
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,400
to enter the hotel industry.

516
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,600
China is a huge market.

517
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,666
There's no way
they wouldn't want a share of it.

518
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,840
Survival in the industry is tough.

519
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,440
Yes.

520
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,800
What are you doing?

521
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,120
My apologies, sir.

522
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,160
Our hotel is a non-smoking zone.

523
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:42,488
Cigars aren't allowed either.

524
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,040
If you insist on smoking,

525
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,300
please move
to the designated outdoor smoking area.

526
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,555
Which department are you from?

527
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,644
Do you know who he...

528
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,040
I don't care who you are

529
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,640
or what privileges you have.

530
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,311
Those are not exceptions to the rules.

531
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,160
Besides, you're not young anymore.

532
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,680
Smoking is bad for your health

533
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,720
and it affects other guests too.

534
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,680
It's not your place to lecture me.

535
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,560
I never wanted to do this either.

536
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,280
Even a three-year-old knows
this common sense.

537
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,360
I'm sure you do too, old sir.

538
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,040
You...

539
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,200
Who are you calling "old sir"!

540
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,880
Calm down. I'll handle this.

541
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:14,400
Don't waste time with her.

542
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,533
Get her direct supervisor.

543
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,000
That'll be even more troublesome.

544
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,320
Our director is very strict about rules.

545
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,920
The law clearly states

546
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,240
that those smoking
in public places will be fined.

547
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,244
The director told us
to enforce this strictly.

548
00:37:25,288 --> 00:37:26,644
You're lucky you met me today.

549
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:27,840
I just saved you 2,000 yuan.

550
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,440
Yi Ran.

551
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,480
So this is Yi Ran?

552
00:37:33,844 --> 00:37:35,680
This old sir was smoking
in a public area,

553
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:36,844
and I asked him to stop.

554
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,880
All right, I'll take care of it.

555
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:43,066
Sorry for the trouble.

556
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:49,488
Chairman Xiao,

557
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:52,022
Yi Ran didn't recognize you
because she's new here.

558
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:53,355
I apologize on her behalf.

559
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,080
No need.

560
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:56,840
I don't want to hear another word

561
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,880
about this ridiculous girl.

562
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,880
Fire her immediately.

563
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,520
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

564
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,800
Or you can fire me too.

565
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,640
You...

566
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,240
You're a dead meat today!

567
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,480
Their shapes are different.

568
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,320
Is it OK?

569
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,150
Where is the room?

570
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,780
Action.

571
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,520
I didn't order breakfast.

572
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,710
Don't worry.

573
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,500
Avoid it first.

574
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,420
Try avoiding.

575
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,570
Action.

576
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:44,521
