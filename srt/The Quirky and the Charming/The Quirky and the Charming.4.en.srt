00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,360
Do I have time to do what

4
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,280
with you...?

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,400
Date.

6
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,280
Why?

7
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,640
According to F&B Department,

8
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,120
the number of participants
for Qixi Festival event is too low,

9
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,355
so they're encouraging internal staff
to participate.

10
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,555
Can you stop being so dramatic
when you speak?

11
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,933
Do you think I sold myself to you?

12
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,380
Like I'd participate in every event.

13
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,080
Fine.

14
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,800
If you're not interested, forget it.

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,800
By the way,

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,760
a guest complained

17
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,311
that you occupied the elevator
and disrupted her travel.

18
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,360
Complained about me?

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,079
I should be the one
complaining about her.

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
Seriously, there are all kinds of people

21
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:14,533
in this world...

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,120
Including you.

23
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,600
Are you trying to start a fight?

24
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
This is a hotel.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,200
Of course, it has all kinds of guests.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,200
As guests,

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
they're entitled to proper service.

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,280
Cui is also an employee of the hotel.

29
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,622
Guests should have priority.

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,220
I think people should be understanding

31
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:32,760
and respectful toward each other.

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,000
Besides,

33
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,280
Cui is already getting old.

34
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,400
I was just helping him out.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,679
Why are you siding with outsiders?

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,800
There are no outsiders here.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,720
Only guests

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,266
and those providing services to them.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
Well, I'm a VIP.

40
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,555
Please mind your words and behavior

41
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:46,080
so we can continue to work together.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,240
Respect my opinion?

43
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:50,480
You just want me
to say good things about the hotel.

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,640
Are you really trying
to solve the hotel's problems?

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,360
Just putting on a show.
You're so fake!

46
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:57,080
That's exactly why I brought you here.

47
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,909
If you have any issues,
you can bring them up.

48
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,790
I'll leave a bad review
for the hotel right now.

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,650
If you're not happy about it,
just kick me out.

50
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:03,040
You...

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,220
=The Quirky and The Charming=

52
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:27,533
(Are you really trying
to solve the hotel's problems?)

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,000
Just putting on a show.

54
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:33,244
You're so fake!

55
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,800
Fake!

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,140
(Xiao Mucheng)

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,040
Yes?

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,760
Were you sleeping?

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
I was about to win five million.

60
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:29,720
Pay me back my money.

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,960
I reviewed

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
the test-stay report you submitted.

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,240
I think some things

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
would be clearer

65
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,355
if we communicated directly.

66
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,155
You mentioned adding some
entertainment facilities to the room.

67
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,088
What exactly should be added?

68
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,560
Just throw in some poker cards

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,560
or puzzles.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
If it isn't urgent,

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,240
can you let me "work" in peace?

72
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,360
Forget about work.

73
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:53,160
Just go to sleep.

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,920
Is he really going to kick me out?

75
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
These are the files
for Spring Sea and Bright Platinum.

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,840
Take a look.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,620
(Bright Platinum Hotel)

78
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,780
(Company Executive Profile, Ling Yishu,
Director, CEO, General Manager)

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,560
Mr. Liu.

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
What are your thoughts?

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,480
Bright Platinum

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,840
is relatively new
in terms of environment

83
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,000
and facilities.

84
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,000
It also has a solid foundation

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
of cooperation with our company.

86
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,600
But the price

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,880
isn't competitive.

88
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,200
Spring Sea

89
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,240
has been around for a while.

90
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
But recently,

91
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,360
they've introduced
some interesting projects.

92
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,400
If you make me choose...

93
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:55,822
If it's that hard to choose,

94
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,580
then let's not pick either for now.

95
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,920
We're not in a rush anyway.

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,440
What do you mean, Mr. Lin Jr.?

97
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,650
When the snipe and clam fight,
the fisherman benefits.

98
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,360
Let them keep competing.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
That way,

100
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,640
TY can secure better terms.

101
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Ms. Ling!

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,560
Ms. Ling.

103
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,160
Did everything go well with your trip?

104
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
Mr. Lin Jr. will take over

105
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,240
TY's branch business from now on.

106
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,720
Mr. Lin Jr.?

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
Should we pay him a visit?

108
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:40,800
I'll think about it.

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
Any updates from Spring Sea?

110
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:43,880
I was just about to report to you.

111
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,880
They're playing tricks.

112
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
They hosted a "Kitchen Open Day"

113
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,000
and invited all the TY executives.

114
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,920
They're going all out to win.

115
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,177
Are we heading back to the hotel?

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,400
No, to Spring Sea.

117
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,120
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm so sorry, Mr. Li.

119
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
Simvastatin is a prescription drug.

120
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,200
We can't provide this service for you.

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Is there really no other way?

122
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,240
I can't go out right now.

123
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm really sorry.

124
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,680
We really can't help you with this.

125
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,040
I heard you even opened up the kitchen.

126
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,800
What made a man
with such strong principles

127
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,880
change so much in just a few days?

128
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Just to defeat me?

129
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,120
Yishu.

130
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:33,480
Bright Platinum isn't on my list
of targets to defeat.

131
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,320
In that case,

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,440
I'll gladly accept

133
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,933
this year's Best of Choice award.

134
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,600
I advise you not to act out of spite.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,760
It won't help you.

136
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,640
You'd better help yourself.

137
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,080
I can tell you now.

138
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,280
You're going

139
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
to lose this game.

140
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,320
Morning, Ms. Yi.

141
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,320
Going for breakfast?

142
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
Third day at work.

143
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,200
What happened

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,280
with that guest?

145
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,920
Mr. Li ran out of his medication

146
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:05,311
and asked us to help buy more.

147
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:06,760
But hotel regulations forbid us

148
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,360
(Simvastatin Tablets)
from buying prescription drugs for guests.

149
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Simvastatin?

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,800
Mr. Li seems to have heart disease.

151
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,360
Heart disease?

152
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,960
I know you haven't been
resting well lately.

153
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
I brought you a gift.

154
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,000
Thanks.

155
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
No need to thank me.

156
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:30,560
If you fall apart,
who's going to play this game with me?

157
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
What's going on?

158
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Dad! Dad!

159
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,160
A sudden heart attack?

160
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
That's so sudden...

161
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,720
(In Operation)

162
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm very sorry.

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,133
Your father passed away
because he wasn't treated promptly.

164
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,480
Mr. Wang!

165
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
Heart problems
shouldn't be taken lightly.

166
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:33,577
Take this just in case.

167
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:34,440
Thanks, Mr. Wang.

168
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,640
No. I can't accept that.

169
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,200
Take it.

170
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
Who are you?

171
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:49,933
This should be
the same medication you're taking.

172
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:50,822
Please take it.

173
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
May I know who you are?

174
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Take it first.

175
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
You don't look well.

176
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,800
Oh, thank you.

177
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,280
Please take care of yourself.

178
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,440
A hardworking employee.

179
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,360
Don't run out of medication again.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,640
Of course.

181
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,520
Please accept this.

182
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,377
A small gesture will do.

183
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,111
What's got you grinning?

184
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,840
My bonus.

185
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,920
What bonus?

186
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,560
I heard that before the hotel awards,

187
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,480
the evaluators will pose as guests

188
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,440
to conduct the final assessment
of the nominated hotels.

189
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,880
If my sincere and enthusiastic service

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,640
impresses the evaluator

191
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,720
and helps our hotel win first place,

192
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,920
don't you think I could redeem myself

193
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,160
and get Vincent to value me again?

194
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,800
Maybe I could even

195
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,800
get a generous bonus?

196
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,800
If they're posing as guests,

197
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,040
how would you even know?

198
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't understand
my talent for reading people.

199
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,355
See that guy over there on the phone?

200
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,640
Notice how he raises his voice

201
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,040
when talking about money,

202
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,640
making sure everyone hears him?

203
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,120
And how his eyes keep darting
toward the young ladies?

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
Also, the way he tugs at his sleeve

205
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
just enough

206
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,120
to show off that Rolex watch?

207
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:15,520
What does that tell you?

208
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,040
What?

209
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,480
Typical nouveau riche.

210
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:21,955
What about that senior over there?

211
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,960
Social media poser.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hello, sir.

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,200
Welcome to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

214
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,120
Hello. I made a reservation.

215
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,280
Mr. Lin, your room number is 9030.

216
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,260
(Cindy Gu)

217
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,080
Your room card, sir.

218
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,040
Thank you, Cindy.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,760
What's the matter, Mr. Lin?

220
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,960
N37

221
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,960
compliments you well.

222
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,920
Really?

223
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,320
Thank you.

224
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,800
Please call me if you need anything.

225
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,280
I'll be here until 5 PM.

226
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Will do.

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,560
Goodbye.

228
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,880
Bye.

229
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
Oh, dear.

230
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,888
I think I've been twitterpated.

231
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,280
Mr. Lin.

232
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,920
Here's a fruit platter from the hotel.

233
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,720
Thank you for the fruit.

234
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,120
I'll make sure to enjoy it.

235
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
If you have time,

236
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,555
please join us
for the hotel's Qixi Festival event.

237
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,266
An employee badge
represents the hotel's image.

238
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,880
It should be neat

239
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
and presentable,

240
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,488
just like the employee.

241
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,720
Thank you, Mr. Lin...

242
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
We'll leave you to rest.

243
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,880
Yes, Mr. Lin Jr.?

244
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,520
Proceed with our plan.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,520
Yes, sir.

246
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,977
Also, the person you're looking for
has been located.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
She is staying at Spring Sea Hotel.

248
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,760
Got it.

249
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:13,200
What do you think?

250
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,560
He was so charming!

251
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,280
"Thank you for the fruit."

252
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,840
"I'll make sure to enjoy it."

253
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,200
And he even

254
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
adjusted my badge for me.

255
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,240
He said

256
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,200
an employee's badge

257
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,520
represents the hotel's image.

258
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,120
It has to be neat

259
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
and presentable.

260
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
My true love has finally appeared!

261
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
Didn't you say Boss was your true love?

262
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,480
That was before 9030 showed up.

263
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm just temporarily
switching loyalties. No big deal.

264
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
He was so handsome.

265
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,720
Rich and polite.

266
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,400
Even the way he speaks is so gentle.

267
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,000
You have a crush on him too?

268
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,920
No.

269
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,240
It's just pure admiration for his looks.

270
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm not like those two.

271
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,520
They're still living in a fairy tale.

272
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,520
Fairy tales are fake.

273
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
But I believe the love
in fairy tales is real.

274
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,960
Little girl,

275
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,920
guys like that are not for you.

276
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,360
Romance dramas are nice to watch,

277
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,160
but don't get too attached.

278
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,466
If you don't work hard,
no one will support you.

279
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,440
But don't you think something feels off

280
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,440
about this?

281
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,360
Why?

282
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,400
How does he know

283
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
so much

284
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,480
about the hotel?

285
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,440
Hotel regulars know these things,

286
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,400
right?

287
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,200
Do they?

288
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,640
What kind of person
frequently stays at hotels

289
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,560
and knows all these details?

290
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,160
Could he be my bonus?

291
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,480
Let's eat.

292
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,400
Ms. Yi,

293
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,622
someone sent you a gift.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Who sent it?

295
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,120
No idea.

296
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,000
You mentioned adding some
entertainment facilities to the room.

297
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:17,311
What exactly should be added?

298
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,440
Just throw in some poker cards

299
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,480
or puzzles.

300
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,060
(Broken door. Do not touch.)

301
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,280
What are you doing here?

302
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
I have a question for you.

303
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,560
What question?

304
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,320
Why did you send me a puzzle?

305
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,960
A puzzle?

306
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,000
When did I send you a puzzle?

307
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
It wasn't you?

308
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,680
No.

309
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
Were you raised being lied to?

310
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,760
My bad.

311
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,577
I won't take up any more of your time.

312
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,440
I'm leaving.

313
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,720
I think this door is stuck.

314
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,640
Idiot.

315
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,280
And this is supposed
to be a five-star hotel?

316
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Bad review.

317
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,680
You...

318
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,960
What's wrong?

319
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,155
We won the "lottery," that's what.

320
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,960
Is anyone out there?

321
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,440
Why are you panicking? I'm not.

322
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,400
You had your phone?

323
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,080
Of course.

324
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,177
Then why didn't you take it out earlier?

325
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,560
There's no signal here.

326
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:04,022
Who told you there's no signal?

327
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,560
Full bars.

328
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,080
Don't need it!

329
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,840
Stop calling!

330
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,240
I said I don't need it!

331
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,520
Stop calling!

332
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:30,400
Don't hang up yet!

333
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,680
You want me to stay on the line?
I'm hanging up!

334
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,400
You're nuts!

335
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,560
Why is the battery dead?

336
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:41,520
I was about to tell you,

337
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,911
but you just took the phone away.

338
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,360
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

339
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,560
I'll try turning it on again.

340
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,200
Don't bother.

341
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,280
Are you all right?

342
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:51,280
Don't scare me.

343
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,311
If you die here,
I won't be able to explain it.

344
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,520
You hit my head with your head.

345
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,600
Why aren't you hurt?

346
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,080
My head's always been hard.

347
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,533
What are you doing?

348
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Helping you feel better.

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Feel better? You call this helping?

350
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,600
You hit me here.

351
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,560
I don't need it.

352
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,200
Have you seen the Boss?

353
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,920
No. Why?

354
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,800
It's too quiet.

355
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,080
Not even a call.

356
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,400
Isn't that perfect?

357
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,600
You've got a free
and easy night to yourself.

358
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Easy?

359
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,400
I can't sleep peacefully

360
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,640
unless he calls me.

361
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,240
Boss, I'm begging you!

362
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,320
Please just call me!

363
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,360
Boss!

364
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,320
Boss!

365
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,480
Don't sit down.

366
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,280
Why?

367
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,911
It's not properly laid out yet.

368
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:03,800
Do you have OCD
or is this just a work habit?

369
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:05,580
Even if you smooth it out now,

370
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,360
it's going to wrinkle
when we sit down anyway.

371
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:09,800
You'll get hungry again
even after eating.

372
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,320
Why bother eating at all?

373
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,688
All right. You can sit on it now.

374
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,240
This place isn't too bad.

375
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,800
Why don't we just
stay here for the night?

376
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,960
Keep dreaming.

377
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,520
True.

378
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Someone like you

379
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,160
would never sleep in a basement.

380
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:42,888
You've slept in a basement?

381
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,440
More than that.

382
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,640
I've slept in basements,

383
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,320
waiting rooms,

384
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,720
underground tunnels...

385
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,400
I even slept

386
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,911
in a factory warehouse elevator
when I was working part-time.

387
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,200
What was the basement like?

388
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,400
That was when
I had just started working.

389
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,600
The factory dorm

390
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,760
was basically a basement.

391
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,480
It was damp

392
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
and had poor reception,

393
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,040
but it was spacious at least.

394
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Everyone had their own single bed.

395
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,040
But at night,

396
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,480
Zhi and Hui

397
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,760
were too noisy.

398
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,044
If they didn't sleep,
I couldn't sleep either.

399
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,000
Who's Hui?

400
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,960
The rats.

401
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,520
Why are you leaning in so close?

402
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,560
Move over.

403
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,960
I'm worried you'll get scared.

404
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm not scared.

405
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,680
It's OK to be scared.

406
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,480
Want me to tell you a cockroach story?

407
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,840
No, thanks.

408
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:48,600
Have you heard cockroaches crawling?

409
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:48,920
No.

410
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,160
Did you know that cockroaches

411
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,480
in the south have wings?

412
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:52,600
And a basement like this

413
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:54,340
would definitely have
lots of cockroaches.

414
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,240
If you see one,

415
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,760
that means they've been living here

416
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,440
and breeding for generations.

417
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,240
Yi Ran!

418
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:00,960
If you say one more word,

419
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,640
I'll tape your mouth shut.

420
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
OK. Fine.

421
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,120
What's that noise?

422
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,840
Yi Ran!

423
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,800
Cleaning the warehouse so early?

424
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,520
Looks like the door lock's broken.

425
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:23,800
(Broken door. Do not touch.)

426
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:24,666
I have a keycard.

427
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,680
Why is the Boss inside?

428
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,112
Not a word about this.

429
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:34,680
Have you heard?

430
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,466
Vincent spent the night in the warehouse

431
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,480
with a woman last night.

432
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,880
You didn't know?

433
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,160
Who said that?

434
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:46,022
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Where?

435
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:46,680
In the warehouse?

436
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,640
With a woman?

437
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,680
Come here.

438
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,022
- What?
- I'll tell you a secret.

439
00:24:52,044 --> 00:24:53,444
Did you hear Mr. Xiao got married?

440
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,120
What? Mr. Xiao is married?

441
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,800
Yes!

442
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,960
(Guys!)

443
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,360
(Big news!)

444
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,400
(Boss is married and even has kids!)

445
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,040
(I can't believe
I slept with her again last night.)

446
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,600
Boss!

447
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,240
Boss!

448
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

449
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,360
Do you have twins?

450
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,840
Twins?

451
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,360
Oh, I see.

452
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,160
Keep up the act.

453
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,440
It's all over the hotel.

454
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,440
They say you not only got married young,

455
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,520
but you even have a pair of twins.

456
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
And you believe that gossip?

457
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,279
How long have you known me?

458
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,690
You don't know my situation by now?

459
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,440
That's true.

460
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:19,333
You're not hiding it from me, right?

461
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,600
Do you want to be fired?

462
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,360
No.

463
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:28,911
They're waiting for you
to do the rounds.

464
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,520
Let's go.

465
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,350
You sure you're not married?

466
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:37,066
I'm sure.

467
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,680
I should get breakfast.

468
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:04,044
You didn't do anything wrong.
Why are you hiding from him?

469
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,440
I've arranged for the two VIPs

470
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,920
to stay in 8618 and 8617.

471
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,800
Make sure to ask
if they need transportation.

472
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:14,220
Yes.

473
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,760
And...

474
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,160
Everyone else,
check the room facilities.

475
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,640
Cleanliness is critical.

476
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:24,000
Besides the welcome fruit platter,

477
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,460
check if the guests have any requests.

478
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,150
Make sure the room amenities
are prepared.

479
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:27,711
Understood.

480
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,755
When you're cleaning the room,

481
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:30,720
check if the guests left

482
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,160
any comment cards.

483
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,840
When restocking the minibar,

484
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,120
check for fingerprints or stains

485
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,080
inside the fridge.

486
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
That's important.

487
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,800
Details determine success or failure.

488
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,640
Heading to breakfast, Ms. Yi?

489
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,360
No. I'm getting food.

490
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,480
Now,

491
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,760
about the hallway setup.

492
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:56,720
Make sure the carpet is sanitized

493
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,960
and clean the dust off the light bulbs.

494
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,320
"Where every moment is five-star."

495
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:08,320
Guests who stay
for three consecutive nights

496
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,080
will receive the fourth night free.

497
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
The promotion applies to all room types.

498
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,320
Including luxury suites
and executive floors.

499
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,840
Guests who book
more than 30 days in advance

500
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
will receive a 10% discount per night.

501
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,800
This encourages guests to plan
and book early

502
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,200
to secure the best rates

503
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,320
on specific dates.

504
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,240
This will allow us

505
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,680
to cultivate repeat customers.

506
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:53,777
We've expanded the banquet hall

507
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,044
to accommodate 1,000 people

508
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,240
and remodeled

509
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,320
the entire space.

510
00:28:57,644 --> 00:28:58,240
Over here...

511
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,600
Why is he everywhere?

512
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,720
Take a look.

513
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:01,990
We've modified the driveway

514
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,000
in the front courtyard

515
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,800
to accommodate more buses.

516
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,644
Please direct your attention here.

517
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,600
We've also updated the greenery.

518
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,240
That's the tree-lined running track.

519
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,720
Allow me to show you around.

520
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,200
This way, please.

521
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,120
OK.

522
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,800
Ms. Yi!

523
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,480
Big news! Did you hear?

524
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,240
What happened?

525
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,520
Boss is married and even has twins!

526
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:53,088
They're old enough to do chores!

527
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,640
Are you OK?

528
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,040
What a scumbag!

529
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,480
Don't tell anyone else.

530
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:02,844
I'll get back to work.

531
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:03,960
Don't tell anyone!

532
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
Yiyi, can you believe this?

533
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,822
Mr. Xiao is not only married

534
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:14,760
but already has twins!

535
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
And they're old enough to do chores!

536
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:19,720
I need to hang up.

537
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,400
I got a call.

538
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,240
Hello.

539
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,720
That's me.

540
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
2 PM at Huatian Tower, right?

541
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,440
I'll be there on time.

542
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,640
OK.

543
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,360
Thank you.

544
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,120
Money really is the only thing
you can trust.

545
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,840
Boss.

546
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,440
We've made adjustments
to the issue you raised.

547
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,640
Here is the revised proposal.

548
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:48,890
Would you like to confirm it?

549
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:49,749
Coordinate with Anna

550
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,160
regarding the promotional details.

551
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,560
OK.

552
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:01,933
You're holding it upside down.

553
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,644
I'm used to holding things upside down.

554
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,280
Scumbag.

555
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,160
I forgot something. You go ahead.

556
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,170
Thank you for staying with us.

557
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,644
We hope to welcome you again.

558
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,400
OK.

559
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,480
Your crush is here.

560
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,080
Hello, Cindy.

561
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,840
Hello, Mr. Lin.

562
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,200
Your car is in the parking lot.

563
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,400
This is the key.

564
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,000
Thanks.

565
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,880
By the way,

566
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
is there a Yi Ran

567
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,880
staying at this hotel?

568
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,000
Yi Ran?

569
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,320
I think so.

570
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,520
Can you tell me her room number?

571
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

572
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
It's a matter of privacy.

573
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,920
OK.

574
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,320
I understand.

575
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,840
I'll leave you to your work.

576
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,280
Mr. Lin!

577
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,920
Is that the person you're looking for?

578
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,440
Yes?

579
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:09,955
Mr. Lin, Ms. Ling from Bright Platinum
wants to meet with you.

580
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:11,360
I have important business today.

581
00:32:11,488 --> 00:32:12,680
Find an excuse and decline.

582
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,200
Yes, sir.

583
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,440
Get in.

584
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,190
We're not headed in the same direction.

585
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,960
We are.

586
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
Send me the location and time.

587
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,400
Take me to Huatian Tower.

588
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,200
Huatian Tower? Where's that?

589
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,200
What are you doing there?

590
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,200
Why are you going there?

591
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,600
For an interview.

592
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,622
If you don't know the way, I'll drive.

593
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,280
Get out.

594
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,200
What are you interviewing for?

595
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,600
As far as I remember,

596
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,840
you still have three days left.

597
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,040
So what?

598
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,400
It's none of your business.

599
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,960
Did you forget your medicine
this morning?

600
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,160
Why are you so moody?

601
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,680
You're lucky I didn't punch you.

602
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,520
You're pretending
to be a single, eligible man

603
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,390
while you've got twins old enough
to do chores?

604
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:38,190
You're despicable!

605
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,520
They were talking about us.

606
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,440
You and me? Married?

607
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,360
With kids? Twins at that?

608
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,960
We're moving way too fast!

609
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,700
Action.

610
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,880
Dad!

611
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,270
That means...

612
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,350
How about we go find Bella to help him?

613
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,000
I told you not to mess with this.

614
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,950
Look at how dirty it is.

615
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,310
Are you okay?

616
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,710
Okay.

617
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,990
Thank you.

618
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,300
Lately,

619
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,670
I've heard some rumors
about the hotel being haunted.

620
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,520
