00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:34,800
This is my stop.

4
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,160
Can you drive yourself home?

5
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
I can drive.

6
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,640
I know.

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,760
You're good at it.

8
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,960
But try not to drive if you can help it.

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,440
What are you doing?

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
Just helping you unbuckle.

11
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,800
Never thought
we'd cross paths like this.

12
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,120
Who's "we"?

13
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
If anything, it's just bad luck.

14
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,320
I don't see it that way.

15
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,080
Hold on.

16
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,720
Nope.

17
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
No WeChat or phone number.

18
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
You're taking up two parking spots.

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,200
Mind moving your car?

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,480
I like taking two spots.

21
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,777
Find another spot to park.

22
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,760
Auntie, Aunt.

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,560
Uncle, Madam.

24
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,280
Brother, Sister.

25
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,320
Someone must have said yes.

26
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,840
Nine hundred thirty-six,
twenty-eight, fifteen...

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,200
With all these expenses,
can you even make a profit?

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,040
We're interviewing a new applicant.

29
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,720
If she doesn't get hired,
I'll be coming after you.

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,080
Read it carefully.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,460
(Sleep on the floor today,
be the boss tomorrow.)

32
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,600
Have some water.

33
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
Yi Ran, right?

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
Show me your resume.

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,480
Why are you crying?

36
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,040
Sit down.

37
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,880
Not bad.

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,840
Tomorrow,

39
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,960
you may start working.

40
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,377
That's it? I'm hired?

41
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,440
Aren't you going
to ask me anything else?

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
The moment I saw you, I knew

43
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,120
you were perfect
for a customer service job.

44
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,440
To be honest,

45
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,720
I don't have much experience
in customer service.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
I look forward to your guidance.

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,960
Experience, you see,

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,560
is something you build over time.

49
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
You develop it.

50
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,200
Take it slow.

51
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,920
Now that we're colleagues,

52
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,440
come on.

53
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
Settle the fees.

54
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,333
(Payment)
This account works too.

55
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,880
What fees?

56
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,400
This is a business.

57
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,400
Workspace fee, employee fee,

58
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
and sanitization fee.

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,800
That'll be 2,400 yuan.

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,120
If you can't scan the code,
cash is fine too.

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,440
Everyone, come on.

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,080
Let's welcome our new colleague!

63
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,200
What is our company motto?

64
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,360
To succeed, you must work hard!

65
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,680
Work hard!

66
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,040
Don't leave!

67
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
It's fine if you don't want to join.

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,160
Just introduce some friends instead.

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,120
Work hard.

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,440
Are you done yet?

71
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,109
Who told you to sit down?

72
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,790
Listen, I have
an important meeting today.

73
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,880
I don't have time for you.

74
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,720
What are the odds?

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
I have plenty of time.

76
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,280
Are you crazy?

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,040
Get up before I call security.

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,160
Security...

79
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,420
(Mr. Lin Jr.)

80
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,840
Hello?

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,920
Your way of treating customers

82
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
is quite unique.

83
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,640
Mr. Lin Jr., you have
an interesting taste as well.

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,040
Hello.

85
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,240
May I take your order?

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
A cup of chrysanthemum tea for the lady.

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,480
She needs to cool off.

88
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,480
And for this gentleman,

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,600
a coffee-lemon-watermelon juice.

90
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,800
He likes strong flavors.

91
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,200
Iced Americano. Sorry.

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,880
Got it.

93
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,760
Would you call this
a fateful encounter?

94
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,240
No.

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,480
Ms. Ling, you would call it

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,960
bad luck.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,040
You're a busy man.

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,800
Let's get straight to the point.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,880
This year, our hotel

100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,840
has undergone a full upgrade

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,400
in both infrastructure and facilities,

102
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,555
including conference rooms
and banquet halls.

103
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
I've already reviewed all of that.

104
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,080
They look good.

105
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,960
But, your prices aren't competitive.

106
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
Give me one reason

107
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,400
why I must choose your hotel.

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,920
In this world,

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,520
you can't expect to get

110
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
high quality at a bargain price.

111
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
A luxury sports car won't be sold

112
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,240
at the price of a sedan.

113
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,920
That is the one truth of the economy.

114
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm sure someone
with your insight, Mr. Lin Jr.,

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
knows how to make the best choice.

116
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,240
To me, a car is just
a means of transportation.

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,520
Efficiency, fuel economy,
and energy saving

118
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,240
are what matter.

119
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,800
But the advantages you mention

120
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,120
also come with safety risks, don't they?

121
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,040
Not really.

122
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,120
Mr. Lin Jr., you wouldn't be

123
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
making things difficult for me

124
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:40,360
because of our unpleasant
encounters, right?

125
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,400
Take a guess.

126
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,639
Looks like there's nothing more to say.

127
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,800
Thanks for coming all this way
just to turn me down.

128
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,240
Your tea is here.

129
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:55,680
Take a sip before you leave.

130
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:57,844
It's a waste of time
if we don't see eye to eye.

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,000
Enjoy your tea, Mr. Lin Jr.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
No need to follow up on the TY case.

133
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
Ms. Ling, why is that?

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,440
Why?

135
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,720
Do I need to explain myself?

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,480
Oh, right.

137
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,640
Drive safe.

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,320
Where's my car?

139
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,800
Zhang,

140
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,680
you're right on time today.

141
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,020
(Love Follows the Wind
sent a Lollipop.)

142
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
Thank you, Love Follows the Wind!

143
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,440
Even though

144
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,400
my livestream has never
had many viewers,

145
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm truly grateful for your support.

146
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
Don't worry,

147
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,760
I'll keep working hard!

148
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,440
What song do you want next?

149
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,680
Welcome to the new viewers!

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,240
Old Zhao!

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,520
Didn't I tell you?

152
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,360
You're too old to be staying up so late.

153
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,440
How about this?

154
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,040
I'll let you pick a song,

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,080
but after that, off to bed.

156
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,920
Let me think...

157
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,560
How about I sing

158
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,240
"Strolling Through the Sunset" for you?

How many times do I have to tell you?

167
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
It's Ms. Yi.

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
I like your way

169
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,480
of catching up.

170
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,320
You've lost so much weight.

171
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,040
If you hadn't said my name,

172
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,555
I wouldn't even know it was you.

173
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,400
And you haven't changed at all.

174
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,920
Oh, I've changed.

175
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
People call me auntie now.

176
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,280
No.

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,520
You're just in the prime

178
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,960
of a woman's beauty.

179
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,280
Wow, educated people
sure speak differently.

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,840
Oh, right.

181
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,400
Did you get the gift I sent you?

182
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,200
What gift?

183
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,800
That puzzle was from you?

184
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,400
Who else did you think sent it?

185
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,680
Thanks for that.

186
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,560
You didn't even leave your name.

187
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,520
What a loss.

188
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,280
What do you mean?

189
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,640
Nothing.

190
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,440
Nice gift, but don't send another.

191
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
What?

192
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,240
Looks like you're doing pretty well now.

193
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,720
Not too bad.

194
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,880
Right now,

195
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,840
I get free meals
and accommodation at this hotel.

196
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,640
Not only do I get VIP treatment,

197
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,080
but even the head of
Housekeeping Department listens to me.

198
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,200
The only slight difference is

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,000
that your day starts
when you open your eyes,

200
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
but mine starts when I close mine.

201
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,720
Wait, are you some kind
of hotel executive?

202
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,960
Something like that.

203
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,160
To be precise,
I'm a professional sleeper.

204
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
A professional sleeper?

205
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,600
Sounds fancy, huh?

206
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,960
And my daily salary
is paid in U.S. dollars.

207
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,320
If you run into any problems

208
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,280
during your stay here,

209
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,320
just let me know.

210
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,044
I'll get it sorted in no time.

211
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,280
You don't trust my abilities?

212
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,440
Let me show you...

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,240
I got so caught up in the chat,

214
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,577
that I forgot the singles party.

215
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,444
You can't go there.

216
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm right here,

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
why do you need a singles party?

218
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,560
I'm going to experience it
and write a review.

219
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,440
How about I take you along for a look?

220
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,000
Sorry, there was a hotel event.

221
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:02,844
I got delayed.

222
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
You knew I was coming,

223
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
so you planned an event just for me?

224
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,000
I beg your pardon?

225
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,800
Nothing.

226
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,400
Just letting you know

227
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,960
I've decided to hand you the TY case.

228
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:14,200
You're handing it over?

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,720
After all, we're friends.

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
Instead of fighting

231
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,080
to the bitter end,

232
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I'd take a step back.

233
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,120
But, you know how demanding TY is.

234
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,200
Whether you can close the deal
is up to you.

235
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,400
Not a lot of people here.

236
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,320
Isn't that a good thing?

237
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,560
Fewer people, more focus.

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,200
With an elite career woman like you,

239
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
you'll get the spotlight.

240
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:39,080
It's all because of that awful woman!

241
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,040
Otherwise...

242
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,600
I'd be off to the Maldives
with the rich bachelor.

243
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,400
Guess it just wasn't meant to be.

244
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,120
Don't worry,

245
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,355
I'll help you find a match...

246
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:47,720
Dear esteemed guests,

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,560
welcome to the singles party.

248
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,440
Welcome!

249
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,480
Yeah!

250
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,240
Tonight,

251
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,680
any guest who successfully pairs up

252
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,040
will receive a complimentary

253
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,680
Valentine's Day candlelight dinner
from our hotel.

254
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,400
Hey, over there.

255
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
He is your type!

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,640
We just got here. What's the rush?

257
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:05,520
Let's look around.

258
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Act now before someone else does.

259
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,720
Come on!

260
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,720
Hurry!

261
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,320
Everyone, please take your roses

262
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,560
and head to the front desk.

263
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
Sir, are you here alone?

264
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,360
Well...

265
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,360
If I'm not alone,

266
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,280
then what am I?

267
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,200
A nice sense of humor.

268
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,800
This is my friend, Susie.

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Hi.

270
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
She'd like to meet you.

271
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,240
Oh, really?

272
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,480
Well, I don't want to get to know you.

273
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,240
Sorry.

274
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,600
Is this guy blind?

275
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Who does he think he is?

276
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
Why didn't you wait for me
before coming in?

277
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Any later,
and I would've been kidnapped.

278
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,800
Her again?

279
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,360
She's the one who made me
miss out on the rich guy!

280
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,560
We can't just let this slide.

281
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
Isn't this supposed to be
a singles' party?

282
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,640
Why does it feel more
like a career fair?

283
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
If I take over the hotel,

284
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:01,920
I'll hire you as an executive.

285
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
See? That's why I've always said

286
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,080
you have great taste.

287
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,560
Since we're already here,

288
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
why not find yourself a perfect match?

289
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,040
I just crawled out of the abyss.

290
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm not falling back in.

291
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,760
For the time being,

292
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
all I care about is making money.

293
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,680
Hello?

294
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,000
Right now?

295
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,320
Give me your phone.

296
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,920
I'll call you.

297
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,760
We'll have dinner later.

298
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,800
Bye-bye.

299
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,440
Bye-bye.

300
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,240
Are you insane? My dress!

301
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
What are you doing?

302
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

303
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,480
Let me help you.

304
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,040
Your hand!

305
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

306
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,800
Get your filthy hands off me!

307
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,440
You did that on purpose!

308
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I really didn't!

309
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,920
She bumped into me out of nowhere!

310
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,240
My shoes!

311
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,280
These are limited-edition!

312
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,400
I'll wipe them for you.

313
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,640
Get lost, you bumpkin!

314
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,840
These shoes can't be washed!

315
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,280
Yishu, I know you too well.

316
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
Just say it.

317
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,080
What are you up to?

318
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,640
Since you know me so well,

319
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,680
then you should know

320
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,280
I've always been serious about you.

321
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
Don't look at me like that.

322
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,520
Sometimes, rivals can be friends too.

323
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,280
If you land this deal,

324
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,320
treat me to dinner.

325
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,840
I'll do my best
to secure the partnership.

326
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:57,880
But there's one thing
you need to understand.

327
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,000
The final decision isn't
between you and me.

328
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Of course, the client has a choice.

329
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,640
But we also get to choose our clients.

330
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,640
Boss, we have a problem.

331
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,177
Your whole life's worth of salary
can't even afford these!

332
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,160
If you know you're a mess,
just stay home!

333
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,960
That's enough, don't you think?

334
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,040
If there's an issue,
let's talk outside, okay?

335
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,360
You started this!

336
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,360
And now you want to take it outside?

337
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,160
Why should we listen to you, bumpkin?

338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,600
Call me whatever you want,

339
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,760
just take it outside.

340
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,720
You are embarrassing all of us here.

341
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,177
You don't like name calling?
Then I'll give you a slap!

342
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,080
Feeling sober now?

343
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,640
Did you just splash on me?

344
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,880
Yi Ran!

345
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,320
So, the rumors about
Boss's insomnia are true.

346
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,920
Doctors say people who sigh a lot
tend to have weak digestion.

347
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,920
And our wise and mighty Vincent

348
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
has finally taken off his mask.

349
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,360
And those dark circles
under his eyes are huge!

350
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,120
No wonder he always
wears sunglasses during meetings.

351
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
Mr. Xiao is a perfectionist.

352
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,320
What's wrong with using sunglasses
to cover up dark circles?

353
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,840
He shouldn't be called
the Sunglasses Maniac.

354
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,000
He should be Dark Circles Maniac.

355
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,680
He's basically a panda at this point.

356
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:01,800
Are you two going to eat or not?

357
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,680
I need a moment to process

358
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,080
this love story tainted by dark circles.

359
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,560
Wait a minute.

360
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,240
Weren't you into Lin You...

361
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,880
Don't say it.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,040
My chest hurts.

363
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,160
Oh, heaven.

364
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Can you leave us at least
a couple of good men?

365
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,760
And heaven replied,

366
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,120
"No sympathy for the fickle women

367
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,520
who are never satisfied
with what they already have."

368
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,640
Do you think Vincent and her

369
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,040
are just naturally incompatible?

370
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,600
Every time she shows up,

371
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,240
his luck takes a nosedive.

372
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,000
He should do some prayers
at the temple.

373
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,800
I think you are the one
who's incompatible with her.

374
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,640
Maybe you should go to the temple.

375
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,200
I did just that.

376
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
I just went a few days ago.

377
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,640
Didn't you see my post?

378
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:57,680
Why are you holding my phone?

379
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,240
No way.

380
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:02,200
Have the prayers been answered?

381
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:05,440
What are you looking at?

382
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,320
Nothing.

383
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,360
Why so mysterious?

384
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,520
By the way,

385
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:11,520
I need to see Mr. Xiao.

386
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,640
Cover for me.

387
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,080
You're going to see him?

388
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,680
Yeah.

389
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,244
I need his signature on this document.

390
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
Why trouble yourself
with such a trivial task?

391
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,600
I'll go instead.

392
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,960
Is there any medicine

393
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
that can delete their memory?

394
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,880
Or just delete mine. That works too.

395
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,920
Boss,

396
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,880
calm down.

397
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,320
Calm down?

398
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,560
How can I calm down?

399
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:42,680
Everyone has seen my face!

400
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:43,880
Do you think I can calm down?

401
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,000
You can't blame Yi Ran for all of this.

402
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:48,711
Those two women clearly
came looking for trouble.

403
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,000
How about I sing you
a song to cheer you up?

404
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,080
♪The darkness before me
is not true darkness♪

405
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,520
You said...

406
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,666
I'll calm down, so shut up.

407
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,720
By the way,

408
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,520
what did Ms. Ling want from you?

409
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,120
She said she's handing over
the TY deal to us.

410
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,400
What did she mean by handing it over?

411
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,680
Wasn't she all fired up

412
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
to take us down?

413
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,880
Something's definitely off here.

414
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,040
It's not that simple.

415
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,360
It's obvious that the newly
appointed Mr. Lin Jr.

416
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,520
shut her down.

417
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,320
She's trying to turn a dead-end deal

418
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,360
into leverage for something else.

419
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,040
Come in.

420
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Mr. Xiao.

421
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,200
I need your signature
for these documents.

422
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
There's something

423
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm not sure if I should say.

424
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,840
Then don't.

425
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,480
Well, I'll just say it anyway.

426
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:49,244
For the sake of the hotel's reputation,

427
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,970
I must say it even
if it offends someone.

428
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,560
Dingdang took this photo.

429
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,320
It looks like Ms. Yi was
secretly taking tips from guests.

430
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,120
That's a terrible look for the hotel.

431
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:06,920
Send me the pictures.

432
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,960
Come in.

433
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
I'll head out now.

434
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,120
I'll leave you two to talk.

435
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:37,333
I wanted to explain
what happened earlier.

436
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,160
Fine.

437
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,120
I know you don't want to talk to me.

438
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,420
(Sorry. I apologize for my actions.)

439
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,100
(I will seriously reflect
and work on improving myself.)

440
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,900
(I will seriously reflect
and work on improving myself.)

441
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,240
You did this?

442
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,600
That was an accident.

443
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,720
But doesn't it look nice anyway?

444
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,400
And this was an accident too?

445
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,000
I took the money to buy him medicine.

446
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Is that a problem too?

447
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,400
What about the incident
at the party tonight?

448
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,680
I know you have a problem with me.

449
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,720
But everyone saw what happened.

450
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,200
Those two women crossed the line.

451
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,720
But they're still hotel guests.

452
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
And so what if they are?

453
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,760
They can't stir up trouble

454
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,800
and hurl insults!

455
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,640
Ever since you came,

456
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,000
I've been on the verge

457
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,640
of a meltdown every day!

458
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,239
What does that mean?

459
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,320
I'm trying to tell you

460
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,080
what should and shouldn't be done.

461
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,560
This is a five-star hotel,

462
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,600
not some roadside inn.

463
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,040
You can't just do as you please.

464
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:10,800
What's wrong with a small inn?

465
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,840
Who are you to look down on them?

466
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,440
Even if they're small,

467
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:15,480
guests feel at home there.

468
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:16,711
Can they feel the same here?

469
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,960
People don't pay for a room

470
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,960
just because the TV is huge,

471
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,800
the decor is fancy,

472
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:22,266
or the staff's smiles are forced.

473
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,520
What they truly pay for

474
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,000
is the feeling that makes them
want to come again.

475
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,880
Enough.

476
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,800
Let me make this clear.

477
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,400
I brought you in to fix problems,

478
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,520
not to create more of them.

479
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,880
You finally said it.

480
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,520
To you, I was the problem all along.

481
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,000
There's no point talking to you

482
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,840
if you have no principles.

483
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,280
(Hotel Professional Sleeper Agreement)

484
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,760
We can terminate our contract now.

485
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,280
Principles?

486
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,680
Are you so sure
you'll stick to yours forever?

487
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,040
What?

488
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,960
Boss kicked her out?

489
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,280
She fought a guest.

490
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:12,422
That sealed her fate.

491
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,960
This is a total disaster.

492
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,880
Have you heard?

493
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,520
Our professional sleeper

494
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,760
got fired by Boss.

495
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,520
When did this happen?

496
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I just got the notice.

497
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,180
I was told to go clean up.

498
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,020
(I will seriously reflect
and work on improving myself.)

499
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,510
(I will seriously reflect
and work on improving myself.)

500
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:43,100
(Thank you for forgiving me!)

501
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,260
(Lin Youjia)

502
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,200
(Sometimes, life is more ridiculous
than a TV drama.)

503
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,600
(No matter how strong you try to be,)

504
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,080
(there will always
be people or situations)

505
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,880
(that tear you into pieces.)

506
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:19,400
(But if fate has given you
the resilience)

507
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,000
(to endure the worst,)

508
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,080
(you have to keep
pushing yourself forward)

509
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,360
(even if you have to fake a smile.)

510
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,000
Are you out of your mind?

511
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,320
Let's go.

512
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,560
Action!

513
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,290
Action!

514
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,980
Action!

515
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,560
Work hard!

516
