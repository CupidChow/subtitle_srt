00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,680
No meat?

4
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,200
I don't have an appetite.

5
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,040
I feel like I've let Yi Ran down.

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,480
You can't go against

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,760
Chairman's wishes, right?

8
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
Yi Ran won't blame you.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,320
The braised pork is really good today.

10
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:09,640
It's not Chairman's order.

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
It's not?

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Then whose is it?

13
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,900
=The Quirky and The Charming=

14
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,360
Hey.

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,320
This way.

16
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,720
The ambiance in this room is nice.

17
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,040
But this is the only room type
they offer.

19
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,080
So, you take the bed,
and I'll sleep on the couch.

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,840
Why?

21
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm not used to sleeping on a bed.

22
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,920
And how could I let a girl
sleep on the couch?

23
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,040
You are hopeless.

24
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
This bed is huge.
It can fit both of us.

25
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:29,755
You want to share a bed with me?

26
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:30,511
So what?

27
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,360
It's not like
we haven't slept together before.

28
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,840
We'll sleep together for real tonight.

29
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,040
Better not.

30
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,560
I'm a healthy man.

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,080
What if...

32
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,022
We're sleeping together!

33
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
Maybe we should

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,680
turn off the lights.

35
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,280
All right.

36
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,680
Understood.

37
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,400
Turning off the lights for you now.

38
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,160
Maybe we should keep them on.

39
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,600
All right.

40
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,680
Understood.

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
Turning the lights back on.

42
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
We can't fall asleep.

43
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,640
Maybe some wine will help.

44
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,480
All right.

45
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you know

46
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,440
the kind of face
you're making right now?

47
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,080
What kind of face?

48
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
A pathetic face.

49
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
An insecure face.

50
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,960
A mopey face.

51
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,240
Look at me.

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,480
I failed my interview today,

53
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:44,720
but do I look mopey?

54
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,120
I am.

55
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,800
Of course, I'm upset!

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,880
I even thought about just quitting!

57
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:08,044
You're not allowed to leave.

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,400
None of you are allowed to leave.

59
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,480
No one is changing Spring Sea.

60
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,640
I just don't get it.

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are you holding on so tight?

62
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,040
People leave,

63
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,600
and hotels change.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,880
What are you trying to hold on to?

65
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,467
Because...

66
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:47,333
Spring Sea is proof

67
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,040
that my mother existed.

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,520
It holds all the memories

69
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
we shared together.

70
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,440
If Spring Sea disappears,

71
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,880
all of that will be gone too.

72
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,880
But I can't save the hotel or you guys.

73
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm so useless.

74
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
I can't even protect the one thing

75
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
I want to protect most.

76
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,720
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,800
It's not your fault.

78
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
No one will be able

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,080
to take away what you want to protect.

80
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,200
I won't let them!

81
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,560
What's with that look?

82
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,440
Morning.

83
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
Why are you staring at me like that?

84
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,840
There was a little mouse
in the room last night.

85
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,400
It kept grinding its teeth.

86
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,640
I couldn't sleep.

87
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,440
There are mice here?

88
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,200
Yes.

89
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
And that little mouse
not only ground its teeth,

90
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:14,955
it also snored the whole night.

91
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:17,666
Sorry about that.

92
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't sleep well

93
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,280
in new places.

94
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,520
I don't mind.

95
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,640
It was kind of cute.

96
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,680
I don't like being called cute.

97
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,688
Then I won't tease you about it.

98
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
What's the plan for today?

99
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,000
Let me think.

100
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,640
Maybe we should cancel
all of our plans for today!

101
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,777
I'll teach you a lesson for tickling me!

102
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
A meeting at the bank

103
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,955
tomorrow at 10 AM
requires your attendance.

104
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,440
Got it.

105
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,680
How's the situation at Spring Sea?

106
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,360
Public opinion has calmed down a little,

107
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:58,044
but this incident has definitely hurt
Spring Sea's reputation.

108
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
There's one more thing.

109
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,360
Go on.

110
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,440
TY is currently in the process
of acquiring Spring Sea.

111
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,320
What?

112
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,720
TY is acquiring Spring Sea?

113
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,200
When did this start?

114
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,170
Just the last few days.

115
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,466
The details are still unclear,

116
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,400
but the acquisition
is moving forward quickly.

117
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,240
Both sides appear to be
very cooperative.

118
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,780
I don't believe he would
hand over Spring Sea that easily.

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
There's no way it's that simple.

120
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,280
Do you think Mr. Lin Jr. is settling
a personal score?

121
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,960
Are you tired?

122
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,720
No.

123
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,880
I feel wide awake.

124
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:47,755
Right. Let me ask you something serious.

125
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
How was your experience last night?

126
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,400
Here?

127
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Isn't this the wrong place
to talk about that?

128
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,560
It's fine.

129
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,160
Don't hold back.

130
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,760
Just say what you think.

131
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Well...

132
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
The drive was good,

133
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,520
but the endurance could use some work.

134
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
What about you? How did you feel?

135
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,520
I didn't enjoy it.

136
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,560
You didn't?

137
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,280
Why are you so worked up?

138
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,400
Did you enjoy it?

139
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
I guess not!

140
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,160
It was an awful experience.

141
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,290
I'm giving it a bad review.

142
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,840
Looks like

143
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,920
we had the exact

144
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,320
same experience.

145
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Doesn't your throat feel dry?
Feeling a bit uncomfortable?

146
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,970
The room should maintain a consistent
temperature and humidity level.

147
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:56,822
Each room should be equipped
with a humidifier.

148
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,240
So the experience you were talking about

149
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,600
was the hotel stay?

150
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,690
What else did you think
I was talking about?

151
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
So, what's this about

152
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,200
the endurance issue?

153
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,222
I was talking about
the room service robot.

154
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,240
What kind of hotel did you book for me?

155
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:21,800
I couldn't even find a single person.

156
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:22,960
I spent half my stay

157
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,200
trying to figure out
how to work the gadgets.

158
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
Even flushing the toilet

159
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
required pressing a bunch of buttons.

160
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,880
I just want a peaceful stay,
but everything's such a hassle.

161
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm not like you young people.

162
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,760
Book me a different hotel tomorrow!

163
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,080
Sir.

164
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,840
You didn't enjoy your stay here?

165
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Enjoy?

166
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,160
This place has only robots

167
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,160
wandering around.

168
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,960
I couldn't even find a real person.

169
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm old.

170
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,600
I can't keep up with modern technology.

171
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,640
Then why did you stay here?

172
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
My son thought

173
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,960
that since I've finally retired

174
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,480
and I'm still able to get around,
I should travel while I can.

175
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,560
I have no idea what he was thinking

176
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,080
when he booked this hotel.

177
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,640
He wanted me to experience something

178
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,960
"futuristic."

179
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,320
But look!

180
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,360
I just barely learned
how to use mobile payments,

181
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,200
and now hotels are self-service.

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm old.

183
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:29,466
It's only going to get harder
to keep up with things from here.

184
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,880
Lin Youjia!

185
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,577
I underestimated you.

186
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Are you insane?

187
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
I can't believe

188
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
you're such a petty man!

189
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,160
That hurt!

190
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,239
You can't get Yi Ran,
so you're going after Spring Sea?

191
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,720
Let go!

192
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,440
Do you really think
using such dirty tricks

193
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
will make Yi Ran want to be with you?

194
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:54,760
- Let go!
- Bah!

195
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,444
I must have been blind to actually have...

196
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:57,160
Enough!

197
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,000
What did I do?

198
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,133
My father's the one who did all of this.

199
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,920
Why are you guys blaming me?

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,920
What? Trying to shift the blame?

201
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,840
As if you had nothing to do with it.

202
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,240
I'm telling the truth.

203
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,800
I couldn't secure
the investment agreement,

204
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,520
so my dad stripped me of my authority.

205
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,880
We even had a huge fight over it.

206
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,844
It's one thing for that God of Plague
to give me trouble.

207
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,320
But you too?

208
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,280
My hair... My eye...

209
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Well, you didn't say anything.

210
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:37,600
Here's your hair back.

211
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,960
I'm sorry. I acted impulsively.

212
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,280
It's fine.

213
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,680
I underestimated your strength.

214
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,200
I wasn't on guard.

215
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
I wonder how they're faring.

216
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,920
Don't worry.

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,920
Although my dad came prepared,

218
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,720
based on what I know
about that God of Plague,

219
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,800
he's not the type
to sit back and take a hit.

220
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,840
You should help come up with a solution.

221
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,120
What can I do? It's not my company.

222
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:12,720
And why would I help

223
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,360
that God of Plague anyway?

224
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,520
I'm sorry, sir.

225
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,760
Your card has been declined.

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,880
Try this one.

227
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,960
Very well.

228
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,280
My apologies. It was declined too.

229
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,600
I'll pay.

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,560
I can't believe him!

231
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,920
That old man even cut off my finances!

232
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,980
If he's going to be heartless,
then I won't hold back.

233
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,160
I'm getting him back for this.

234
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
Smart hotels do have their advantages,

235
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,880
but they're not perfect.

236
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,120
Young people pick things up fast

237
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,760
and they're open to new things.

238
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,880
High-tech stuff appeals to them.

239
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,480
But for most elderly people,

240
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,960
an overly automated hotel

241
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,440
actually becomes a barrier.

242
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,400
Exactly.

243
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,920
The issue of an aging population
can't be ignored.

244
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,800
Hotels shouldn't just cater
to young customers.

245
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,360
Older guests deserve consideration too.

246
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,000
You're right.

247
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,360
How can cold, unfeeling robots

248
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,040
provide warm service?

249
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,360
And don't you think the beds there

250
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,480
weren't as comfortable
as the ones at Spring Sea?

251
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,520
Totally.

252
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,280
Spring Sea's beds are
on a whole different level of comfort.

253
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,480
And the pillows too.

254
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,760
A few days ago,
several guests even asked me

255
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,720
what brand of pillows we use

256
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,960
and where they can buy them.

257
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,520
Maybe this could be
a business opportunity?

258
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,840
You mean

259
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,480
selling Spring Sea's signature

260
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,639
mattresses and bedding?

261
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,160
That's it.

262
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,520
If people could enjoy

263
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,040
a five-star hotel experience at home,

264
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:45,400
I bet a lot of people
would be willing to pay for it.

265
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,880
Who wouldn't want a good night's sleep?

266
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,600
We could even open an online store

267
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,520
and sell all kinds
of Spring Sea-branded products.

268
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,120
Slippers, towels, bathrobes,

269
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,080
and toiletries.

270
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,840
The hotel rooms would double

271
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,560
as offline experience centers.

272
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,480
Guests could try things out in the room,

273
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,140
and then order them
straight to their home

274
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,000
with free shipping.

275
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,960
Turn the hotel into a showroom.

276
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,888
Transform the traditional business model

277
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,960
into accommodation and e-commerce.

278
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
That's a brilliant idea!

279
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,400
Did we just find our breakthrough?

280
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
More than just a breakthrough.

281
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,880
Yi Ran,

282
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,560
this idea might be the key
to Spring Sea's success.

283
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,760
Yes?

284
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,400
Boss! Bad news!

285
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,222
The board just announced
that the official signing with TY

286
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:37,555
is happening tomorrow at 9 AM!

287
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,520
You need to hurry back!

288
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,760
Noted.

289
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,200
What's wrong?

290
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,160
They're signing the contract

291
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,160
at 9 AM tomorrow.

292
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:54,880
There's still time.

293
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,920
You drive.

294
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,920
You handle the road.

295
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:20,280
You handle the proposal.

296
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,280
Elevator overload.
Please take another elevator.

297
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,600
It's almost time.

298
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,720
Let's begin.

299
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:58,911
After several rounds of discussions,
the board has reached a consensus

300
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,920
on TY Group's proposal

301
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,800
to manage Spring Sea Resort Hotel

302
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,400
under a win-win cooperation model.

303
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,160
The signing ceremony will now begin.

304
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,266
Please do the honors,
Chairman Xiao and Mr. Lin Sr.

305
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,440
I object!

306
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,280
Mr. Lin Sr.

307
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,560
We have matters to discuss.

308
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,480
Please step out for a moment.

309
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:33,600
Mucheng, this is no time for games.

310
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,040
Do you even know your place here?

311
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,088
You're in no position
to oppose this decision.

312
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
Is this how you treat your guests?

313
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,280
Chairman Xiao.

314
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:42,680
Just give me ten minutes.

315
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
I only need ten minutes.

316
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,320
Xu Hang,

317
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
take Mr. Lin Sr.
to the lounge for some tea.

318
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Xiao.

319
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,400
It's fine.

320
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,320
I'll just take a short break.

321
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,680
Everyone,

322
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,440
I'll keep this short.

323
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,311
It's just a few minutes of your time.

324
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,480
The contract with TY
includes a bet-on clause

325
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,080
that requires Spring Sea
to go public within three years.

326
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:20,760
Three years isn't a long time.

327
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,720
There are a lot of variables at stake.

328
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
The current market is unpredictable.

329
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,580
If Spring Sea faces losses
year after year,

330
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,640
I'm sure everyone here
will feel the consequences.

331
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,440
And when the power is no longer

332
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,800
in our hands,

333
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,600
do you think you'll still be sitting
in these seats?

334
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,480
Now,

335
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,840
let's talk about the smart hotel issue.

336
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
Let me show you a picture.

337
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,800
This elderly man

338
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,720
was a guest at one of the smart hotels

339
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,000
we researched.

340
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
Self-check-in and self-service dining.

341
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,560
All of these so-called "conveniences"

342
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,120
were extremely difficult

343
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,400
for him.

344
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,800
In China, there are 280 million people

345
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,160
over the age of 60.

346
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,160
That's an incredibly powerful
consumer demographic.

347
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,640
However, this demographic

348
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,680
is entirely at odds
with the concept of smart hotels.

349
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
Smart hotels

350
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,160
can reduce labor costs by up to 90%,

351
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,000
but future upgrades

352
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,320
and system iterations

353
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,000
will require significant investment.

354
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,360
It could even become
an uncontrollable expense.

355
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,520
And smart hotels are highly replicable.

356
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,200
If this trend continues,
hotels will lose their personal touch,

357
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,720
and the industry will become
a ruthless game of capital.

358
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,120
We are all well aware
of the points you raised.

359
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
But running a business
isn't charity work.

360
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,844
The hotel has been losing money
year after year.

361
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,960
Making a profit is what matters most.

362
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,240
I have a feasible solution.

363
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,480
We can leverage the Spring Sea brand

364
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,800
to create an experience center

365
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,920
and launch a new business model

366
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,280
that combines accommodation
with e-commerce.

367
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,320
Based on market research,

368
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,680
Spring Sea Hotel offers
a better guest experience

369
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,720
than other brands.

370
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:03,866
This is thanks

371
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:06,040
to Spring Sea Hotel's meticulous service

372
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,720
and the exclusive bedding

373
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,280
it has supplied for over 20 years.

374
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,560
That's one

375
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,200
of the main reasons

376
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
guests choose to return.

377
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:17,600
Please direct your attention
to my project proposal.

378
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,640
Chen Mo.

379
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,480
Last year, our total sales
were 100 million yuan.

380
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,400
After deducting all expenses,

381
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,520
our profit margin was 20%.

382
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,240
But if we combine online

383
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
and offline promotions,

384
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,311
we could match last year's total sales

385
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,800
in just three months.

386
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,800
Mucheng.

387
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,840
I know you're capable,

388
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,840
But claiming you can hit

389
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,400
last year's revenue
in just three months?

390
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,560
Isn't that a bit overconfident?

391
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,960
I only need three months.

392
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,320
How did it go?

393
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,680
I knew it.

394
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,320
It won't work without my support.

395
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,640
I practically ran my legs off
and still showed up late.

396
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:24,911
Why are you still sitting here?

397
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,960
We did it.

398
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:29,520
Don't try to comfort me.

399
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:31,622
Why are you sighing if we succeeded?

400
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,640
I'm sighing

401
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,560
because the next three months

402
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,320
are going to be busy.

403
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,800
Seriously?

404
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:43,511
The contract signing has been
pushed back three months.

405
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,422
We've got another shot
at turning this around.

406
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,840
We did it!

407
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,600
Keep up!

408
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,080
You said it would all work out.

409
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,440
Lin,

410
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,000
the board doesn't listen to just me.

411
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,400
Calm down.

412
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,560
It's just three more months.

413
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:19,400
What are you worried about?

414
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,600
You'd better make this work.

415
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:23,960
You know what the consequences
will be if you don't.

416
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,120
Relax.

417
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,880
That duck is practically cooked.

418
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,280
Keep doing what you're supposed to.

419
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
I don't want any surprises.

420
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,920
Yes, sir.

421
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,640
Did something else come up?

422
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,760
No.

423
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,240
Did you eat yet?

424
00:25:57,644 --> 00:25:58,880
Come with me and grab a bite.

425
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm not going unless you tell me.

426
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,760
Our previous clients have made it clear

427
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,520
they won't work with us anymore.

428
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Online public opinion
hasn't calmed down.

429
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:16,280
The PR department released a statement,

430
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,920
but it's not helping.

431
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
I think we need help.

432
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,960
First, the God of Plague threatened me.

433
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,960
Then Ling Yishu pulled my hair

434
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,880
and poked my eye.

435
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,711
And now you're falsely accusing me too!

436
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,560
I...

437
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,920
Calm down.

438
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,720
I swear on Lin Youjia's hair.

439
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
He had nothing to do with this.

440
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,160
I know it's not your fault.

441
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,960
I'm asking

442
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,320
if you could get your dad
to stop meddling.

443
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:46,888
Why does it have to be Spring Sea

444
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,320
out of all the hotels?

445
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,640
So from the start, you partnered with us

446
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,520
just to take over our hotel?

447
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,680
Well, I might as well
be honest with you now.

448
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:57,880
In the beginning, my mission
was to invest in your hotel

449
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,280
and get you to sign that contract.

450
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:01,444
As for what's going on
in my dad's mind,

451
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:02,333
I'm clueless.

452
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,040
Besides, I've already been sidelined.

453
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:05,360
All my cards have been frozen too.

454
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:06,800
What more do you guys want from me?

455
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,720
We want to ask for your help.

456
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,520
With that?

457
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,280
What? You...

458
00:27:17,644 --> 00:27:19,600
You're asking me
to sabotage my own father?

459
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,960
That's... going too far.

460
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,160
The one going too far is him.

461
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,200
Think about it.

462
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,590
Not only does he look down on you,

463
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
he's also set you up.

464
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,360
Now he's cut off your credit cards

465
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,840
and left you to fend for yourself.

466
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,760
It's like

467
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,440
you don't even exist to him.

468
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,180
All we're asking is for you to stop him
from taking over Spring Sea.

469
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,360
Even if you fail,

470
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,880
you've got nothing to lose.

471
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm begging you.

472
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm begging you, please don't beg me.

473
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,080
Why are you begging him?

474
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,000
I...

475
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,760
Then I'll beg you.

476
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,720
Help! Why are you all doing this to me?

477
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,040
Will you help us or not?

478
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,280
I don't get to make that call.

479
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
My dad owns the company.

480
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,240
How can I use his company to help you?

481
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:12,022
Having said that,

482
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:14,933
I can use someone else's company.

483
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,400
That's right.

484
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Isn't PR

485
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,480
Bright Platinum's forte?

486
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,480
We're strategic partners
with Spring Sea.

487
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,120
Helping them means helping us.

And this is a full report on Deman.

518
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,200
I've already shared it with Mr. Xiao.

519
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,360
You did well. Good work.

520
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,220
(Three months later)

521
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,280
Guys, look!

522
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,640
Gao Xu shared our post too!

523
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,680
She did!

524
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,260
(Spring Sea Hotel Promotional Copy)
This is a free endorsement from her!

525
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,080
Look at the number of shares
and comments!

526
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,960
This wave of publicity
really maxed out our exposure!

527
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,040
This is amazing!

528
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:57,800
Let me read it.

529
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,666
Xiao Mucheng has made some progress

530
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
these past few months,

531
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:02,960
but everything is still
within our control.

532
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,400
I heard the public opinion
around Spring Sea is shifting.

533
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:10,155
Rest assured, Mr. Lin Sr.

534
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:11,400
The deadline is almost here.

535
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,520
There's no way

536
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
they'll turn the tables.

537
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm not looking for confidence.

538
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,480
I want a sure win.

539
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,440
I've waited for 20 years for this.

540
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,760
This time,
I will reclaim everything I lost.

541
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,520
Understood.

542
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,200
We will acquire Spring Sea.

543
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,700
(Spring Sea's Quarterly Online Sales)

544
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,220
(Offline Sales Revenue)

545
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:00,160
How much are we still short?

546
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:07,280
I have two friends
who run travel agencies.

547
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,000
Thanks.

548
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,240
You guys have already helped me enough.

549
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,320
Xiao Mucheng.

550
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:16,422
What happened to all that arrogance?

551
00:32:17,844 --> 00:32:19,660
I already helped you
sabotage my own father.

552
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,120
Are you going to give up now?

553
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,800
After everything we've done,

554
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,040
if you quit now,

555
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,160
all our efforts
will have been for nothing.

556
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:29,111
It's not something that can be fixed

557
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,240
with a couple of orders

558
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,720
or a few friends.

559
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,520
We're out of time.

560
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,000
Forget it.

561
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,760
Game over.

562
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,200
You must be disappointed in me.

563
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,120
No.

564
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,440
I think

565
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,800
it's impressive that we managed

566
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,080
to make it this far.

567
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,240
Maybe...

568
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,040
There are no maybes.

569
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,560
For him,

570
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,200
losing even a single yuan
is unacceptable.

571
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,360
I don't know what else to say,

572
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,080
but I know

573
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,240
we'll figure something out.

574
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,800
I almost forgot.

575
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
I have a gift for you.

576
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,440
What is it?

577
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,240
My heart.

578
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,400
Don't underestimate this heart.

579
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,600
It carries

580
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,560
all the hope and strength
you've given me.

581
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,920
I used to think

582
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,520
I was someone

583
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,400
life had abandoned.

584
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,960
But after meeting you,

585
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,560
I found a stable job,

586
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,440
met a group of amazing friends,

587
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,000
and my once gloomy life
finally lit up again.

588
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,000
Now,

589
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,160
I'm entrusting this heart

590
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,040
to you.

591
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,440
Can you feel it?

592
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,080
That's right.

593
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,080
Nothing is certain.

594
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,680
As long as we don't give up today,

595
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,200
there will always be hope tomorrow.

596
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
Thank you.

597
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,080
For what?

598
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,080
For everything.

599
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm the one

600
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,400
who should be grateful.

601
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,840
Thank you for coming into my life.

602
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,600
All the numbers are trending upward now.

603
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:55,280
Our e-commerce business
has broken even

604
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,644
after the initial investment.

605
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,800
But we're still
a little short of the target.

606
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,280
Looks like the outcome is set.

607
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:03,288
Maybe that's for the best.

608
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,333
Chairman Xiao...

609
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,760
I know what you want to say.

610
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,680
Spring Sea is something
his mother and I fought hard for.

611
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:11,488
Of course, it's hard for me to let go.

612
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,600
But times have changed.

613
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,280
The phones people use,

614
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,290
the houses they live in,
and the cars they drive...

615
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,640
They're all changing every day.

616
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,360
Even values are changing.

617
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,200
If you don't want to be left behind,

618
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,760
you have to keep moving forward.

619
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,480
I don't deny his efforts,

620
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,040
but it's time for him to admit defeat.

621
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,200
He needs to learn to face reality
and take responsibility.

622
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,840
I can protect him for now,

623
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,680
but not for a lifetime.

624
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,240
He'll understand
your good intentions someday.

625
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,640
I can feel

626
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,680
my health getting worse day by day.

627
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,360
I'm getting old.

628
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:58,680
Sometimes it's better to let go
than to try to figure everything out.

629
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,880
If losing Spring Sea helps him grow,

630
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,760
then this business loss
will be worth it.

631
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Chairman Xiao.

632
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,844
Mr. Yu and his wife's
golden wedding anniversary banquet

633
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:11,777
is about to start.

634
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,040
Got it.

635
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,600
Thank you, everyone.

636
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,320
Thank you for taking the time

637
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,280
to attend Lianru
and my golden wedding anniversary.

638
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,960
Life is long,
but the years go by so fast.

639
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,120
In the blink of an eye,
decades have passed.

640
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,560
I still remember
when we first got married,

641
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,880
having a sewing machine at home

642
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,240
was considered a luxury.

643
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,400
That's why

644
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
we didn't have a proper wedding

645
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,520
until 30 years later.

646
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,880
(Blessed Fortune)
Does it look right?

647
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,511
It's perfect.

648
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,600
Be careful.

649
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,320
Bohan.

650
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,840
Let's hold another wedding here

651
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,200
30 years from now.

652
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
30 years?

653
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,777
Who knows if the hotel
will still be here in 30 years?

654
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,511
I'm sure it'll still be here.

655
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,360
Because this is our home.

656
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,080
Yes, this is our home.

657
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,160
Coming back here after 20 years

658
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,520
feels like returning to the past.

659
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,560
I want to take this opportunity

660
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,360
to say a few words to my wife.

661
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:41,600
Thank you for choosing

662
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,480
to marry me,
a poor boy, all those years ago.

663
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,320
No matter how hard life got,

664
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,480
you never complained.

665
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,840
You always give me your trust
and encouragement.

666
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,960
(We've been through)

667
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
(difficult times together)

668
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,280
(and countless important moments.)

669
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,840
Thank you for your patience
and understanding

670
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,640
over the past 50 years.

671
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,320
Thank you

672
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,440
(for sticking by me)

673
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,880
(through thick and thin.)

674
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,360
(Thank you)

675
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,720
(for wanting to spend
the rest of our lives together.)

676
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,320
I'm grateful to have you in this life.

677
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Take your medicine, Mei.

678
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,400
Here.

679
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,960
You should rest.

680
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,480
Here.

681
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,400
Get some rest.

682
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Bohan...

683
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,840
Meeting you

684
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,120
has been

685
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,000
the greatest blessing of my life.

686
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,080
I'm sorry

687
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,280
I have to leave now.

688
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,720
I can't stay with you guys any longer.

689
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,320
I don't want to leave...

690
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,960
You have to take care

691
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
of Mucheng and Spring Sea

692
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,400
for me.

693
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,920
Look after them

694
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,760
for me.

695
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,880
Mei.

696
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,080
Mei.

697
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,080
Don't think like that.

698
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,400
Promise me.

699
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,320
Promise me, please?

700
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,520
I promise you.

701
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,240
Back then, it was thanks
to Bohan and Su Mei's help

702
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,880
that we were able
to have a proper wedding.

703
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,520
Now, I'd like to invite my dear friend,

704
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,680
and the one who officiated our wedding,
Mr. Xiao Bohan,

705
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,600
to come up and say a few words.

706
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,720
Wonderful.

707
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,400
This is wonderful.

708
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,440
Truly wonderful.

709
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,200
First of all,
I'd like to congratulate Yu and Lianru.

710
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,200
To stay together as a couple

711
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,120
and walk hand in hand for 50 years

712
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,760
is a remarkable feat.

713
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,160
I'm very...

714
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,520
Very envious.

715
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,520
Today, I learned for the first time

716
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
that the dream
Su Mei and I couldn't fulfill

717
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,120
all those years ago

718
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,200
has now come true
for thousands of families

719
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,320
through Spring Sea.

720
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,680
It reminds me

721
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,520
of the old days.

722
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,840
Of those precious memories
from the past.

723
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,280
And...

724
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,520
And...

725
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,880
My wife, Su Mei,

726
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,240
who left me so many years ago.

727
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,920
Thank you.

728
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,120
Today has been

729
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:09,560
a joyous occasion for everyone.

730
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,680
All right.

731
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:14,840
I'll see you around.

732
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:15,760
Goodbye.

733
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,440
- All right.
- Goodbye.

734
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,800
Chairman Xiao,
I have something to say to you.

735
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,600
Dad, where's Mom?

736
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,240
Your mother isn't coming back.

737
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,560
Let's go home.

738
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,800
I want my mom!

739
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:40,480
Let's go home.

740
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,720
I want my mom...

741
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,000
