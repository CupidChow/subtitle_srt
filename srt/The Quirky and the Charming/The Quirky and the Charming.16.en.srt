2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,880
Ms. Gao,
the contract has been sent over.

4
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,240
Do you need to confirm it?

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,200
You can handle it.

6
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,840
I wasn't that interested
in this event, to begin with.

7
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,440
Ran!

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,720
It's a celebrity!

9
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,280
Come on!

10
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:40,422
If it weren't
for supporting domestic brands,

11
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,190
I wouldn't have compromised
on so many terms.

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
I understand.

13
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,560
Who's that?

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,120
Gao Xu.

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,760
She used to be a superstar.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,840
Gao Xu...

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
I think I've heard of her.
Was she an actress?

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,880
She was a triple threat.
Acting, singing, and dancing.

19
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:00,222
I told my mom
that she's staying at our hotel,

20
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:01,200
and she was so excited!

21
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:02,955
She was my mom's idol
when she was young.

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
Serious talk, Ran.

23
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,511
How's the preparation
for the assessment going?

24
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:11,240
Still thinking about it.

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,600
What's there to think about?

26
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:15,288
You're not thinking
about leaving, are you?

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,600
No.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
I just think part-time work

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
isn't so bad.

30
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,888
There's more freedom, you know?

31
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,288
Hurry up and finish. Then we'll eat.

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
Ran, we're having Chinese food.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,955
Why are you using a knife and fork?

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,520
Just wanted to try it.

35
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,822
(Mucheng has been using a knife and fork
since he was a child.)

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,640
And you?

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360
Gao Xu, keep soaring!
We'll always be behind you!

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,880
Gao Xu, keep soaring!
We'll always be behind you!

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
Gao Xu, keep soaring!
We'll always be behind you!

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,080
Hello, everyone.

41
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,680
We'll always be behind you!

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
Next, let's give
a warm round of applause

43
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,520
to welcome Meilian Workshop's
Brand Ambassador,

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,040
Ms. Gao Xu!

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,120
Great!

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,720
Hello, everyone.

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720
I've been using

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Meilian's products for many years.

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,360
It's an honor to represent this brand.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
I hope you will support Meilian

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,200
the way you've supported me.

52
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
Thank you, everyone.

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,120
Great!

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,280
Yes.

55
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,560
As a 20-year-old

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,560
Chinese brand,

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,040
Meilian Workshop shares
the same irreplaceable charm

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,320
as our ageless goddess, Ms. Gao Xu.

59
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,840
Now, let's have Ms. Gao Xu

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
join the organizers

61
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,520
and fans

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
for a group photo.

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,240
Yes!

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,080
Please.

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,520
Come.

66
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,560
Gather round.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
Look here, everyone.

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,120
Look here.

69
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,640
One, two.

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,680
I love you, Gao Xu!

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
Marry me!

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
I love you, Gao Xu!

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,840
Marry me!

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
Don't hurt him!

75
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
(Brand Ambassador)

76
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,080
Boss!

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,760
Boss!

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
Call an ambulance!

79
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,560
Stop shooting!

80
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,920
Boss!

81
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,760
Ran!

82
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,600
It's terrible! Something bad happened!

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,600
What now?

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,320
It's Boss!

85
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,800
He got hit by a billboard!

86
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:33,733
He's covered in blood!

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,160
He's been rushed to the hospital!

88
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Don't exaggerate.

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,880
Think before you speak.

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,160
I'm not lying!

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
It's true! I swear!

92
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,560
I'm telling the truth this time!

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,800
I didn't exaggerate anything!

94
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
Dr. Liu checked the patient's condition.

95
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:53,244
The medical orders have been issued...

96
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:53,720
Miss.

97
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,644
Where's the person
who just got brought in?

98
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,240
The one hit by the billboard.

99
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,060
=The Quirky and The Charming=

100
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,955
The patient sustained severe injuries.

101
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,480
We've done everything we can.

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,760
That's impossible!

103
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,680
How can that be?

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,120
Xiao Mucheng...

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,640
Don't scare me...

106
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
What am I supposed to do
if you leave me?

107
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,600
If you're gone, what will I do?

108
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,120
Ran.

109
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
Is Boss all right?

110
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,760
His injuries were serious.

111
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,955
The bed was covered in blood.

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,360
The doctor said

113
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:15,955
they've done all they can.

114
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,080
No way!

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,960
Boss!

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,080
That's the bed next door.

117
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,520
Why are you crying?

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,920
You're alive?

119
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:44,280
You were hoping I'd die?

120
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,240
Then who's that?

121
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
I heard he got hit by a billboard too,

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,880
but he was less lucky.

123
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
It was a bigger one.

124
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm so sorry.

125
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,440
Is this fan obsession
or attempted murder?

126
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,960
And you.

127
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,520
How could you just rush over

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,560
without thinking?

129
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
Were you worried about me?

130
00:08:20,844 --> 00:08:22,760
I was worried
that if something happened to you,

131
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:24,600
I'd have to look for another job.

132
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,800
What's wrong?

133
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,800
Does it hurt somewhere?

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,160
My head...

135
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,280
Lie down.

136
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,240
I'll get the doctor.

137
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,640
Stop looking at me
with those longing eyes.

138
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,760
I'm not.

139
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,640
Yes, you are.

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,400
See?

141
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,200
For making you worry.

143
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
Do you know how scared I was just now?

144
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
When I saw that blood-stained sheet,

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,520
I really thought it was you.

146
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,200
I didn't care about anything.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
I'll leave.

148
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,680
I'd do anything.

149
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,660
I just need you to be...

150
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,200
I swear

151
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,600
nothing will ever

152
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,520
separate us.

153
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,440
Boss is fine for now.

154
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,880
He just hit his head.

155
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,888
He'll stay in the hospital
for observation.

156
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,520
Ran! Where did you
learn to act like that?

157
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,120
From you guys.

158
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
As long as he's fine.

159
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
If something really happened to him,

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,640
I wouldn't want to keep living either.

161
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Don't jinx it!

162
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
Can't you say
something positive for once?

163
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,440
But it's strange, isn't it?

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
Gao Xu has been

165
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,240
out of the spotlight for many years.

166
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm surprised she still has

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,440
such a massive following
among young people.

168
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,400
What do you mean?

169
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,311
Haven't you seen the news?

170
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
It's already trending online.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,760
It happened so fast.

172
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,700
It hasn't been long since the incident,

173
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,130
but the internet is already flooded

174
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,360
with news about Gao Xu.

175
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,720
Hello.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,920
Who let you touch that?

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,960
I thought that was waste.

179
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
We don't need cleaning. Just leave!

180
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,400
All taken care of?

181
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
Don't you trust me? Where's my money?

182
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,440
The news is everywhere now.

183
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,666
Your artist is set to rebuild

184
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:32,120
her image as a kind and loving idol.

185
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,960
You handled it well.

186
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,280
A die-hard fan's public confession, huh?

187
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,800
That's big news.

188
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,560
That wasn't my arrangement.

189
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,920
You didn't bring that guy in?

190
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,080
What?

191
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,711
So, you guys want
to blow this up even more?

192
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,720
I'll help you with that.

193
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:49,355
What are you looking at me for?
Go after her!

194
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,280
Sorry, Ms. Gao...

195
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,440
Name your price.

196
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Money

197
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
can't fix everything.

198
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,280
Do you realize how much negative impact

199
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,000
your actions have had on our hotel?

200
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,760
Fine. Let me put it another way.

201
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,480
What are your terms?

202
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,360
Do you think I'm trying to extort you

203
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,040
for some kind of gain?

204
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:55,488
At the end of the day,

205
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,560
people are driven by fame and profit.

206
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,440
There's nothing wrong with trying

207
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,200
to secure benefits for yourself.

208
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,440
When I was young, I was just like you.

209
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,400
Sharp and arrogant,
thinking I knew everything.

210
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,520
But when you reach my age,

211
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,720
you'll understand

212
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,080
how valuable opportunities are.

213
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:22,800
You don't need to tell me any of this.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,320
I only have one condition.

215
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,040
You publicly clarify the situation

216
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,280
and apologize to our hotel
and Mr. Xiao.

217
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,320
Apologize?

218
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,400
Little girl,

219
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,520
aren't you being a bit naive?

220
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
Everyone in this industry does it.

221
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,200
Buying popularity,

222
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,280
buying followers,
and buying trending spots.

223
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,680
If they can do it,

224
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,000
why can't I?

225
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,840
These so-called
"social media influencers" these days.

226
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,040
They can't sing or act.

227
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,720
Why are they treated like gods?

228
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,440
Just because they have fans?

229
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,520
Let me tell you.

230
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,840
If you don't fight,

231
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,120
and if you don't scheme,

232
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,160
you'll never make it in this business.

233
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,266
That's just how it works.

234
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,822
That's your business.
It's none of my concern.

235
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,000
But no matter what,

236
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,160
you can't sacrifice others

237
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,680
to gain benefits for yourself.

238
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,740
Mr. Xiao is still bedridden
in the hospital

239
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,440
because he protected you!

240
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm very sorry about that.

241
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,360
I'll make it up to him.

242
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:43,960
And as for all that stuff

243
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
about your industry,

244
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,600
I don't understand it,
and I don't want to.

245
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,280
But I do know

246
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,200
that the people who truly like you,

247
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
they love you for your singing,

248
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
and your acting.

249
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,240
If they knew about everything
you've done behind the scenes,

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,240
and if they knew this is the real you,

251
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,160
they'd be so disappointed.

252
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,960
Is it really worth it?

253
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,488
Whether it's worth it or not

254
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
isn't for you to judge.

255
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,280
You're right.

256
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,440
It's all bought with money anyway.

257
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,760
Who cares?

258
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,760
Ms. Gao.

259
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,560
Let her go.

260
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,133
Something on your mind?

261
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,480
That fan at Gao Xu's event that day...

262
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,760
She paid for him.

263
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,280
Her assistant was settling the payment

264
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
when I caught them.

265
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,160
Do you think

266
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,920
we should expose it?

267
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,440
The news online

268
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,280
is at a peak right now.

269
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
If we release this information now,

270
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,600
it could cause unnecessary trouble.

271
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,760
And

272
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,640
I don't want you to get dragged into it.

273
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,440
They got you hospitalized.

274
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,770
You're just going to let it slide?

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,840
I'll just think of it as a vacation.

276
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,480
Besides, if this hadn't happened,

277
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I wouldn't have known

278
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,040
you cared about me so much.

279
00:17:29,022 --> 00:17:30,160
Then don't get discharged.

280
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
Let me help you extend your stay.

281
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Stop moving!

282
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,840
Stop tickling me!

283
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:50,300
Could you deliver these flowers

284
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,600
to the patient in that room?

285
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,600
Sure.

286
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:53,800
I wish him a speedy recovery.

287
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:16,040
I'll have what she's having.

288
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,040
Got it.

289
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
Of all the empty seats,

290
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:23,244
why are you sitting next to me?

291
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,480
Do I know you that well?

292
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,720
Does it matter where I sit?

293
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,920
Of course not.

294
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
I just don't like
sitting too close to losers.

295
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,880
Enjoy.

296
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,000
Thanks.

297
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Aren't you the same?

298
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,640
But why did you lose?

299
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,080
Don't tell me it's because of me?

300
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,480
What? Scared?

301
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,320
What's there to be scared of?

302
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,720
Don't worry.

303
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't need a man

304
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
to live a fabulous life.

305
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,960
Looks like someone else
has his heart racing.

306
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Boss, let me carry that for you!

307
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,680
Mr. Xiao! I was so worried about you!

308
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,222
While you were in the hospital,

309
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,840
I couldn't eat or sleep properly!

310
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,280
Nothing tasted good!

311
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,720
You couldn't eat because of a toothache.

312
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,240
Well, I was so anxious and stressed.

313
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,800
Stop touching him!

314
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,769
He just got discharged.

315
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,822
The doctor said he still needs
to be monitored closely.

316
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,280
Seems like you guys
aren't busy enough at work.

317
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,240
Oh, right.

318
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,440
Any new updates at the hotel?

319
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,390
We're operating as usual. Don't worry.

320
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:56,711
Gao Xu just announced her retirement
from the industry.

321
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,200
Gao Xu retired?

322
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,155
I heard you announced your retirement.

323
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,120
How old are you?

324
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
27.

325
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
27. How nice.

326
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,360
I remember I debuted

327
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,120
when I was 27 too.

328
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,280
They said I had a sweet voice
and a pretty face.

329
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,560
They crowned me
the "Queen of Sweet Songs."

330
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,120
In just one year,

331
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
I achieved

332
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,200
what others couldn't in years,
even decades.

333
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,560
My concerts were impossible
to get tickets for.

334
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,640
They all said they'd love me forever.

335
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,320
Support me forever.

336
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:06,360
And I believed them.

337
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,120
To maintain everything I had,

338
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,040
I sacrificed love, friendship,

339
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:15,600
and marriage.

340
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,760
And what's left?

341
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
No one remembers me.

342
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,120
If they do,

343
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,520
it's either criticism

344
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,640
or pity.

345
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,400
What they think is their business.

346
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,440
And no one can live in the past forever.

347
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,520
These past few days,

348
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,120
I've been reflecting
on the first half of my life.

349
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,280
I've stood on mountaintops
and admired the view.

350
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,000
I've waded through the mud
at the bottom of the valley.

351
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,244
What else is there to chase?

352
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
Pride?

353
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,760
Not everyone can let go of one's pride.

354
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,400
Humans are peculiar creatures.

355
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,880
Once you figure it out,

356
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,960
letting go becomes instant.

357
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm ready to move forward now.

358
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,000
Today is 4 March, 1986.

359
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,280
I turn 27 today.

360
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Good things will continue to come.

361
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,666
There are as many possibilities
as grains of sand on this beach.

362
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,400
And of course, more people will love me.

363
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,840
But I won't show too much excitement,

364
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,040
or some people might get jealous.

365
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Gao Xu! Gao Xu!

366
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,680
The set's ready!

367
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,800
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

368
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,800
Wait.

369
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,320
Today is 4 March, 1986.

370
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,120
I turn 27 today.

371
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,360
Good things will continue to come.

372
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:43,200
There are as many possibilities
as grains of sand on this beach.

373
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,600
And of course, more people will love me.

374
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,680
But I won't show too much excitement,

375
00:24:50,244 --> 00:24:51,760
or some people might get jealous.

376
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,000
Cut!

377
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,880
Excellent performance, Ms. Gao.

378
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,400
Let's go for one more take.

379
00:25:04,644 --> 00:25:05,644
- Sure.
- All right.

380
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,266
Chairman Xiao,

381
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:34,844
I have something to say to you.

382
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,400
Go ahead.

383
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,040
What's this?

384
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,400
This painting depicts

385
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,360
Camille, The Woman in the Green Dress.

386
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,320
It captures

387
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,040
a defining relationship in Monet's life.

388
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,520
Due to his father's objection,

389
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:53,969
his relationship with Camille
endured many ups and downs.

390
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,800
Even after his father

391
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,000
cut off his financial support,

392
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,640
Monet remained steadfast

393
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,880
in choosing Camille.

394
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,720
This very painting earned him

395
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,520
the admiration
of the French literary giant Zola,

396
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:06,360
which marked a turning point
in his career

397
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:08,800
and eventually won over
his father's approval.

398
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:11,320
Their love finally gained
the blessing of their families.

399
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,600
The reason

400
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,760
we're able to see
this painting 200 years later

401
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,760
is that Monet stayed true
to his feelings.

402
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,520
So, you think you can win my support
for your relationship

403
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,760
with just this painting?

404
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,360
I just want you to know

405
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm not going to give up.

406
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
I admit that there's a big gap

407
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,680
in status

408
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,840
between us.

409
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,840
Go back three generations, and almost
everyone's from humble beginnings.

410
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,000
Also,

411
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,600
I encourage you to spend more time

412
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,800
understanding your son.

413
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,720
Only children

414
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,720
tend to see things
from their own point of view.

415
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm going back to work now.

416
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,520
I'll leave you to enjoy the painting.

417
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:13,866
Chairman Xiao.

418
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,440
The girl's got some nerve.

419
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,280
She actually lectured me.

420
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,280
But what she doesn't know is

421
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,200
Monet's relationship with Camille

422
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,520
only lasted two years

423
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,240
before he moved on to another woman.

424
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,880
She said she's letting go
and moving forward.

425
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,680
Making that choice

426
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,511
couldn't have been easy for her.

427
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,240
I hope every day of her future

428
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,400
is a new beginning.

429
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:45,280
Thank you for staying at Spring Sea.

430
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,750
We look forward to serving you again.

431
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,400
All right.

432
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,880
I'm sure we'll be seeing
each other again soon.

433
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,440
Everyone,

434
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,000
tonight might be my last livestream.

435
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,560
Because...

436
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,240
I'm going home.

437
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,240
"Love on the Wind."

438
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,440
"Zhao."

439
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,640
"Kill You 3,000 Times."

440
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,280
"Late Autumn."

441
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,640
Thanks for being there for me

442
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,040
and supporting me every step of the way.

443
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,200

468
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,680
When I was packing, I realized

469
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,911
there was not much
to take with me after all.

470
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,466
All these years
of struggling and hustling

471
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,960
fit into just one suitcase.

472
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,880
Leaving this place

473
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,720
isn't as hard as I imagined.

474
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,960
Who knows when we'll get

475
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:28,266
to have a drink together again?

476
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:30,222
Let's drink as much as we can tonight.

477
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,400
What?

478
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,160
Trying to get me drunk

479
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,640
so I'll miss my train tomorrow?

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,880
Will you stay, then?

481
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,680
And if I stay, then what?

482
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
When the dream ends, you wake up.

483
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,960
You have to face reality eventually.

484
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,720
Yiyi.

485
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,880
I don't want you to go,

486
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,320
but I don't have the power
to make you stay.

487
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,440
I know better than anyone

488
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,760
how much courage it took

489
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,520
for you to make this decision.

490
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,600
And the only thing I can do

491
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,800
is respect your decision.

492
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,120
Thank you,

493
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,040
Yi Ran.

494
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,280
I'll miss you.

495
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,600
I'll miss you too.

496
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,920
His expression
is definitely not suitable.

497
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,530
Does it hurt somewhere?

498
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,380
Let me help you extend your stay.

499
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,460
Three, two, one.
