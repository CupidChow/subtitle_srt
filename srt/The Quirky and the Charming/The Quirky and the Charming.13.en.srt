=The Quirky and The Charming=

2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,800
How dare you, God of Plague?

4
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,360
How dare you get angry at me
when you flirted with other women?

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,560
I'll beat you up.

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,880
I'll smash your face in.

7
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,480
Die!

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,040
Ran!

9
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
We're in trouble!

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not in trouble.

11
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,040
That's not it.

12
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,000
Boss was bullied by an old man!

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,980
He was slapped so hard
that his face was swollen.

14
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,160
He received his retribution already?

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,960
That's not it!

16
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,040
Who else can bully him besides me?

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,040
Where are they?

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,360
They're at the office.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
No. I have to get some reinforcements.

20
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,222
I mustn't let him bully Ran as well.

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,440
We're in trouble!

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
We're in trouble!

23
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:23,800
We're in trouble!

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,040
What happened?

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,960
Boss got into a fight with a guest.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,044
Yi Ran has already gone there
with reinforcements.

27
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:29,860
Call for backups!

28
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,000
They're at Boss's office.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
How dare they touch our boss? Let's go!

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,680
Don't make me

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,080
repeat what I said.

32
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:38,800
I don't want

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,120
to repeat what I said either.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
How dare you hit our Mr. Xiao?

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,040
Come at me if you dare!

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
Put down the bottle!

37
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,160
No one will touch you under my watch!

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,720
He's the chairman!

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
I don't care! No one can stop me!

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,800
The chairman?

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,160
Dad.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Who are you calling Dad?

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Chairman Xiao.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,920
Sorry about that.

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,400
I didn't know that you were here
for an inspection.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,080
This is a welcome gift for you.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,920
Get out.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Have you eaten?

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,640
Get out!

50
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:14,280
Where's that guy?

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,360
Are you guys done?

52
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,555
- Chairman Xiao.
- Chairman Xiao.

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,720
Chairman Xiao.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,920
This is a misunderstanding.

55
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:24,066
I can explain the situation.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
How?

57
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:27,200
The head of the HR Department is here.

58
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:28,911
Pay her six months' worth of salary.

59
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,330
It's our first encounter.
You don't need to be this courteous.

60
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,110
It's my duty.

61
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,711
Terminate her contract by today.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't let me see her again.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,840
I disagree.

64
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
You don't get to make the call here.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,880
Hurry and go!

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,200
This...

67
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,266
Why don't I leave, then?

68
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:54,844
All of you should leave.

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Chairman Xiao,

70
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
if you insist on sacking Yi Ran,

71
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,800
I'll leave the hotel with her.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,240
Are you sure

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,000
you want to go against me
because of that wild lass?

74
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,720
Her name is Yi Ran.

75
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,880
I won't be your puppet again.

76
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:45,020
=The Quirky and The Charming=

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,320
You really landed me in trouble.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm sorry, Ran.

79
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
I had no idea.

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,755
I've never seen
the chairman before either.

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,360
Forget it.

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,560
I feel like I've seen this scene before.

83
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
Bei Lala was right.

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,200
What did Bei Lala say?

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,520
She said I would encounter

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,822
a huge challenge
that I have never encountered before.

87
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,040
She told me to be prepared.

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,920
This is too huge of a challenge.

89
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,680
Ran, they can't just sack you.

90
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
Mom! Over here!

91
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
Come here!

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,280
Mom...

93
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,120
Stop acting cool.

94
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,440
What have I done?

95
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
I've done my research online.

96
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,760
There's no such thing as liking someone

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,040
just because you're close to them.

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,479
It was just a joke.

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,170
You didn't need
to take it that seriously.

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,120
This is a warning.

101
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Stop using those tricks

102
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
meant for little girls to manipulate me.

103
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,822
Or are you trying to bewitch me
because you think you have no chance

104
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:15,840
of courting Yi Ran?

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,480
Useless guy.

106
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:18,711
Don't even think about it.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,280
I...!

108
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,400
This is the first song for the night,

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,360
"Us."

110
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:25,680
Thank you, everyone.

111
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,760

Why did you park the trolley here?

124
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,360
My dress is dirty because of you.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
Sorry about that.

126
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,880
That's just soap water.

127
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,220
Why don't you take it off?

128
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
I'll clean it for you.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,880
My father bought this overseas,
you know?

130
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,000
You think you can wash it casually?

131
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm going to take a photo
with it later, you know?

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,640
Jiao.

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
Mom! Look at what she's done!

134
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,800
It's just some soap water.
It'll be fine after cleaning.

135
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,560
This clothing cannot be
machine-washed, hand-washed,

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
or dry-cleaned.

137
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,200
Why don't I wipe it for you?

138
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,320
Don't touch me with your filthy hands!

139
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,760
That's rude of you.

140
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,360
Mom, how could you
side with an outsider?

141
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,120
She was the one who dirtied my dress!

142
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,640
If it's necessary,

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,320
I'll process it for you no matter

144
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,040
if you want it dry-cleaned
or hand-cleaned.

145
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,155
If it doesn't work out,
I'll buy another one for you.

146
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,160
But if you keep being unreasonable,

147
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,680
I won't entertain you.

148
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,288
Buy another one for me?

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
Can you even afford it?

150
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
Jiao, forget it.

151
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:54,040
Stop right there!
Did I say you could leave?

152
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Please let go of me.

153
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,644
What kind of attitude was that?
I'm going to complain about you.

154
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:01,333
What's going on?

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
Hello, I'm Xiao Mucheng,
head of Housekeeping Department.

156
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,120
Hello.

157
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
You're the head, huh? Great timing.

158
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:10,520
I want to complain about her.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
What's your name?

160
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,280
My name is Yi Ran.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,600
You want to complain about me, huh?
Suit yourself.

162
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Stop it!

163
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,280
Mom!

164
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,800
(In life, there are certain things)

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,920
(that you knew
you would be disappointed by,)

166
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,880
(yet still longing for them to happen.)

167
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,080
(You thought you would find happiness)

168
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,800
(in those bits and pieces.)

169
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,480
(But what can be found)

170
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,280
(is nothing but helplessness
after extreme grief.)

171
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,200
Hello...

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,480
May I enter the room?

173
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,920
The room isn't cleaned yet.

174
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:53,160
An esteemed guest like yourself
shouldn't be here.

175
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,360
I have a daughter named Yi Ran as well.

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,440
It's been over two decades since we met.

177
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,600
I wonder how she's doing now.

178
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:03,700
It's been over two decades.

179
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,320
That means she's not important to you.

180
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Sorry, madam.

181
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,600
Providing psychological comfort

182
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,880
is not within our scope of work.

183
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,320
Please leave.

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,880
Ran!

185
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,480
I know it's you.

186
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,760
It's all my fault.

187
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:26,133
You mistook me for another person.

188
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
The girl staying in a premium suite

189
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,400
with the luxury dress is your daughter.

190
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,880
Ran, I would never mistake
my own daughter.

191
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,760
It's not that I abandoned you.

192
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,400
The small inn your dad opened

193
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,640
had used up all of our family's money.

194
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
We were in huge debt too.

195
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,920
I had no choice but to leave the family,

196
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,800
Ran.

197
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,040
Enough.

198
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,240
I no longer had a mother

199
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,400
ever since you left the family.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,880
Really? Could you be mistaken?

201
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:13,920
All biological mothers can definitely
recognize their own daughters.

202
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,560
And, judging from Ran's reaction,

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm sure that's the case.

204
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,840
Isn't that dramatic?

205
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,160
It's because you guys are lucky.

206
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,640
Reality is much more dramatic
than TV dramas, you know?

207
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,160
But no matter what,

208
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
I suppose it's a good thing

209
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,040
for her to be reunited with her mother.

210
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,720
But her mother established a new family

211
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,840
and had a child with another man.

212
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,800
No way.

213
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,480
I can never accept that.

214
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,920
She bumped into her biological mother

215
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,800
right after offending the chairman.

216
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
Is Yi Ran experiencing
Mercury retrograde?

217
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,040
Maybe seek Bei Lala...

218
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:48,600
Lu.

219
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,520
It's bad to gossip about people

220
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,040
during work hours.

221
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm full.

222
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm done as well.

223
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,640
Boss.

224
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,480
I'll make a move first.

225
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,120
Lu.

226
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,800
How is it? Isn't it comfortable?

227
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,120
Your technique is professional indeed.

228
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
Of course.

229
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,040
I learned it from a massage expert.

230
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,680
Your father is so lucky.

231
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,800
If only my son

232
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:52,080
were half as sensible as you.

233
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
Vincent is busy with work usually.

234
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,040
If you need anything

235
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,240
or if you wish to go anywhere,

236
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,280
you can find me.

237
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,000
Sure.

238
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,240
By the way,

239
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm free tomorrow.

240
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,080
Tell your parents to join me for a meal.

241
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,688
It's time to talk about
the marriage between you two.

242
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Mr. Xiao, why don't you forget it?

243
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,880
What's wrong? Are you unwilling
to be married to him?

244
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,200
I know you're doing this for our sake.

245
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
But Vincent...

246
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
I don't want to force him.

247
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,600
He's still young.

248
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,400
He hasn't developed
a good foresight yet.

249
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,560
I don't want him
to take the wrong path either.

250
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,560
Since I, Xiao Bohan,
have acknowledged you,

251
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,360
I'll be responsible for your future
until the end.

252
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,160
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

253
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,520
Chairman Xiao.

254
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,840
I have a meeting this afternoon.
I'll head back first.

255
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,600
I'll update you once I confirm the time.

256
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,400
Alright.

257
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,280
Xu Hang,

258
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,040
see Yishu off on my behalf.

259
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,920
No need for that.
My PA is waiting downstairs.

260
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:51,920
You guys can go ahead.

261
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,570
Alright. Remember to tell your parents
about our gathering tomorrow.

262
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:55,133
Alright.

263
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,160
Speak.

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,600
Chairman Xiao,

265
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,240
according to my knowledge,

266
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,000
Gaosheng has no plans
to enter the Chinese market.

267
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,240
But I also found out

268
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
that besides us,

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,160
Beisiman is also in contact with
Bright Platinum Hotel.

270
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,880
Do you think
we should do something about it?

271
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,720
Just leave it to Mucheng.

272
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
I wish to see

273
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,600
the final decision he will make.

274
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, look at her.

275
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,760
She abandoned you for over two decades.

276
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,840
Now, she wants to acknowledge you?

277
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,711
She didn't even stop to think about
how you've been all these years.

278
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
I already disowned her long ago.

279
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,600
What's your next plan?

280
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,720
I have no plans.

281
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,311
I'll avoid her as much as I can.

282
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,560
You see,

283
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:04,755
you're always too stubborn
to admit something.

284
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,920
She's your only kin after all.

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,711
Are you sure you can disregard her?

286
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,160
Madam Qin is my kin.

287
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,920
You're my kin.

288
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,880
My colleagues in the hotel are my kin.

289
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,600
But her?

290
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:23,680
She's not my kin.

291
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,520
Why are you drowning yourself in sorrow

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,240
if she means nothing to you?

293
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Pan Yiyi.

294
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,400
Fine. I'll drop the topic.

295
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,520
Let's drink.

296
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:58,960
What are you doing here?

297
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,640
You kept mentioning
God of Plague just now.

298
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
Coincidentally, he called me.

299
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,640
That's why I told him to come.

300
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:08,640
I have a live stream to do later.

301
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,644
I'll make a move first.

302
00:16:09,688 --> 00:16:10,777
You two can enjoy your chat.

303
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,760
Let me see you off.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
Just forget about me.

305
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,440
By the way,

306
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm entrusting Yi Ran to you now.

307
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,040
You have to look after her.

308
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,480
See you.

309
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,120
Take care.

310
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,160
Goodbye.

311
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:29,311
I've heard about what happened
between you and your mother.

312
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,600
That's terrible.

313
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:32,600
Now, the entire hotel knows about it.

314
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,733
Why don't you take a couple of days off?

315
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,000
Go and take a break.

316
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,422
I'm not the one with
a guilty conscience here.

317
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,760
Why should I avoid her?

318
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,120
Stop drinking.

319
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,133
Mind your own business.

320
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:44,920
Stop drinking.

321
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:46,920
You can leave first.

322
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,520
Let me be alone for now.

323
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,320
Being alone won't help you out.

324
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,120
If you wish to vent your frustrations,

325
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,520
let me take you somewhere.

326
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,160
There's nobody else here.

327
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,600
You can vent your frustrations here.

328
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,760
Go ahead.

329
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:47,920
Stay out of this!

330
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,370
- I'll divorce you!
- Don't touch her!

331
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:49,760
Leave!

332
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,488
- I'll deal with her!
- Don't touch her!

333
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,920
Mrs. Yi!

334
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,240
Dad!

335
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,520
Dad!

336
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,320
Thank you.

337
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,440
I feel much better after that.

338
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:46,960
I don't know whether to console you

339
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
or be envious of you.

340
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:51,422
Envious of me?
You should forget about it.

341
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,040
By the way,

342
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,777
has Chairman Xiao put you
on the spot again after that?

343
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,560
At most, I'll leave the hotel.

344
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,160
Don't offend him again because of me.

345
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,333
Can you bear to leave the hotel?

346
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,040
Of course I can't.

347
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,120
This is the longest job I have had.

348
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
I truly love this place.

349
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,880
In every little 30-square-meter space
called a room,

350
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,480
we keep meeting,

351
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,280
parting, and meeting again.

352
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,680
I don't know since when

353
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,960
I started to look forward to the future.

354
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,240
It's all thanks to you.

355
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
You changed my life.

356
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:46,400
You should wait until
you pass the onboarding assessment

357
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,640
before thanking me.

358
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,088
Didn't Chairman Xiao say
he wanted to sack me?

359
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm here.

360
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,800
Don't worry.

361
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,840
When I cleaned her room,

362
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:08,066
her curtains were closed
even though it was daytime.

363
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
Do all people like her

364
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,933
have to maintain
a little bit of mystery?

365
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
It's because Bei Lala is akin to a god.

366
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,755
Her predictions are ungodly accurate.

367
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,520
But gods are created by humans.

368
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,240
Even gods have emotions and desires.

369
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,400
And, even gods
would be abandoned by men.

370
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,520
Are you saying that Bei Lala
was abandoned by a guy?

371
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,800
Where did you hear this gossip from?

372
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,800
This isn't gossip.

373
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,960
Listen.

374
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,720
It happened three years ago.

375
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,440
I just joined the hotel back then.

376
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
I saw her and a guy
checking into our hotel.

377
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,200
She was older than her ex-boyfriend.

378
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,920
So,

379
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
is Bei Lala returning to our hotel

380
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,120
to mourn her lost love?

381
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,040
That's quite likely.

382
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,480
Speaking of which,

383
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,622
I suppose I'm considered
a witness of her love.

384
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,360
They were madly in love back then.

385
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,520
Even so, they still parted ways.

386
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:11,444
I never expected my female goddess
to be a hopeless romantic.

387
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,880
Ran, are you okay?

388
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,000
Yi Ran,

389
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,120
although we only knew
each other for a short time,

390
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
we're closer than family

391
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,160
even though we're unrelated.

392
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,000
That's right. In the future,

393
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,400
you can treat us as your family.

394
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
Lu, come here.

395
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,720
Let's have a chat.

396
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
Ran, my break time is over.

397
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,960
I have something to do later.

398
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,640
What's going on?

399
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
I don't know.

400
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:53,280
This is the project renovation plan

401
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:54,840
after receiving Beisiman's investment.

402
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,840
You may take a look.

403
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,100
(Evaluation Results
And Improvement Suggestions)

404
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,740
(Market Analysis And Renovation Plan)

405
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,120
If I'm not mistaken,

406
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:09,060
Spring Sea has only
undergone one renovation

407
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,360
in the past 20 years.

408
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,960
The difficulty of the upgrade
and renovation is quite high.

409
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,600
It's quite a huge sum

410
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,120
if we include everything.

411
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,880
The budget provided in this plan

412
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:20,000
should be far from enough.

413
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,990
The upgrade and renovation
don't need to be completed in one go.

414
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,355
We can do them in batches.

415
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
The project proposal
only covers part of it.

416
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,760
Mr. Xiao,

417
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,555
please pardon me for being frank.

418
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,480
Our company's

419
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,640
investment risk assessment
for Spring Sea

420
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,600
is relatively high.

421
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:38,800
Regarding the terms
of the bet we provided earlier,

422
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,760
if you're willing to consider them,

423
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,360
we can make concessions.

424
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,311
If that's the case, we can proceed with
the next step of the deal.

425
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:46,320
What do you think?

426
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,933
I understand your feelings completely.

427
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,600
Investing in a company

428
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,880
is about looking for

429
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,120
long-term and stable returns.

430
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
So whether it's long-term or short-term,

431
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,266
I've already outlined it
in the project proposal.

432
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,360
But there are some parts of the contract

433
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,840
that I cannot accept.

434
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,840
The company also can't approve it.

435
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,000
Mr. Xiao,

436
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,480
why don't you reconsider the contract?

437
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,280
A chance like this

438
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
won't come by often.

439
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,440
Our hotel should establish

440
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,560
a Gossip Department.

441
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,880
You should be its head!

442
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,040
Sorry, Ran.

443
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
We were just concerned about you.

444
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,800
Miss Yi.

445
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:32,480
Chairman Xiao is seeking your help
at the restaurant.

446
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:34,800
I wonder if you're free now.

447
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,600
Me? Are you sure about that?

448
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
Alright. Understood.

449
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,160
How come I always end up

450
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:57,000
being the one
to deal with things like this?

451
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,400
Do I know too much?

452
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,800
I won't be silenced, will I?

453
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,120
Who exactly are we waiting for?

454
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,800
I've invited Yishu's parents.

455
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Our families will have
a meal together today.

456
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:25,800
Sorry, but I can't remain here.

457
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,080
Farewell.

458
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,840
Sit down.

459
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
Finish the meal,

460
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:32,600
and we can talk about the rest later.

461
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,960
Mr. Xiao.

462
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,800
Sweetie.

463
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,240
Ling.

464
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,040
Xiao.

465
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,760
Long time no see.

466
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,890
Long time no see, Mrs. Ling.

467
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,577
Nice to meet you.

468
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,320
Long time no see. Please have a seat.

469
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,888
- Hurry and have a seat.
- Alright.

470
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,600
Have a seat.

471
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,360
Jin.

472
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,955
The guests have arrived.
You may serve the dishes.

473
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:53,400
Alright.

474
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,680
Come.

475
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,240
Have a try.

476
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay.

477
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,360
Mrs. Ling, please try them.

478
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
Okay. Thank you.

479
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:07,720
What are you doing here?

480
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,000
I told her to come.

481
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,222
She's from the Housekeeping Department.

482
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,200
What? Have you changed
the rules of the hotel?

483
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,466
She's just a part-timer.
Her department doesn't matter.

484
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,955
Or are you upset that she's here?

485
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,280
Sorry. She cannot serve us.

486
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,880
It's fine. There are no outsiders here.

487
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,120
Xiao Mucheng.

488
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,977
There are guests here.
You better mind your manners.

489
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
Yi Ran, serve our guests.

490
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,600
Thank you.

491
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,560
Mucheng,

492
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,680
hurry and offer your elders a toast.

493
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,400
Mr. Ling, Mrs. Ling.

494
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,440
Good.

495
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Alright.

496
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,120
Cheers.

497
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,800
I know.

498
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,480
Yishu is willful.

499
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,280
I did spoil her since young.

500
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,800
You have

501
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,680
to keep her in check for me
in the future.

502
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,960
But you mustn't bully her, okay?

503
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,480
Dad, Vincent won't bully me.

504
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,360
Ling, don't worry.

505
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,360
If he dares to bully Sweetie,

506
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,600
I'll deal with him myself.

507
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:12,360
Precisely.

508
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,520
Mucheng is dashing and talented.

509
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,640
He and Yishu are a match made in heaven.

510
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,480
I can rest at ease
if we entrust her to him.

511
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,000
Brainless Shrimp

512
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
for Scum Among Scums.

513
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
That's a unique name.

514
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,560
Yi Ran!

515
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Sorry, everyone.

516
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,800
This dish is Antarctic Deep-Sea Shrimp

517
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,320
Paired with Da's Caviar.

518
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,160
Please enjoy it.

519
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,777
Sorry about that.

520
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,920
I haven't memorized the menu yet
since I'm new here.

521
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,160
This is one of my favorite dishes.

522
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:49,933
You have to eat this with sour cream
for it to taste the best.

523
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,560
Here, have a try.

524
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,800
I can feed myself.

525
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,640
Look at the boy. He's shy now.

526
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,520
Xiao Mucheng,

527
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,088
it's impolite of you to make Yishu
hold the food like that.

528
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,520
I...

529
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,600
What are you doing?

530
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,577
I was testing the dish on your behalf.

531
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,600
It's quite sour.

532
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,240
Hey!

533
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,640
How could you be this rude?

534
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,000
Who's your supervisor?

535
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,400
Come with me.

536
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,680
I'll educate you.

537
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Forget it.

538
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,800
Xiao Mucheng!

539
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:27,222
Come back and sit down.

540
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,800
Dad, this concerns the hotel's image.

541
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,240
We mustn't tolerate such rudeness.

542
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,520
I'll educate her.

543
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:35,640
You guys can go ahead.

544
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,400
Wait!

545
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,680
- Vincent!
- Don't be too harsh.

546
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:38,600
Be patient with her.

547
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,320
It's fine.

548
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,000
Youngsters nowadays

549
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,440
have short tempers.

550
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
Let's continue.

551
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,360
Okay.

552
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,044
Were you meeting her parents?

553
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:57,688
I didn't know about
the situation either.

554
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:00,440
If so, let's clarify
the situation, then.

555
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:02,177
I don't want things to be unclear.

556
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:04,190
There are certain things
you don't understand.

557
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,560
Explain it to me, then.

558
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,200
You...

559
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,360
It's all because of

560
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,680
your ambiguous attitude

561
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,680
that this matter has
become so complicated.

562
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:16,640
I know Chairman Xiao doesn't like me.

563
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:18,822
But we have an honest
and upright relationship.

564
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,440
There's nothing shady about it!

565
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,280
Is it that hard for you
to explain our relationship to him?

566
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,000
Can you give me some time?

567
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:34,377
These are the conditions
brought up by Spring Sea.

568
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
They didn't meet our expectations.

569
00:28:39,044 --> 00:28:40,733
Has Bright Platinum Hotel responded?

570
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:42,288
They rejected the deal.

571
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,480
They're quite resistant
to the proposal

572
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,160
of assigning management

573
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,266
and adding an expert team.

574
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:50,755
That's no surprise.

575
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:55,911
Should we continue to follow up
with Bright Platinum Hotel?

576
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
There's no need to force it.

577
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,520
Right now,
our priority is still Spring Sea.

578
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,280
I think the space for negotiation
is very limited.

579
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,733
If so, let's make it more attractive
and create more possibilities.

580
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:16,920
Mr. Lin Sr. didn't give us much time.

581
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Alright. I'll arrange for it
once I head back.

582
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:26,920
(Ling Yishu)

583
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,360
(Time for you to make an appearance.)

584
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,840
I have to go.

585
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,560
Alright. See you later.

586
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,800
What's wrong?

587
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,888
If there's something, just tell me.

588
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:30,933
I'm really worried about your state.

589
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,160
You should worry about yourself.

590
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,440
Your crush, Ms. Ling,

591
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,711
is getting engaged to God of Plague.

592
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,240
When did that happen?

593
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,400
This afternoon.

594
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,444
I was there to witness it all.

595
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,880
Now, we're like two wounded porcupines.

596
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Why are you wounded?

597
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,160
Don't tell me you were together
with that God of Plague?

598
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,440
It was as if we were together,

599
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:08,440
but the opposite was true as well.

600
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,440
Forget it.

601
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,200
None of it matters anymore.

602
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,160
If so,

603
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:20,040
why don't the two of us,
who are heartbroken,

604
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
form a healing circle?

605
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:27,760
Are all men this casual

606
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,200
toward relationships?

607
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,880
Today, be with this girl.
Tomorrow, be with another girl.

608
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,022
You guys speak irresponsibly.

609
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:35,333
You think everything's over
after a good night's sleep.

610
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:35,960
You...

611
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,200
Did you two actually sleep together?

612
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,920
It was a joke.

613
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,377
How dare you crack a joke like that?

614
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,840
Fine. It's my fault.

615
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm upset as well.

616
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,560
Stop following me.

617
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,640
You see, you're good in every aspect.

618
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,840
But your one flaw is

619
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,880
that you always
take on the pressure alone.

620
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,400
You need to share your burdens
if you love someone.

621
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:19,720
If I wish to retain the hotel,

622
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,320
I cannot fall out with my father.

623
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,640
So what if Yi Ran knows the truth?

624
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,444
She can't do anything about it.

625
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,760
It'll only make her worry.
What's the point?

626
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:34,560
You're worried
that Yi Ran will leave of her own accord

627
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,920
after finding out, right?

628
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,360
Yi Ran knows

629
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,080
how important the hotel is to me.

630
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,240
She'd rather sacrifice herself

631
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,520
so that I could fulfill my dream.

632
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:53,160
That's what I want to avoid the most.

633
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,960
How do you plan to resolve this issue?

634
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,400
Don't forget.

635
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,360
Your time limit is nearing.

636
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,760
When there's a will,

637
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,720
there's a way.

638
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,880
Clean up the shells.

639
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,320
The floor is already cleaned.

640
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,840
Do you have any other instructions?

641
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,200
I didn't mean to do that.

642
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,560
The kettle was placed
at such an inconvenient location.

643
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,400
Please clean it up.

644
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,080
I have plenty of work to do.

645
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,800
I don't have time to waste on you.

646
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,840
If you're upset,
you may complain about me.

647
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,440
What's the point?

648
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,000
You will still resume your work.

649
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,880
Last time, I couldn't take a photo
in my new dress because of you.

650
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:00,640
Mom even lectured me because of you.

651
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,360
Now, I'm going to torment you.

652
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,040
No choice. Customer is king, right?

653
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,666
Have you lost your mind?

654
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,680
If you lack manners,
I'll be your teacher.

655
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,480
You!

656
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,120
Jiao!

657
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,880
Mom, she bullied me!

658
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,400
Mom!

659
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,800
Did you just slap me?

660
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
You've never done that before!

661
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,440
Ran,

662
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,600
I wish to speak with you.

663
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,680
I don't.

664
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,480
We'll head back tomorrow.

665
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,760
I've spoiled Jiao.

666
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,920
Don't hold it against her.

667
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,200
It's great when one has a mother
who spoils her.

668
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,120
Ran.

669
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
If that's all you're trying to say,

670
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,640
you can stop.

671
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,780
I didn't take it to heart anyway.

672
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,560
Wait.

673
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,600
We'll be leaving tomorrow.

674
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,520
We might not return again.

675
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:23,777
You're an expert at leaving
without bidding farewell, aren't you?

676
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,920
You didn't do it 20 years ago.

677
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,440
Now, you may do the same.

678
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,200
I know it's too late for me to say this.

679
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I never fulfilled my duty
as your mother.

680
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,760
I was too selfish.

681
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,080
Ran, I failed to look after you.

682
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,440
I'm sorry.

683
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,400
Can you please stop apologizing?

684
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,155
I don't want to hear any of it.

685
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,440
Ran,

686
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,880
would you please leave with me?

687
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,920
We can

688
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,080
live together.

689
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,800
I'll support you no matter what you do.

690
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,560
Can you please leave with me?

691
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,600
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you to say that?

692
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,520
Ran.

693
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,680
Please give me one more chance.

694
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,840
Just one more chance.

695
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,000
Okay, Ran?

696
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,680
I'm sorry.

697
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,480
It's too late.

698
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,330
Just stand there for now.

699
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,230
I should put the wine down.

700
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,400
Action.

701
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,730
How dare you slap our Mr. Xiao?

702
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,900
Come at me if you dare!

703
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,060
Dad.

704
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,850
Please give me one more chance.

705
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:08,210
Why don't you take it off?

706
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,380
I'll clean it for you.

707
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,440
I'm Xiao Mucheng,
head of Housekeeping Department.

708
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,120
Mr. Xiao.

709
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,910
Sweetie.

710
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,540
See?

711
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,870
You're even getting jealous now.

712
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,920
=The Quirky and The Charming=
