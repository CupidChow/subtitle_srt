2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,120
Where's Yi Ran?

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,680
Does she really not want
to see me one last time?

5
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,000
She asked me to give it to you.

6
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:07,222
Please open it after you get in the car.

7
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Thank you

8
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,520
for watching over her for me.

9
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,880
Thank you.

10
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,120
Take care.

11
00:02:56,767 --> 00:03:01,300
(For Yi Ran)

12
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,420
=The Quirky and The Charming=

13
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,000
(Ran,)

14
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,640
(forgive me.)

15
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,560
(I have never been a good mother.)

16
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,320
(My weakness and selfishness)

17
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,960
(made me incapable
of devoting my life to you.)

18
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,840
(It's not that I didn't try.)

19
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,120
(But in this world,)

20
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
(Name: Zhang Xinmei)
(not everything)

21
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,200
(can be fixed through effort,)

22
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
(especially relationships.)

23
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
(People get married for happiness.)

24
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,160
(Name: Zhang Xinmei)

25
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,440
(It's the same for divorce.)

26
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
(You know)

27
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,280
(your father and I)

28
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,680
(were always fighting back then.)

29
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,320
(I couldn't convince myself)

30
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
(to be trapped)

31
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,920
(in a failed marriage)

32
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,640
(and let it drain both of us.)

33
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
(After the divorce, I had no home.)

34
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,320
(At that time,)

35
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,400
(Name: Zhang Xinmei)
(I had no ability)

36
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,840
(or the courage to take you with me.)

37
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,120
(I won't make excuses)

38
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,560
(for my failures.)

39
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,120
(I won't ask for your forgiveness.)

40
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,840
(But please never doubt
my love for you.)

41
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,880
(The memories of your childhood)

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,240
(have always been engraved in my heart.)

43
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,960
(Your first cries as a baby)

44
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,160
(and your first words
calling me "Mom"...)

45
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,000
(They're my most precious memories.)

46
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
(In my hardest times,)

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
(you helped me overcome)

48
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,840
(one hardship after another.)

49
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,600
(Ran.)

50
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,000
(I've been through it myself.)

51
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,040
(So I know how hard it is for a woman)

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
(to make her way in this world.)

53
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,760
(Please take this card.)

54
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,133
(Use the money however you want.)

55
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,320
(For living, for learning,
or whatever you need.)

56
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,022
(I will always support your decision.)

57
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,360
(Please give me a chance)

58
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
(to make it up for you.)

59
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,760
It looks like you've met your challenge.

60
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,440
Why are you here?

61
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,280
Just getting some air.

62
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:11,844
You're doing the same, right?

63
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,440
With so much space outside,

64
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,920
did you have
to come here to do that?

65
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
From the way you look,

66
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,000
I'd say something's bothering you.

67
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,960
Life, work, and relationships,

68
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,440
all come with struggles.

69
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,440
Sometimes,

70
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,560
they can make you feel powerless.

71
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,160
But as long as you take a step forward,

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,520
you'll realize

73
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,080
that only you can heal yourself.

74
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,640
Ran,

75
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,200
you haven't looked happy

76
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,240
these past few days.

77
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,480
Is work not going well?

78
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,920
No.

79
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,640
No?

80
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,560
Then what's wrong?

81
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,760
I saw my mom.

82
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,200
She's doing well.

83
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,280
She has a new family

84
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
and a daughter now.

85
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,240
Ran...

86
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,120
Don't worry.

87
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm fine.

88
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,480
I always felt like

89
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,640
a heavy weight was pressing on my heart.

90
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,560
But now I finally feel lighter.

91
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,840
It was 2:30 AM,
and she scared people half to death.

92
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,600
Good thing the guest was a young
and healthy person.

93
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
If it was an older one,

94
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,440
they might not have survived!

95
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,177
What are you guys talking about?

96
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,200
Ran,

97
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,200
last night Bei Lala put
a funeral wreath in the hallway.

98
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,640
At 2:30 AM,

99
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,688
the complaint hotline
was ringing off the hook.

100
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
Bei Lala?

101
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
How did she even manage

102
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
to get something that big in here?

103
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,240
She's actually quite pitiful.

104
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:14,222
What happened to her?

105
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,720
Her dream guy is gone,

106
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,111
and as a goddess in people's eyes,
she is abandoned.

107
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:20,511
She won't do something drastic,
will she?

108
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,880
I saw her on the rooftop yesterday.

109
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,800
She said she just wanted some fresh air.

110
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,440
Do you think she wants to...

111
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,600
No way...

112
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:39,488
She won't do something foolish, right?

113
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,360
Bei Lala!

114
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,240
Bei Lala!

115
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Miss Bei.

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
Come down. Let's talk.

117
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,840
Oh, it's you.

118
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,680
You're not just here for fresh air,
are you?

119
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
Yesterday, you told me

120
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,440
to take a step forward,

121
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
and I'd find a solution.

122
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,800
So?

123
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,040
So don't do anything foolish

124
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
because of a man.

125
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Do you think I'm going to jump?

126
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,320
(Three years ago.)
Let's take a set of photos

127
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,720
of the bride and groom right here.

128
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,440
Hello, everyone.

129
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,320
Hi there.

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,000
Hello.

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,133
You're taking photos already.

132
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,880
You're here.

133
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:36,040
You look dashing today.

134
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,360
He does, doesn't he?

135
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,200
Three years ago today,

136
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,080
this was where I met him.

137
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,720
Come and catch me!

138
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,360
If you catch me, you'll get a reward!

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,977
Stop right there!

140
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,040
Jiawei.

141
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,840
Jiawei?

142
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,920
You always trick me.

143
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,640
And then?

144
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,520
He disappeared.

145
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
We never met again after that.

146
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,080
For years, I kept thinking about him.

147
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,840
I even did tarot readings,

148
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,880
imagining he was somewhere close,

149
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,520
breathing the same air

150
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,440
and watching the same sunset as me.

151
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,040
But now, I've decided to let go,

152
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,760
right here where we met.

153
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:42,960
Come in.

154
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:49,400
I thought you didn't want to see me.

155
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
You didn't answer my calls or texts.

156
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
I need your help finding someone.

157
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,240
A wedding planner

158
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,240
who stayed here three years ago.

159
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,600
Why? Did he owe you money?

160
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,640
Mr. Xiao,

161
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,400
this is not the time

162
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
for silly jokes.

163
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,800
I wasn't joking.

164
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,280
That's what your face says.

165
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
So, will you help me or not?

166
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,280
That goes against hotel policy.

167
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,480
I know.

168
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,440
With my position,

169
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:18,550
I shouldn't be asking
about a guest's private matters.

170
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,440
But I really want to help Bei Lala.

171
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,320
That's not something
you should be worrying about right now.

172
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,600
What you should focus on

173
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,760
is preparing for next month's
onboarding assessment.

174
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,600
Hotel service standards say

175
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,120
that when a guest needs help,

176
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
we should do everything

177
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,960
we can to help.

178
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,320
Hotel service standards also say

179
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,880
that when helping a guest,

180
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,200
we must first consider

181
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,880
if it affects the hotel or ourselves.

182
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,880
Do what is within your ability.

183
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,240
So I can't help you.

184
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,640
Do you know why I want to help her?

185
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,000
I want to help her find an answer.

186
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,960
Feelings shouldn't be left so vague

187
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
and unresolved.

188
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,800
Even if the answer

189
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,560
is only a ridiculous excuse,

190
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,480
falling out of love

191
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,920
or never loved at all,

192
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
it should still be clear.

193
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,000
A person who loves sincerely

194
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,560
without holding back

195
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:09,440
shouldn't be the one
who gets hurt the most.

196
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,640
Why is she leaving?

197
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,480
Boss,

198
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
did you fight?

199
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:27,720
Let's focus on work.

200
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
Beisiman just sent their feedback.

201
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,720
They're willing
to add 10% more investment

202
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,280
on top of the original amount.

203
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
But only if the terms remain unchanged.

204
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
What do you think?

205
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,160
I think

206
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,600
it's obviously a good thing.

207
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,240
With your capability,

208
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:52,066
meeting their requirements
within three years

209
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:52,960
should be no problem.

210
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,560
Since you think it's a good thing,

211
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,640
that must mean there's a catch.

212
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,720
What's the issue here?

213
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,200
First, think about what we have to give
to get something in return.

214
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,280
For a company like theirs,

215
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,200
do you really think they'd agree

216
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,280
if it weren't an equal exchange

217
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:17,622
or something even more valuable?

218
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
Do you think
Spring Sea is worth it right now?

219
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,480
Boss,

220
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,680
aren't you being a little too cautious?

221
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,600
With the Chairman still around,

222
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,000
whether our hotel survives or not

223
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,760
is entirely up to you.

224
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,000
Either way,

225
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,080
I don't believe in free lunches.

226
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:38,400
I'll think about it.

227
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,400
Then I'll head out first.

228
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,040
Wait.

229
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:46,977
Look into someone for me.

230
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,240
Who?

231
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,160
A wedding planner from three years ago.

232
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,840
We can start now.

233
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,040
Excuse me.

234
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,000
This dress is way too tight.

235
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,280
Can I change back into my clothes?

236
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
No, it's perfect.

237
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,200
Only in this outfit

238
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
can you really show off your figure.

239
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,133
You can start now.

240
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,280
It can be a flower...

241
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,760
It can be a tree...

242
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,800
This is nothing like my style.

243
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
I'm not like those streamers

244
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,520
who rely on makeup and padded bras

245
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,760
to boost their looks.

246
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,240
I am a singer.

247
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,960
Go on.

248
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,240
Do you take

249
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,040
a singer as a joke?

250
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,760
Girl, take my advice.

251
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,280
Make some money
and gain some followers first.

252
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Once you have both,

253
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,320
you can do whatever you want

254
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,560
and say whatever you like.

255
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,480
These days,

256
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,680
only carnival gifts

257
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,080
are real business.

258
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,040
Everything else is just nonsense.

259
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,200
Come on, let's keep going.

260
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,800
Forget it.

261
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,160
I'd rather have no one listen
to my songs

262
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,440
than sing for people like you

263
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,160
because

264
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,200
you don't deserve it.

265
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,520
Wow, I was being nice,

266
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
and you're acting all high
and mighty now?

267
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,222
If you don't like it, then get lost!

268
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,160
Take off our clothes before you go.

269
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,960
I still have a few songs.

270
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
They're not finished yet.

271
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,920
But I put my heart into writing them.

272
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,680
Please listen to them.

273
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,160
I get hundreds of songs

274
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
like yours every month.

275
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,720
If it's a no, it's a no.

276
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,280
Music takes talent.

277
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
Don't waste your time, okay?

278
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,200
Hello?

279
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:54,777
Mom?

280
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,400
Are you busy?

281
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,760
No.

282
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Did you catch a cold?

283
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,066
Did you take your medicine?

284
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,960
Yes.

285
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:06,000
I know you don't want to hear me nag.

286
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:06,800
But I also know

287
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,520
it's not easy being out there alone.

288
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,177
But look at the girls you age
around here.

289
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:12,400
They are all married.

290
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,720
You're not making money...

291
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,440
Mom,

292
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
can you not talk about this?

293
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,720
You're not making much money,

294
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,755
and you don't have someone
to take care of you.

295
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
Dreams are just a hobby for rich people,

296
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,040
not something ordinary folks

297
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,355
like us can afford to chase.

298
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,480
Hello?

299
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,240
Can you hear me?

300
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,520
Hurry.

301
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:36,320
What's going on?

302
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,360
Miss.

303
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,422
- Are you okay?
- Miss?

304
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,800
Call an ambulance now.

305
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,280
Okay.

306
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,200
- Miss.
- Miss, are you okay?

307
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,040
Hello.

308
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,444
Is this Aijia Wedding Planner?

309
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,222
I'm calling
from Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

310
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,400
I'd like to ask

311
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,440
if you have

312
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,960
a wedding planner named Huang Jiawei?

313
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,440
Huang Jiawei?

314
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:57,740
Never heard of him before.

315
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,880
What about three years ago?

316
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,266
I don't know him.

317
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,990
Are you sure you call the right place?

318
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,520
Sorry for the trouble.

319
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,880
Hello.

320
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,520
Do you know Pan Yiyi?

321
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,440
Yes, I do.

322
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,840
She passed out outside.

323
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,244
Please come to the hospital.

324
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,160
Which hospital?

325
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,880
Central Hospital.

326
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,680
Okay, I'll be right there.

327
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,360
You're up. How are you feeling?

328
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,480
Lie down and don't move.

329
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,120
Where...

330
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,760
Where am I?

331
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,040
You're getting an IV at the hospital.

332
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,760
You passed out by the beach.

333
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,155
The doctor said
you have low blood sugar and anemia.

334
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,960
Have you not been eating proper meals?

335
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,360
I have been taking my meals.

336
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,400
I've just been busy lately

337
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,760
and didn't have time.

338
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
You sing all day at the music restaurant

339
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,920
and stream at night.

340
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,640
You're skipping meals and not sleeping.

341
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,222
Are you trying to ruin yourself?

342
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,120
Yi Ran.

343
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,520
I want...

344
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,880
What?

345
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,360
I want to eat.

346
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,840
I'm hungry.

347
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,440
Now you realize you're hungry?

348
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,680
Just rest.

349
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,240
I'll go get you some food.

350
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Boss, we found the person
you were looking for.

351
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,720
Boss. Boss?

352
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,600
Take me to him.

353
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,310
Thanks for everything
these past few days.

354
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,022
You're welcome.

355
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,560
Welcome to visit us again next time.

356
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:28,560
I will come back.

357
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,440
I've burned my obsession away.

358
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
But the memories remain.

359
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,000
Wait!

360
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,360
I never thought I'd see you here again.

361
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:02,266
You shouldn't have left
without saying goodbye.

362
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,320
I'm sorry.

363
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,160
I didn't want to hurt you.

364
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,480
I didn't want

365
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,360
to drag you down.

366
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:20,933
Not a single day has gone by
during these years

367
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,400
without me thinking about you.

368
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
Do you know how hard

369
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:30,600
these past years have been for me?

370
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,400
You can see that.

371
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,760
I want to hold you.

372
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,280
But I can't.

373
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,680
Do you know what love should look like?

374
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,240
It's when you can't do something.

375
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
But I can.

376
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,360
It'll be okay.

377
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,960
Everything will be okay.

378
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,200
I'll be here with you.

379
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,280
How did you find them?

380
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,440
I searched every wedding company
that worked with the hotel

381
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
three years ago.

382
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,600
But I couldn't find anything.

383
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,360
After a lot of effort,

384
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,240
I finally got in touch with one.

385
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,960
Only to discover
he was never a wedding planner.

386
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
He's Qiao Yu's friend.

387
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,080
They've been in touch all these years.

388
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,880
(Three years ago,)

389
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,880
(Jiawei was diagnosed with ALS)

390
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:47,760
(and cut off contact
with the outside world.)

391
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,560
(He's been relying on medication)

392
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,680
(to slow the progression.)

393
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,800
(But the results haven't been great.)

394
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,320
(A caregiver has been looking after
him all this time.)

395
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,840
Hello,

396
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:07,800
I am Xiao Mucheng, the Head

397
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:10,444
of the Housekeeping Department
at Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

398
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Bei Lala has been waiting for you.

399
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,960
I believe you've been waiting too.

400
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,840
She's leaving today.

401
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,560
Are you willing to see her?

402
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,320
There's nothing to talk about.

403
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,720
We broke up

404
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,240
a long time ago.

405
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,720
I completely understand.

406
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,120
I have someone I care about too.

407
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,280
Sometimes,

408
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:04,520
we make decisions thinking

409
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,840
they're for the other person's good.

410
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,080
But I recently realized

411
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,320
that it's not always what they want.

412
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,866
When two people truly love each other,

413
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,960
they should hold nothing back.

414
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,240
It has been three years.

415
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,440
Bei Lala has been waiting
for your answer.

416
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,360
Why the sudden change of heart?

417
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,200
To the hotel,

418
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,800
securing valuable clients

419
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,800
is what benefits the hotel the most.

420
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,800
Is that really what you think?

421
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,640
If I don't say this,

422
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,560
how would I live up

423
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,355
to the cold-hearted image
you have of me?

424
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,200
By the way,

425
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
there's a resort project.

426
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,080
You should check it out.

427
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,880
You want me to lay low for a while?

428
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
It's a work assignment.

429
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,680
Besides, a lot has happened lately.

430
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,680
You need a break.

431
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,080
I'll handle everything else.

432
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,880
Thank you, Boss.

433
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,920
I never expected things
to turn out this way.

434
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,840
That's exactly why

435
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,760
this proves one thing.

436
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,200
Love is like a ray of light
in the darkness.

437
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,320
When will that light shine on me?

438
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,720
I was hoping Bei Lala would say
a few more words to me.

439
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,480
She did.

440
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,200
She said

441
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,800
your energy is as powerful
as nuclear energy.

442
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:03,520
You're bound to explode with happiness.

443
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
When did she say that?

444
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,439
You're being naughty,
you little mischief.

445
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,977
- Stop...
- You were lying to me, huh?

446
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,777
Stop messing around.

447
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,000
Let's just focus on the meal.

448
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,880
Here you go.

449
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,560
Who is it?

450
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
What are you up to now?

451
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:35,879
You passed by this shop the other day

452
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,400
and said their cheesecake was amazing.

453
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,239
So I got one for you.

454
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,490
- Pretty thoughtful, huh?
- I...

455
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:41,488
I'm busy and don't have much
of an appetite.

456
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,200
Why are you packing?

457
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,920
Did you finally see the true colors
of God of Plague

458
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:52,288
and decide to leave this place
of heartbreak?

459
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:54,160
I'll have your back.

460
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,720
Actually, our hotel and the resort

461
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,066
are collaborating on a project.

462
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:01,590
God of Plague asked me to check it out.

463
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
It's not that simple.

464
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,720
A man knows a man.

465
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,040
It could be a trap.

466
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,400
I'll go with you.

467
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:09,480
Sounds like you're the one
with ulterior motives.

468
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,520
You're at a risky stage right now.

469
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:13,755
I don't trust letting you go alone.

470
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:14,960
How about this?

471
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,920
I'll go pack right now.

472
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,960
I'll see you tomorrow morning. Bye!

473
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,000
I didn't say you could come.

474
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,240
Boss, something happened.

475
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:56,909
Mr. Lin Jr. came to pick Yi Ran up.

476
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,390
He said they were going to the resort.

477
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,800
What?

478
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:02,200
Bring her back right away.

479
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,022
No, that won't work.

480
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,040
Maybe I should go myself?

481
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:13,777
Yes, I'll do that.

482
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,160
Let's go.

483
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,320
Chairman Xiao.

484
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,760
Chairman Xiao.

485
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:23,960
Are you heading out?

486
00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:27,080
I'm going to the resort
to check on the project.

487
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,066
You don't have to go
for something like that.

488
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,040
Just send someone.

489
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,760
Mr. Xiao, just let him go.

490
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,120
Yishu,

491
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,160
your team is also involved

492
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,480
in the resort project, right?

493
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,577
Then you should go together.

494
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,600
Okay.

495
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
We'll be back soon.

496
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,560
Okay.

497
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,377
Chairman Xiao...

498
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,088
Go.

499
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,355
What are you doing here?

500
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,111
The company sent me
to inspect the project.

501
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,044
What is he doing here?

502
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,760
And why is she here?

503
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,720
Oh, hey. We meet again.

504
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,280
This is your solution?

505
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:54,080
Stalling me
while keeping others on the side?

506
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:55,180
I'm not! I'm here for work.

507
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,320
Stop making excuses.

508
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,280
Player.

509
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,240
Me? A player?

510
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,279
I haven't asked you yet.

511
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,666
Why did Lin Youjia follow you here?

512
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,680
Do you even see me

513
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,440
as your boyfriend?

514
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,560
Oh, so I'm your girlfriend?

515
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:12,210
If you were coming here
with God of Plague,

516
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
why didn't you tell me?

517
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
I should be asking you that.

518
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,680
Didn't we agree

519
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:17,120
to update each other on any moves?

520
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,440
What now?

521
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,600
We play it by ear.

522
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,200
Also, don't drag me down.

523
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Same to you.

524
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:27,840
Hello, Ms. Ling and Mr. Xiao.

525
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,440
I'm Liu Jing, the resort manager.

526
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:32,169
I wasn't informed
that there would be this many guests.

527
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,360
It was a last-minute change.

528
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,644
Can you prepare another villa?

529
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm really sorry but we're fully booked.

530
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,480
This villa was specially reserved
for you.

531
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,720
Then we'll just make do.

532
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,480
I won't disturb your rest.

533
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,840
Let me know if you need anything.

534
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,600
You all heard that.

535
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,080
That's that.

536
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,280
Mr. Xu, all four of them have arrived.

537
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:18,440
All right. I understand.

538
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,760
All four of them?

539
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,520
Yes.

540
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,480
Some things didn't go exactly
as planned.

541
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,160
But overall,

542
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,133
everything is unfolding
according to your plan.

543
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,200
People have to go through certain things

544
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,920
to understand other things.

545
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,760
Vincent is growing fast at the hotel.

546
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:50,890
He's already capable
of handling things on his own.

547
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,880
I trust he'll make wise decisions.

548
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,960
I'm not insisting

549
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,560
that he must be with Yishu.

550
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,200
I only want to see

551
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,800
whether he can stand by his choices

552
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:05,880
when faced with difficulties
and obstacles.

553
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:09,600
Small matters reveal big truths.

554
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:12,688
Are you worried
that his mind isn't fully set

555
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,840
and he might make a choice he'll regret?

556
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,844
Parents who love their children

557
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,760
always think ahead for them.

558
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,080
Do you have an extra toothbrush?

559
00:34:57,688 --> 00:34:58,880
Isn't there one in your room?

560
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,320
I already used the disposable one once.

561
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,400
I brought my toothbrush.

562
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:16,000
You can use the one from this room.

563
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,080
Disposable toothbrushes

564
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,200
can be used two to four times.

565
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,160
(Lin Youjia)
(This God of Plague)

566
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,349
(is definitely up to no good.)

567
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,480
(Remember to lock your door.)

568
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,300
(I'll be downstairs.)

569
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,577
(Call me if you need anything.)

570
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,280
What now?

571
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,840
Do you have an extra towel?

572
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,000
Boss,

573
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,920
this isn't Spring Sea.

574
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,160
If you need a towel, slippers,
or a toothbrush,

575
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,466
you should ask customer service,

576
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:02,320
not Yi Ran.

577
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Let me remind you again.

578
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,000
It's already 11 PM.

579
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,310
You may not need sleep, but I do.

580
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:16,444
Stop knocking on my door.

581
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,360
Good night.

582
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,911
I didn't get a chance
to say good night earlier.

583
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,640
Good night.

584
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,880
Did you

585
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,920
just knock on my door?

586
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,640
I didn't.

587
00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:49,377
But I can knock now if you want.

588
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,040
No need.

589
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,000
You're still up?

590
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
Well, so are you.

591
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,320
I am thirsty.

592
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,533
I'm getting some water too.

593
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
Get some rest early.

594
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,160
Get in.

595
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,420
When opening the car door,

596
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,540
your face will be blocked.

597
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,510
Action.

598
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:54,500
Then you realize he doesn't
care about you at all.

599
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,720
Is that really what you think?

600
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,170
If I don't say this, how would I...

601
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,480
What did the Director say?

602
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,860
Just stand still.

603
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,220
Okay.

604
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,880
