=The Quirky and The Charming=

2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,480
You told him to make your bed,

4
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,680
organize your clothes,

5
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,600
and fill up your bathtub.

6
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,080
You even wanted him
to wash your hair for you.

7
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,760
And scrub your back as well.

8
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm done for.

9
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm dead meat.

10
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,200
I'm sure he wants to kill me now.

11
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,520
I don't think so.

12
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
He seemed normal.

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,080
I don't think it's normal.

14
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,520
He didn't make a fuss.

15
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,640
He did whatever you wanted him to do.

16
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:57,600
- Is that normal?
- Is that normal?

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,040
The calm before the storm
is always the quietest.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,040
The quieter it is, the bigger the storm.

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,160
Why didn't you guys stop me?

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
Do you know how drunk you were?

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,920
We couldn't stop you, you know?

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,280
You didn't want to let go
of Vincent's thigh.

23
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:19,333
I thought you were
going along with your plan.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
If Boss had his usual personality,

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
he would've sent you packing.

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
But now, he hasn't reacted yet.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
What does that mean?

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
That means he hasn't decided yet.

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Could it be...

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,880
- You two!
- You two!

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
Yi Ran, you're something else.

32
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,860
You're playing hard-to-get
with Mr. Lin Jr.

33
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,640
and flirting with Vincent
at the same time.

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,040
You're occupying
two outstanding males at once.

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
This is a huge waste of resources.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,920
What nonsense was that?

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,720
Come in.

38
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,360
Cut to the chase.

39
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,320
I'm busy.

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,400
Regarding last night,

41
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:46,500
just treat it
as if nothing had happened.

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,320
What do you mean?

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,040
You see,

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,720
I'm sure everyone has erred
when they were young.

45
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
If a dog bites you,

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,040
would you bite it back?

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Let's treat it
as if nothing had happened.

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,840
A dog?

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,440
Bitten by a dog?

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,640
I know my example

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,555
is a little extreme.

52
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,822
But it has the same meaning.

53
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,360
It's good as long as you understand it.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,790
Just consider it as a mistake
that everyone makes, made by me

55
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,711
when I was young
and didn't know any better.

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,960
If you can't get over it...

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,755
I've never thought of it as a thing!

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Really?

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,080
Get out.

60
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:58,080
Bitten by a dog? Do I look like a dog?

61
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,400
Were you calling for me?

62
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,440
Get out.

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,160
Okay, Boss.

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
Regarding our online event,

65
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:23,444
which is to submit a vlog

66
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,040
and win a luxury ocean-view suite,

67
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
it has received

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,920
over 1,000 vlogs.

69
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:30,000
The Housekeeping Department
has to review them

70
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
and choose the best one.

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,280
Is there any volunteer?

72
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,240
Isn't this the duty

73
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
of the Publicity Department?

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,640
I heard that the Publicity Department

75
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
is getting ready for a huge event.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
They have no time for this.

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
No days off? Not even a bonus?

78
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,733
(Not me. Don't pick me)
No one's willing to do this.

79
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:50,320
Precisely.

80
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,880
Not me.

81
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,240
(Rabbit, fried egg, ramen)

82
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,680
Yi Ran.

83
00:05:58,777 --> 00:05:59,666
You shall do it.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
This can't be.

85
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Yi Ran,

86
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,800
hurry and rest.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,360
Your body can't take it
if you keep pulling all-nighters.

88
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,840
I'm sure he's pranking me.

89
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,040
He said the vlogs were short.

90
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,360
But each is around 20 minutes long.

91
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,200
What have you done to offend him again?

92
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
I blacked out.

93
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,177
I ordered him around
for the entire night.

94
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,960
But we've already
clarified the situation.

95
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,320
We're even now.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,490
We were supposed to treat it
as if nothing had happened.

97
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,640
Are you sure it's as simple
as ordering him around

98
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,520
for the entire night?

99
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,000
You blacked out, you know?

100
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,977
How could you remember what you've done?

101
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,440
That's what they said.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,640
What you hear might not be true.
Seeing is believing.

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,240
Maybe you've done something

104
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,955
to make him hold a grudge against you.

105
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,400
You're right.

106
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:06,911
If I must die, I need to die
after knowing the truth.

107
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,680
Who's there?

108
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,120
No. You can't just access our footage

109
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,040
casually.

110
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
I know that.

111
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,680
You said you wanted
to use the restroom, right?

112
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:31,760
No matter how strict the hotel is,

113
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,688
I'm sure you're allowed
to use the restroom.

114
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,100
I'll go and use the restroom, then.

115
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,822
I'll leave after putting
the drinks here.

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,960
You better be quick.

117
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:55,220
(Elevator)

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,960
I...

119
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,440
I should be in the restroom.

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,960
I saw nothing.

121
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,660
(Elevator, Thursday)

122
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,540
=The Quirky and The Charming=

123
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:38,680
You forgot to press the floor button.

124
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:46,133
Did you do it on purpose?

125
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Yes.

126
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,440
Regarding last night,

127
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:52,533
(just treat it
as if nothing had happened.)

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sure everyone has erred
when they were young.

129
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,200
If a dog bites you,

130
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,360
would you bite it back?

131
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
I can't believe I made that comparison.

132
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
Why exactly did he kiss me?

133
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,720
You don't say?

134
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,160
Of course it's because he fancies you.

135
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,280
That's too sudden.

136
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,240
I'm not prepared for this at all.

137
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
Love comes too fast, just like a storm.

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,440
Don't let happiness wait for too long.

139
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,920
This won't do.

140
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,120
He hasn't confessed to me yet.

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,080
Yi Ran,

142
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,520
since when were you this wishy-washy?

143
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:40,533
Do you expect him
to wrap himself in a gift

144
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:42,133
and deliver himself to your room?

145
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,040
That'll do too.

146
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:53,960
No.

147
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,840
I have to clarify things with him.

148
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
She's begging for forgiveness already.

149
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,840
Fine.

150
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
I'll give you one more chance.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,440
Hello?

152
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,120
This won't do.

153
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
I haven't figured out what to say yet.

154
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,200
What should I do?

155
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,680
I...

156
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,666
The number you have dialed
is switched off.

157
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,755
She switched her phone off?

158
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,520
How dare you?

159
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Hello. The number you have dialed is...

160
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,040
Hello?

161
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,666
Join me for a boxing session.

162
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,680
See you at the yoga studio
in half an hour.

163
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,840
Boss,

164
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,400
why don't we go somewhere else?

165
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,080
Hello?

166
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,640
Mr. Yan.

167
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,320
This is an opportunity for you.

168
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:53,000
Why don't you head to the yoga studio

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,511
and have a deep conversation with Boss?

170
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,320
Sure.

171
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,680
Yoga is my expertise.

172
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,040
If so, you have to perform well tonight.

173
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,480
Are we never going
to see each other again?

174
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
That won't be. Wait for me.

175
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,800
I'll definitely come back and find you.

176
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,320
Pinky promise.

177
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,880
No. Only children do that.

178
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm leaving soon. Come on.

179
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,520
Alright, then.

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,120
Hello?

181
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,280
Tiny Yi.

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Tell me.

183
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
Is my return too late?

184
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:24,711
Give me the same drink.

185
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,360
Ms. Ling, you can't sleep
because of your loneliness either, huh?

186
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:34,040
Are you trying to
drown yourself in sorrow?

187
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,740
(Phone Call, Mr. Lin Jr.)

188
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,280
Sorry about that.

189
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:52,600
I called the wrong number.

190
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,000
Yi Ran would never find out

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,688
even if you drink
yourself to death here.

192
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,520
If you like her,
you should fight for her.

193
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
You're right.

194
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,240
Hyenas can outdo lions

195
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,080
if they work together.

196
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,200
This isn't about me alone.

197
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
If I lose to Xiao Mucheng,

198
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,960
you'll lose to Yi Ran as well.

199
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,920
I never worry about losing.

200
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,520
But since you've already begged me,

201
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:39,244
I guess I have no choice
but to agree to your request.

202
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,840
Pinky promise.

203
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,200
So childish.

204
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,640
"Take things easy,
and life will be a breeze?"

205
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,960
Is this an official announcement?

206
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,160
How could you tell?

207
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,000
Isn't it obvious?

208
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,280
They drank together last night.

209
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,720
And, they stayed out all night.

210
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
Stop poking it.

211
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,840
The rice will be ruined.

212
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,120
No wonder you were upset
for the past few days.

213
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,400
So, Yi Ran was the benchwarmer.

214
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,680
The world of the rich

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,400
isn't one we can just walk into.

216
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,960
Don't give up easily.

217
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,560
We still stand a chance.

218
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
Why don't we join hands

219
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
and separate them?

220
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,000
(If a dog bites you,
would you bite it back?)

221
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,440
Let's treat it
as if nothing had happened.

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,280
Why do you look happy all of a sudden?

223
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,800
What's the matter?

224
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,560
Who said I looked happy?

225
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,840
I just feel heartbroken
and upset for Yi Ran.

226
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm full.

227
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,320
You guys can go ahead.

228
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,360
You haven't even taken a bite.

229
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,440
Let her be.

230
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,800
She needs some time alone.

231
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,960
Mr. Yan.

232
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:42,244
What a coincidence.

233
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
What do you want for lunch today?

234
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,960
Order away. It's my treat.

235
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,133
I want to eat someone alive.

236
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,720
I thought of you as a brother.

237
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,240
But you took me as a fool, huh?

238
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,800
You said you gave me an opportunity

239
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,520
to engage in
a deep conversation with him.

240
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,920
Look at my eyes!

241
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,577
Are the bruises deep enough?

242
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,760
Mr. Yan.

243
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,840
Why don't you let me explain myself?

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,640
No, I won't!

245
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
You see, at that moment,

246
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,720
I was...

247
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,920
What are you two doing here?

248
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,640
Nothing. It was just a casual chat.

249
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,240
I told you to stop, right? Does it hurt?

250
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,640
I'm fine.

251
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,920
Say,

252
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,800
after our boxing session last night,

253
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,880
I feel great today.

254
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:39,333
I have to learn more from you.

255
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Sure. Let's have another session

256
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
tonight.

257
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:46,533
Chen Mo, you should join us too.

258
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,840
Let's go!

259
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,040
Come in.

260
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
So...

261
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,822
Have you selected the best vlog?

262
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,000
Not yet.

263
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,200
That night...

264
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:29,688
Why are you standing here
when you haven't finished your task?

265
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:30,888
Is there anything else?

266
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:35,866
Now, you remember everything, huh?

267
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,280
You irresponsible woman!

268
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,920
I...

269
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,760
Seems like you have
nothing important to say.

270
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,120
I'm very busy now.

271
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,760
Out with it!

272
00:18:58,822 --> 00:18:59,800
Are you truly leaving?

273
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,800
Leave if you dare!

274
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,040
She did leave.

275
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:06,680
She even slammed the door?

276
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,280
It was windy just now.

277
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
I didn't mean to slam the door.

278
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
Get out.

279
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,640
Isn't Cui's salon next week?

280
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:35,266
What are you guys doing?

281
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,680
We know that you're heartbroken.

282
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,960
We've decided to hold an impromptu

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,080
breakup memorial service for you.

284
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,066
We want you to forget
about your troubles.

285
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,280
Forget about the worldly desires.

286
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,840
Let moonlight stop your sorrow.

287
00:19:57,622 --> 00:19:58,720
Who has fallen out of love?

288
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:01,280
She doesn't dare to face reality.

289
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,044
This is a classic case
of late-stage breakup syndrome.

290
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,080
Ran, I knew there was nothing
between you and Boss.

291
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,560
You just did it because of Mr. Lin.

292
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,840
There are no outsiders here.

293
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,080
We'll keep you company.

294
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,080
Wait.

295
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,680
What have I missed out on?

296
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,466
If there's nothing else,
I'll leave first.

297
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:16,044
I still need to filter out the vlogs.

298
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:17,866
Don't leave.

299
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,960
If you leave,
the memorial service will be pointless.

300
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,870
What memorial service?
I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,560
Didn't you break up with Mr. Lin Jr.?

302
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,880
My foot!

303
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,360
We were childhood friends
who hadn't met for over a decade.

304
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,440
We were neighbors.

305
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:32,840
Childhood friends?

306
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,280
Is that all?

307
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:35,120
You don't say?

308
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,040
Do you guys think that he and I...

309
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
What did I tell you guys?

310
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,280
I knew Ran wasn't a two-timer.

311
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,320
All of us have misunderstood you.

312
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,422
It's a misunderstanding.

313
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,280
This is ridiculous.

314
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:53,333
I'll leave first.

315
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,160
Don't!

316
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
You're already here.

317
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:58,600
Have a drink with us.

318
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,240
A little?

319
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,360
Just a little.

320
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,200
Hurry!

321
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,960
Cheers.

322
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,520
Cheers.

323
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,360
Cheers.

324
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,200
Mr. Cui.

325
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,560
I want to ask you something

326
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,800
that everyone has been curious about.

327
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,680
You're already very old.

328
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,560
Why are you still working at our hotel?

329
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,120
Come on.

330
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,160
Tell us your story.

331
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
I'm waiting for someone.

332
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,640
Who are you waiting for?

333
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,440
My wife.

334
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,800
30 years ago,

335
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,680
my wife was assigned to Europe

336
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,320
for work.

337
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,120
She vanished mysteriously

338
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,400
after six months.

339
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,520
Even now, she's nowhere to be seen.

340
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,840
How could that be?

341
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,400
How could a person
vanish just like that?

342
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
In that era,

343
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,800
communication wasn't
as advanced as it is now,

344
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,400
not to mention that I had
to look for her in a foreign land.

345
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,320
That was even more difficult.

346
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,920
I've tried everything I could.

347
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,680
I had no news of her.

348
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,440
Later, my family moved.

349
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,440
After that,

350
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,120
it became the current
Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

351
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,480
No wonder you kept saying

352
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,120
that the hotel was your home.

353
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,440
It's been 30 years.

354
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,280
I've thought about
all kinds of possible outcomes.

355
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,400
I could accept them.

356
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,400
But what if she does return one day?

357
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
What if she can't find me

358
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
or our home?

359
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,280
Therefore,

360
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
I have to wait for her return.

361
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,280
So, God of Plague knows this as well?

362
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,200
That's why

363
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
Mr. Xiao made an exception

364
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,840
and let me remain until now.

365
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
I'm very grateful to him.

366
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:35,600
Don't just stare into space.

367
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,720
Come, let's drink.

368
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,280
I hope you two can be reunited.

369
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,280
This is what love should be like.

370
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,680
You guys

371
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,840
will encounter

372
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,760
your own love stories and relationships.

373
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,600
I wonder

374
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,880
how it feels to encounter love.

375
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,320
Child, let me tell you something.

376
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,120
If you meet someone

377
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,760
who makes you
think about him unconsciously...

378
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,760
No matter if you're happy, upset,

379
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,600
clumsy, or impulsive,

380
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,840
it doesn't matter.

381
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,920
It's because that's love.

382
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,120
If you feel that, don't avoid it.

383
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,560
Embrace it bravely.

384
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,380
(Murphy's Law)

385
00:24:58,111 --> 00:24:59,880
(I folded the page
of one of your books.)

386
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,960
What did you say? Which book?

387
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,400
I don't know.

388
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,040
Why don't you find it yourself?

389
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,460
(Murphy's Law)

390
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,680
Mom, I want some dried pineapples.

391
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,644
What did you call me?

392
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,920
Dear,

393
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,511
don't forget about your test at 8 P.M.

394
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:54,600
All done, mister.

395
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,320
Thank you.

396
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,422
Hello. I've made a reservation.

397
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,400
Hello, Miss Bei.

398
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
Welcome to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

399
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,760
I'm a fan of yours.

400
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,040
I've been following your channel.

401
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,600
Thank you.

402
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,400
Are you a Sagittarius?

403
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,240
How did you find out?

404
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,480
That's amazing.

405
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,320
You look like someone proud

406
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,600
and highly capable.

407
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,160
Right now, the stars have arrived in
your Five Orientations,

408
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,880
and Mercury is about to join them.

409
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,290
An opportunity will appear soon.
You must grab hold of it.

410
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,200
Thank you for the reminder.
I'll take note of that.

411
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,288
Please wait a moment.

412
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,320
Miss Bei, this is your room card.

413
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:39,879
- The elevator is behind you.
- Okay.

414
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,177
Okay. Thank you.

415
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,240
Who is she?

416
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,080
Don't you know who she is?

417
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,200
That's Bei Lala.

418
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,160
She's an astrology expert
with ten million followers.

419
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,240
I don't know much about astrology.

420
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,120
She was never wrong
with her predictions.

421
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,533
Her ten million followers
aren't just for show, you know?

422
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,200
My life is going to begin soon!

423
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,320
Boss,

424
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:10,290
Miss Chen hopes
that she can hold an after-party

425
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,600
in her room after the banquet.

426
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,279
Confirm the number.

427
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,044
If too many,
move to the Executive Lounge.

428
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,520
Okay.

429
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:17,933
By the way,

430
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:19,920
I didn't see Yi Ran today. Where is she?

431
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,120
She applied for leave.

432
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,560
Again?

433
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,040
You yourself said
that she could take a paid leave.

434
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,022
I think she's reviewing
the vlogs as we speak.

435
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:30,066
You know this too.
There are a lot of them.

436
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,240
Hello.

437
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,920
Do you need me to contact her?

438
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,640
Don't disturb her.

439
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:52,960
What are you doing here?

440
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,760
Shouldn't you be in a meeting

441
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,800
with Ms. Hua at this time?

442
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,200
It was over. Since I was here,
I came here to visit you.

443
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,360
I heard you're also talking
to Beisiman about financing.

444
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,840
You found out again?

445
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:07,879
What an unfortunate coincidence.

446
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,555
I was discussing
the same thing with them.

447
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,777
Do you need me to lend you a hand?

448
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:13,155
Here's my advice for you.

449
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,080
Beisiman is no ordinary company.

450
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,880
You guys should keep an eye on them.

451
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,200
Are you worried about me?

452
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,000
Don't worry.

453
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,888
I'll do the same
even without your reminder.

454
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,440
It's almost dinnertime. Buy me a meal.

455
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,640
I...

456
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,920
What?

457
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:31,155
I introduced a huge
business deal to you.

458
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,000
Now, you're reluctant to buy me a meal?

459
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,840
Okay.

460
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
Alright. Let's go.

461
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,200
Isn't that Mr. Lin Jr. and Yi Ran?

462
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:52,640
What a coincidence.

463
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,640
Yeah.

464
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:56,577
What are you guys doing here?

465
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,800
Vincent is buying me a meal as thanks.

466
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:02,555
Since we met by coincidence,

467
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,440
why don't we share a table?

468
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,480
Are we bothering you guys?

469
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,560
No.

470
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,920
Mr. Xiao, I wonder if you mind.

471
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,720
Mr. Lin Jr., since you don't mind,

472
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,777
we can share a table.

473
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,040
Hey.

474
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,080
Did you confess to her or not?

475
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,520
If this keeps up,

476
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,760
you'll lose her.

477
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
I think you misunderstood something.

478
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,160
Waiter.

479
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,160
Thank you.

480
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:55,149
Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs,
Sweet and Sour Pork Fillet,

481
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,380
Pineapple Sweet and Sour Pork,

482
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:57,666
Honey Glazed Char Siu.

483
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,866
Tiny Yi loved sweet food since young.

484
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:02,960
She can finish three bowls of rice
if there's Sweet and Sour Pork Fillet.

485
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:19,840
(Are you taking paid leave for work
or for a date? Can't I have lunch during work?)

486
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,740
(There's nothing between us!)

487
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,300
(Stop shifting the topic!
I'm canceling your paid leave!)

488
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,920
You!

489
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,640
Were you two texting each other?

490
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,640
- No.
- No.

491
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,590
The Sweet and Sour Pork Fillet
is pretty good.

492
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,600
You can have it first.

493
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:44,280
I remember that I always had meals

494
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,200
at your house after class.

495
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,377
Sweet and Sour Pork Fillet
was your father's signature dish.

496
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,320
Just shut up and eat.

497
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,360
This dish tastes especially good today.

498
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,200
Mr. Xiao,

499
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
the chefs in your hotel are amazing.

500
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,560
You should look after her.

501
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,200
No thanks. I don't like sweet food.

502
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,360
I'm the same as Vincent.

503
00:31:09,377 --> 00:31:10,950
We prefer food that has a lighter taste.

504
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:17,244
There's no more coriander.
You can eat it now.

505
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,880
I heard that you two grew up together.

506
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,040
That's right.

507
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,100
We sleep right next
to each other in kindergarten.

508
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,840
Back then, he was
wearing open-crotch pants.

509
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:40,800
I even knew how many moles
he had on his butt.

510
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,560
I suppose

511
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,120
Yi Ran and I shared the same pants
when we grew up.

512
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,320
Eat up.

513
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,666
Were you poor that
you couldn't afford pants?

514
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,800
Are there moles on your butt?

515
00:31:56,844 --> 00:31:57,560
How should I know?

516
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,019
How would she know
if you didn't know?

517
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,990
How should I know that?

518
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:01,066
How did you know?

519
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,880
I...

520
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,880
It's not like you can
see the moles on your butt.

521
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,840
That was so long ago. Let's eat.

522
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,200
- No way!
- No way!

523
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,760
Why do I feel like the meal went south?

524
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,888
It's all because of you.

525
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:30,760
Why did you talk about
the moles on his butt?

526
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,960
You begged me, you know?

527
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,240
That's why I helped you out.

528
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:35,569
If you're experienced,
you should initiate some good topics.

529
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,460
You let me follow you.

530
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,360
Enough. I have no time to waste on you.

531
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,840
If you can't do it, I'll do it myself.

532
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,280
Who said I can't do it?

533
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,160
Useless man. You think you're a hyena?

534
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,720
At most, you're just a teddy bear.

535
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,600
If so, you're a Corgi.

536
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,880
You only croak.

537
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Only frogs croak.

538
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:53,800
Don't you have any common sense?

539
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,820
They're running away,
yet you're discussing with me

540
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,000
the kind of animals that croak.

541
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,110
Go to the zoo to find it out.

542
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:59,244
Scram! Stop following me!

543
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,720
Fine by me!

544
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,844
There are a lot of flower baskets
in front of Room 9032.

545
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,760
Yi Ran, talk to Miss Bei.

546
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:41,340
Don't let her affect the other guests.

547
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:43,111
Roger that. I'll get to it immediately.

548
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,840
Hello.

549
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,680
Hello, I'm Xiao Mucheng, head of
Housekeeping Department.

550
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,440
What are these flower baskets?

551
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,520
Sorry about that.

552
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm allergic to pollen,

553
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,280
but I don't want to let my fans down.

554
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,880
Understood.

555
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,777
But these will affect the other guests
if you leave them in the corridor.

556
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:14,529
What about this?

557
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,760
Please give me an address.

558
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,040
I'll deliver them to your house.

559
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Sorry for the trouble.

560
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,280
You have to do this because of me.

561
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:22,160
Sorry about this.

562
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,360
It's my duty.

563
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:24,600
If you need anything,

564
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,840
you may find us at any time.

565
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:27,333
Sorry for the interruption.

566
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,640
Wait.

567
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,920
One of my earrings is missing.

568
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,600
Can you please find it for me?

569
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,160
Okay.

570
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,240
It should be around this area.

571
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,640
It's a white pearl earring.

572
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,400
Miss Bei, what are you doing?

573
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,280
Miss Bei!

574
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:03,400
Please let me hug you.

575
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,040
Just one minute!

576
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:05,880
Miss Bei, I'm sorry.

577
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,680
Please let go.

578
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,600
Miss Bei!

579
00:35:08,555 --> 00:35:10,422
- Miss Bei, please let go.
- Let him go!

580
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,530
Action.

581
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,300
It's such a coincidence.

582
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:22,288
Why don't we share a table?

583
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,710
Are you truly leaving?

584
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,920
Leave if you dare!

585
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,540
Out with it.

586
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:34,730
No matter how similar it looks,

587
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,420
you can't just touch it like that.

588
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,200
Say it.

589
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,310
Action.

590
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,160
