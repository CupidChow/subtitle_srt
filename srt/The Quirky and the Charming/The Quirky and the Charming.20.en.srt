My baby!

11
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
Did you have fun at school today?

12
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,720
My baby's home.

13
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Show me what you drew.

14
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,440
What's this?

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,720
Let me see it too.

16
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,240
It's a little bird.

17
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,120
Did Ran draw that?

18
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
That's amazing, Ran!

19
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,880
This is where I used to draw
when I was a kid.

Here she comes.

27
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,640
Look what I made for you.

28
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,520
Ran.

29
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,560
Come and sit down.

30
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
Sit down, Ran.

31
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,320
Come on.

32
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,280
Here.

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,800
Your chopsticks.

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,400
Thanks, Mom.

35
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,920
Here you go.

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,160
Thanks, Mom.

37
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,120
Come, come!

38
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,880
Join us, everyone!

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,200
Come on!

40
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,120
My dad

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,720
hung a hammock right there for me.

42
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
In the summer, I'd lie in it.

43
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,400
Swaying back and forth

44
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,520
in the evening breeze.

45
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,520
It was so cool and relaxing.

46
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,890
And with the sound of crickets chirping,

47
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,480
it was the perfect lullaby.

48
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,960
You won't have trouble sleeping here.

49
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,640
Back then,

50
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,200
no matter how late I got home,

51
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,920
or how stormy the weather was,

52
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,755
there was always someone
waiting for me at home.

53
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,280
From now on,

54
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,222
I'll be the one waiting for you
to come home.

55
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,500
=The Quirky and The Charming=

56
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
Bright Platinum is in your hands now.

57
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,177
Get someone to drive the car
back to the company when you have time.

58
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,160
My suitcase is heavy.

59
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
I packed too much stuff.

60
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,440
I...

61
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:07,960
What are you doing here?

62
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,760
Fate works

63
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
in mysterious ways.

64
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,680
But this time,
I didn't mistake you for someone else.

65
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,440
Where are you heading?

66
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,280
Haven't decided yet.

67
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,210
Just thinking
I'd go out and see the world.

68
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,666
Maybe head up and take a look later.

69
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,377
What about you?

70
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
No destination either.

71
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,560
Want to be travel companions?

72
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,720
If you ask nicely,

73
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
maybe I'll consider it.

74
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,680
Do you think we're destined to meet?

75
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,560
I think it's probably bad karma.

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Bad karma is still karma.

77
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,880
Fine. If you say so.

78
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,440
Yes.

79
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,990
All right. Let's proceed with this plan.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,400
Got it.

81
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,750
I'll leave you in charge
of the hotel. I'll see Yi Ran off.

82
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,680
Chairman Liu is here.

83
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,200
He is in the meeting room.

84
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Why now?

85
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:18,320
Didn't even give us a heads-up.

86
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,155
I have something important
to take care of.

87
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,420
Chairman Liu's visit concerns

88
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,520
the final evaluation for first place.

89
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,640
Ran, take care of yourself.

90
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,000
Call us when you can.

91
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,840
Take care of yourself
when you're alone over there.

92
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,120
I will.

93
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,720
Yi Ran, don't worry.

94
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

95
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,320
If anything happens,

96
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,080
I'll report to you right away.

97
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,840
Just take care of yourself.

98
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,080
Yi Ran.

99
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,360
We really don't want you to leave.

100
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,160
Two years will pass in a flash.

101
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,777
Wait for me to come back.

102
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,160
Where's Boss?

103
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,400
Yi Ran, Boss had an emergency.
He couldn't make it.

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,560
He asked me to see you off.

105
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,240
It's fine.
I can get to the airport on my own.

106
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,320
You guys should head back to work.

107
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,520
I'm off.

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,088
Take care of yourselves.

109
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,040
Go back.

110
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,760
He didn't even bother
to come see me off.

111
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,840
Not even a call or a message!

112
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,880
That heartless jerk!

113
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
I lost sleep over you last night.

114
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,400
I even cried because of you.

115
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,280
I was wrong about you!

116
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,760
You're still not calling?

117
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
Stupid God of Plague!

118
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,360
I'm leaving for two years.

119
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,866
They say long-distance relationships
are hard to survive.

120
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:51,320
We haven't even started
and he's already ghosting me.

121
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,840
You said you couldn't bear
to part with me.

122
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
You liar!

123
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,822
Xiao Mucheng, you're a liar!

124
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,600
A big fat liar!

125
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,440
Fine.

126
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
Don't ever call me again.

127
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,422
Even if you do, I won't pick up.

128
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:09,666
Let's see how anxious you get,
you heartless jerk!

129
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:10,440
Excuse me, Miss.

130
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:12,160
Please don't use vulgar language

131
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,720
in Spring Sea's exclusive vehicles.

132
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:15,320
So what if I curse him?

133
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,600
He deserves it!

134
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,440
I can't listen to this any longer.

135
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,844
I was planning to give you
a surprise at the airport.

136
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:48,488
But you've been cursing me
the whole way.

137
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,490
I can't hold back anymore.

138
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,755
Why'd you pull this stunt?

139
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,960
I thought you weren't coming.

140
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,080
How could I bear to leave you?

141
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:05,511
Just the thought of not seeing you
for two years

142
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,560
makes it hard to breathe.

143
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:09,555
I don't want to be apart from you.

144
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,560
I don't want to leave you either.

145
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,120
When you get there,
take good care of yourself.

146
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,120
Eat well.

147
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
Sleep well.

148
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,240
Don't get sick. Stay healthy.

149
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,160
Be happy every day.

150
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
And one more thing.

151
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,040
You're not allowed
to fall for anyone else,

152
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
and don't let anyone fall for you.

153
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,520
I can't control that.

154
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,520
Then figure it out.

155
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,800
Day and night.
You have to always keep me

156
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,360
on your mind.

157
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,560
That will be all, sir.

158
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,730
Thank you for staying with us.

159
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:44,400
Thank you.

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,120
Welcome to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

161
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,511
Good morning, everyone.

162
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,320
I'll assign everyone's tasks

163
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,720
for the week.

164
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,680
Lu.

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,320
Inspect all vacated rooms and make sure

166
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,760
to restock guest supplies
and towels promptly.

167
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,520
Xu Yuan.

168
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,080
Check all workspaces and linen rooms.

169
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
Collect and replace all dirty linens.

170
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,160
Molly.

171
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,160
Follow the maintenance plan
for public areas.

172
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:19,333
Ensure all public spaces
are thoroughly cleaned.

173
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,120
Dingdang.

174
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,380
Strictly follow cleaning
and disinfection standards

175
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,200
for all tools and equipment.

176
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,080
All right?

177
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,800
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:26,920
Let's work hard, people!

179
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:32,490
We need to analyze
our competitors' strengths.

180
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,711
For example, Bright Platinum

181
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,666
has been organizing themed events
on the beach,

182
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,600
such as BBQ festivals

183
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:37,960
and beer festivals.

184
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,000
(Yi Ran)
We can do similar events, like

185
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,000
private cocktail parties

186
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,880
or dessert-themed events.

187
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,040
Have a dumpling.

188
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,760
My turn.

189
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,355
I need to get to class.
Talk to you next time.

190
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:17,380
It fits you perfectly.

191
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,840
All right.

192
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:26,449
Happy Chinese New Year!

193
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,280
All right.

194
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,080
Check out this bed. Not bad, right?

195
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,840
Spring Sea's bedding.

196
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,600
I...

197
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,920
Mr. Xiao.

198
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:04,069
(Yi Ran: Waiting for the other party
to accept the call)

199
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,380
(Call rejected)

200
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:49,980
(One year later)

201
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:15,760
(10th Star Hotel Industry Development Summit)
The development of the hotel industry

202
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
serves as a barometer
for a city's economic growth

203
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,000
and tourism development.

204
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,280
It also reflects

205
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,680
the spirit and character of a city.

206
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,000
Over the past year,

207
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,720
we've been pleased to see our colleagues

208
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,680
actively working to improve

209
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,240
service quality,

210
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,880
build brand identity,

211
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,880
and create differentiation.

212
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,240
I think it's going to be us.

213
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
By introducing digital thinking,

214
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,160
we've broken
traditional operating models

215
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,640
and driven reform and innovation
within the hotel industry.

216
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,080
Today,

217
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,520
I am honored to announce the winner

218
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,720
of this year's Hotel Excellence Award.

219
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,720
And the first-place winner

220
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,080
is...

221
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,760
Spring Sea Resort Hotel!

222
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,640
Let's give them a big round of applause!

223
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,200
Over the past year,

224
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,760
Spring Sea Resort Hotel has redefined

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,720
the hotel industry by combining

226
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,200
a guest room

227
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,880
and experience store operating model.

228
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,800
Thank you all for the recognition.

229
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,909
Spring Sea Resort Hotel will continue
to move forward,

230
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,420
staying true to its vision and mission.

231
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:42,000
Thank you.

232
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,900
(Ling Yishu)

233
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,920
Yes?

234
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,320
Guys.

235
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,360
This is a restaurant.

236
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,520
This isn't your living room.

237
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
I have good news for you.

238
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,440
We're getting married!

239
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,320
Keep it low-key.

240
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,480
I got the wedding invitation.

241
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,080
Congratulations.

242
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,955
If there's nothing else,
I'll be leaving now.

243
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,022
What's with that attitude?

244
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,380
It's been so long since we've met.

245
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,755
Why aren't you happy for us?

246
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,040
That's right.

247
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
Are things going well at work

248
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,960
but not in love for you?

249
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
What happened?

250
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,200
Did Yi Ran

251
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,400
move on

252
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,640
and dump you?

253
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
Did Yi Ran really leave you?

254
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,240
We haven't talked

255
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,760
for a long time.

256
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,400
She's all on her own over there.

257
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,680
She's busy with her studies.

258
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,840
Maybe she's preparing for her exams.

259
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,200
Good point.

260
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,080
Yi Ran has always struggled
with academics.

261
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,520
And when it comes to guys,

262
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,844
she tends to get bored
and move on quickly.

263
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,520
I guess long distance

264
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,320
is a test for both sides.

265
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,160
True.

266
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,311
We couldn't handle
a long-distance relationship either,

267
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:23,444
so he just moved
the whole business back here.

268
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,520
Thank you for doing so much for me.

269
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,040
Don't mention it.

270
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:32,840
I've had enough of you two!

271
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:34,910
Are you here to share
good news or to start a fight?

272
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:36,377
You're paying for everything today!

273
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,600
Well, don't skimp on our wedding gift.

274
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,240
You...

275
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

276
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:06,360
Boss, there's an urgent document
that needs your signature.

277
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,160
Mr. Xiao, there's a staffing update
to report to you.

278
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,080
The group has appointed
a new marketing manager.

279
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,340
She will assume her post in an hour.

280
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:16,733
Do you have her file?

281
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,840
Not yet.

282
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:33,960
One more thing.

283
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:35,560
Any news from Yi Ran?

284
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,880
No.

285
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,080
What's with Yi Ran?

286
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,150
She went overseas
for two years of study.

287
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,250
It's only been a year, and she's
cut contact with us.

288
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,680
Ignoring us is one thing.

289
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,120
But how could she ignore Mr. Xiao?

290
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,440
Unbelievable.

291
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,800
What's wrong?

292
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,720
He... He needs to pee.

293
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,320
Then, just go to the bathroom.

294
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,600
I'll take him there now.

295
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,880
Right now.

296
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,000
Good luck!

297
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,000
Notify all department heads.

298
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,890
Meeting in the conference room
in five minutes.

299
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:56,920
I have work to delegate.

300
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,840
Yes, sir.

301
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,120
The theme of this event is

302
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,640
"Rediscovering Youth."

303
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,080
We will enhance the event
by incorporating blind boxes

304
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,680
and school uniforms to evoke

305
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,960
a sense of nostalgia.

306
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,240
The contents of the blind boxes
may include meal vouchers,

307
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
room discounts,

308
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,200
snacks, and hotel merchandise.

309
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,644
If anyone has any good ideas,
please submit them

310
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:31,600
to the Marketing Department
within three days.

311
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,080
Lastly,
please allow me to introduce myself.

312
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,760
I am Yi Ran,

313
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,080
the new marketing manager
of Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

314
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,088
I'm honored to have the opportunity
to work with all of you moving forward.

315
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,920
What's going on?

316
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,690
You didn't even tell me
you were coming back.

317
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,120
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.

318
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,320
I have work to handle.

319
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,360
Personal matters can wait
until after work hours.

320
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,160
Mr. Yan.

321
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,990
We need to prepare early
for the spring recruitment,

322
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,370
which needs your cooperation.

323
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,466
Do you have time now?

324
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,040
Yes...

325
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,280
I guess...

326
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,200
Let's discuss it in my office.

327
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,680
Have you confirmed it?

328
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,120
Thank you for visiting Pan Yiyi's shop.

329
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,600
Good.

330
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,400
OK.

331
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,640
Done.

332
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,997
(Love lock)
Our love locks

333
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:33,511
(Eternal Bond)
are very effective.

334
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:34,300
(Hearts in Harmony)

335
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Trust me.

336
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,640
It works.

337
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,910
(I'll reflect on this
and work hard to improve.)

338
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,200
(Yi Ran! I'm sorry!)

339
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,920
(I'm sorry for what I did!)

340
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,560
(I'll reflect on this
and work hard to improve.)

341
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,280
I'll reflect on myself seriously

342
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,160
and work hard to improve!

343
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,280
Doesn't this "God of Plague" doll

344
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,760
look just like you?

345
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,280
Santa.

346
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,080
Can I

347
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,160
ask you something?

348
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
There was someone.

349
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,120
She disappeared a few months ago.

350
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Didn't answer calls.

351
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,320
Didn't reply to messages.

352
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,600
Now she's suddenly back.

353
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,120
Can you tell me why?

354
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,240
Before I answer that,

355
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,160
I need you to say yes to something.

356
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,880
Say yes to what?

357
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,880
Marry me.

358
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,680
Marry you?

359
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,520
Now?

360
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,080
Yes.

361
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,720
I'm not going to give you
another chance to back out.

362
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,520
Yi Ran.

363
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,200
I leave this boy in your care.

364
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,880
Dad.

365
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,440
You guys...

366
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,160
Things have been

367
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,520
really hectic this past year.

368
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,840
I barely slept three hours a night.

369
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,080
The rest of the time,

370
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,800
I was hitting the books nonstop.

371
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,320
That's how I managed to finish
two years of coursework

372
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,160
in just one year.

373
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,480
Just so I could come back to you sooner.

374
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,200
You could've just told me that.

375
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,080
When I left,
you prepared a surprise for me.

376
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,680
I had

377
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,840
to return the favor.

378
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,000
It took a lot out of me

379
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,560
to keep this secret.

380
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,680
Why are you crying?

381
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,200
I'm just so touched.

382
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,720
You two have to be happy, OK?

383
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,160
Yi Ran is my best friend.

384
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,680
I'm counting on you
to take good care of her.

385
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:54,360
I wish you both happiness.

386
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,440
Once you accept this ring,

387
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
you'll be mine forever.

388
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,080
No divorce.

389
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,240
No regrets.

390
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,040
No getting sick.

391
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,520
No looking at other women.

392
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Even if we see each other every day,

393
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,555
I'm the only one who can be
in your heart every second of the day.

394
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,040
Anything else you want to say?

395
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes.

396
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,240
You can't say no.

397
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,360
Yi Ran.

398
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,600
I love you.

399
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,680
Boss.

400
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,688
We have a ring for you too.

401
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,760
Thanks.

402
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,960
Yi Ran.

403
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,360
I'll never

404
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,040
leave you again.

405
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,640
Through spring,
summer, autumn, and winter,

406
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:42,800
across the stars and the seas,

407
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,760
I'll always stay by your side.

408
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,400
No arguments.

409
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,040
No bad reviews.

410
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,440
Only happiness.

411
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,160
Marry me.

412
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,680
Kiss!

413
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,800
Give us a kiss!

414
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,840
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

415
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,000
Are you ready? I'm going to begin.

416
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,320
I'll have to give you
a proper inspection.

417
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,200
It's over already?

418
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,400
Bad review!

419
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,200
Wait.

420
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,840
I haven't even started yet.

421
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,180
(End)

422
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,650
Sit here.

423
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,890
What about now?

424
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,950
Can I turn around and see?

425
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,880
Put this on.

426
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:11,940
What?

427
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:24,441
