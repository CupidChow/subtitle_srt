There's something

I've wanted to tell you in person.

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
I liked you.

You knew that, right?

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,560
I used to think you liked me too.

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,200
I even waited for your confession.

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720

68
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,360
your distance from me

69
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,440
was just you playing hard to get.

70
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,640
I also believed

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,040
that no one else in the world

72
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,880
was worthy of me except you.

73
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
And that no one but me

74
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,040
was worthy of you.

75
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,680
But now I understand.

76
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
None of that was real love.

77
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
It was just my pride.

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,400

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,640
you were a worthy opponent

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,320
and a good friend.

82
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,391

for more than 20 years.

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
I was never lonely.

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,840
I feel the same way.

86
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
I'll stop here.

87

117

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960

139
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,066

147
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,400
I left a bottle of liquor in my room.

148
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,040
I only took one sip.

149
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,240

150
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280

151
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,520
Cui, is this true?

152
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,120
No. The bottle was half-empty.
I thought he wanted it

153
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,040
disposed of.

154
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,000
Liar! I only took one sip.

155
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
Stop making excuses.

156
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,280

157
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:56,920
Cui.

158
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,120
I apologize for the inconvenience.

159
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,000
Please, calm down.

160
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
We'll handle this matter.

161
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:09,840
How did this happen?

162
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
It's okay. Don't worry.

163
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,640
Boss will take care of it.

164
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:14,288
He won't let Mr. Cui get mistreated.

165
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:17,440
Let me get you a new bottle.

166
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,040
Fine.

167
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,480
That's more like it.

168

keep him around?

169
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,520
You should've fired him!

170
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,360
Fired?

171
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,960
What did he mean by "fired"?

172
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,480
Cui, go pack your things.

173
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,840
Are you really letting him go?

174
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,120
You're firing him

175
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,222
over a bottle of wine?

176
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,080
Drinking on the job
and tampering with guest belongings

177
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,840
are serious violations.

178
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,160
He wasn't stealing.
He thought it was discarded.

179
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,600
How was he supposed to know?

180
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,120
Yi Ran.

181
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:10,311
It's already decided.

182
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,640
Cui.

183
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240

Me too.

188
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,800
I chose to leave.

189
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,640
I was the one who asked Mr. Xiao.

190
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm 72 now.

191
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,640

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,640
But I stayed here

193
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,640
because I was waiting
for my wife to come back.

194
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
To be honest,

195
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,160
it's been over 20 years.

196
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,280
I think I've waited long enough.

197
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,360
While I still can,

198
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,960
I want to go look for her.

199
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,800
This is

200
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,760
just the right time to leave.

201
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
It's a good thing.

202
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,720
Please, don't misunderstand Mr. Xiao.

203
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,840
He truly sees us as family.

204
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,280
We were wrong about him.

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,760
In that case,

206
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
we wish you a happy retirement.

207
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,960
Safe travels.

208
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,160
Thank you.

209
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,080
Safe travels.

210
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,600
- Safe travels.
- Safe travels.

211
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,120
Thank you.

212
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,444
- Safe travels.
- Safe travels.

213
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,440
I'll miss you all.

214
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,360
Mr. Xiao, you must be tired.

215
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,080
Why are you working so late at night?

216
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,640
Take a break.

217
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,780
(I'm sorry.)

218
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,820
(I'm sorry. Smile a little.)

219
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,866
(Smile a little. Hahaha.)

220
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,260
(I'm sorry. Smile a little. Hahaha.
Universal Coupon.)

221
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,800
Universal Coupon?

222
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,600
How "universal" is it?

223
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
The esteemed guest
can request anything.

224
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,680
Whatever you want.

225
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,920
Really?

226
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,240
Anything I want?

227
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,520
Don't stop.

228
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,440
Keep massaging.

229
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Boss, how about
we trade for a different coupon?

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,640
How about a food voucher?

231
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,040
No.

232
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,400
Obedience voucher?

233
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,560
Nope.

234
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,440
A "come at my call" voucher?

235
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,400
Nope.

236
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,920
So, it's a no?

237
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,100
(Does anyone even stay here?)

238
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,860
(Filthy and awful!)

239
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,459
(Found a stain on the bed!
Terrible service!)

240
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,600
(Staff can't communicate!
No one cleans! Never coming back!)

241
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,240
What kind of dump is this hotel?

242
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,120
It looks nothing
like the pictures online!

243
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
Are you ripping people off?

244
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,800
Madam, this is the deluxe
king room you booked.

245
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,440
If you want,

246
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,560
we can get you another room.

247
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,360
You are utterly taking me for a fool.

248
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,320
Give me a refund!

249
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,280
Madam!

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Madam!

251
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:25,640
Take a sniff yourself.

252
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,888
Doesn't it smell weird?

253
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Sir,

254
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,360
our room amenities

255
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,960
undergo strict sanitization.

256
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
They are safe to use.

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,280
It's all over the internet!

258
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,755
People have used
these kettles to boil socks and rags!

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,960
That's impossible.

260
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,720
We sanitize them after every guest.

261
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,160
Enough! I don't want to hear it.

262
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
I can't stay in this room!

263
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:43,644
I want a refund!

264
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,560
Sir!

265
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
I want to check out!

266
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,920
Sir!

267
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:51,200
You can't rip people off
just because you're famous!

268
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,960
Who cares about
your crappy place anyway?

269
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,520
Listen here,

270
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,440
if you don't have proof,
this is slander.

271
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,560
I'll sue you for this!

272
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,440
Madam, please don't be upset.

273
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,960
Our housekeeping records do show

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,280
that a few items are missing.

275
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,266
And you expect me to stay calm?

276
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,640
How am I supposed to stay calm?!

277
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Think carefully.

278
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:08,120
Can you really

279
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,600
take responsibility for this?

280
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,400
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Where did this come from?

282
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,777
Hey, it has nothing to do with me!
Don't pin this on me!

283
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,920
As of 8 AM this morning,

284
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,440
these are the trending topics
and keywords we've monitored.

285
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,960
"Spring Sea Hotel security issues."

286
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:38,866
"The hotel falsely accuses guests
of stealing towels and tableware."

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,360
"Spring Sea Hotel,
overpriced and poorly maintained."

288
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:42,800
"Unpleasant odor."

289
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
We expect peak discussions
at 3 PM and 8 PM today.

290
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,088
During these time slots,

291
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,000
we'll likely see
another surge in the Internet.

292
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:50,960
Security issues?

293
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,840
Is this about
the Gao Xu attack incident?

294
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,880
Yes.

295
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,200
Even though PR has done
emergency damage control,

296
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,400
there are still people online blowing it

297
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,480
out of proportion.

298
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,880
Could someone be targeting us?

299
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:04,560
Whether this is

300
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,040
a deliberate attack or not,

301
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,120
with public opinion already so high,

302
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,120
whatever we do will be wrong.

303
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,720
So for now, we let it cool down.

304
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
Internally, though,

305
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,222
we need a contingency plan.

306
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,400
Also,

307
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,080
for dissatisfied guests,

308
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,440
besides offering reassurances,

309
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,720
we must provide concrete solutions

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,200
and compensation options.

311
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,120
As for those who are slandering us,

312
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
we respond with evidence.

313
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,480
No unnecessary conflicts.

314
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
If anyone encounters
a problem you can't handle,

315
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,933
report to me immediately.

316
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,320
Understood.

317
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
The situation is urgent.

318
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,266
Each department
will respond accordingly.

319
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:39,977
If issues arise, we'll be in contact.

320
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,840
However, the top priority

321
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:44,355
is to solve the root of the problem
as soon as possible.

322
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,820
(Hallway 1)

323
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,180
(Hallway 3)

324
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,220
(Elevator Door 1)

325
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,280
(Thank you for staying here.
Do come again.)

326
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,760
Sure.

327
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,080
We'll be seeing
each other again very soon.

328
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,155
Find out everything about this guy.

329
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,360
Mr. Wang is

330
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,680
the project lead

331
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,120
at a PR firm called Deman.

332
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,080
That recent online smear campaign

333
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
seems to involve this company as well.

334
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,560
Deman...

335
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,880
Why would Deman come after us?

336
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,480
That's still unclear.

337
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,120
But interestingly,

338
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,800
one of the companies backing them

339
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,760
is TY Group.

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
So this whole thing

341
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
was never a coincidence.

342
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm coming! Stop knocking!

343
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,280
Lin Youjia, what are you doing?

344
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,444
Have you lost your mind? Let go!

345
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,080
Listen up.

346
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,440
Come after me if you want.

347
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,680
But if you mess with my hotel,

348
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,560
I'll make you pay!

349
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
Are you insane?

350
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Why would I go after you?

351
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,160
So, you really don't know?

352
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,360
That PR firm, Deman, is involved in

353
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,022
everything that has happened recently.

354
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,360
Does the name ring a bell?

355
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,000
I refused to work with you.

356
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,155
So, you're trying to ruin
Spring Sea out of spite?

357
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,880
Xiao Mucheng.

358
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't like you.

359
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,400
I might even hate you.

360
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:48,200
But, I'm not low enough
to pull something like this.

361
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:49,680
Before you accuse someone,

362
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,520
get your facts straight.

363
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,240
You know very well what you did.

364
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,880
Just pray I don't find proof.

365
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,400
Hello, Mr. Lin Jr.

366
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Are you responsible
for this mess with Spring Sea?

367
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Spring Sea should no longer worry you.

368
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:15,880
What do you mean?

369
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
What are you implying?

370
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,910
It's what Mr. Lin Sr. decided.

371
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,640
From now on,

372
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
he'll handle
everything with Spring Sea.

373
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,640
Lin Sr. is back?

374
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,800
Mr. Lin Sr.

375
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,880
Long time no see.

376
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,200
Indeed, Chairman Xiao.

377
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,400
It's been a while.

378
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
I didn't expect Mr. Lin Sr.
and Chairman Xiao

379
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,240
to already know each other.

380
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,520
Oh, it's more than that.

381
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,320
Let me tell you an inside scoop.

382
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,000
Over twenty years ago,

383
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,280
when Spring Sea first started out,

384
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:13,080
Mr. Lin Sr. was one of its investors.

385
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,720
No way, really?

386
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,960
Well,

387
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,520
where do you even hear this stuff?

388
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,520
I won't vouch for everything,

389
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,680
but this scoop is solid.

390
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,120
I heard they had disagreements
over business philosophy.

391
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Eventually,
Chairman Xiao forced him out.

392
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,800
After that, somehow,

393
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,840
he made a fortune in real estate.

394
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,960
But TY always
finds a way to get involved

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,440
with anything even remotely
related to our group.

396
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,440
This sounds like

397
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,840
some twisted love-hate rivalry.

398
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,640
Therefore,

399
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,440
Mr. Lin Sr.'s arrival

400
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,800
is definitely not a coincidence.

401
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,040
We can all see
the current state of Spring Sea.

402
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:16,520
A partnership between TY and Spring Sea

403
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,120
would be a win-win for both of us.

404
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Why not go for it?

405
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,760
You sure make it sound good.

406
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,000
"Partnership"?

407
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
More like looting a burning house.

408
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,960
And calling it a "win-win" at that.

409
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,600
That's a slick move.

410
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,920
You flatter me, Chairman Xiao.

411
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,200
Xudong.

412
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,320
Back then,
I was too young, too reckless.

413
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,600
Didn't know how to hide my emotions.

414
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,080
It's been over twenty years.

415
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,720
What grudge could still
be worth holding?

416
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,000
We've lived a long life.

417
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,640
There are things

418
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
you can't just let go whenever you want.

419
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,960
However, I should thank you.

420
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,040
If you hadn't kicked me out back then,

421
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
I wouldn't have made it this far.

422
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,640
To be honest...

423
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,360
I took you as my role model.

424
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,640
I spent twenty years working my way up.

425
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,080
As for whether I'm here
to offer a helping hand

426
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,160
or to strike while the iron's hot,

427
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,760
Chairman Xiao,

428
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,240
take your time and think it over.

429
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,320
Alright.

430
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,240
Give them a few days to think it over.

431
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,880
I doubt those old foxes
will turn it down.

432
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,520
Ignore him.

433
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,040
From now on,
report everything directly to me.

434
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,720
To the hotel.

435
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,600
Yes, sir.

436
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,880
Hold on.

437
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,840
Speak.

438
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,320
What do you want?

439
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,840
What are you up to?

440
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,760
Are you behind the smear campaign?

441
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
It's none of your business. Leave.

442
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,480
None of my business?

443
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,400
You promised
I'd handle Spring Sea's case.

444
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:38,120
Why did you take it away from me?

445
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,000
And you have the nerve to ask?

446
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,511
Since you were a kid,

447
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,440
when have you ever

448
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,920
done a single thing right?

449
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,200
You ended up
spending money at Spring Sea!

450
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,440
Are you trying to help them
hit their sales targets?

451
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
You are worthless to me!

452
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,680
If you weren't my son,

453
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,240
I'd have kicked you out ages ago!

454
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,240
Fine.

455
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,320
I'll show you

456
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,960
what this worthless son can do.

457
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,120
Why you...

458
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,360
You are a fool!

459
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,022
Haifeng Group canceled

460
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,622
their contract for the next quarter.

461
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Other long-time clients
are getting distant, too.

462
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,880
We should be

463
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
in the peak season for conferences.

464
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
But at this rate,

465
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,720
we'll be stuck hosting small meetings.

466
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,400
Year-end room sales aren't looking good.

467
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,240
Yeah.

468
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,320
That's why we still
need to push forward

469
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,520
with other corporate deals.

470
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,080
This is the employee incentive plan
we drafted.

471
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:28,700
(Employee Incentive Plan)
In a time like this, we need to boost morale.

472
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,080
Starting tomorrow,

473
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,360
I'll be handling
the hotel's recruitment interviews.

474
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Follow up on everything we discussed.

475
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,755
Got it. I'll handle
the client coordination.

476
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,400
We could also grant some VIP privileges

477
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,160
based on the situation.

478
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,320
Understood.

479
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,760
What's this?

480
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,720
Red date tea.

481
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,200
Staying up late

482
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,920
can cause fatigue and poor circulation.

483
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,480
Drinking red date tea regularly

484
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:45,760
boosts energy and blood flow.

485
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,320
I made this

486
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,800
for my boyfriend.

487
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,880
I suddenly feel so energized.

488
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,440
It doesn't work that fast.

489
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,120
Are things not going well?

490
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,240
The public backlash hasn't settled yet.

491
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,680
This month's performance
has clearly dropped.

492
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,320
To be the best,

493
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,640
we'll need to try something else.

494
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,080
It's the off-season for tourism.

495
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,080
Conferences and rooms aren't enough

496
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,400
to raise occupancy rates.

497
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,800
It's tough.

498
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,880
Any ideas?

499
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,640
Maybe this is an opportunity.

500
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,160
The red dates in this tea

501
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,400
are locally sourced.

502
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,440
What if we partner

503
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,400
with local farmers

504
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,640
and host an event?

505
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,800
It could attract nearby customers

506
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,320
for short-term stays.

507
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
It will support farmers

508
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,440
and boost hotel occupancy.

509
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,880
If it's successful,

510
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,760
we could turn it into an annual

511
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
red date harvest festival.

512
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,200
And then,

513
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,520
we could make this red date tea

514
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,640
into tea bags.

515
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,080
We can replace the usual

516
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,720
black and green tea in the rooms,

517
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,400
and set up

518
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
a counter in the hotel to sell them

519
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,720
as souvenirs to the guests.

520
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,320
I...

521
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,320
I just blurted it out.

522
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,080
If you think it's a bad idea,

523
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:36,040
just pretend...

524
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,640
No.

525
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I think you have a great business mind.

526
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,280
Honestly,

527
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,680
keeping you in the Housekeeping
Department is a waste.

528
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:45,280
So, you finally see my talent.

529
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:46,920
I was actually planning

530
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,360
to start my own business.

531
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,120
And now?

532
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,520
I'm reluctantly working for you.

533
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,280
What, do you hate the job?

534
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
Too bad.

535
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
I happen to like you too much.

536
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,555
I have an interview tomorrow,

537
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,480
so I'll fight by your side today.

538
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,680
Relax.

539
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,920
I won't get in your way.

540
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,640
Don't bother me while I study.

541
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
Stop staring at me.

542
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,320
I need to focus.

543
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,133
Morning, Mr. Xiao.

544
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,480
You should head back.

545
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,888
It's not a good look
if people see you here.

546
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Don't feel stressed.

547
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,280
Just do your best.

548
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,120
Okay.

549
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,240
I'm going in.

550
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,880
Boss, I knew I'd find you here.

551
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,160
Why didn't you answer my calls?

552
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,320
I left it in the office.

553
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,200
Chairman Xiao called
a shareholders' meeting.

554
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:41,177
They're negotiating with TY
about acquiring us.

555
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,560
We're no strangers.

556
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,960
Let's get straight to it.

557
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Can you introduce yourself in English?

558
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Good morning, everyone.

559
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,760
It's my honor to be here.

560
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,680
Everyone,

561
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,280
once we invest this capital,

562
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
within a year,

563
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
we will transform
this outdated and stagnant hotel

564
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,640
into the city's most dynamic,

565
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,440
cutting-edge,

566
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,360
and tech-driven smart hotel.

567
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,520
I really appreciate you offering me
the chance of this interview.

568
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,000
Now, I'll introduce myself first.

569
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,160
My name is Yi Ran.

570
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,200
Our proposal

571
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,720
is not only innovative, convenient,

572
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,160
reliable, and secure,

573
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,480
but also

574
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,080
reduces labor costs by 90%.

575
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,360
This will significantly

576
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,080
cut down Spring Sea's massive expenses.

577
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,400
Instead of sticking to the old ways,

578
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,000
why not embrace change?

579
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,000
I believe that through
our upgrades and transformation,

580
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,040
we will redefine
Spring Sea's brand value.

581
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,200
Smart hotels are
the future of this industry.

582
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,000
If we seize the opportunity now,

583
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,720
Spring Sea's potential
will be limitless.

584
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,640
That's right.
We should keep up with the times.

585
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,040
Am I right, Xiao?

586
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,760
I'll have Han Bin handle the follow-up.

587
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,600
Chairman Xiao.

588
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,400
That's your son?

589
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,360
Yes.

590
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,600
The young are impressive.

591
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,960
One last question.

592
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,040
How do you think we can provide

593
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
the perfect service for our guests?

594
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,800
I don't think

595
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,240
such a thing exists.

596
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,120
Guest needs aren't quantifiable.

597
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,240
They're fluid.

598
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,040
Sometimes,

599
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,400
they don't even know

600
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,200
what they want.

601
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,400
My family used to run a small inn.

602
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,400
Ten yuan for a bed,

603
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,160
and twenty yuan for a room.

604
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,080
You had to boil your own water

605
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:19,511
and wait in line for the shower.

606
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,520
It wasn't fancy,

607
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,480
but no one ever thought it was bad.

608
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,000
People from all over gathered there,

609
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,560
became friends,

610
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,960
and shared their joys and sorrows.

611
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,880
It felt like one big family,

612
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,240
warm and welcoming.

613
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,640
That's

614
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,760
what I love about this industry.

615
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,280
I want to treat every guest

616
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,280
like a new neighbor,

617
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,360
a new friend.

618
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,400
I want them

619
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,880
to find a sense of belonging

620
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,280
in our hotel.

621
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,360
That, to me,

622
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,240
is the best service I can offer.

623
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,800
That's a great answer.

624
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,880
But I'm sorry.

625
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,160
I can't pass you.

626
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,120
Personally, I think you're great.

627
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,440
But...

628
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
our hiring standards
for full-time staff

629
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,800
are quite high.

630
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,888
Given your current
education and experience...

631
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,640
I understand.

632
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,000
Thank you for your time.

633
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,320
That's all from me.

634
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,160
What are you doing?

635
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,640
Step outside.

636
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,400
Chairman.

637
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,840
I said, step outside!

638
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I'll wait outside.

639
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,560
Why?

640
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,400
How can you be so heartless?

641
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,680
I'm done

642
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,000
talking about this.

643
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,120
You know how much
Spring Sea means to me.

644
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,800
You and Mom built this hotel

645
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,520
through years of hard work.

646
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,640
Before she passed,

647
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,360
she wanted to protect this place.

648
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,400
And now you're just handing it over?

649
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,240
Do you truly believe

650
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,640
everything can be replaced?

651
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,640
That everything has a price?

652
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,120
Before she died,

653
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
you swore to her.

654
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,400
You promised to protect the hotel.

655
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:23,511
What happened to that promise?

656
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,280
Was it a lie?

657
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,840
What is this? Are you even a man?

658
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,080
Stop being so selfish!

659
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,320
Tell that to the shareholders.

660
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,840
Xiao Mucheng.

661
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,880
Grow up!

662
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,320
Sure, you've helped Spring Sea improve,

663
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,960
but can it compete
with these new hotels?

664
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
This isn't just about me.

665
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,120
Do you understand that?

666
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,680
Yeah.

667
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,680
In your eyes,

668
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,640
I'll always be a child
who refuses to grow up.

669
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,640
The contract isn't up yet.

670
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,960
I'll finish my job properly.

671
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,320
One more thing.

672
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,480
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

673
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
About today's interview...

674
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,720
I already knew the result.

675
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,720
I let you down.

676
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,640
I'm sorry.

677
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,000
It's okay.

678
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,920
I can always try again.

679
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,640
How about you?

680
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:43,520
I had a huge fight with my dad.

681
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,160
Why?

682
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,920
It's not because of me, is it?

683
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:51,311
He wants to give up the hotel.

684
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
He's handing it over?

685
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,480
It's a long story.

686
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,720
How about a short getaway?

687
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,760
Sure, where to?

688
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:04,520
We can get a room.

689
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:17,550
I'll roll down the window

690
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,600
or just stick my head out?

691
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,580
Action.

692
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,790
Stop being so selfish!

693
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,740
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

694
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,390
Smart hotels do have their advantages,

695
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,860
but they're still not perfect.

696
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,450
Just glance at her in the middle.

697
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,060
Thank her for driving you.

698
00:40:35,288 --> 00:40:36,040
Take it out first.

699
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,830
Then speak directly.

700
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,280
And then open it.

701
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,360
=The Quirky and The Charming=
