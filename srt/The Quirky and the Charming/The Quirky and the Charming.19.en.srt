(Online Revenue)

4
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:28,000
Although we didn't meet expectations,

5
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,480
but this quarter's total revenue

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,480
has already surpassed
the first half of the year's total.

7
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,640
If we can sustain this growth...

8
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,560
I don't see the point in continuing.

9
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,880
Since we failed to reach our target,

10
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,640
why should we believe you can deliver

11
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,240
better returns
than TY in the short term?

12
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,600
You're young.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,960
You should know

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,520
what it means to keep up with the times.

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,600
Cold, lifeless machines

16
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
can never replace warm,
genuine service.

17
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,240
What we offer is heartfelt hospitality.

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,760
A home away from home.

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,720
We can't just focus on short-term gains

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,880
and forget why we got into
the hotel business.

21
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,080
I ask all of you

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
to give Spring Sea a chance.

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,240
The young man makes a good point.

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
However,

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,120
business is built on profit.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Are we supposed to run on nostalgia?

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,240
You can't expect others to foot the bill

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
for your sentimental vision.

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,600
Let's proceed with the vote.

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,960
All in favor of TY joining,
raise your hand.

31
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,440
The majority is in favor.

32
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,160
I hereby announce
that TY will officially join...

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,120
I object.

34
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,580
=The Quirky and The Charming=

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,640
Chairman Xiao.

36
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,840
What good is your objection?

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,680
You are protective of your son.

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,360
I get it.

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,720
It's touching, really.

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
But your one vote against it

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,080
doesn't change a thing.

42
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,240
By the way,

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,080
your office has quite the view.

44
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Better start packing it up for me.

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
First thing tomorrow,

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,880
our team will move into Spring Sea.

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,520
Who said my vote doesn't matter?

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,640
Gentlemen,

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,840
have you all forgotten?

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,720
As the founder of Spring Sea Group,

51
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:50,844
per the company charter,

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,160
when it comes to major decisions,

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,440
I hold veto power.

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,440
What do you mean?

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,360
You...

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Why are you only saying this now?

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,880
Mr. Chen.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,466
As the shareholder representative,

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,720
you should speak up.

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,600
We've never had this happen before.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,600
But yes, Chairman Xiao
does have veto power.

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,160
If he objects,

63
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,640
there's nothing the board can do.

64
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,488
(Voting in Progress)

65
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:33,480
This is ridiculous.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,920
He's willing to risk
everything for his son,

67
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,840
but are you shareholders

68
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,520
really willing

69
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,600
to go down with him?

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,960
This...

71
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,960
Here, take a look.

72
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,800
(Overseas Online Marketing Data)
This just came in

73
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,640
from the Marketing
Department minutes ago.

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
The latest overseas marketing data.

75
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
With this added,

76
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,360
their total revenue
in the past three months

77
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,800
has exceeded 20 million.

78
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,760
They've proven

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,560
with facts

80
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
that the lodging-plus-e-commerce
model works.

81
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,840
On a personal level, Mucheng is my son.

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,760
As long as he's doing the right thing,

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,840
I'll stand by him unconditionally.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,680
Mr. Lin Sr.

85
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,000
My office does have a great view.

86
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,680
If you like it,

87
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,360
drop by for tea anytime.

88
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,520
Spring Sea Group always welcomes you.

89
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,200
Veto power.

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
That's a crucial detail.

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,640
So, why didn't you tell me?

92
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
Now I see it.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,177
From the very beginning,

94
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
you and Xiao Bohan
were in on this together.

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,040
You were playing me for a fool!

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Lin Sr., I have no idea
what you're talking about.

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,320
No wonder you knew our hotel operations

98
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,160
inside out.

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,760
No wonder you chose to step in now.

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,520
It was you all along.

101
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:20,888
Chairman Xiao.

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,560
No, listen to me!

103
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,360
- Enough!
- I...

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,280
Just wait and see.

105
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,840
Mr. Lin Sr! Mr. Lin Sr!

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,520
Mr. Lin Sr!

107
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,440
Chairman Xiao.

108
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,360
Chairman Xiao, I was wrong.

109
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,120
I swear I didn't tell him anything.

110
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,880
Really!

111
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,600
Please, give me another chance!

112
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
I already gave you one.

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,320
You didn't cherish it.

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,320
Mucheng, handle this.

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,520
No leniency.

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,880
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,840
Alright, gentlemen.

118
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
Meeting adjourned.

119
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,640
Mr. Lin Sr., please calm down.

120
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:14,560
Take it easy, sir.

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
That old fox, Xiao Bohan...

122
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
I can't believe he played me again!

123
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,360
And that traitor Xu Hang

124
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,720
is a cursed ingrate!

125
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:23,920
Mr. Lin Sr.,

126
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,300
under normal circumstances,

127
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,840
corporate law doesn't allow

128
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
a single veto power.

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,680
But, as the founder,

130
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,840
Chairman Xiao had the right

131
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,880
to establish additional clauses
when the board was formed.

132
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,840
Mr. Lin Sr.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,760
Do you think I don't know all this?

134
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,680
This is all on Xu Hang!

135
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,120
He should've verified
this important detail!

136
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,920
He betrayed my trust!

137
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
And you too!

138
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,080
I told you to keep
Xiao Mucheng in check.

139
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,320
I gave you all that money!
What did you do with it?

140
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,320
Every last one of you is useless!

141
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,560
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,822
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin Sr.

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Actually...

144
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,640
Actually, over the past few months,

145
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,990
Mr. Lin Jr. has brought
quite a few resources to Spring Sea.

146
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,320
What did you just say?

147
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,080
Cheers!

148
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,640
Cheers!

149
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:25,488
Thanks to all of you,

150
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,400
I was able to keep Spring Sea safe.

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,880
Honestly,

152
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,680
the connections you brought in
really carried the day.

153
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Here, have a chicken wing.

154
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,080
No, I didn't help you guys.

155
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
You're all happy now,

156
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:39,222
but if my dad finds out
I had a hand in this,

157
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,440
he'll kill me.

158
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,640
Whatever happens,
I had nothing to do with it.

159
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,000
This chicken wing
should go to Ms. Ling.

160
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,840
Yishu.

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,600
Thank you.

162
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:55,044
Don't read too much into it.

163
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:56,080
I didn't do it for you.

164
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,280
Strong opponents make you stronger.

165
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,960
Because I had a rival like you,

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,480
I got to where I am today.

167
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,640
In my heart,

168
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,360
protecting my rival is
just as important as protecting myself.

169
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,320
That's why Spring Sea
must stay standing.

170
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,280
I think the credit for this victory

171
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,560
should go to those fighting
on the frontlines.

172
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
So, should I

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
give you a compliment just for show?

174
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,600
Please don't.

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
I really appreciate all of you.

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,160
No need for long speeches of gratitude.

177
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,200
It's all in the drink.

178
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,040
Cheers!

179
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,200
Cheers!

180
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,600
Cheers!

181
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,200
Cheers!

182
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,440
Mucheng.

183
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
Come on, time to eat.

184
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Don't just stare at it. Eat.

185
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,400
I haven't cooked in a while.

186
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
Not sure how it turned out.

187
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,640
Here, try it.

188
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,480
Not bad.

189
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,720
Well?

190
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,640
Tastes just like Mom's cooking.

191
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:39,520
You probably don't know this.

192
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,920
But your mom

193
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,240
learned it from me.

194
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,960
She had a weak stomach back then.

195
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,800
Whenever it acted up,
she couldn't eat a thing.

196
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,200
The only thing she wanted
was this bowl of noodles.

197
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,720
And that's how I won her over.

198
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,360
It's a shame, though.

199
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,320
After we got married,

200
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,600
I never cooked again.

201
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,040
She took care of cooking

202
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,440
and making noodles.

203
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,222
She held this family together.

204
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
It wasn't easy for her.

205
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,440
You're right.

206
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,120
I failed her.

207
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,880
Dad.

208
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,800
Can I ask you something?

209
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
What made you change your mind?

210
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,600
Chairman Xiao.

211
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
I have something to say.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Go ahead.

213
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
I hope you won't give up on the hotel.

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,800
I've said it before.

215
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
A win is a win. A loss is a loss.

216
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,960
You can't always
pin your hopes on others.

217
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,160
But not everything in life
is about winning or losing.

218
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,880
To Mr. Xiao,

219
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,760
this hotel was built
by you and your wife.

220
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,440
It's proof of her existence
in this world,

221
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,440
a bridge that holds
your family's memories.

222
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,080
That's why he's fighting so hard

223
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,360
to keep Spring Sea alive.

224
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
And you?

225
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,480
What's most important,

226
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
if not family?

227
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
Even with all the money in the world,

228
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,080
is it worth losing
the people who matter most?

229
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:44,040
Don't talk to me about what's worth it.

230
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,160
You have no idea

231
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,240
what I've sacrificed for this family.

232
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,520
Maybe you have sacrificed a lot.

233
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
But, if you keep being this stubborn,

234
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,222
I'm afraid you'll end up losing
the only family you have left.

235
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,080
If winning means
more to you than family,

236
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
then you don't deserve to be a husband,

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,440
or a father.

238
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,080
Wait.

239
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,720
That girl

240
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
reminded me of your mother.

241
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
She is bold

242
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,640
and determined.

243
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
It's no wonder you love her.

244
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,240
That said,

245
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,360
you can't let your guard down.

246
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,080
I used my veto power

247
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,960
to keep the hotel in your hands,

248
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,760
but

249
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
if you don't meet your targets on time,

250
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,511
the shareholders won't be convinced.

251
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,360
Don't worry.

252
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,360
Dad.

253
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,400
Dad!

254
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,360
Dad!

255
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,040
Dad!

256
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,920
Never mind.

257
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,660
Never mind!

258
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,760
You ungrateful son!

259
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,360
How dare you team up
with an outsider against me?

260
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,720
Dad.

261
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,640
Calm down.

262
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,920
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

263
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
Misunderstanding?

264
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,400
Don't play dumb with me.

265
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,480
Since when have you ever
been able to hide anything from me?

266
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,480
I just

267
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,360
introduced them to a small client.

268
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,560
A small client?

269
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,040
You call that a small client?

270
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,200
You threw in tens of millions yourself,

271
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,240
and you call that small?

272
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,240
How did I end up with such failure

273
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,280
of a son?

274
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,720
Well, you froze my credit cards

275
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,720
to punish me.

276
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Besides, Spring Sea is old and outdated.

277
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,440
It's an antique.

278
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,600
You know nothing!

279
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
I'll beat you to death!

280
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,480
I'll end you!

281
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,120
You ungrateful money-waster!

282
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,920
I'll kill you!

283
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,080
I'll kill you!

284
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,680
I...

285
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,800
Dad?

286
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,120
Dad!

287
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,440
What's wrong?

288
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,280
Dad!

289
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:02,333
Your blood pressure is at 160.
It hasn't come down yet.

290
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,400
Try to get some rest.

291
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:05,200
If you feel unwell,
press the call button.

292
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,000
Alright.

293
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
At your age,

294
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,200
why are you still acting like a child?

295
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,040
Besides taking your meds on time,

296
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,360
you need to strictly
control your sugar intake.

297
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,640
I only eat sweets
to help me quit smoking.

298
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,920
You should quit smoking too.

299
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Alright, just lie down
and rest for a bit.

300
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,560
I'll have the nurse
check your blood sugar later.

301
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,360
Okay.

302
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,840
No wonder the voice sounded familiar.

303
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,120
What a small world, huh?

304
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
What happened?
Trouble at Spring Sea?

305
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:55,280
What got you so worked up
that you landed in the hospital?

306
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,080
No worries.

307
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,880
We've known each other for years.

308
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,240
If you regret it now, it's not too late.

309
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
Regret? What would I regret it?

310
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm just here for a routine check-up.

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,080
Routine check-up?

312
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,560
Give me a break.

313
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't try to be tough.

314
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,400
I heard everything just now.

315
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,280
Who was it they said has hypertension?

316
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
My neighbor is 103 years old.

317
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,200
She is still walking like a champ.

318
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,560
You know why?

319
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,400
How would I know?

320
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,000
Because she minds her own business.

321
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,480
Why you...

322
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
At this age,
having high blood pressure is normal.

323
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
But you,

324
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:43,600
it looks like you'll be
staying for a while.

325
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,040
Need me to recommend a specialist?

326
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,480
You...

327
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Mind your own business.

328
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
You? Finding me a specialist?

329
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,990
Take a good look at yourself.

330
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,920
You should

331
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,640
get your temper checked!

332
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,920
Between the two of us,
who's really the one with anger issues?

333
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,440
My son's coming to pick me up soon.

334
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,520
I'll be well taken care of at home.

335
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,920
Where's your son?

336
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
My son? My son is...

337
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,520
What does this have to do with my son?

338
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,800
Oh, come on.

339
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,960
Your son has contributed
to the success of this matter.

340
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,320
Mr. Lin Sr., you really raised him well.

341
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,555
So, by extension,
you deserve some credit too.

342
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,240
Look.

343
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,380
Once you're discharged,
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

344
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
I really have to thank you.

345
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,680
You...

346
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,160
I'll show you...

347
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
Stop talking nonsense!

348
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:44,960
Still faking it?

349
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,480
Still putting on an act?

350
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,960
Xudong! Xu...

351
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,000
Doctor! Doctor!

352
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,000
Xudong, you...

353
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:54,200
The call button!

354
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,600
Press it! Hurry!

355
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,920
Doctor!

356
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,520
Doctor!

357
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,040
What did you wish for?

358
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,200
I hope Spring Sea

359
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,680
can take first place this year.

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,480
I hope all our hotel colleagues

361
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,760
stay happy and healthy.

362
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,400
And I hope Grandma lives a long life.

363
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,720
That's a lot of wishes.

364
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,280
Can heaven keep track of all that?

365
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,720
Wishing doesn't cost anything.

366
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,200
Might as well make a few more.

367
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Greedy.

368
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, right.

369
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:52,760
Are you free tomorrow night?

370
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,920
I booked a restaurant.

371
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,222
Let's have dinner together.

372
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
That sounds formal.

373
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,080
A special occasion.

374
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,560
I'll think about it.

375
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:08,200
You can think about it,
but you're not allowed to say no.

376
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
One rose tea, please.

377
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Sure. In a moment.

378
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,840
Handsome, can you buy me a drink?

379
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,120
Don't be so stingy.

380
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,760
My fierce beloved is coming.

381
00:20:57,844 --> 00:20:59,000
She's right behind you.

382
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,640
How's your dad?

383
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,400
He went home to rest.

384
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,200
This time,

385
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
he was really pissed.

386
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Now that the Spring Sea
situation is settled,

387
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,120
what are you planning next?

388
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,680
I'll figure it out later.

389
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,800
But, I probably won't stay here.

390
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:44,600
- You...
- I...

391
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,240
You go first.

392
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,040
I've arrived.

393
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,280
What were you going to say?

394
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,480
Nothing.

395
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't know if we'll
ever cross paths again.

396
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,640
I guess this is it.

397
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,520
Since we met,

398
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,680
consider this my parting words.

I'm late.

426
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,160
Not at all. You're right on time.

427
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,280
Come.

428
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,800
Sit down. Check the menu.

429
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,600
Order.

430
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,400
There's something I want to tell you.

431
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,280
What is it?

432
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,600
Promise me

433
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,240
you won't get mad after I tell you.

434
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,480
Actually...

435
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,360
You didn't pass the test that day

436
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,120
because I asked Yan Xu to fail you.

437
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
I know I shouldn't have
made that decision for you.

438
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,044
But compared
to Housekeeping Department,

439
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,080
I think you deserve a bigger stage.

440
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:29,680
You shouldn't be tied down by me.

441
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,480
Actually, I have
something to tell you too.

442
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,920
And you can't get mad either.

443
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm planning to leave for a while.

444
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,840
If you want me to say yes
to your request,

445
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,920
you must agree to one condition.

446
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,480
Anything.

447
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,800
Alright.

448
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,640
I saw everything

449
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,320
you did for Mucheng.

450
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,440
If you truly want to help him,

451
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,880
and if you want to stay by his side,

452
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
it takes more than just effort.

453
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,440
You need real skills.

454
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:14,777
I'll send you for advanced training.

455
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,440
Two years.

456
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,240
These two years will test not just you,

457
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,480
but your relationship too.

458
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,200
If you agree, I'll say yes.

459
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,640
Yes.

460
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,920
No. I won't let you go.

461
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,040
Why not?

462
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,880
I think Chairman Xiao has a point.

463
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,440
If we want to be together long-term,

464
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
just working hard won't be enough.

465
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,080
I need to improve myself too.

466
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,440
More importantly,

467
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
this is something I've always wanted.

468
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,040
You've made up your mind?

469
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,960
I hope you'll support me.

470
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,800
Alright.

471
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,480
I support you.

472
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,000
Go ahead.

473
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,520
Really?

474
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,760
You're not against it?

475
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,480
Like I said,

476
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,000
you shouldn't be

477
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,160
stuck in that tiny
Housekeeping Department.

478
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
You deserve a bigger stage.

479
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:33,720
It's just

480
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:36,400
that the thought
of being apart for so long...

481
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,400
It's only two years.

482
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,680
It'll go by fast.

483
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,080
Then, study hard while you're there.

484
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,880
I'll be at Spring Sea.

485
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,840
I'll be waiting.

486
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,360
Suddenly, I realized

487
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,800
my insomnia might
actually come in handy.

488
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:13,840
Now we won't have a time difference.

489
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,900
(Kangyi Nursing Home)

490
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,640
Madam Qin.

491
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Do you remember?

492
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,000
Right after my dad passed away,

493
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,560
we were so poor
that we couldn't even afford heating.

494
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,640
It was freezing.

495
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,840
You rubbed my feet to keep me warm.

496
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,920
Back then,

497
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,240
your little feet

498
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,760
were always so cold.

499
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,160
You always wanted me
to warm them up for you.

500
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,640
You remember that?

501
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
Of course I do.

502
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,480
Time flies, doesn't it?

503
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,280
You are all grown up now.

504
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,840
Sometimes,

505
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
I wake up in the morning

506
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,480
and it feels like
everything has changed.

507
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,240
But when I look at you,

508
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,760
it feels like
nothing has changed at all.

509
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,880
Grandma.

510
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,600
I might have to leave for a while.

511
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,640
I won't be able
to visit for a long time.

512
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,160
But you finally remembered me.

513
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,200
I really don't want to be
away from you.

514
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,520
What if you forget me again?

515
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,560
Maybe I shouldn't go.

516
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,440
Chen, what's wrong?

517
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,560
You don't want to work here anymore?

518
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,960
Where are you planning to go?

519
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,280
You're confused again.

520
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm not quitting.

521
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
I just want to go study for two years.

522
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,240
Go ahead.

523
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,440
It's a good thing.

524
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,600
Young people should chase their dreams.

525
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,240
It's alright.

526
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,400
There are plenty of nurses here.

527
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
They'll take good care of me.

528
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,360
And there's Mr. Wang.

529
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,080
He dances and sings with me.

530
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,120
I've learned quite a few
dance steps from him.

531
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,520
Let me show you.

532
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,480
I'll show you my moves.

533
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,520
Careful, now!

534
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,440
Okay!

535
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,080
So, how does it go?

536
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,160
Mr. Wang told me

537
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,920
I have to start with this.

538
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,840
Watch me.

539
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,560
One-two-three.

540
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,160
Two-two-three.

541
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,800
Three-two-three...

542
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,520
Four-two-three.

543
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,680
How was my dancing?

544
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,200
You danced beautifully.

545
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,720
Oh, right.

546
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,720
Chen, remember this...

547
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,320
Call Ran for me.

548
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,440
Tell her I'm doing just fine.

549
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,280
She doesn't need to worry.

550
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,000
She doesn't need to keep visiting.

551
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,000
You know what?

552
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm happiest
when I'm by myself these days.

553
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,840
Alright.

554
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,120
I got it.

555
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,440
You young ones

556
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,400
should be out there
chasing your own dreams.

557
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,680
Go on.

558
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,280
Go.

559
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,160
Madam Qin.

560
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,000
You...

561
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,360
Hurry up and leave.

562
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Mr. Wang will be here any minute.

563
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,600
Go on.

564
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,840
Don't worry. I'll take care of Grandma.

565
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,520
Go now.

566
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,600
Go.

567
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,480
Take good care of yourself.

568
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,440
Don't worry.

569
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,440
Mr. Wang will be here soon.

570
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,240
Now go.

571
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,000
Be good and go.

572
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,800
Hurry, go.

573
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,560
Can you take me
to your childhood home?

574
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,450
I've said this too.

575
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,480
Does he have feelings?

576
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,250
I didn't do it for you.

577
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,820
A win is a win.

578
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,800
A loss is a loss.

579
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,560
What's most important,

580
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,320
if not family?

581
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,320
