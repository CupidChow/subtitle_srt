[Episode 15]

4
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,150
It's not easy to recruit soldiers.

5
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,710
A couple of days ago, the Palace Guards came to recruit soldiers.

6
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,390
They said the houses around here were mostly empty.

7
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,190
Everyone seemed to be starving.

8
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,120
I guess this time,

9
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,770
the situation will be similar for us.

10
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,270
Do you have a plan, My Lord?

11
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,230
[Jin Chang]

12
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,950
I am Jin Chang, Captain of the reserve service at Jiashan Fortress.

13
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,880
Greetings, Lord Zichuan Xiu and all the other lords.

14
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,050
Captain Jin Chang,

15
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,329
how's the recruitment going in Jixin Province?

16
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:21,790
After receiving your order,

17
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,110
I immediately announced the recruitment notice to the whole province.

18
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,230
Thanks to your blessing,

19
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,230
the recruitment is going very well.

20
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,110
Really?

21
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,500
How many people have you recruited?

22
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,340
After hearing it's Zi…

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,880
After hearing it's Zichuan…

24
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,230
After hearing…

25
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,190
After hearing it was the lords who were recruiting,

26
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,950
people all rushed to make responses.

27
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,829
Most of the recruitment mission has been completed.

28
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,110
Now, we have more than 100 reserved soldiers.

29
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,230
The average age is 30.

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,480
That's great.

31
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,560
Take Lord Xiu to have a look.

32
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,470
Please, Lords.

33
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,690
Please.

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,630
Is that the soldier you recruited?

35
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,890
No, that is the sheep he brought.

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,360
I...

37
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,760
Are you even 16?

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,210
My nominal age is 10, so I'm definitely 16.

39
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,150
You must be over 60, right?

40
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,290
Not "over." I'm 60 after rounding it off.

41
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,390
Didn't you say

42
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,320
they are all young men in their 30s?

43
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,270
I said, "the average age."

44
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,130
That's right. I've done the math.

45
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,520
It's 30. It's definitely in line with the recruitment requirements.

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,650
We're not here to open a nursing home and a kindergarten.

47
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,110
We don't need nursing.

48
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,590
I can go to the battlefield. Look.

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,920
Grandpa.

50
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,750
What's wrong?

51
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,190
It's okay. He just had a heart attack.

52
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,450
He'll be fine after lying down for a while.

53
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,910
He's experienced in that.

54
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,030
My Lord,

55
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,310
don't detest me because I'm old.

56
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,870
Don't drive me back.

57
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,630
Young people here

58
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,390
all went to the frontline

59
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,910
to kill the enemies and have all died.

60
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,070
There are indeed no young people.

61
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,750
Yes.

62
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,910
Our family hasn't eaten anything for days.

63
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,210
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

64
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,110
We haven't had anything good…

65
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,090
anything… to eat for days.

66
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,409
Don't worry.

67
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,620
Lord Xiu from the Imperial Capital is kind-hearted.

68
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,020
He won't abandon you.

69
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,580
We'll make sure you have something to eat, too.

70
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,909
Captain Jin Chang, I...

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,670
Captain Jin Chang, thank you for your hard work.

72
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,030
I didn't expect

73
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,920
the situation in Jixin Province to be so serious.

74
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,510
I'll report to the Imperial Capital and spare you from your military service.

75
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,440
Thank you, My Lord.

76
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,780
Thank you, My Lord.

77
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,460
I'll leave this place to you.

78
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,000
I have something important to ask.

79
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,120
Please go ahead.

80
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,010
I'll do anything for you.

81
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,850
Where is Chunfeng Garden?

82
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,000
The recruitment situation is so bad.

83
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,610
Are we really going to Chunfeng Garden

84
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,580
to have fun while taking the risk of being accused of defying orders?

85
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,220
To be honest, I might not be able to…

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,030
Can you use your brain?

87
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,670
How could such a good thing happen to us?

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,640
Have you ever seen an old man

89
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,950
with a heart disease looking so strong?

90
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,909
Have you seen a kid who's never been full before yet still so chubby?

91
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,590
You mean...

92
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,420
we can't trust Jin Chang's words completely?

93
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,510
There's more to it?

94
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,780
So,

95
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,470
we're going to Chunfeng Garden.

96
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,130
Then, are you going to Chunfeng…

97
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,110
What is Chunfeng Garden?

98
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,430
It's the collecting and distributing center for information.

99
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,690
Lord Xiu is obviously going there to collect information.

100
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,290
Why is Chunfeng Garden closed down?

101
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,880
[Ze]

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
Are you coming to Chunfeng Garden?

103
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,570
We came to Chunfeng Garden

104
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,090
to do what one should do in here, of course.

105
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,790
You're late.

106
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,870
Chunfeng Garden

107
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,830
couldn't continue anymore.

108
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,640
I'm an official from the Imperial Capital,

109
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,960
the deputy commander of the reserve service.

110
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,620
If you have any difficulties,

111
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,120
just tell me.

112
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,470
So you're an official from the Imperial Capital!

113
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,750
We really met a savior.

114
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,490
The Jixin Province is short of manpower, money, and food.

115
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
My Lord, please save us!

116
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,550
I think Jixin Province should save itself

117
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,250
than get support from other places.

118
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,110
By the way, what's your name?

119
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,210
Ze. I'm in charge of this Chunfeng Garden.

120
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,180
Do you know Mingyue?

121
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,190
Yes, I know her well.

122
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,470
What a coincidence. I'm close with Mingyue, too.

123
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,050
So,

124
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,360
tell me the truth. I won't treat you badly.

125
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,500
My Lord, please don't make it difficult for me.

126
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,360
I really

127
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,360
can't say anything about this.

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,350
If the Imperial Capital sends someone else to investigate it,

129
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm afraid at that time,

130
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,110
the reserve service and Chunfeng Garden

131
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,310
can't hide the truth anymore.

132
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,230
Yeah.

133
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,060
My Lord, this way, please.

134
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,090
Please forgive my offense earlier.

135
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,480
My Lord, please.

136
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,390
My Lord, please keep it a secret for me.

137
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,280
I know the rules.

138
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:20,850
Go.

139
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,420
My Lord, the Jixin Province

140
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,720
has experienced continued famine and recruitment.

141
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,600
It is indeed poor.

142
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,960
But last year,

143
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,760
we came up with a way to save ourselves.

144
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,330
All the young men in the village

145
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,690
went to the mountains to become bandits.

146
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,919
First,

147
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,230
they could avoid recruitment.

148
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,110
They can also rob some money

149
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,350
from the passers-by.

150
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,750
In the end,

151
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,010
it has brought the Jixin Province back to life.

152
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,170
The only thing we fear is the inspection from the above.

153
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,510
So, as soon as you are out of the reserve service base,

154
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,630
our men have followed you.

155
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,910
To be honest, your acting skills...

156
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,090
No, the acting skills of all of you were too bad.

157
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,610
But I need a favor from you.

158
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
Please go ahead, My Lord.

159
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,280
According to the rules of Chunfeng Garden,

160
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,330
I'll give you money or information.

161
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,950
I want

162
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,680
a list.

163
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,450
Lord Zichuan Xiu…

164
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,360
What...

165
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
What else can I do for you?

166
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,080
I didn't expect the situation in Jixin Province

167
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,990
to be so bad.

168
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,870
Even if the Imperial Capital is willing to help,

169
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,060
it can't solve our most imminent problems.

170
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,470
So I decided

171
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,980
I will go up the mountains to suppress the bandits.

172
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,290
Did I hear it right, My Lord?

173
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,760
Suppress the bandits?

174
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,130
But we don't have any soldiers.

175
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,070
Who said we don't have soldiers?

176
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,670
Bad news!

177
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,460
Big Brother!

178
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
Big Brother, bad news!

179
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,920
Big Brother, bad news!

180
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,340
[Maocai]

181
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,030
Shaozi, don't panic.

182
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:32,520
[Shaozi]

183
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,670
Someone wants to suppress the bandits.

184
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,930
Suppress the bandits?

185
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,460
You're just some bandits.

186
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,230
I'll regret it if I don't fight against you.

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,100
With one hit from me, you'll…

188
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,760
Be destroyed.

189
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,530
I strike again, and you'll be dead.

190
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,850
This commander is not well-educated.

191
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,270
They said he was the commander of the reserve service from the Imperial Capital.

192
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,270
How many soldiers can he have if he's with the reserve service?

193
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,470
We need to be prepared anyway.

194
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,630
Don't get beaten up.

195
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,580
It's just the reserve service. There's nothing to worry about.

196
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,030
[Li Nong]

197
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,030
What are you afraid of? It's just the reserve service.

198
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,990
They've come. Hide!

199
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,710
Hurry! Hide! Hide!

200
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,900
Soldiers have to be cunning.

201
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,910
Tell our brothers

202
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,830
to look out for my gesture later.

203
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,880
There's only a group of defeated generals and beaten soldiers.

204
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,650
My Lord, I can't walk anymore.

205
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,620
Hang in there.

206
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,780
We're almost there.

207
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,470
Almost there.

208
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,300
Why does that old man look so much like my father?

209
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,560
Father!

210
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,920
Kill!

211
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,120
No.

212
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,270
Brothers!

213
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,620
They are our parents!

214
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,070
Did you see that?

215
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,500
Father.

216
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,610
Mother!

217
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,790
Father!

218
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,790
Mother.

219
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,350
My son.

220
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,340
Father.

221
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,670
Do you know how I lived my life?

222
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,570
Who are you?

223
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,510
Why are you here to suppress the bandits?

224
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,590
What bandits?

225
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,750
The Lord is taking us down for a checkup.

226
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,430
What are you doing?

227
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,650
Now you've paid the admission fee,

228
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,650
our military recruitment campaign

229
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,030
will officially begin.

230
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,010
As you all know,

231
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,040
as long as you are 16 years old or over,

232
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,760
you can choose to join the army

233
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,430
voluntarily.

234
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,280
Nonsense! Who volunteered?

235
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,030
Yes, who volunteered?

236
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,630
If you didn't hold my father,

237
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,910
I wouldn't have come.

238
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,370
Since it's voluntary,

239
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,750
you should return the admission fee to us.

240
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,070
Yes.

241
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,190
Refund!

242
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,960
Calm down.

243
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,870
You have to pay for it to cherish it.

244
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,510
I want you to cherish

245
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,800
every sentence you're hearing today

246
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,120
because it will affect your whole life.

247
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,480
Tell me, who are you?

248
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,250
I...

249
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,990
A bandit.

250
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,830
No, you're not an ordinary bandit.

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,570
On the vast Xichuan Continent,

252
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,000
every one of you

253
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,620
is a unique individual.

254
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,710
Every one of you is a miracle.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,310
And you have

256
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,250
extraordinary missions on your shoulders.

257
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,390
I want you to know

258
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,710
you are born to change this world.

259
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,550
If you join the Zichuan Army,

260
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,380
I promise

261
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,200
your future

262
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,500
will be bright.

263
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,600
Bro, you took so much money

264
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,840
just to tell us this?

265
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,840
Let's dismiss.

266
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,070
Wait.

267
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,990
You don't like empty talk?

268
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,790
Let's talk about something practical.

269
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,870
As bandits,

270
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,970
your income must be unstable.

271
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,850
As long as you join the Zichuan Army,

272
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,310
you'll have a fixed salary

273
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,740
and paid holidays.

274
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,790
You'll be able to live without worries.

275
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,790
What do you think?

276
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,120
In the mountains,

277
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,920
we rob once, and it'll be enough to last half a year.

278
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
We have plenty of good wine and food.

279
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,310
The whole family's livelihood is guaranteed.

280
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,990
Yes.

281
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,090
It's free of entry fee if you sign up now.

282
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,710
Lords,

283
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,230
would you like to consider joining us?

284
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,950
Yes.

285
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,550
No? Let's dismiss.

286
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,980
Don't go.

287
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,200
In that case,

288
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,470
I can only use my trump card.

289
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,720
Actually, our ambassador of the campaign

290
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,720
is the beautiful and charming "Battlefield Flower," Miss Baichuan.

291
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,910
She lives right in this room.

292
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,870
She's waiting for you to come.

293
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,550
I believe you will have

294
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,370
an unforgettable, passionate moment with her.

295
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,550
Passionate moment?

296
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,190
Don't miss it.

297
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,070
After

298
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,330
the passionate time with Miss Baichuan,

299
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,980
those who still don't want to join the army

300
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,060
can leave freely.

301
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,970
The admission fee will be refunded for free.

302
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm willing to join the reserve service.

303
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,980
Wait.

304
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,850
Let me go first.

305
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,950
Why are you grabbing me?

306
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,590
Go away!

307
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,010
Baichuan?

308
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,500
What's going on?

309
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,440
Ask him.

310
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,250
He's definitely not an ordinary bandit.

311
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,050
I'll join, too.

312
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,800
Zichuan Xiu lied to you?

313
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,130
No.

314
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,350
Baichuan is not pretty?

315
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,150
Yes.

316
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,010
It's not free if you quit?

317
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:30,700
It is.

318
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,190
Is it not passionate?

319
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,800
It is.

320
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,190
Come on.

321
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,190
Let's wrestle.

322
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,430
If I win,

323
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,110
you'll join the reserve service voluntarily.

324
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,430
If I lose,

325
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,020
you can do whatever.

326
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,200
You city people

327
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,190
are really different.

328
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,910
But if I win,

329
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,380
isn't it a bit unfair to you?

330
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,790
Look at your pretty face.

331
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,520
Get up, go out, and turn left.

332
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,190
Soldiers are indeed cunning.

333
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,450
There are a lot of them.

334
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,800
Our task is almost done.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,359
Hang up the military flag later.

336
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,450
My Lord, we still need two more people.

337
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,070
Yes.

338
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,180
All the bandits are here.

339
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,790
Where are you going to find the rest?

340
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,310
My Lord, I heard you had subdued the bandits.

341
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,530
I am here to get my reward.

342
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,150
We're not in need of more people now.

343
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,320
I hereby announce that the Xiu Battalion is officially established today.

344
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,630
My Lord, we just had a great victory in Wayun!

345
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,880
The rebels breached

346
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,030
the Wayun Fortress.

347
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,750
Deputy Commander Luo Bo fought the enemy himself.

348
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,270
He had a hand-to-hand combat.

349
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,750
Wayun was about to fall.

350
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,490
At this time, the Palace Guards suddenly appeared.

351
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,630
Lord Si Yilin rushed day and night.

352
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,130
It took him just four days

353
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,440
to travel from the Imperial Capital to Wayun, Yuanzhou.

354
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,230
Because the Palace Guards newly arrived, they were in high morale.

355
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,970
Meanwhile, the rebels had attacked Wayun for more than ten days but couldn't occupy it;

356
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,070
they had lost their spirit.

357
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,300
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

358
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,100
to attack them back.

359
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,400
Lord Si Yilin kept chasing and attacking the rebels.

360
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,540
As expected of Si Yilin.

361
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,990
After all, those rebels are not regular soldiers.

362
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,390
There are many ways to keep them panicking.

363
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,390
Divide the main forces into six teams

364
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,320
and take turns to attack the enemy,

365
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,230
to make the rebels exhausted.

366
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,130
It can ensure our main force's safety,

367
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,820
and we can also have the advantage of having physical strength.

368
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,120
It can also draw a proper distance between the two armies

369
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,400
so that the rebels won't be cornered to the extent

370
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,040
to fight our main forces head-on.

371
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,190
Amazing. That's how he did it.

372
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,210
Of course.

373
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,750
Because we're brothers.

374
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,030
Here. The report letter of the 17th.

375
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,790
The 17th.

376
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,090
My handwriting is a bit rough.

377
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,820
You'll understand, won't you?

378
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,530
It's just unbelievable.

379
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,800
During the 17 days,

380
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,800
the route he went after the rebels

381
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,160
crossed four provinces in Yuanzhou.

382
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,880
According to the report,

383
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,400
Si Yilin

384
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,280
cleaned up rebels like peeling potatoes.

385
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,400
Everyone is scared.

386
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,830
Not only the people of Zichuan,

387
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,910
but the local rebels also called him

388
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,040
the Tiger of Zichuan.

389
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,700
Everyone is terrified of him.

390
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,680
Ning, thank you.

391
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,280
It's nothing.

392
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,960
I just pulled some strings

393
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,220
at the Ministry of War.

394
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,730
You don't know, but my uncle was

395
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,080
more than happy when he heard

396
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,880
I was going to the Ministry of War

397
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,170
to learn some current political affairs.

398
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,100
He wishes I copied these every day.

399
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
These are all military reports of the Zichuan family.

400
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,470
As a person from the North Clan,

401
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,530
I am absolutely forbidden to learn about these things.

402
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,080
But you secretly copied them for me

403
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,230
to let me know how Mr. Si is doing.

404
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,720
Because I know

405
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
what it feels like when your lover is on a battlefield.

406
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,950
It's good to know more.

407
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,160
My Lord.

408
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,020
My Lord.

409
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,300
You stayed up all night again.

410
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,310
I'll sleep soon. Put it down.

411
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,890
These are the documents I've read and replied to.

412
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,850
I'll distribute them to each department.

413
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,500
Is there any news about the retreat of the Yuanzhou Army?

414
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,140
No.

415
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,270
You're so self-disciplined and serving the government.

416
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,480
You prioritize the peace and prosperity of our country.

417
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,840
However, Si Yilin disrespects military law

418
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,970
and acts willfully.

419
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,640
He really doesn't respect the Ministry of War.

420
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,500
He is also unworthy of

421
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,160
all your efforts in planning.

422
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,630
In my view, he wants to destroy Zichuan.

423
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,680
I know the strategic intention of Si Yilin.

424
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,750
It's just…

425
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
it's too risky.

426
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,210
We shouldn't be swayed by personal feelings.

427
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,470
Send my order. Tell the Palace Guards to withdraw immediately.

428
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:23,870
Yes.

429
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,960
If I remember correctly,

430
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,640
is the time for recruitment due?

431
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,560
The missions at all places have been completed.

432
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,960
They can assemble today.

433
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,040
Good.

434
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,280
You can lead the soldiers you recruited yourself. I can't do it.

435
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,080
What's wrong?

436
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,030
They ask for drumsticks every time they have a meal.

437
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,720
The training intensity has increased. It's reasonable.

438
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,360
They ask for an increase in the salary for extra training.

439
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,880
Desire is a powerful motivation for an army.

440
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,510
It's a good thing.

441
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,000
Zichuan Xiu, if you indulge them like this,

442
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,400
they will only get worse.

443
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,700
Now they want to watch Princess Zichuan Ning dance.

444
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,920
Watch who?

445
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,140
Zichuan Ning.

446
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,070
Judging from this taste, they are indeed my soldiers.

447
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,610
Go back and tell them

448
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,190
Princess Ning will be here soon.

449
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,600
You...

450
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,600
My Lord, go ahead with your work.

451
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,760
I have pigs to raise in my hometown.

452
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,630
I'll take my leave.

453
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,140
Stop!

454
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,630
Hey.

455
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,630
Are you stupid?

456
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,530
They've been in the mountains for so long.

457
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
Which one of them do you think has seen Ning?

458
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,140
You, or Ming Yu,

459
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,680
find a random person to pretend.

460
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,940
Won't it be done, then?

461
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,850
Boss, pay the fee first.

462
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,660
Let that insubordinate soldier go back for training.

463
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,890
My Lord, I don't want to say this,

464
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,560
but you are really something.

465
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,550
Those rogues

466
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,600
went back to training when they saw the Princess's carriage.

467
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,060
The Princess's carriage?

468
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,280
Didn't you invite Princess Ning over?

469
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,120
Who's here?

470
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm here.

471
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,350
Get up. Stop pretending.

472
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,890
I'm leaving.

473
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,420
Ning, why are you here?

474
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,590
I just fell asleep.

475
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,110
I am the heir to the Chieftain

476
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,660
and the princess of the Zichuan family.

477
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,940
You once promised me

478
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,200
no matter what happened to me,

479
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,730
you'd always be loyal to me.

480
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,600
Brother Xiu, I order you

481
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,250
to come home with me.

482
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,770
I will be loyal to you.

483
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,800
But that's exactly why I can't go back.

484
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,960
You are the heir to the Chieftain and the princess,

485
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,560
and I'm a soldier of Zichuan.

486
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,630
You have your duty.

487
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,160
And my duty is to follow the command of the Ministry of War.

488
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,890
Now, there is a war in Yuanzhou.

489
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,880
What if the order is to ask you to go to Yuanzhou?

490
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,430
Then I should do so.

491
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,060
And I still have something unfinished there.

492
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,710
Okay, you can go anywhere you want.

493
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,990
As long as you want to go home in the end,

494
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,980
I can wait.

495
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,680
You'll come back, right?

496
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,920
I don't know.

497
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,870
Ning.

498
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,400
Right. How could you know?

499
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,120
The Ministry of War hasn't come out yet.

500
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,220
I'll go back first. I'll visit you next time.

501
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,390
My Lady, Lord Xiu won't come back with you?

502
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,720
I knew he wouldn't come back.

503
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,540
Then why did you go to him personally?

504
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,350
Sometimes,

505
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,330
I think I'm quite smart.

506
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,660
Whether he will come or not,

507
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,320
I can always guess it.

508
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,280
But sometimes,

509
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,910
I think I'm rather stupid.

510
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,710
If I don't try,

511
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,510
I'll never give up.

512
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,920
But you were fine two days ago.

513
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,890
Now Yang Minghua is dead, and the Imperial Capital is safe,

514
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,490
why are you two starting to fight again?

515
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,160
We are not fighting.

516
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,060
There are just some problems between us.

517
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,740
On the matter of the Palace Guards,

518
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,690
he has a divergence of opinion with my uncle.

519
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,900
Lord Ge's death is also a big blow to him.

520
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,320
So...

521
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,680
he probably doesn't know how to face it.

522
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
If Lord Xiu doesn't get better,

523
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
you can't just wait for him forever.

524
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,320
There will be a way.

525
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,770
We'll be fine.

526
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,090
What about Ka Dan? What is she doing?

527
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,730
Princess Ka Dan asked for paper and a pen.

528
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,010
I guess she wanted to write a letter.

529
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,660
Although she puts her missing on the paper,

530
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,080
it can't reach her lover's eyes.

531
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,330
It's another kind of sadness.

532
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,160
Mr. Si, knowing that you've triumphed in succession,

533
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,740
I still feel uneasy and at a loss.

534
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,240
Dear Princess, I looked up to the mountains and missed you so much.

535
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
Everyone only sees the victory,

536
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,620
but they don't know

537
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,900
behind this victory is a horrible swamp.

538
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,510
Even though it'll inevitably dampen the spirits,

539
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,430
I can only tell you my anxiety.

540
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,650
My Lord.

541
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640
Is everything ready?

542
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,480
Yes.

543
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,250
Tell everyone that we'll depart overnight

544
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,110
to go to Yuntai.

545
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,920
Yes.

546
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,160
My Lord.

547
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,320
We shared the food with the local Orcs,

548
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,850
but they even gave us

549
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,830
fake maps.

550
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,120
Compared with the rebels who are familiar with the terrain here

551
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,680
and the local people,

552
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,230
it's too hard for us to move forward.

553
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,700
Everyone in the province is either the rebels or the family of the rebels.

554
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,770
The difficulty in Yuntai is not about the enemy or the danger

555
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,140
but the evilness of people's hearts.

556
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,010
The Zichuan family has been governing this place benevolently

557
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,640
for 200 years.

558
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,240
But every living creature here

559
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,240
tries their best to oppose us.

560
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,500
Why is that?

561
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,030
Mr. Si,

562
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,280
a stray cat

563
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,210
has often come to my room recently.

564
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,980
I named it Silan.

565
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,750
It means "fur ball" in our language.

566
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,080
But as a prisoner,

567
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,960
I can't be its master.

568
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,160
If one day, the hatred between our two clans clears up,

569
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,300
and we can be together freely,

570
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,920
let's have a cat together, okay?

571
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,320
The army is in dire need of provisions.

572
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,580
But because of that,

573
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,820
I learned that there were so many

574
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,610
strange things that could serve as food.

575
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,170
Mr. Si, my letters can't reach you.

576
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,640
I just hope my love can reach you.

577
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,160
Your Highness,

578
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,030
I can't send these letters from Yuanzhou.

579
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,640
I can only let them stay here forever.

580
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,640
Qing.

581
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,150
[Li Qing]

582
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,920
Lord Chieftain.

583
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,300
I, Li Qing,

584
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,280
failed to protect you by your side when Yang Minghua rebelled.

585
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,210
I deserve to die.

586
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,950
Please punish me, Lord Chieftain.

587
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,120
Get up.

588
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,590
Without you making the southeast fortresses stable,

589
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,600
how can I

590
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,330
punish Yang Minghua without any worries?

591
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,760
I couldn't kill Yang Minghua myself. I regret it so much.

592
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,600
Qing, think about it.

593
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,070
You are my only foster daughter.

594
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,030
And you're well-versed in both civil and martial virtues.

595
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,220
If I were Yang Minghua,

596
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,370
I would have transferred you away from me sooner.

597
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,710
It was not your fault.

598
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,690
Did you get hurt in the battle?

599
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,400
No, I'm fine.

600
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,840
I had Si Yilin.

601
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,960
I heard that Lord Si Yilin

602
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,330
was also framed by Yang Minghua

603
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,510
and was severely injured.

604
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,360
Si Yilin inflicted injury upon himself to gain Yang Minghua's trust.

605
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,910
He's very healthy now.

606
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,280
He got promoted.

607
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,590
He is now the commander of the Palace Guards.

608
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,250
General Si Yilin has made great contributions.

609
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,190
I admire him.

610
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,810
Why do you youngsters

611
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,970
sound more old-fashioned than me?

612
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,760
No wonder the marriage was delayed again and again.

613
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,160
Please stop joking.

614
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,160
Lord Si Yilin and I

615
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
were just protecting you together.

616
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,090
We never talked about love.

617
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,400
Childhood jokes don't count.

618
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,520
Although it was a joke,

619
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,680
you've grown up day by day.

620
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,910
It's the national affairs

621
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,950
that delayed your personal affairs.

622
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,470
That's why I never put it on the schedule.

623
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,630
Now, the Imperial Capital is stable.

624
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,980
Don't worry. Father will take care of it.

625
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,030
Please stop joking.

626
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,310
How is this a joke?

627
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,830
You are my adopted daughter.

628
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,560
He's my close subordinate.

629
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,240
You two are a perfect match.

630
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,400
I think Si Yilin will definitely be happy.

631
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,180
Si Yilin disobeyed the military orders and acted recklessly to get all the credits.

632
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,700
He disregarded the lives of the officers and soldiers.

633
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,500
I ask you to come here because I want you to order him to come back immediately

634
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,700
in the name of the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

635
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,820
It sounds like these accusations

636
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,400
have nothing to do with the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

637
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,480
It's your Ministry of War that failed to lead the army.

638
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,540
I can't interfere.

639
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,710
The whole of Zichuan has been recruiting troops for days

640
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,040
and has recruited a million soldiers.

641
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,810
They will overthrow the rebels with an overwhelming force soon.

642
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,760
Si Yilin's troops are just reinforcements for Wayun,

643
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,420
yet he goes to Yuntai blindly.

644
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,550
Lord Di Lin, as Minister of Military and Legal Affairs

645
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,420
you can't just ignore it, can you?

646
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,710
I'm not ignoring it.

647
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,150
But the war at the front line

648
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,170
cannot be speculated by us who are just sitting here.

649
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,920
Lord Luo, have you been to the battlefield?

650
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,710
Forget it.

651
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,909
Then, you should at least control Ming Hui.

652
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,440
What's wrong with Ming Hui?

653
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:23,840
Gu Sen.

654
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,520
After Commander Ming Hui got the order to back up Yuanzhou,

655
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,850
he attacked passively.

656
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,179
His army only marched 20 miles for 14 days.

657
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,449
Now, he's still out of Wayun Fortress.

658
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,510
My Lord.

659
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,929
When Yang Minghua rebelled,

660
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,280
Commander Ming Hui was in two minds.

661
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,080
Now, he is deliberately delaying the expedition.

662
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,780
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs must investigate it thoroughly.

663
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,550
Lord Luo,

664
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,790
his style is opposite

665
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,670
to Si Yilin's.

666
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,179
While fighting back against the rebels,

667
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,560
the Ministry of War encountered huge obstacles,

668
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,090
all coming from the inside.

669
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,410
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs should intervene in time and correct the military disciplines.

670
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,400
I'll leave this to you.

671
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,880
I have to go to attend the military review of the new soldiers.

672
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,980
My Lord, you may have to wait a little longer for the military review.

673
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,430
The review is at 3 p.m. Why should I still wait?

674
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,670
The newly recruited soldiers are not trained.

675
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,300
Their military discipline is indeed worrying.

676
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,720
They have been ordered to gather at 3 o'clock,

677
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,270
but haven't assembled yet.

678
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,240
Which unit?

679
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,110
There are about seven or eight units.

680
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,440
The slowest one is the Xiu Battalion of the reserve service.

681
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,540
The Xiu Battalion? Who is its leader?

682
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,130
Lord Di Lin's sworn brother, Zichuan Xiu.

683
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,960
Lord Chieftain is here!

684
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,920
Thank you for your hard work.

685
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,550
Recently, some young advisors from Three Central Offices

686
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,180
went hunting in Jiashan

687
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,240
and hunted a few does.

688
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,480
So, I will offer you a present with their things.

689
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,240
I brought you several deer legs

690
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,900
to reward you for your hard work these days.

691
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,230
We wouldn't dare to trouble you, Lord Chieftain.

692
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,040
Lord Luo, you should eat more

693
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,000
and nourish yourself.

694
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,530
Thank you, My Lord.

695
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,200
Di Lin, take one later.

696
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,130
Thank you, Lord Chieftain.

697
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,070
I have something important to do in the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

698
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,130
I'll take my leave.

699
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,670
I'll leave as well.

700
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,410
Okay.

701
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,430
My Lord.

702
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,760
Lord Luo, you just took office,

703
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,840
and you have to deal with so many tricky problems.

704
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,280
Thank you.

705
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,630
You're welcome.

706
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,610
It's my duty.

707
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,960
Just tell me if you have any difficulties.

708
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,290
I support you.

709
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,030
In that case,

710
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,550
I have a presumptuous request.

711
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,360
Si Yilin and Ming Hui are both important generals of Zichuan,

712
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,470
but they both defied the orders.

713
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,810
If they do it again, I'll have no choice but to punish them by military law.

714
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,760
What is this place?

715
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,840
The Ministry of War.

716
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,990
That's right.

717
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,440
Now, you're the commander-in-chief of the Ministry of War.

718
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,230
Of course you should decide

719
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,990
what to do with this matter.

720
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,380
Thank you, My Lord.

721
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:38,200
Do you get along with Di Lin?

722
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,770
Yes, we're okay.

723
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,210
That's good.

724
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,520
The Tatie Army of our Yuanzhou Army

725
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,280
fought for four days and nights.

726
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,470
No one flinched.

727
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,190
No one survived.

728
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,280
Everyone, stop chasing and bury the bodies.

729
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,730
These are all warriors who sacrificed their lives for our country.

730
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,930
We can't let them lie in the wilderness.

731
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,960
The Ministry of War's order has arrived.

732
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,140
They want us to retreat again?

733
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,420
They ask you to return to the Imperial Capital immediately otherwise the military law…

734
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,090
This is a written letter from the Chieftain.

735
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,830
Lord Chieftain?

736
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,020
You can relieve my worries and I understand what's in your mind.

737
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,280
We can't ignore

738
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,050
the orders of the Ministry of War anymore.

739
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,100
I'll go back to the Imperial Capital to ask for punishment in place of you

740
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,800
so that we can explain to the Ministry of War somehow.

741
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,310
Okay.

742
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,070
Take care.

743
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,080
Take care.

744
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,970
I heard Xiu lives here.

745
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,710
Xiu.

746
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,270
Why are you looking for Xiu?

747
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,950
I'm his ex-mistress.

748
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,020
I'm here to ask him for alimony

749
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,440
and youth compensation.

750
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,260
Your Highness.

751
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,740
Your Highness.

752
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,320
Deputy Commander Lin.

753
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,310
Deputy Commander Lin?

754
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,370
Yes, Your Highness.

755
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,880
This is Deputy Commander Lin Bing of the Yuanzhou Army.

756
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,560
Sorry for not welcoming you.

757
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,070
Don't be sorry, Your Highness.

758
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,960
I was just kidding. Please don't mind it.

759
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,760
Of course not.

760
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,120
Mei, what are you waiting for?

761
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,780
Prepare some delicious food.

762
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,630
Yes.

763
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,410
You must want to talk business.

764
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,210
I won't bother you then.

765
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,470
I need your help.

766
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,570
Luo Bo is in trouble.
