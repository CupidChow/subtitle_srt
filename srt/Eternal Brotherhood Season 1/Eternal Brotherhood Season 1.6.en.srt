[Episode 6]

4
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,310
Zichuan Xiu, you've gone too far!

5
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,660
If you still don't draw properly, I won't let you off!

6
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,370
Tieshou.

7
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,210
Don't look.

8
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,970
What? It was not well-drawn?

9
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,820
That Zichuan Xiu

10
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
wrote a poem to humiliate me.

11
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,560
Don't read it.

12
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,600
You have a big heart, Lord Di Lin.

13
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,329
You don't need to care about it.

14
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,250
My love is in the Imperial Capital,

15
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,410
but she's married to a foolhardy man.

16
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,740
A stupid donkey doesn't appreciate how good you are, Xiujia.

17
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,270
Why don't you dance with me?

18
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,580
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

19
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,110
Tieshou!

20
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,290
Wait!

21
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,190
I have a request.

22
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,060
I can't beat him to death for you.

23
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,640
No, no matter how I beat him,

24
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,390
don't tell Lord Yang.

25
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,899
Because all these years,

26
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,280
I've never let him down.

27
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,190
But Zichuan Xiu went too far this time.

28
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,300
He did.

29
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,160
Zichuan Xiu.

30
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,280
He's here.

31
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,230
Look, I've been beaten up for no reason.

32
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,650
You hurt my pride and humiliated my talent.

33
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,560
If I die in the Ministry of War today,

34
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,280
it'll be all your fault.

35
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,580
Let's see how you'll explain to Lord Commander-in-Chief!

36
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,150
Lord Zichuan Xiu.

37
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,590
You wrote such a poem.

38
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,690
No wonder Lord Di Lin beat you.

39
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,140
I was paying tribute to my first love

40
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,110
and my youth.

41
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,350
-It's only because he's narrow-minded.
-You…

42
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,570
Since it's all in the past,

43
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,830
let's forget about it.

44
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,360
It's stuffy inside. Should I open the skylight?

45
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
No.

46
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,350
I don't want him to throw me out again.

47
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,000
Lord Di Lin.

48
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,760
The mission assigned by Lord Yang is the most important.

49
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,160
How's the drawing going?

50
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,800
Don't tell me you didn't even start to draw because you were busy fighting.

51
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,470
It's been too long. I don't even remember.

52
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,730
I need to think more carefully about it.

53
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,680
This is just...

54
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,030
This is just a sketch.

55
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,980
That's good. I'll report it to Lord Yang.

56
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,310
Did you draw this?

57
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,790
Yes.

58
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,750
It's so ugly.

59
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,310
Was your face hurt by me?

60
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,150
But your poem is really good.

61
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,130
Every word is from my heart.

62
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,370
I think you want to get beaten up for real.

63
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,570
My Lord, you're awake.

64
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,670
Your Highness.

65
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,210
The wound on your chest is poisonous.

66
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
I just treated it for you.

67
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,520
Your Highness, I can't repay you

68
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,870
for saving my life.

69
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,410
Don't say that.

70
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,720
It's all my fault.

71
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,150
This poison is unique to our North Clan.

72
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,900
I think

73
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,660
it was initially prepared for me.

74
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
They want to let you…

75
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,080
To let me die.

76
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,900
Actually, I'm afraid something might happen

77
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,950
after you took me out of the War Prisoner Camp,

78
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,410
so I left signals to my clan all along the way.

79
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,430
I betrayed your trust in me

80
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,760
and overestimated the affection my people had towards me.

81
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,909
So besides Mu Qi,

82
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,400
there is a confidant of my brother Ka Dun

83
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,930
in the delegation for the peace talks, right?

84
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,030
There's another envoy called Lu Di.

85
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,960
Looks like Ka Dun didn't want peace talks.

86
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,090
Peace talks are unfavorable for them.

87
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,510
But I didn't expect,

88
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,100
in order to achieve their goal,

89
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,660
they didn't want me to go back alive.

90
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,980
I can do it myself.

91
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,480
Your leg hasn't recovered yet.

92
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,750
Sit down now.

93
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,020
Thank you.

94
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,350
I should thank you.

95
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,390
I couldn't have done anything for you.

96
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,990
And I relied on you to save me.

97
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,670
To me,

98
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,850
it's already precious

99
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,060
that you could listen to my stories.

100
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,050
You're very thoughtful, My Lord.

101
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,010
I'm very grateful.

102
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,040
Actually, there's something

103
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,040
I don't know if I should tell you.

104
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,270
Please go ahead.

105
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,950
The reason why the peace talks even took place

106
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,940
was because your father cared about you.

107
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,570
So during this period,

108
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,200
no matter how sad you are,

109
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,370
you should think about him.

110
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,170
Then you can hold on.

111
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,230
Don't worry.

112
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,750
As a royal,

113
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,880
my life doesn't belong to me.

114
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,960
I know what my mission is.

115
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,190
I will also do my best to protect Your Highness.

116
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,610
Your Highness,

117
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,530
please wait here for a moment.

118
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,010
Second Brother left a mark of his leaving the city at the west gate.

119
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,120
He left around 7 p.m. yesterday.

120
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,590
The west gate is close to a wood. It's easy to hide there.

121
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,790
They should be there.

122
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,530
It'll be too hard to find them.

123
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,990
Even if he left marks all the way,

124
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,850
it'll take much time to find them.

125
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,690
Big Brother,

126
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,440
we need to find a way out quickly.

127
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,890
I'll figure it out.

128
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,260
Didn't you say my drawing is ugly?

129
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,180
You get it done.

130
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,080
Alright, I'll do it.

131
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,190
A bomb!

132
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,600
Did it really explode?

133
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,550
Am I hallucinating?

134
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,820
What's going on?

135
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,080
Forget it. Let's continue.

136
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,740
Okay.

137
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,570
A bomb.

138
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,340
What's going…

139
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,170
What's going on?

140
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,560
What are you looking at?

141
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,650
Stop playing. Something happened. Let's check it.

142
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,130
Should we go and regulate him?

143
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,950
It's not easy to regulate him, right?

144
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,680
Are we really going to stand by?

145
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,230
We can't do anything really, can we?

146
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,150
Room No. 1,

147
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,940
Dragon's Tail.

148
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,270
Here comes the Gold Thread Changchun Tea.

149
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,320
My Lord, your tea is here.

150
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,970
Get lost!

151
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
Yes, My Lord.

152
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,870
Lord Yang heard that the princess had rashes

153
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,030
and can't meet anyone,

154
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,310
so he asked me to bring the medicinal wine from Zichuan

155
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,390
for your health.

156
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,870
He's too kind.

157
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,630
I invited you here

158
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,270
to ask you to express my gratitude

159
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,780
to Lord Yang.

160
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,510
The buddies of the Palace Guards

161
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,070
helped me a lot yesterday.

162
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,880
Lord Lei is in charge of the Palace Guards.

163
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,320
And Lord Ge Yingxing is in charge of

164
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,030
the peace talks.

165
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,510
Lord Yang

166
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,910
can only give you this bottle of wine to express his kindness.

167
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,360
Some people may only move their fingers,

168
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,840
but that can help us a lot.

169
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,960
Besides, I always think

170
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,510
we have the same goal as Lord Yang.

171
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,870
Ge Yingxing is our old enemy in Yuanzhou.

172
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,910
Neither you nor I want to change that.

173
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,110
It all depends on the progress of the peace talks.

174
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,130
The result of tomorrow's peace talks is set.

175
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,470
The princess is dead.

176
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,590
The peace talk is bound to fail, and the result is impossible to change.

177
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,550
Lu Di, I heard you're a beast on the battlefield.

178
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,330
You won't show any mercy to the enemy.

179
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,680
I didn't expect you to be so ruthless to your own people, too.

180
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,720
Only people who have the same goal as me can be called my own people.

181
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,510
The peace talk is bound to fail.

182
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,910
It'll be troublesome if someone looks into it.

183
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,130
I'm afraid it'll delay our return.

184
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,480
We need the brothers of the Palace Guards to help us again.

185
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,540
It's done. We can get out soon.

186
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,680
That's good.

187
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,860
Have some tea, Big Brother.

188
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,470
What's this?

189
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,950
I've tried my best.

190
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,300
Let's not talk about this now.

191
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,760
How shall we get out later?

192
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,640
Lord Zichuan Xiu, please come with me.

193
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,720
Zichuan Xiu's behavior must be punished severely.

194
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,240
My Lord!

195
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,230
Zichuan Xiu!

196
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
How dare you smash everything we need

197
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,710
for tomorrow's peace talks?

198
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,310
Me...

199
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,870
Me, me, me?

200
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,520
It's still written in my room,

201
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,460
"Zichuan Xiu has been here."

202
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,030
When did that happen?

203
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,280
This morning.

204
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,580
Yes, it was me.

205
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,700
I won't play dumb anymore. I'll tell you everything.

206
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,860
Why did you do that?

207
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,710
Why?

208
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,910
Why?

209
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,960
Because of you, Lord Ge Shan.

210
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,980
She deducted all my salary!

211
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,780
I'm going to sue her, My Lord!

212
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,230
You, go back to the Ministry of Government Supervision now

213
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,630
and restore everything.

214
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,000
Lights, tea sets, folders…

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,260
Not one can be left out.

216
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,050
I can't leave.

217
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,310
The peace talks are crucial.

218
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,950
Xiu, go back.

219
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,340
If you don't

220
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,870
get everything we need for the peace talks perfectly ready

221
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,310
before tomorrow morning,

222
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,840
be careful of losing your head! Do you hear me?

223
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,230
Lord Ge, every word of yours is precious.

224
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,840
I dare not disobey.

225
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,060
That's good.

226
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,390
Lord Yang,

227
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,850
have you approved the military supplies

228
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,359
applied by the Ministry of Government Supervision?

229
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,510
I'll approve it now.

230
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,750
Lord Ge Shan has a strict working style.

231
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,200
Even I am afraid of her sometimes.

232
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
You may leave now.

233
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,589
Yes.

234
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,310
Thank you, Lord Yang.

235
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,119
Let's go.

236
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,099
Wait.

237
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,030
Xiu, how's your picture going?

238
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,390
Picture?

239
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,670
Picture!

240
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,800
My Lord.

241
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,410
Not bad, but the details need to be improved.

242
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,380
Thank you, Xiu.

243
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,500
You helped me a lot.

244
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,330
You're welcome. I'll take my leave.

245
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,180
Okay.

246
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,780
My Lord, after you.

247
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,810
My Lord, will the picture drawn by Zichuan Xiu do?

248
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,780
Not bad.

249
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,760
[Zichuan Xiu has been here]

250
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,610
Zichuan Xiu has been here.

251
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,790
This is too far.

252
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,030
Boss, don't worry.

253
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,240
We will

254
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,910
clean up everything for you

255
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,910
and buy everything you need.

256
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,900
You are so kind.

257
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,190
But we won't pay

258
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,430
for the reparations.

259
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,710
I need to pay for the reparations?

260
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,110
Lord Ge Shan clearly said

261
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,680
you'd have to pay for all the expenses.

262
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,920
You can testify for me.

263
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,270
I didn't do this.

264
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,870
It's obviously a frame-up.

265
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,950
At the time of the incident,

266
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,350
we were afraid that Lord Ge Shan would blame us.

267
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,950
So...

268
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,870
We saw nothing.

269
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,880
We heard nothing.

270
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,840
We said nothing.

271
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,380
So we can't testify for you.

272
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:34,970
I...

273
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,040
How much would this cost?

274
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,110
I can afford it.

275
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,480
Lady Ning.

276
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,960
Tell Lord Ge Shan,

277
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,550
I don't owe her anything anymore.

278
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,300
That's right.

279
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,600
You don't owe her anything now. You owe me.

280
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,310
But I don't have that much money.

281
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,070
I can't afford it.

282
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,390
I don't want your money.

283
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,360
You can just redeem your vow to the god.

284
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,160
Redeem my vow?

285
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,320
I've calculated it.

286
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,710
At 9 p.m. tomorrow,

287
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,430
it's the auspicious time and date that only happens once in centuries.

288
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,140
That day

289
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,470
is the best time to play all kinds of music.

290
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,430
If you miss it,

291
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,290
you'll have to wait a few decades.

292
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,180
So, whether you want to pay back the money or redeem a vow,

293
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,140
it's up to you.

294
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,400
Your Highness, is your leg fine?

295
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,710
Much better.

296
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,540
I just went around to explore the surrounding area.

297
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,940
I took a look at the routes

298
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,310
and found two wild fruits.

299
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,630
They may not taste good,

300
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,300
but it's more important to eat something.

301
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,680
Here.

302
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,460
They're here!

303
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,050
They're not enemies, Your Highness!

304
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,880
It's so beautiful!

305
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,890
What are these things?

306
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,170
Your Highness, you must be startled.

307
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,300
They're fireflies.

308
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,060
So this is the firefly.

309
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,590
There are some over there, too.

310
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,910
I've only read about it in books.

311
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,640
I've never seen it in real life.

312
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,850
Your Highness.

313
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,940
Your Highness.

314
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,410
What did you just burn?

315
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,830
Seven Treasures Soul Collecting Elixir.

316
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,830
This is the secret recipe of the North Clan.

317
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,090
When you were injured,

318
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,730
I used it to detoxify you.

319
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,920
We have to leave here immediately.

320
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,870
My Lord,

321
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,620
there are too many caves around here.

322
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,550
We haven't found their traces yet.

323
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,550
I just caught a whiff of the fragrance of herbal medicine.

324
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,480
It's that way. Keep chasing.

325
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:45,780
Let's go.

326
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,510
Send this to the embassy

327
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,160
and hand it to Lord Lu Di.

328
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,150
It belonged to Princess Ka Dan.

329
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,470
The princess is dead?

330
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,670
The North Clan did it.

331
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,810
Now the peace talks are bound to founder,

332
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,820
we might as well do them a favor in passing.

333
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,020
Got it.

334
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,370
Do you know why I asked you to do this?

335
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,330
Thank you for your trust, My Lord.

336
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,950
All these years,

337
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,810
I've been trusting you and putting you in an important position.

338
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,640
Now that the peace talks are about to founder,

339
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,370
there will be a war in Yuanzhou.

340
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,090
How do you think

341
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,000
we should cope with it next?

342
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,930
No matter what we're going to do,

343
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,840
I will do anything for you,

344
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,180
even at the expense of my life.

345
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,370
Since ancient times, swords need their heroes.

346
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,830
If you take charge of Yuanzhou in the future,

347
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,230
I can rest assured.

348
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,550
The Thousand Turns Throat-Slitting Sword.

349
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,670
Thank you so much, My Lord.

350
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,550
My Lord, it's right here.

351
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,800
We're late. They've left.

352
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,600
The poison

353
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,730
can't be detoxified

354
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,190
even if he took the elixir.

355
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,100
My Lord, we found them.

356
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,770
Let's go.

357
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,950
Guys, kill him!

358
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,440
Are you okay?

359
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:09,670
I won't die.

360
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,230
It's getting late. Let's stop drinking.

361
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,420
We still have peace talks tomorrow.

362
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,660
Lord Lu Di, you should rest early.

363
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
It's still early. What's the hurry?

364
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,420
Someone sent something to Lord Lu Di.

365
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,590
Isn't this the princess's pendant?

366
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,510
Blood? Could the princess be…

367
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,890
Didn't you see her this morning?

368
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,420
Mu Qi, you're a senior court official of the North Clan.

369
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,660
I didn't expect you to collude with Zichuan.

370
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,430
How long are you going to

371
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,830
conceal the news that the princess is dead?

372
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,190
I didn't want to investigate this in Zichuan,

373
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,320
but what on earth happened to the princess?

374
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,670
And who tried to kill her?

375
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,780
I'm afraid you know better than anyone else.

376
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,190
Since you already know everything,

377
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,300
we don't have to put on an act anymore.

378
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,550
Lu Di,

379
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,440
what did you do to the princess?

380
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,570
Tell me!

381
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,450
You'll meet her soon.

382
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,950
Lord Zichuan Xiu

383
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,920
has brought Si Yilin and the princess back.

384
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,140
The princess is changing.

385
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,340
She will arrive soon.

386
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,870
It's time,

387
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,250
yet the envoy of the North Clan hasn't shown up.

388
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,390
Go out and take a look.

389
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:19,790
Yes.

390
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,540
This is Curly Grass?

391
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,130
Xiu drew it.

392
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,870
He has been in Yuanzhou for so many years,

393
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,960
so there should be no mistake.

394
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,670
Xiu drew it?

395
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,880
What's wrong?

396
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,120
I can't believe it!

397
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,300
He has never liked calligraphy or drawing since he was young.

398
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,710
In order to make him sit tight at the table,

399
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,480
my brother chased after him and beat him a lot.

400
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,740
Now he can

401
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,820
draw so well.

402
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,140
He's really improved.

403
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,250
Indeed.

404
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,410
It is said that he is meeting the peace envoys

405
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,300
at the Ministry of Government Supervision.

406
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,000
If the peace talks succeed,

407
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,810
he will be rewarded.

408
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,190
Today is the signing day, right?

409
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,180
Yes.

410
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,430
Princess Ka Dan will also be there

411
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,790
to witness the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

412
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,860
In that case,

413
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,000
there should be someone from the Zichuan family there.

414
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,820
If we ask Ning to dress up now,

415
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,050
it'll take half a day.

416
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,570
Forget it.

417
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,270
Forget it. Let's go together.

418
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,510
After the agreement is signed,

419
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,080
we can visit Lord Ge Yingxing

420
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,300
to celebrate for him.

421
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,360
You're so thoughtful, Lord Canxing.

422
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,730
When the peace talks succeed,

423
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,610
we can go to Yuanzhou

424
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,120
to see the real Curly Grass.

425
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
Now that I think about it,

426
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,910
not only can we see Curly Grass

427
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,320
but also the rare peace in Yuanzhou.

428
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,230
My brother entrusted Zichuan

429
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,910
to you and Ge Yingxing.

430
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,660
It's my luck. It's Zichuan's luck.

431
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,740
Come on. Let's witness this moment together.

432
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,180
Why aren't they here yet?

433
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,160
Something must have happened.

434
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,130
My Lord,

435
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:33,100
the delegation of the North Clan left the Imperial Capital last night.

436
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,990
Why didn't anyone report it?

437
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,320
The envoys of the North Clan killed

438
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,010
all the Zichuan guards in the Embassy,

439
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,150
so no one reported it.

440
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,090
When I arrived there,

441
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,820
it was in the middle of the room.

442
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,800
This is for you.

443
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,990
I, Mu Qi, colluded with Zichuan

444
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,110
and hid the death of the princess. It's unforgivable.

445
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,710
There is no more need for the North Clan

446
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,280
to negotiate with Zichuan.

447
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,200
Lord Ge, see you on the battlefield.

448
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,690
My Lord, what should we do?

449
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,870
Ge Yingxing.

450
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,940
Lord Xiao, what brings you here?

451
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,950
The embassy has suffered a massacre.

452
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,030
All the guards were killed.

453
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,090
What are you waiting for, Lord Ge?

454
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,880
Lord Ge, why haven't the peace talks started yet?

455
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,310
Where are the envoys?

456
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,340
I just heard about it.

457
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,340
The envoys left the Imperial Capital last night.

458
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,440
Since the envoys have left, why don't you go after them?

459
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,820
What about Princess Ka Dan?

460
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,700
Lord Ge, was there anything wrong

461
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,050
during the negotiation

462
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,730
that irritated the envoys?

463
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,510
My Lord.

464
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,450
My Lord.

465
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,650
Send it to Wayun immediately.

466
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,580
Give it to Luo Bo.

467
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,580
Yes.

468
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,150
All envoys of the North Clan have left.

469
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,770
They insisted that the princess was dead.

470
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,390
A war is inevitable.

471
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,330
How is your injury?

472
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,480
I am guilty.

473
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,120
I failed to protect the princess. Please punish me, My Lord.

474
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,100
Here.

475
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,840
You've done your best.

476
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,230
Don't blame yourself too much.

477
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,990
My Lord.

478
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,880
The North Clan tried to lure Princess Ka Dan out of the city

479
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,140
to assassinate her, and they didn't want to keep her alive.

480
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,350
Looked like they didn't want peace talks from then.

481
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,310
As soon as Princess Ka Dan left the city,

482
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,900
the Palace Guards ordered an early curfew.

483
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,420
Has Yang Minghua colluded

484
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,830
with the North Clan from long ago?

485
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,890
I know Yang Minghua well.

486
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,530
He's just targeting me.

487
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,170
He wouldn't do anything harmful to Zichuan.

488
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,880
No one stopped the envoys from leaving.

489
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,340
He must have known the plan of the North Clan,

490
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,680
so he gave them a favor in passing.

491
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,260
To be honest, do you hate me?

492
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,940
Why do you say that?

493
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,350
An hour…

494
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,710
You want me to find evidence

495
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,530
that the Palace Guard neglected their duty in an hour.

496
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,679
If you don't hate me,

497
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,690
why did you fix me like that?

498
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,780
Have you found it already?

499
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,010
It depends on

500
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,820
how much Lord Ge

501
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,860
wants to offer to buy the evidence.

502
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,429
One gold coin?

503
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,889
A one-day trip.

504
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,110
My Lord, this is a request for instruction

505
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,610
submitted by a general of the Palace Guards.

506
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,210
With this document,

507
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,020
Lei Xun can hardly absolve himself from the blame.

508
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,670
Si Yilin.

509
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,510
Yes.

510
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,330
Follow me to the Chieftain's Mansion.

511
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:06,700
Yes.

512
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,080
I can finally relax for a while.

513
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,350
Are you so afraid that Lord Ge will send you on a trip?

514
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,540
He meant

515
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,990
to send me to Hungry Tiger Ridge.

516
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,910
There are hundreds of tigers in Hungry Tiger Ridge in Yuanzhou.

517
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,160
They would even kill each other for food.

518
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,450
Only Lord Ge can bring you under control.

519
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,160
Wait.

520
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,640
Don't tell Di Lin.

521
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,320
He's capable of that, too.

522
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,830
Me too.

523
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,670
Lord Ge is here!

524
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,910
Lord Ge,

525
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,150
hurry.

526
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,330
Help me to persuade them.

527
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,340
Si Yilin, are you okay?

528
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,840
Where is Ka Dan?

529
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,560
Princess Ka Dan is doing well.

530
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,640
Please rest assured, My Lord.

531
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Lord Yang, did you hear that?

532
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,380
Ka Dan is fine.

533
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,530
Let him get up.

534
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,620
Lord Yang,

535
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,300
what do you mean?

536
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:34,750
Go ahead.

537
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,720
After verification,

538
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,060
the delegation of the North Clan forged the passports.

539
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,150
They broke into small groups

540
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,840
and left from the west Gate, north gate, and south gate.

541
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,990
The Palace Guards didn't notice anything unusual

542
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,290
and therefore didn't stop them.

543
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,870
During that time, the general of the south gate had suspected

544
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,940
that too many people were passing through customs with their passports.

545
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,750
He asked for instructions on whether he needed to examine them more carefully,

546
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,290
but...

547
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,460
Go on.

548
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,910
But the Place Guards had the previous night off.

549
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,800
Most officers hadn't returned from their hangovers.

550
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,600
This request wasn't replied to.

551
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,060
How could they be so careless and let the envoys go?

552
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,360
Zichuan's vital project is ruined in one day.

553
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,580
Lord Chieftain, please demote Lei Xun by three ranks.

554
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,220
The same goes with me as well.

555
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,980
Dismiss me from the post of Commander-in-Chief,

556
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,130
yet make me still take charge of affairs with the scope of the duty of a Commander-in-Chief.

557
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,730
Well...

558
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,320
Lord Ge, look.

559
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,560
Does this make sense?

560
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,950
Lord Chieftain, please calm down.

561
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,890
Because Si Yilin and I

562
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,040
are also here to admit our errors and ask for punishment.

563
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,030
As the Deputy Commander of the Royal Escorts,

564
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,330
Si Yilin was in charge of protecting Princess Ka Dan.

565
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,750
But the North Clan took her away easily,

566
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,460
hence the failure of the peace talks.

567
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,990
Zichuan's vital project is ruined in one day.

568
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,140
Lord Chieftain, please demote Si Yilin by three ranks.

569
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,740
The same goes with me as well.

570
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,980
Dismiss me from the post of Yuanzhou Commander,

571
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,260
yet make me still take charge of affairs with the scope of duty of Yuanzhou Commander.

572
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,730
What are you doing?

573
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,790
What are you doing?

574
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,750
do you

575
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,350
want to destroy Zichuan on purpose?

576
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,800
-I dare not.
-I dare not.

577
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,910
Lei Xun had led the Palace Guards

578
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,920
to train for days.

579
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,410
It's normal to take a leave.

580
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,780
What could he do if the people of the North Clan were determined to escape?

581
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,670
I know Si Yilin.

582
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,010
The North Clan had an internal strife.

583
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,830
There was no way to prevent that.

584
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,550
So, My Lords,

585
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,690
for my sake,

586
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,220
please don't mention punishment, okay?

587
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,250
No.

588
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,310
My Lords,

589
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,320
the envoys of the North Clan have left.

590
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,550
We need to come up with a solution.

591
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,970
Please think of the big picture

592
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,500
and...

593
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,040
You are right, Lord Chieftain.

594
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,230
I'll gather all commanders to discuss countermeasures.

595
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,030
Good.

596
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,350
I didn't expect they would retreat in order to advance.

597
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,070
I guess Yang Minghua wanted to sacrifice Lei Xun

598
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,360
to intervene in Yuanzhou affairs.

599
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,950
If Lei Xun did get demoted by three ranks,

600
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,220
it'd be reasonable for him to be a Deputy Commander in Yuanzhou.

601
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,700
So, I could only sacrifice you.

602
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,990
Then you'd be punished together or escape the punishment together.

603
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,790
I understand.

604
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,650
Everyone,

605
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,340
Princess Ka Dan is still alive.

606
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,800
She is in our hands.

607
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,560
Let's send her back.

608
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,260
Well...

609
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,410
Let's resolve the misunderstanding and negotiate again.

610
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,570
My Lord, if we send the princess back now,

611
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,410
the North Clan will know that we, Zichuan,

612
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,790
have strong intentions to negotiate. They may take the opportunity to make things difficult for us deliberately.

613
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,050
We will also lose the lever in the future.

614
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,880
So we need to reconsider it.

615
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,910
Lord Ge is right.

616
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,020
But we can't stop the peace talks.

617
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,090
I suggest to take good care of the princess

618
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,320
and write a letter.

619
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,580
Lord Ge can take it back to Yuanzhou

620
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,140
and then find a chance to negotiate peace with the North Clan.

621
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,080
Lord Ge, what do you think?

622
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
That's the correct way to do things.

623
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,460
That's great.

624
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,830
From now on, Zichuan and the North Clan will have a sensitive relation

625
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,090
that's hard to master.

626
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,730
You have to work hard on it, Lord Ge.

627
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,150
Deputy Commander Luo Bo

628
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,380
has deployed troops to the border for precautions.

629
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,710
Lord Ge, you do understand well that speed is precious in war.

630
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,330
Lord Yang, you have always been a great strategist.

631
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,970
Any objections from the Ministry of War?

632
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,450
Both of you have no objections.

633
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,080
I don't think they'll have any objections.

634
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,670
My Lord, I have a different opinion.

635
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,280
I think the two Lords

636
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,180
are too benevolent.

637
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,670
Now, the hawks of the North Clan have won a great victory.

638
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,270
I don't think there is any hope for peace talks.

639
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,850
Now, we have no other option but to flex our muscles by sending troops to the border.
