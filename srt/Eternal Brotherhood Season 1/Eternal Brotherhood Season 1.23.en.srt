00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,710
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,750
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,210
Si Yilin is good at using military tactics,

6
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,670
but he has his weaknesses.

7
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,750
That is, the Zichuan army is weak

8
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,000
and lacks strength.

9
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,070
If the North Clan soldiers take advantage of their weaknesses,

10
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,000
they will be able to win in one shot.

11
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,240
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

12
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,270
My guards are all over the Maple Forest.

13
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,550
Si Yilin's men

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,270
will not be able to break through the regiment's formation

15
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,870
and endanger His Majesty.

16
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,230
Father.

17
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,710
Forgive me for my messy appearance, I came here in a hurry.

18
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,910
I rushed here as soon as I heard the news.

19
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,910
The Lu Di troops have been stationed all over the Maple Forest.

20
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,030
They vow to fight Si Yilin's army to the death

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,090
to protect Father.

22
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,310
Your Majesty, even if Si Yilin comes,

23
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,700
I can defeat him quickly,

24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,050
take his head

25
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,590
and guard Your Majesty.

26
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,960
Greetings, Father.

27
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,510
I have sinned.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,930
I didn't come in time to protect you

29
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,980
because I'm guessing that

30
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,630
that Si Yilin's attack on Father was fake

31
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,829
and it's a diversion.

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,790
I've sent the General-in-chief

33
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,920
to investigate the whereabouts of Si Yilin and stop him.

34
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,670
We will catch him off guard.

35
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,770
Lu Di.

36
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,040
You've led troops for a long time,

37
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,010
yet you can't even see through such a stupid tactic.

38
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,829
I'm guilty. Please calm down, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm guilty. Please calm down, Father.

40
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,910
Ka Lan!

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,700
You're so arrogant just because you have some smarts.

42
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,610
If Si Yilin isn't a diversion,

43
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,870
aren't you being disloyal and unfilial?

44
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm sorry. Please calm down, Father.

45
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,110
Father, I know I'm not as smart as Second Brother.

46
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,270
Although I know you are invincible,

47
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,730
the Zichuan family has always been cunning.

48
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,070
It's only because I care about Father's safety

49
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,510
and I couldn't ignore your safety.

50
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,310
That's why...

51
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,850
That's why I got confused, because I was concerned.

52
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,450
Your Majesty, the soldiers of the North Clan are incomparably brave.

53
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,320
The remaining Zichuan troops are no match for them.

54
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,070
They say that our North Clan soldiers are incomparably brave,

55
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,650
but we are also lacking intelligence and strategies. We can't succeed in big tasks.

56
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,320
All units, assemble your troops and station them here.

57
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,950
Yes, Father.

58
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,909
Yes.

59
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,750
I want to see

60
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,790
what tricks this Si Yilin can pull.

61
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,790
My Lord, according to the information from the front line,

62
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,630
Si Yilin has issued a war letter

63
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,870
saying he wants to go directly to the Maple Forest

64
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,670
to take the head of the Divine Emperor of Sairong.

65
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,630
But then, he disappeared.

66
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,240
Attack the Divine Emperor of Sairong directly?

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,520
I was shocked, too.

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,150
The Divine Emperor himself will be on the field.

69
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,550
The two princes, Ka Dun and Ka Lan will lead the troops

70
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,950
and assist in the escort.

71
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,830
They're sending in millions of soldiers to fight.

72
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,160
If Si Yilin is so impulsive, I'm afraid...

73
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,120
Lord Chieftain.

74
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,590
General Si Yilin is the Tiger of Zichuan.

75
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,990
He's experienced, courageous and resourceful.

76
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,630
He won't act recklessly

77
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,870
and disregard the lives of the Zichuan family elites.

78
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,650
I got it.

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,680
Si Yilin is creating a diversion

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,790
to divert the enemy

81
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,310
and disperse the forces of the North Clan.

82
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,890
He's buying more time

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,350
for our family's defense, right?

84
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,390
Yes. I believe General Si Yilin's

85
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,470
disappearance is only temporary.

86
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,550
They will definitely fulfill their mission.

87
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,390
But...

88
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,970
Ning, you've been with me

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,330
for a while, studying political affairs.

90
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,680
What do you think?

91
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,130
I think the most important thing at this time

92
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,670
is not Lord Si Yilin,

93
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,710
but the family.

94
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,110
Lord Si Yilin's move

95
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,030
will definitely cause turmoil within the family,

96
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,390
so the crisis will be internal, not external.

97
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,990
In the face of danger,

98
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,130
the family must not be disorganized.

99
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,710
We should send more people to the front line

100
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,720
to ensure the accuracy of our sources in the Imperial Capital.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,360
At the same time, we should raise funds

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,670
to prepare for emergencies.

103
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,670
From the history records that I studied recently,

104
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,000
I also remember a record

105
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,830
about the Battle of Blue River over 100 years ago,

106
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,270
where there was a similar situation.

107
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,590
Our generals at the time

108
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,310
used a diversion

109
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,190
to attract the attention of the North Clan.

110
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,560
The family utilized accurate and fast information transmission

111
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,310
to coordinate the front line and rear, and achieved victory.

112
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,240
Lord Chieftain.

113
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,640
Advisor Ma Wei wants to see you.

114
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,870
Let him in.

115
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,400
Yes.

116
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,310
Advisor Ma Wei, please.

117
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,770
Lord Chieftain.

118
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,430
I've been informed that the war is getting more complicated on the front.

119
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,830
As a junior of the Three Central Offices,

120
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,090
I know my responsibilities and mission.

121
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,650
On behalf of the Three Central Offices,

122
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,180
I'm here to help the family.

123
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,570
What are your thoughts, Lord Ma?

124
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,680
I think

125
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,030
we shouldn't just be defending against the North Clan.

126
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,820
With regards to the movements of the other families,

127
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,750
we can't let our guard down either.

128
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,070
This is a time of internal and external trouble for the family.

129
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,670
The other families will likely

130
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,350
catch wind of this and take advantage of the situation.

131
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,550
We can't be careless.

132
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,510
Also, we should strengthen our trade ties with the Lin family.

133
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,340
We can purchase

134
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,390
some military supplies and provisions from the Lin family

135
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,250
to enrich the family's stockpile

136
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,000
in case of emergencies.

137
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,390
At the same time, we need to continue to

138
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,710
fortify the last line of the family's defense,

139
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,909
Wayun Fortress.

140
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,409
That's very well thought out.

141
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,560
The Ma family

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
has produced a true young talent for my family.

143
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,160
My Lord, you flatter me.

144
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,430
As long as the family needs me,

145
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,200
I will do my best.

146
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,970
You came at the right time.

147
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,630
Ning, let me introduce you.

148
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,910
This is Advisor Ma Wei.

149
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,210
Your Highness.

150
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,710
Advisor Ma Wei is the youngest advisor

151
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,070
in the history of the Three Central Offices.

152
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,710
He has a knack for

153
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,130
government affairs and military strategy.

154
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,250
If you talk to each other,

155
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,110
it'll help you to

156
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,280
improve your knowledge.

157
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,550
Yes, Uncle.

158
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,610
I'm not very knowledgeable.

159
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,270
I look forward to your guidance, Your Highness.

160
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,030
If Your Highness is not interested in politics today,

161
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,360
we can talk another day.

162
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,250
I heard Uncle say that it's dangerous at the front line now.

163
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,550
I can't think of anything else today.

164
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,240
Forgive me.

165
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,650
I understand Your Highness's concern for Lord Xiu.

166
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,740
Lord Xiu and Your Highness

167
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,340
were childhood sweethearts and have deep feelings for each other.

168
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,600
I've heard about that.

169
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,230
But based on my judgment,

170
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,300
Your Highness doesn't have to worry too much.

171
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,100
Although Lord Xiu is young,

172
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,750
he's very thoughtful and resourceful.

173
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,430
Although he often plays tricks,

174
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,640
he's always able to, in ways that defy common sense

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,970
and are unpredictable,

176
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,510
save the day at critical moments.

177
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,710
You know Brother Xiu?

178
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,400
Although I've never met Lord Xiu face to face,

179
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,430
my family has been in business for generations,

180
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,110
and have been to countless places.

181
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,110
I have some friends in Yuanzhou too,

182
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,610
so I've heard a lot about Lord Xiu.

183
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,510
Lord Xiu has always been

184
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,790
a young talent I want to make friends with.

185
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,520
Hopefully, I can learn from him in person one day.

186
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,320
I'm afraid this battle in Yuanzhou

187
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,430
can't be avoided with just a little ingenuity.

188
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,280
Don't worry about that.

189
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,510
The battle between the two armies hasn't reached a decisive moment yet.

190
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,240
With Lord Xiu's intelligence,

191
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,870
he can definitely protect himself.

192
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,470
I'm just worried that...

193
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,100
About what?

194
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,870
Lord Xiu is a loyal man.

195
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,680
Even if he can leave,

196
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,350
he'll never leave his brothers behind.

197
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,990
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

198
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,590
With Brother Xiu's personality,

199
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,020
if he can escape,

200
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,540
he'll definitely support Lord Si Yilin.

201
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,470
Ma Wei,

202
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,510
can you do me a favor?

203
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,910
Can you help me ask about

204
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,590
Brother Xiu and

205
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,070
Lord Si Yilin in Yuanzhou?

206
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,930
Since Your Highness asked me to,

207
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,400
I will do my best.

208
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,070
Luo Jie.

209
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,720
The momentum is almost at its peak.

210
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,330
Tonight, divide the team into small groups

211
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,720
and withdraw into Wayun from the small roads.

212
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,750
I'll do it.

213
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,100
Ming Yu, preserve the food well.

214
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,110
Take them all back to Wayun.

215
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,640
Don't waste a single grain.

216
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,830
As for those fake ones,

217
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,150
continue to disperse and confuse the enemy.

218
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,550
Okay.

219
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,070
Shall we form a team

220
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,600
to go to Payi with some food?

221
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,200
No need.

222
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,510
If we lose Payi, Yuanzhou will be gone.

223
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,230
If we lose Wayun, Zichuan will be gone.

224
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,910
So no matter what,

225
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,370
we must protect Wayun.

226
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,380
What did I say?

227
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,110
Xiu is still so mean.

228
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,480
Ho-ho-ha.

229
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:47,200
Ho-ho-ha.

230
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,620
Ho-ho-ha.

231
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,000
Wait, you...

232
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,040
Do you...

233
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,550
Do you want to die with me?

234
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,730
Soldiers are cunning.

235
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,670
We heard that the North Clan is pretty rich,

236
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,940
so we'd like to find out for ourselves.

237
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,490
Lord Xiu said that the spirit is the most important.

238
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,310
Boss.

239
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,590
What do you think of our spirit?

240
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,670
There's room for improvement.

241
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,070
Ho-ho-ha.

242
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,750
Ho-ho-ha.

243
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,600
That's more like it.

244
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,590
With this spirit,

245
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,590
how can we not show the North Clan how it's done?

246
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,780
Don't worry.

247
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,790
The Palace Guards have gone to Payi as planned.

248
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,630
We, the Xiu Battalion, are the only ones who'll follow you to your death.

249
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,270
Ho-ho-ha.

250
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,270
Ho-ho-ha.

251
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,750
Ho-ho-ha.

252
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,750
Ho-ho-ha.

253
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,600
Come on.

254
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,470
Again.

255
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,230
Drink.

256
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,550
Took down Payi City in one day.

257
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,020
What warriors of Zichuan?

258
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,190
They are all defeated by me, Oule!

259
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,350
That's right.

260
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,230
Drink!

261
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,550
General, bad news! General!

262
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,150
General.

263
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,390
The East Gate, the East Gate is lost!

264
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,040
Si Yilin is attacking the city!

265
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,800
What?

266
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,630
My Lord.

267
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,440
The first and second teams have conquered all gates of Payi City

268
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,140
and captured over 10,000 North Clan prisoners.

269
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,470
Most of them were drunk.

270
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,030
They were barely able to fight.

271
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,430
My Lord, you knew the right time to act.

272
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,260
The North Clan didn't expect us to fight back,

273
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,790
they're all drinking and celebrating, and are very relaxed.

274
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,670
Get people to guard the city gates. No mistakes.

275
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,160
Yes.

276
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,510
Report!

277
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,850
General, bad news. We lost Payi City.

278
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
It's indeed Si Yilin.

279
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,910
I just didn’t expect

280
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,430
he would be so fast.

281
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,230
What's the situation?

282
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,470
Zichuan's Si Yilin led his troops to attack Payi City suddenly.

283
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,710
The defending general, Oule and his men were powerless to resist

284
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,870
and were all captured.

285
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,630
Fortunately, you predicted this

286
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,630
and we're only 30 miles away from Payi.

287
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,090
Should we send troops now?

288
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,230
Send my order.

289
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,310
Cut off the Payi's water supply and surround Payi City.

290
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,790
Yes.

291
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,670
General, aren't we going to fight?

292
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,830
The enemy's strength is unknown. We can't act rashly.

293
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,670
Besides, although Si Yilin

294
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,800
took down Payi with a surprise attack,

295
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,220
he's trapped there.

296
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,910
We just need to cut off the water supply.

297
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,730
When they run out of food and ammunition,

298
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,590
we can take down Payi City without a single soldier.

299
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,320
My Lord.

300
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,680
North Clan's Yun Qianxue's regiment

301
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,160
are stationed on the north bank of the Gray River,

302
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,220
surrounding Payi.

303
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,190
Ming Hui's old troops are blocked

304
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,720
and can't go in to the city to provide support.

305
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,520
Looks like Xiu's performance is not good enough.

306
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,550
Send my order. All troops are to get ready for battle.

307
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:01,920
Yes.

308
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,980
Also, stock up on water ahead of time.

309
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,490
A diversion.

310
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,530
Father, the Zichuan family is cunning.

311
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,550
I'll lead 200,000 soldiers

312
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,880
to besiege Si Yilin.

313
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,190
We'll get Payi back within three days.

314
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,070
Father, General-in-chief Yun Qianxue

315
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,070
has arrived outside of Payi City,

316
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,600
cut off Payi's water supply

317
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,630
and besieged Si Yilin.

318
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,910
When Si Yilin runs out of food and ammunition,

319
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,110
we'll definitely get Payi back without a single soldier.

320
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,450
The General-in-chief is a good strategist.

321
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,490
This plan is feasible.

322
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,230
It's just a diversion.

323
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,270
He can't stop me.

324
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,310
Since the Tiger of Zichuan invited me,

325
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,260
I can't let them down.

326
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,470
In this battle, I'll be leading the troops.

327
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,150
Ka Dun, Lu Di, Pingjing Duke.

328
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,750
Yes.

329
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,200
You lead the troops to Payi

330
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,670
to suppress Si Yilin

331
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,680
together with the General-in-chief.

332
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,020
Yes sir.

333
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,870
The Divine Emperor's holy might shakes the universe.

334
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,750
The North Clan will win!

335
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,610
Long live Father! The North Clan will win!

336
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,870
My Lord. There are North Clan guards at all water points

337
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,630
and North Clan soldiers are all outside the city now.

338
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,890
If we leave the city, there'll be a fight.

339
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,550
Can the soldiers continue the hold?

340
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,030
We're running low on water.

341
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,200
We're trapped.

342
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,390
Guard Payi and prepare to fight.

343
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,960
Understood.

344
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,910
Cutting off the water source... it's tactical.

345
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,220
Unfortunately, it's not very innovative.

346
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,260
What's your plan?

347
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,760
We are a creative team.

348
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,380
Go hunting.

349
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,550
Bad news!

350
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,550
General! The enemy is attacking the camp!

351
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,470
What?

352
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,030
Gather the troops immediately!

353
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,510
The lieutenants are already gathering them.

354
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,930
It's just that the attack was too sudden.

355
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,440
And they're still wearing the North Clan's military uniform.

356
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,840
It's hard to tell who's the enemy.

357
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,150
They're wearing the military uniform of the North Clan?

358
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,590
Yes.

359
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,150
Si Yilin's troops have left the city?

360
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,270
They're not Si Yilin's troops.

361
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,000
The attack came from behind us.

362
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,390
Are these North Clan rebels or Zichuan's reinforcements?

363
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,270
I don't know.

364
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,110
Report!

365
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,590
Emergency military report.

366
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,230
Admiral Lei Hong said there're rebels from the North Clan.

367
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,910
What?

368
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,650
Why would you call Pingjing Duke Admiral Lei Hong?

369
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,070
You...

370
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,110
Who are you?

371
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,470
Protect the General!

372
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:06,750
General!

373
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,790
General!

374
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,560
General!

375
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,310
General, wake up! General!

376
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,940
What happened?

377
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,540
My Lord.

378
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,990
We found a group of North Clan

379
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,510
who are heading towards Payi.

380
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,950
They also have a white flag

381
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,480
with some kind of code on it.

382
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,920
Archers, get ready.

383
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,520
The handsome and brave Third Brother.

384
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,140
You're still so stupid.

385
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,380
How's it going? Everything okay?

386
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,200
Everything's okay.

387
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,680
If there're problems, I'm coming after you.

388
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,410
Don't worry.

389
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,000
Thank you for your hard work.

390
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,350
It's been a great ride.

391
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,100
You didn't embarrass me.

392
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,510
Who let the beggars in?

393
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,810
Second Brother!

394
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,920
Second Brother, I, a beggar

395
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,470
brought you a secret surprise.

396
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,860
Brothers, unload the goods.

397
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,350
Okay.

398
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,310
Here.

399
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,430
Of course, this isn't

400
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,390
the secret that I'm talking about.

401
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,150
Xiu, you shouldn't have come.

402
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,830
What? I'm not welcome?

403
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,750
I took care the people tailing you guys.

404
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,240
Let's go.

405
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,410
General.

406
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,820
Although the arm can't be restored,

407
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,150
if you recuperate well,

408
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,360
you'll be able to move around like a normal person.

409
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,370
I got it. You may leave.

410
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,270
Yes.

411
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,030
General.

412
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,270
I'll lead the troops to attack Lei Hong's army

413
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,200
and tear that bastard into pieces.

414
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,190
No.

415
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:18,500
General.

416
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,120
It's not him.

417
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,870
If Lei Hong really wanted to kill me,

418
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:30,190
why would he send someone in his own military's uniform?

419
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,710
And he called him Admiral Lei Hong, it's very strange.

420
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,870
Whoever hurt me must be someone else.

421
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,380
I will find him

422
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,740
and kill him.

423
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,710
General, the Divine Emperor heard the news that

424
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,660
Si Yilin has taken over Payi

425
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,990
and sent Prince Ka Dun to supervise the battle.

426
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,190
Please give instructions on how to deal with

427
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,320
the Zichuan Army in Payi City, my Lord.

428
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,410
I'm willing to share your burden.

429
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,460
Let's take a break

430
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,580
and stay put for now.

431
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,010
But Prince Ka Dun has arrived.

432
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,270
I can wait, but he might not be able to.

433
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,310
Where is the General-in-chief?

434
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,310
Take me to him now!

435
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,800
Your Highness.

436
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,500
It broke.

437
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,930
It really broke.

438
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,350
Your Highness.

439
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,430
How did you protect the General?

440
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,890
Calm down, Your Highness.

441
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,800
Calm down.

442
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,950
Bastard!

443
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,060
It's not his fault. The opponent was too strong.

444
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,710
I was careless

445
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,460
and fell into his trap.

446
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,750
Who was it?

447
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,590
I want to kill him.

448
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,380
Calm down, Your Highness.

449
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,230
General Yun is known as the first general of the Golden Army.

450
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,650
If even he couldn't handle that person,

451
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,920
he must be a master.

452
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,200
Bullshit! The North Clan is full of talents.

453
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,390
Will we be threatened by a petty Zichuan thief?

454
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,790
General-in-chief, don't worry.

455
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,230
Revenge for you

456
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,430
is not your personal business anymore.

457
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,910
It concerns the dignity of our North Clan.

458
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,900
I will gather all my men

459
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,290
to avenge you.

460
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,470
I, Yun Qianxue, was inferior in skill

461
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,310
and humiliated the North Clan.

462
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,570
Please punish me, Your Highness.

463
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,900
You're too polite, General Yun.

464
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,500
Take care of yourself.

465
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,370
I will avenge you

466
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,440
and kill the person who hurt you.

467
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,570
Take care, General Yun.

468
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,590
It's been verified?

469
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,830
Just a glance.

470
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,000
When I saw Yun Qianxue's arm,

471
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,560
I almost laughed.

472
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,080
Actually, you don't have to visit me.

473
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,180
Yun Qianxue has followed Ka Lan since he was a child.

474
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,780
He wants to follow my brother.

475
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,710
How can I be at ease if I didn't see it with my own eyes?

476
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,310
Now,

477
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,070
we haven't even gone to war with Si Yilin

478
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,460
and the North Clan First General's arm

479
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,230
is gone.

480
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,950
I feel sorry for my brother.

481
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,700
I heard Prince Prince Ka Lan is determined to kill Lei Hong

482
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,910
to seek justice for Yun Qianxue.

483
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,580
Now, Lei Hong is a traitor of Zichuan,

484
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,520
and hated by the North Clan.

485
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,990
A veritable homeless dog.

486
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,990
Lei Hong doesn't have those skills.

487
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,870
There's something strange going on here.

488
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,130
But, since he has the rebels in Yuanzhou,

489
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,190
this is a good chance to take him in.

490
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,460
Your Highness is wise.

491
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,110
If the rebels in Yuanzhou aqre yours,

492
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,750
we'll definitely win this battle.

493
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,230
Yun Qianxue is really stubborn.

494
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,560
I just took some grains from him.

495
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,760
I didn't expect him to attack us so soon.

496
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,170
Did you just grab some grains?

497
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,710
He lost an arm.

498
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,470
Isn't that all the more reason to rest and recuperate?

499
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,330
I just wanted him to get some rest.

500
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,510
The backup units must have arrived.

501
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,730
And there's also the Yuanzhou tribe.

502
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,550
Looks like the rebels in Yuanzhou have surrendered and returned to the North Clan.

503
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,060
I've never seen such a big battle.

504
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,260
One, two, three, go!

505
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,470
We surrender. Please treat us prisoners well.

506
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,810
End.

507
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,440
How is it?

508
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,470
It works.

509
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,960
But it's not creative.

510
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,970
I think we should make a Song of the Divine Emperor.

511
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,490
If we're captured, we'll move our enemies.

512
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,910
Crying is the most important for these things.

513
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,380
I...

514
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,590
What if I can't cry?

515
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:36,730
Wait.

516
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,840
I found a doctor

517
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,620
who prescribed some medicine.

518
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,060
When you sprinkle this on your eyes,

519
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,350
you cry instantly - you'll move anyone.

520
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,680
Chickening out before battle. A bunch of cowards.

521
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,810
You don't look like Zichuan soldiers.

522
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,950
Who said that?

523
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,210
The spirit of a soldier, great.

524
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,030
Thousands of soldiers have surrounded the city, forming a strong siege.

525
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,710
We need to be realistic.

526
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,710
Am I right?

527
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,710
Yes.

528
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,150
How can the Palace Guards

529
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,710
compare with deserters

530
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,390
like you?

531
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,700
Who are you calling deserters? Xiu Battalion.

532
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,270
Yes.

533
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,310
Get him.

534
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,640
What are you talking about?

535
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,360
Stop fighting, brothers.

536
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,580
Brothers, we are brothers.

537
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,350
Why are you fighting?

538
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:27,860
Enough.

539
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,740
I'm talking about you.

540
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,270
Stop!

541
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,730
Shut up!

542
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,910
You...

543
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,220
Is this how you work for me?

544
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,110
I've taught you nothing.

545
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,610
Lord Xiu, we're sorry.

546
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,840
Guys, they know they were wrong.

547
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,800
Let's just let it go.

548
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,860
Go back first.

549
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,510
Let's go.

550
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,550
What have you guys done?

551
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,370
The props are not in place, and the emotions are not sincere.

552
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,560
And you dare to sing?

553
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,380
Who gave you the courage?

554
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,250
This slogan is so ordinary.

555
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,080
Do you think the Divine Emperor of Sairong

556
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,909
will let you idiots surrender?

557
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,920
How many times have I told you?

558
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,110
If you surrender,

559
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,150
at least show some sincerity.

560
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,150
Right?

561
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,290
This slogan should be vivid and clear.

562
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,000
Singing and dancing should be melodious and beautiful.

563
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,560
At the very least, you have to make people cry.

564
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,000
Forget about the song and dance.

565
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,929
How about we change it to poetry recitation?

566
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,710
Let's call it "The Divine Emperor is invincible"?

567
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,530
That's good. The Divine Emperor is invincible.

568
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,590
The Divine Emperor is invincible.

569
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,630
The Divine Emperor is invincible.

570
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,430
If you choose to give up,

571
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,720
you won't get any benefits.

572
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,710
My will...

573
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,630
I, Zichuan Xiu,

574
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,290
am now the Deputy Commander of the Xiu Battalion of the Yuanzhou Army

575
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,220
on duty at Payi.

576
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,530
Knowing that the battle of Payi is a matter of life and death,

577
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,620
I hereby make this will

578
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,220
to prevent any disputes in property division.

579
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,120
First of all, I have no children.

580
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,230
If I'd known I'd die young,

581
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,830
I would've gotten a wife.

582
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,560
Xiaozhu from the dessert shop next to Jintai Hotel

583
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,880
is a good girl.

584
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,060
She used to give me sweets when I was young.

585
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,190
I didn't cherish it.

586
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,030
Big Brother Di Lin owes me three dinners.

587
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,590
Remember, it's dinner.

588
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,440
Because only fried rice at night

589
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
has seafood in it.

590
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,590
I hope Big Brother and sister-in-law can keep your promise.

591
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,790
Are you serious?

592
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,070
Of course.

593
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,870
After I die,

594
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,540
I'm willing to donate my underpants

595
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,830
to the treasury.

596
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,270
I hope my family can acknowledge me as the Commander.

597
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,880
I'll give all my assets

598
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,940
to the brothers of the Xiu Battalion.

599
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,420
My property,

600
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,650
my people and all the things on your mind

601
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,610
are all in the Imperial Capital.

602
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,770
I know you miss home.

603
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,050
But now the North Clan is here.

604
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,600
We can't leave Payi City behind.

605
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,900
Because if we lose Payi City,

606
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
we lose Wayun.

607
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,280
If we lose Wayun, then the city...

608
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,380
So, brothers, guarding Payi City

609
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,310
is our only way out.

610
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,710
If you want my property, go back to the Imperial Capital.

611
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,510
But you have to die with me first.

612
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,940
We'll always be together with Lord Xiu!

613
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,660
Together! Together!

614
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,030
We'll do our best for Payi City!

615
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,230
We'll do our best! We'll do our best!

616
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,990
Don't worry.

617
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,940
Even if we die,

618
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,260
I'll die first.

619
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,870
Lord Xiu.

620
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,230
As you ordered,

621
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,710
we've pacified the people of the city.

622
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,600
The equipment and supplies in the city have been accounted for.

623
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,720
I've arranged for people to keep an eye on the enemy.

624
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,070
If there's any movement, prepare to fight at any time.

625
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,710
Okay.

626
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,570
Guys,

627
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,430
the safety of Payi City depends on you.

628
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,230
All right.

629
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,990
Go with Baichuan to prepare.

630
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,000
Let's go.

631
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,680
Second Brother.

632
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,470
If we die, I'll die before you.

633
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,200
We, Zichuan have taken a big blow this time.

634
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,750
It's not easy for them

635
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,400
to protect Wayun Fortress.

636
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,840
So they won't send reinforcements here.

637
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,270
Whether we live or die in this battle

638
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,390
is up to us.

639
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,710
Not just us,

640
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,560
but also your Palace Guards

641
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,960
and my Xiu Battalion.

642
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,450
You came to protect me.

643
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,270
So I'll definitely protect you.

644
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,090
Promise me.

645
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,140
if anything happens,

646
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,120
don't worry about me. You go first.

647
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,830
I'm not the only one

648
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,910
who's capable of killing my way out of here, right?

649
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,270
My brothers

650
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,300
were brought here by me.

651
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,380
Even if I can't take them back,

652
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,660
I can at least die with them.

653
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,350
Why don't you let me die with you then?

654
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,070
I'm serious.

655
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm serious too.

656
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,510
Forget it.

657
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,840
Didn't you write your will?

658
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,590
So you won't abandon me to live alone.

659
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,270
But...

660
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,150
What?

661
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,290
You don't have enough money to share with anyone.

662
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,180
I'm the one who's saved up a lot these years.

663
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,150
That makes sense.

664
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,160
I have to add a few more words to my will.

665
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,910
If Second Brother Si Yilin dies,

666
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,550
his inheritance will be mine.

667
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,070
That's my will.

668
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,910
I see.

669
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,610
Thank you, Xiu.

670
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,230
For what?

671
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,840
You're willing to live and die with me.

672
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,570
Why can't you tell what's important?

673
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,860
The most important thing now is not to live and die together

674
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,990
but not to give Big Brother the best deal.

675
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,740
He has the most money.

676
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,040
We should split his.

677
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,680
Let's go.

678
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,890
Wayun has gathered

679
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,650
all the noblemen and soldiers.

680
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
Those noblemen and officers who are used to idling around,

681
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,260
when they heard it was your order,

682
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,040
though they were reluctant,

683
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,820
they didn't dare to not come.

684
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,660
Military orders of the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs must be obeyed. Who dares to disobey?

685
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,470
Even so,

686
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,950
most of them

687
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,670
are the sons and nephews of Three Central Offices members.

688
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,560
They joined the army

689
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,480
mostly to get a position

690
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,510
in their families

691
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,270
for the sake of business.

692
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,570
There have no military honor.

693
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,920
What a disgrace to their families.

694
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,030
My Lord.

695
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,090
Shall we go down with Lord Si?

696
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,970
Let them stay there first.

697
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,900
Without my order,

698
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,270
nobody leaves.

699
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,950
Yes.

700
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,270
It's been six hours.

701
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,240
Why isn't Lord Di Lin here yet?

702
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,950
Why don't we go back and rest?

703
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,790
When he remembers us,

704
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,610
it won't be too late still.

705
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,310
How dare you!

706
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,710
Lord Di Lin's title of the executioner

707
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,840
is not for naught.

708
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,390
Many senior officials

709
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,590
were killed by him.

710
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,690
You couldn't cut off enough of your head.

711
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,270
If we keep waiting,

712
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,350
we'll still die.

713
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,280
This is an insult to us nobles.

714
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,770
That's right.

715
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,320
Let's go.

716
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,190
Take him away.

717
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,110
My Lord, please spare my life.

718
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
My Lord!

719
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,550
My Lord!

720
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,190
Please spare my life.

721
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,300
My Lord.

722
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,440
I'm sorry you had to stay in Wayun.

723
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,430
Why don't we send you to the battlefield to kill the enemy?

724
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,290
My Lord.

725
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,690
We are responsible for repairing Wayun

726
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,220
guarding the last line of defense of our home.

727
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,160
We can't leave.

728
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,930
Why hasn't the wall been repaired then?

729
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,070
We don't have enough supplies.

730
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,870
And the supplies needed for repair

731
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,420
and personnel deployment...

732
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,980
So, this and...

733
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,180
From now on,

734
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,190
all of you are not allowed any breaks.

735
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,390
I need to see the repairs in seven days.

736
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,420
Yes.

737
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,630
I'm tired.

738
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,120
Tell them the rules of this place.

739
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:29,960
Yes.

740
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,430
Wounded soldiers from the front line,

741
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,410
no matter what position you hold,

742
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,630
you will be re-grouped at Wayun.

743
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,600
You'll obey all orders from Lord Lin Bing.

744
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,270
If you run back to your families or loaf around

745
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,130
and violate the military order,

746
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,710
you'll be killed.

747
00:43:59,310 --> 00:43:59,990
Yes.
