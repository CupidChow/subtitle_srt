[Eternal Brotherhood 1]

3
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,860
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,780
After all, Yuanzhou is in civil strife.

5
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,710
If foreigners interfere in its governance,

6
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,259
there will be military conflicts again the future.

7
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,870
Lord Chieftain, what Elder Bunong said

8
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,900
makes some sense.

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,550
Yuanzhou is vast,

10
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,160
but it's mostly barren land.

11
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,670
Instead of having conflicts with people there again and again,

12
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,710
we can let Elder Bunong govern that place.

13
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,820
If the family needs anything in the future,

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,079
Elder Bunong will mediate

15
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,660
between the two sides.

16
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,270
Right?

17
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,790
Of course.

18
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,290
To satisfy Lord Chieftain's need will always be the priority.

19
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,720
What a joke.

20
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,090
Di Lin, we're now at Three Central Offices.

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,640
I don't think you have the right to attend this meeting.

22
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,140
Sorry, My Lord.

23
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,130
I'm a martial artist who has good hearing.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,310
I happened to hear

25
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,380
something treasonable just now.

26
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,510
And I couldn't control my feet and legs

27
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,920
so I came in to see

28
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,260
who the traitor is.

29
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,360
You're talking nonsense.

30
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,640
Drop your weapons.

31
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,780
You really wanted to break the rules

32
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,380
of Three Central Offices in front of everyone?

33
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,460
Advisors, I have a question.

34
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,270
The generals of the family are risking their lives when fighting on the battlefield.

35
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,210
Right now, many of our soldiers

36
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,630
are fighting on the front line.

37
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,630
Why are they so loyal?

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,480
Because they're proud to fight for the territorial integrity of the country

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
and for the stability of the family.

40
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,230
How dare a nobody coming from nowhere

41
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,790
ask the Zichuan family

42
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,740
to let him govern Yuanzhou?

43
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,990
This is outrageous!

44
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,230
My Lords.

45
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,310
I have no intention of rebelling.

46
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,550
Advisors.

47
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,570
How could you plan to give an outsider the right

48
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,300
to govern the entire Yuanzhou?

49
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,710
This decision will be a national disgrace.

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,980
You're exaggerating.

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,630
What we're doing at Three Central Offices

52
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,560
is for the interests of the family.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,279
I'm telling you the truth.

54
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,019
Hope you'll understand.

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,700
Let me ask you.

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,510
Are you doing this to protect the interests of the entire family

57
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,090
or to get the business of your own family to resume operation?

58
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,620
That's a different matter.

59
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,840
Now we're at Three Central Offices.

60
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,810
We're addressing the problems brought by the prolonged war.

61
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,180
If it continues, I'm afraid our national power will decline.

62
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,150
You nobles from all families

63
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,510
have long enslaved the people in Yuanzhou

64
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,030
and have been turning a blind eye to the corruption of local officials.

65
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,960
That's why the people in Yuanzhou are rebelling now.

66
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,800
You took advantage of the benefits of the family

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,300
and feathered your own nest.

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,800
You're a bunch of hypocrites and parasites

69
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,910
who should be blamed for the crisis faced by the family.

70
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,560
You...

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,670
Di Lin, what do you mean?

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,550
The people you called parasites

73
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,990
have all contributed a lot to the family.

74
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,240
Weren't the high profits they made from the operation of mines

75
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,750
spent on the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

76
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,310
and used to pay for the provisions for the army?

77
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,980
You're naive to think you didn't use their money.

78
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,380
Your soldiers are supported by the people you called parasites.

79
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,310
If you want to continue to be a parasite, that's fine.

80
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,170
But if you want to give up the right to govern Yuanzhou to negotiate peace,

81
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,460
I will never agree.

82
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,320
There're wars everywhere now.

83
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,870
Only by suppressing and punishing the rebels

84
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,070
can we let all the people know

85
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,870
that the family is inviolable.

86
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,730
Only in this way

87
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,640
can the family be permanently stable.

88
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,409
I'm afraid you don't get to decide

89
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,880
whether to negotiate peace or not.

90
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,470
The voting mechanism of Three Central Offices

91
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,570
is something sacrosanct of the Zichuan family.

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,380
The representative for the peace talk is here.

93
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,400
The peace deal has been voted through.

94
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,150
Di Lin.

95
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,510
The advisors appreciated your loyalty

96
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,570
and didn't punish you for barging in.

97
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,820
Instead, they explained everything to you patiently.

98
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,080
Are you satisfied now?

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,870
Leave now!

100
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,130
Leave now!

101
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,360
You...

102
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,630
Di Lin, you killed someone in public.

103
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,410
You'll be sentenced to death.

104
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,150
The representative for the peace negotiation is now dead.

105
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,150
The peace negotiation will have to start over.

106
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,110
You can punish me however you want.

107
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,110
You can send me to jail right now.

108
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,750
That's enough.

109
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,580
The rules that have existed for years at Three Central Offices

110
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,750
have been broken by you alone today.

111
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,170
You showed no respect for your elders and spoke rudely.

112
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,200
You really think an official should be like that?

113
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,070
Are you trying to take over my position?

114
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,630
I dare not.

115
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,350
I just couldn't stand watching the traitors bring a national disgrace

116
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,600
and cede the territory of the country of the family.

117
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
How dare you!

118
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,670
The advisors were all trying their best to solve the problem.

119
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,870
You don't understand it at all.

120
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,980
You still haven't realized your mistake. This is intolerable.

121
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,530
Lord Chieftain...

122
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,650
I have to punish you for barging in.

123
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,460
But considering that you did it for the family

124
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,490
and that you have contributed to fighting corruption,

125
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,420
I won't get you punished this time.

126
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,669
Leave.

127
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,570
Why aren't you leaving? You really want to be punished?

128
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,429
Leave now!

129
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,830
Thank you, Lord Chieftain. I'll take my leave.

130
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,140
Well...

131
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,080
Why did you let him go and didn't punish him?

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,740
We can't do nothing about Elder Bunong's death.

133
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,790
Enough. If others know what happened just now,

134
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,970
we'll be in a very unfavorable position in the war against the rebels.

135
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,630
But...

136
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,950
Keep his death secret for as long as possible.

137
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,470
Di Lin killed someone in public and didn't get punished at all.

138
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,670
I really don’t understand why Lord Chieftain let him off.

139
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,050
Lord Chieftain

140
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,570
didn't want to give up the right to govern Yuanzhou.

141
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,080
Di Lin barged in and interrupted the meeting.

142
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,610
That was exactly what Lord Chieftain wanted.

143
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,550
Now Bunong is dead.

144
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,820
We don't have a right leader for the time being.

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,880
But I have to at least prove

146
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,170
that Yuanzhou can no longer be controlled by the family.

147
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,450
You're right, Advisor Xiao.

148
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,950
We can't just give up.

149
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,200
We lost face at Three Central Offices today.

150
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,760
Advisor Ma Wei, what are your thoughts?

151
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,380
The people.

152
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,470
Di Lin didn't listen to reason.

153
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,610
He killed everyone in Lord Luo Minghai's family

154
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,980
and got away with that.

155
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,230
He doesn't care about the people.

156
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,240
He doesn't, but someone does.

157
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,600
Palace Guards and Si Yilin.

158
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,830
Right. The people will get furious

159
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,470
if they know that Si Yilin, commander-in-chief of Palace Guards,

160
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,650
is out of the control of the family and is a warlike man,

161
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,950
and that it's because of him that the family and people

162
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,990
of tribes in Yuanzhou are suffering.

163
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,600
Lord Chieftain.

164
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,550
Fang Jing is now leading the Black Banner Army and defending Moon Bay.

165
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,480
Ming Hui is leading Border Appeasement Army and guarding the Yuntai Grand Road.

166
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,470
There is lots of good news from Palace Guards.

167
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,350
They all fought many battles

168
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,980
so they requested to be given more provisions.

169
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,180
Now is the perfect time

170
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,910
to continue to suppress the rebellion.

171
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,950
If the provisions for the army can't be supplied in time,

172
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,950
the soldiers will be disappointed.

173
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,840
It's good of you to empathize the soldiers on the front line.

174
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,370
I'll let you handle the matter

175
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,840
concerning the supply of provisions for the army.

176
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,320
Yes.

177
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,390
My Lord, Princess Ning is back.

178
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,390
Li Qing.

179
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,650
Your Highness.

180
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,580
How angry is my uncle now?

181
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,270
Is he going to punish me according to the family rules

182
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,580
or to get me grounded?

183
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,130
Your Highness, don't worry.

184
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,490
Lord Chieftain always loves you.

185
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,680
He won't punish you.

186
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,090
He will.

187
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,720
Her Highness has returned safely.

188
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,680
Lord Si Yilin, you went through bloody battles

189
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,820
and took a long trip. You must be tired.

190
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,150
It's okay. It is my honor to work for the family.

191
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,270
My Lord.

192
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,150
The weather is quite changeable in Imperial Capital. Please take care of yourself.

193
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,480
Thank you, Lord Li Qing.

194
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,910
Have some.

195
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,500
I've prepared so much food you like for you.

196
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,550
I think I should be blamed

197
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,590
for your leaving this time.

198
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,270
I made you study at home

199
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,350
and learn to have good manners all day.

200
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,410
You must have suffered burnout for doing those things.

201
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,830
I've read all the books

202
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,470
that I asked you to read

203
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,930
and I found that all of them, especially those histories,

204
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,600
were really boring.

205
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,360
An old man like me

206
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,430
felt sleepy when reading them,

207
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,160
let alone young girls like you.

208
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,860
Then I came up with the idea

209
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,300
to draw pictures

210
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,760
according to the content of the books.

211
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,870
It is more interesting to learn about history from those pictures.

212
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,670
Wait a moment.

213
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,470
Let me show them to you.

214
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,780
Look.

215
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,490
This is The Annals of the History of the Zichuan Family.

216
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,830
Look at this picture I drew. Who is it?

217
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,910
This is your great-grandfather.

218
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,550
Look.

219
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,290
There was a mole on the corner of his mouth.

220
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,610
Does this image look like him?

221
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,910
Here.

222
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,830
You won't feel bored

223
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,830
when you're looking at these pictures.

224
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,660
Besides,

225
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,850
I want to find you a teacher

226
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,840
who is good at martial arts.

227
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,730
I want you to learn some martial arts.

228
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,690
Don't stay in your room all day.

229
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,910
You'll get sick if you stay in your room for too long.

230
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,910
And if you really want to leave home in the future,

231
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,230
you can protect yourself if you know how to perform martial arts.

232
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,910
I was so worried

233
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,010
after you left home this time.

234
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,630
What should I do

235
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,960
if an accident had happened to you or you had met bad guys?

236
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,710
And about Xiu...

237
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,790
I was too emotional that day.

238
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,530
I've always treated you

239
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,160
as my real daughter.

240
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,490
If you get married,

241
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,290
I'll miss you very much.

242
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,160
I always hope

243
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,070
you'll marry a good man.

244
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,320
Ning, please understand me.

245
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,540
Look.

246
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,750
There're so many the books, documents,

247
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,400
and so much paperwork.

248
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,510
I'm responsible for managing Zichuan.

249
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,790
I'm extremely busy.

250
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,390
Uncle, I'm sorry.

251
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,160
I won't be willful anymore.

252
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,420
Let's stop talking about this.

253
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,060
Let's stop talking about this.

254
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,740
Come on, help yourself.

255
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,910
Let's eat together.

256
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,750
What did you see in Yuanzhou this time

257
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,830
when you were there?

258
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,170
I haven't been there for a long time.

259
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,250
What's going on there?

260
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,830
Uncle.

261
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,420
During my trip in Yuanzhou,

262
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,080
I saw how difficult life was for people there.

263
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,140
Some families couldn't afford food.

264
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,480
Zhui was killed and eaten by people there.

265
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,410
Those refugees ate your horse?

266
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,870
So Uncle,

267
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,490
we must find a way

268
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,960
to lift the people in Yuanzhou out of poverty.

269
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,020
We should get them to have enough food at least.

270
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,990
So this trip

271
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,349
has made you more mature.

272
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,300
You now care more about the development of the country.

273
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,310
You're becoming more and more like a family heiress.

274
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,869
If you want,

275
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,500
you can learn more about state affairs, okay?

276
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,790
Sure, I want to do that.

277
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,750
Okay.

278
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,000
And about Si Yilin...

279
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,640
What happened to Si Yilin?

280
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,099
Si Yilin fought hard against the enemies on the front line.

281
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,680
Palace Guards tried their best to protect the country.

282
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,110
And there have been many casualties and wounded people.

283
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,470
Though their provisions were not sufficient,

284
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,950
they gave some of them to many people they met on their way.

285
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,240
I really don't understand

286
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,270
why there is a rumor in the city

287
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,810
that Si Yilin is disloyal and warlike.

288
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,630
When we entered the city,

289
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,700
he was humiliated.

290
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,550
I think there must be some misunderstanding.

291
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,150
Uncle, is there anything you can do

292
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,330
to dispel the rumors

293
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,870
and restore his reputation?

294
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,670
I'll think about how to help him.

295
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,560
It'll take some time.

296
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,270
Ka Dan.

297
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,190
Ning.

298
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,330
You're back.

299
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
How was your trip?

300
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,590
It was full of surprises.

301
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,900
Anyway,

302
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,230
I was in danger but got safe eventually.

303
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,680
I have good news for you.

304
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,810
Si Yilin took me back this time.

305
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,270
He is in Imperial Capital now.

306
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,060
Is he okay?

307
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,840
He seems thinner than before.

308
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,040
Recently, in Imperial Capital, there has been a rumor that Mr. Si is a warlike man

309
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,310
who is the culprit for the excessive consumption of the family's wealth.

310
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,510
I wonder if he has been bothered by that.

311
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,150
Ka Dan, calm down.

312
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,310
My uncle has promised

313
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,570
to help Si Yilin restore his reputation.

314
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,420
Don't be too worried.

315
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,950
If you still can't rest assured,

316
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,150
I can get you to meet Si Yilin.

317
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,970
More and more people have heard the rumors about Mr. Si.

318
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,790
Even I, a princess from your enemy state,

319
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,870
has heard about it.

320
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,400
He must be in a very difficult situation.

321
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,860
If he and I meet, it'll do no good to him.

322
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,300
But if you can't see him in person,

323
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,380
how will you rest assured?

324
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,230
Whether I go see him or not won't make much difference.

325
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,130
I'm not able to help him. I'll only get him into trouble.

326
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,290
Ning, thank you.

327
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,990
Ka Dan, I've never regretted

328
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,760
embarking on the trip to Yuanzhou.

329
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,400
If I had chosen to continue

330
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,060
to stay in the mansion and mope

331
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,140
instead of leaving the capital that day,

332
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,620
I would regret it.

333
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,050
I admire you for your personality

334
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,910
and for being so brave to love him.

335
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,830
Life is unpredictable. Grasp every chance for you two to see each other.

336
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,490
My Lord, is everything okay?

337
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,840
I'm fine. You may leave.

338
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,850
Princess... Hello, Princess Ka Dan.

339
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,460
What brings you here?

340
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,090
Did Princess Ning take you here?

341
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,720
Princess Ning is waiting for me in the yard.

342
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,520
I can't stay here for too long.

343
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,750
Did Lord Chieftain give you a hard time

344
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,750
after Princess Ning went to Yuanzhou without permission?

345
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,030
Everyone in the Zichuan family has been very nice to me.

346
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,560
They're very kind to me. You can rest assured.

347
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,450
Both you and Princess Ning

348
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,030
are princesses

349
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,910
but with different personalities.

350
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,440
However, both of you can be really impulsive.

351
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,710
Ning's love for Zichuan Xiu is so pure and deep.

352
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,950
I can empathize with her.

353
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,480
I shouldn't have come,

354
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,780
but I wanted to see you so badly.

355
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,140
Just ignore all the terrible rumors in the city.

356
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,360
You just need to follow your heart and you'll get through the difficulties.

357
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,790
I trust you.

358
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,650
I'm done. I should go.

359
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,040
I brought you a gift from Yuanzhou.

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,760
Wait a moment. Let me fetch it.

361
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,240
Ka Dan, I hope this letter finds you well.

362
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,250
The battlefield is very dangerous.

363
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,000
I almost got killed several times.

364
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,620
But every time I thought of your smile,

365
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,870
I felt the courage to keep fighting.

366
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,920
I will take good care of myself.

367
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,670
[With you]

368
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,030
Ning played truant a lot.

369
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,080
Zichuan Xiu fooled around a lot.

370
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,370
I thought you were the most

371
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,320
obedient and honest child of them.

372
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,490
I didn't expect that you were just too shy

373
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,910
to tell others your feelings in person.

374
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,310
This...

375
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,420
Only this one?

376
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,850
The rest were thrown into the river.

377
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,380
Mr. Si.

378
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,020
When you were in Yuanzhou,

379
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,840
I also wrote many letters to you.

380
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,250
Ka Dan, these days...

381
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,540
I know. I felt the same.

382
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,150
Ka Dan.

383
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,220
We should go now.

384
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,420
I should go now.

385
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,940
Ka Dan.

386
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,560
Today, I summoned you here suddenly

387
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,670
because I have two announcements to make.

388
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,730
The first thing

389
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,390
is about the war against the rebels.

390
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,520
My ministers.

391
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,670
What do you think of General Si Yilin's performances

392
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,550
during the war against the rebels this time?

393
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,150
My Lord, Si Yilin and Palace Guards

394
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,540
were very brave during the war against the rebels

395
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,890
and they successfully suppressed the rebels

396
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,970
and preserved the dignity of the family.

397
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,230
I'm telling the truth.

398
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,330
I think you all agree with me, right?

399
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,870
Lord Si Yilin was indeed brave and heroic in the war.

400
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,890
But we also suffered great losses during the war.

401
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,510
Corpses were everywhere, our soldiers were in low morale and our people also complained a lot.

402
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,140
Lord Si Yilin should be blamed for those things.

403
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,710
How can a general who has lost the support of the people

404
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,150
continue to be a general?

405
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,270
General Si Yilin didn't stop fighting when he and his soldiers should have retreated.

406
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,580
He also repeatedly disobeyed the orders.

407
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,460
As a result, many good opportunities on the battlefield were missed

408
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,920
and many soldiers died partly because of it.

409
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,640
Commander-in-chief, what are your thoughts?

410
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,270
My Lord, I think it was extremely difficult to fight the war.

411
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,430
The soldiers faced a shortage of provisions at the front line,

412
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,110
so it's understandable

413
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,290
that they couldn't win the war quickly,

414
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,090
and that they were in low morale.

415
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,430
It was not easy for Lord Si Yilin

416
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,750
to hang in there and win the war eventually.

417
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,150
The soldiers who died

418
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,340
during the war against the rebels were all great heroes.

419
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,010
We should honor all the living and deceased soldiers.

420
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,770
Commander-in-chief is right.

421
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,910
It was extremely difficult to fight the war.

422
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,390
Lord Chieftain, I hope

423
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,260
you'll reward Palace Guards based on their contributions.

424
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,050
I'm glad that you are showing great respect

425
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,800
for soldiers at the front line.

426
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,090
General Si Yilin.

427
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,400
Yes.

428
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,060
Lei Hong, who betrayed the family

429
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,240
and colluded with the rebel forces

430
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,100
to kill my people and soldiers,

431
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,250
deserves to be killed.

432
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,790
Si Yilin, who commanded Palace Guards,

433
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,910
was brave and wise in fighting the war.

434
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,310
They won a great victory.

435
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,670
Therefore, I hereby bestow the title

436
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,950
of Duke of Loyalty and Bravery on Si Yilin

437
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,580
and give him a badge of the Zichuan family.

438
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,550
Si Yilin.

439
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,430
May you be loyal and brave forever

440
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,910
and remember the family's love for you.

441
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,580
Thank you, Lord Chieftain.

442
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,330
I will always remember the family's love for me

443
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,260
and be loyal to the family forever.

444
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,190
Good.

445
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,100
Wait a moment.

446
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,750
Let me make the second announcement.

447
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,650
Si Yilin was away from the city for a long time in order to fight the war.

448
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,270
He dedicated himself to the country

449
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,180
and had no time to mind his personal business.

450
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,050
As the chieftain of the family,

451
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,840
I'd like to find General Si Yilin a fiancée.

452
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,050
General Li Qing is about his age.

453
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,060
They have similar personalities.

454
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,020
As the chieftain of the family,

455
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,540
I'll let them get engaged today.

456
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,110
On their wedding day,

457
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,190
I'll be the host for their wedding ceremony

458
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,720
on behalf of their parents.

459
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,640
Qing.

460
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,410
Thank you so much, Lord Chieftain.

461
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,180
But the country is still in trouble and the rebels haven't been completely defeated.

462
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,410
I have no time to make any plans for my personal business.

463
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,480
I know

464
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,900
you two will continue to fight for the country

465
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,600
and at the same time make a good couple.

466
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,910
What's wrong?

467
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,790
Are you going to refuse to be engaged to Qing

468
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,460
right now?

469
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,210
My Lord.

470
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,220
Si Yilin is too excited to say anything.

471
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,300
Really?

472
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,350
Come on, Qing.

473
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,060
Please get up.

474
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,430
Come on.

475
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,030
Let's send congratulations to General Si Yilin and General Li Qing.

476
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,270
They'll make a good couple.

477
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,550
Congratulations.

478
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,690
Lord Chieftain

479
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,990
bestowed the title of duke on Si Yilin and gave him the family badge.

480
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,590
What an honor for him.

481
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,340
Why are you pulling a long face?

482
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,610
Ka Dan, are you out of your mind?

483
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,650
Are you lying to yourself or to me?

484
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,860
My uncle let Li Qing and Si Yilin get engaged.

485
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,990
How can you just sit here and do nothing?

486
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,330
Lord Chieftain is a visionary leader.

487
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,590
He really thinks highly of Mr. Si.

488
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,350
What he did can not only restore Mr. Si's reputation

489
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,150
but also ensure his important position in the family.

490
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,660
Si Yilin now has a fiancée.

491
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,060
What should you and he do?

492
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,130
I'm a princess of the North Clan.

493
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,040
He's an official loyal to the Zichuan family.

494
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,440
If others find out about our relationship,

495
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,430
they will laugh at us.

496
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,670
If he and Li Qing really get married,

497
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,110
aren't you afraid you'll live with regret for the rest of your life?

498
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,310
I'd rather live with regret for the rest of my life

499
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,110
than do harm to his future career

500
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,940
or get his life in danger.

501
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,460
You've been promoted and the chieftain has got you a fiancée.

502
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,520
Congratulations.

503
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,990
You should invite me to drink and celebrate in your mansion.

504
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,480
Why are you drinking with me

505
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,340
at my place now?

506
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,260
There's nothing to celebrate.

507
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,750
I'll leave after drinking this.

508
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,420
Where are you going?

509
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,830
I'm going back to Yuanzhou to continue to fight the war.

510
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,030
Let me die on the battlefield.

511
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,790
Stop.

512
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,750
I know you so well.

513
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,360
You've never been willful before.

514
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,250
Ever since I put on this military uniform,

515
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,630
my life has been dedicated to the family.

516
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,750
To win glories on the battlefield was everything.

517
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,280
Loyalty was everything.

518
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,460
In the end, I got nothing.

519
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,660
I only got engaged to a woman that I don't love.

520
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,680
Li Qing's parents are officials loyal to the family.

521
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,970
She is a noble

522
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,350
who holds an important position in the government.

523
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,650
Lord Chieftain trusts her a lot.

524
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,580
You're just a general who used to be a commoner.

525
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,750
How come you don't want to marry her?

526
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,610
Let me tell you.

527
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,430
She is your best choice.

528
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,580
I was really afraid that you would refuse to get engaged to her in front of Lord Chieftain.

529
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,830
Fortunately, you weren't that impulsive.

530
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,550
He asked me and her to get engaged when there were so many officials present.

531
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,210
He, being the chieftain, imposed his will on me.

532
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,740
That was so awkward.

533
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,470
For most of the time, you stayed in the army.

534
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,070
You've seen very few women.

535
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,240
How do you know that you and Li Qing won't be a good match?

536
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,890
You'll gradually be in love with each other.

537
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,480
Anyway, I won't betray my beloved girl.

538
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,640
Think about it clearly.

539
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,220
Ka Dan is a princess of the North Clan.

540
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,670
It's unacceptable if you and she choose to be together.

541
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,870
And let me remind you.

542
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,990
The war in Yuanzhou is still not over.

543
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,330
I know. Don't worry.

544
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,220
I know what my mission is and I won't

545
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,550
waste my time on dating.

546
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,870
Fang Jing's army is at Moon Bay now.

547
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,340
Ming Hui's Army has moved to Payi.

548
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:16,540
Payi City is the gateway to Yuanzhou from the North Clan.

549
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,889
If we advance there, we can attack the enemies. If we retreat, we can defend ourselves.

550
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,639
My Palace Guards are ready to fight the war at any time.

551
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,750
You can rest assured.

552
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,710
I can't.

553
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,480
We are now in a situation

554
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,469
where the war between us and the North Clan will be inevitable.

555
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,699
What the rebel forces led by Lei Hong will do

556
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,219
will always be unpredictable.

557
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,260
We can't afford to let any accidents

558
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,639
happen to the important places of Payi City and Moon Bay.

559
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,540
My Lord, let's retreat.

560
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,010
As long as we're alive, we'll be able to take revenge in the future.

561
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,070
Leave now, Ming Ke.

562
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,360
When you're back, tell my two daughters

563
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,080
that their father is a coward

564
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,330
but he never does anything

565
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,130
that will get himself a bad name.

566
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,790
Life and death are nothing.

567
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,470
Go back to Moon Bay! Watch out!

568
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,150
Yes.

569
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,860
You rebels!

570
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,980
As long as I'm alive,

571
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,030
I won't let you enter Moon Bay.

572
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,740
Shoot!

573
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,520
Kill all the people at Moon Bay in one day.

574
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,800
My Lord, we've lost control of Moon Bay.

575
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,170
Fang Jing, commander of Black Banner Army, died in battle.

576
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,290
Before he died, he said...

577
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,620
I know what he would say.

578
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,550
Life and death are nothing.

579
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,630
Before he died,

580
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,630
he was still regretting ever following Yang Minghua.

581
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,750
My Lord.

582
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,060
News from our spy.

583
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,110
Lei Hong has joined the North Clan with the rebel forces in Yuanzhou.

584
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,830
He has completely betrayed Zichuan.

585
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,760
Now the army of the North Clan

586
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,110
colluded with the rebels led by Lei Hong to attack our forces.

587
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,630
The commander of the Black Banner Army, Fang Jing,

588
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,290
led his soldiers and tried their best to resist,

589
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,060
but they were all killed.

590
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,550
Keep

591
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,710
the news secret.

592
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,690
Don't get the people to panic.

593
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,260
Understood.

594
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,680
You may leave.

595
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,060
Report it to me if anything happens.

596
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:19,990
Yes.

597
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,370
You...

598
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
Go comfort Fang Jing's family members

599
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,590
and the family members of the soldiers of the Black Banner Army.

600
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,190
They have suffered a lot.

601
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,190
Please rest assured.

602
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,510
My Lord, you should make preparations in advance.

603
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,040
Send Si Yilin back to the front line right now.

604
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,700
I think

605
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,560
though Si Yilin and Di Lin are as close as brothers,

606
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,790
their personalities are very different.

607
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,630
Si Yilin is loyal and upright.

608
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,680
He's always loyal to the family

609
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,000
and he knows a lot about military strategies.

610
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,240
He provides the strongest support

611
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,730
for the army of the family.

612
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,630
You treat Si Yilin well

613
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,520
and got him promoted for several times.

614
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,560
He must be grateful to you.

615
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,820
Fang Jin has been killed by the North Clan.

616
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,830
The army of the North Clan has broken our defenses.

617
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,550
If the rebel forces in Yuanzhou take the chance to fight against us again,

618
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,990
Ming Hui and his army will have to fight back against them alone on the front line.

619
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,250
It'll be very difficult for them to do it.

620
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,680
Lord Chieftain, Si Yilin wants to see you.

621
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,270
Leave from the north door.

622
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:44,750
Yes.

623
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,280
Greetings, Lord Chieftain.

624
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,950
Si Yilin, thank you.

625
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,710
What a coincidence.

626
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,960
I was about to ask you to come.

627
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,470
Here.

628
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,190
Thank you.

629
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,630
Something happened in the war in Yuanzhou.

630
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,330
Lei Hong surrendered to the North Clan.

631
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,580
What?

632
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,370
The army of the North Clan

633
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,310
and Lei Hong's rebel forces

634
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,710
are attacking Yuanzhou.

635
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,030
So,

636
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,100
you must return to Yuanzhou as soon as possible

637
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,280
and help General Ming Hui.

638
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,470
You need to help him strengthen the defense.

639
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,780
Yes, I will go.

640
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,170
Please sit down.

641
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,150
Si Yilin.

642
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,450
You are the person I trust the most.

643
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,660
I think highly of you.

644
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,970
Actually,

645
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,940
I planned to send you back

646
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,900
after you and Qing hold your wedding.

647
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,560
But this is an emergency task.

648
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,760
I'm sorry you'll have to postpone the wedding.

649
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,790
Cheers.

650
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,320
What brings you here today?

651
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:51,270
Lord Chieftain, I appreciate your effort to find me a fiancée.

652
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,600
But please let me call off the engagement.

653
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,690
Why? You don't like Qing?

654
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,720
I dare not.

655
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,660
Lord Li Qing's

656
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,720
words, deeds, and virtues

657
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,390
are better than mine.

658
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,670
But I am just a serviceman.

659
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,820
I don't deserve a wife as good as her.

660
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,620
Are you in love with someone else?

661
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,030
I'm right.

662
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,450
Since you are in love with someone else,

663
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,390
you should have told me earlier.

664
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,220
If so, I wouldn't have found a fiancée for you.

665
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,740
Looks like I was an unwelcome matchmaker.

666
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,790
Who is the girl you're in love with?

667
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:31,980
Ka Dan.

668
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,550
Ka...

669
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,510
Which Ka Dan?

670
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,870
Is it the Ka Dan from the North Clan?

671
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,380
Yes.
