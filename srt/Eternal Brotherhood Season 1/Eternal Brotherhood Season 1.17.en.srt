[Episode 17]

4
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,070
I'd like to ask you a question, my lords.

5
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,370
Just now, which of you said that all the soldiers of our Xiu Battalion

6
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,630
were ruffians and rascals?

7
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,530
It was me. What's wrong?

8
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Nothing special.

9
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,329
Buddies, kneel!

10
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,960
Cry now!

11
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,450
Buddy!

12
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,360
You are so pitiful.

13
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,990
Stop!

14
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,310
I asked these two men to come here to get military provisions.

15
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,950
But why did you hit him and make him get injured so seriously?

16
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,280
Do you know who he is?

17
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,500
He's the most famous hero of our Xiu Battalion,

18
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,860
and the mainstay of the entire army.

19
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,550
You injured him so badly.

20
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,960
You've ruined the morale of our battalion.

21
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,060
Can you bear the consequence if the troops at the front line lose the battle?

22
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,260
What do you guys want?

23
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,840
Ming Yu.

24
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,250
Calculate

25
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,980
the compensation fee,

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,670
the cost for loss of working time,

27
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,730
and the mental damage compensation.

28
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,730
How much is it?

29
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,000
3,000 dan.

30
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,430
5,000 dan of military provisions in total.

31
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,670
Give them to me now.

32
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,350
No matter how we calculate it, it's not right.

33
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,390
Why do you think it's not right?

34
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,690
This is the compensation fee for our entire Xiu Battalion.

35
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,670
Yes! That's right!

36
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,310
Yes!

37
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,150
We can't make a decision on this.

38
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,520
If you can't decide,

39
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,350
ask your executive to come out.

40
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,190
Go now!

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,750
Buddies, take the provisions away!

42
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,280
Leave me alone. Take them away!

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,780
Though a gentleman loves food, he should take the food in a reasonable way.

44
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,890
Guys, move them here in an orderly manner.

45
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,220
Come on.

46
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,520
Come on. Lift them up and put them down gently.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,400
Hurry up.

48
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,270
Alright. Next one.

49
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,750
Put it here.

50
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,150
Okay.

51
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,810
Put it here.

52
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,650
Next one.

53
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,820
Write it down at once.

54
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,070
Put it here.

55
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,990
This one.

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,940
Everyone, do it in an orderly manner.

57
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,800
Don't scramble for them. There are enough provisions for everyone.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,730
Stop!

59
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,600
All of you, stop at once!

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,510
Stop at once!

61
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,010
I'm the highest-ranking officer of the Logistics Ministry in Kaige City.

62
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,110
How dare you rob the provisions granary

63
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,680
so openly in broad daylight?

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,310
I'm going to report it to Lord Chieftain.

65
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,190
I've already calculated the compensation fee with your subordinates.

66
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,720
Go back to report it at once.

67
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,210
None of us will stop you.

68
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,630
You're Zichuan Xiu, right?

69
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,630
In our army, your Xiu Battalion

70
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,850
is well known as a gang of ruffians.

71
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,470
As I saw you today, I didn't expect that

72
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,700
Lord Di Lin and Lord Si Yilin

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,480
would have such barbarous buddies like you guys.

74
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,890
Since you have mentioned my brother, Si Yilin,

75
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,000
coincidentally, the situation of the battle at the front line is so tense.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,070
The Palace Guards led by General Si Yilin

77
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,490
are short of military supplies.

78
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,330
But in your account book, I found that

79
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,750
some of the military supplies were deducted every month.

80
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,230
I want to ask you

81
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,460
where these missing military supplies

82
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,790
were taken to?

83
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,180
This is normal wastage.

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
What was the quantity every month?

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,420
1,000 dan.

86
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,970
That's quite normal, isn't it?

87
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,180
Maocai, I'll leave it to you.

88
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,980
Our buddies at the front line shed blood and sacrificed their lives.

89
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,380
They can't even get full.

90
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,890
It's all due to the corrupt officials like you who embezzled the funds.

91
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,390
You are just an insignificant soldier.

92
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,910
How dare you be so rude to me?

93
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,110
I'm a captain!

94
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,990
Even though you're a captain, so what? I'll just hit you!

95
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,870
Hit him! Hit him!

96
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,940
Hit him! Hit him!

97
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,940
I...

98
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,540
Do you still want to stay in the army?

99
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,710
How dare you hit the executive of the Logistics Ministry?

100
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,810
I saw you eating the food we had collected yesterday,

101
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,270
and you enjoyed eating it so much, didn't you?

102
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,730
Besides, the minister of the Logistics Ministry is a forgiving man.

103
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,260
Not only did he not blame us,

104
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,720
but he also gave us 50% more provisions.

105
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,630
The minister of the Logistics Ministry

106
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,040
is such a good captain who understands the important principle thoroughly.

107
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,850
What if he reports this incident to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs?

108
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,820
Can you explain it clearly?

109
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,620
I'm quite close to their leader.

110
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,070
Di Lin.

111
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,040
Boss.

112
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,420
The provisions are ready.

113
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,030
Luo Jie is already leading our buddies to distribute them in an orderly manner.

114
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,590
Okay.

115
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,070
Distributing them? To whom?

116
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,050
Aren't you quite brave and good at fighting?

117
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,180
That bloody Lei Hong!

118
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,750
Because of him, the people in Yuanzhou are living in poverty, and many people have starved to death.

119
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,050
Though this Kaige City

120
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,110
looks glamorous,

121
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,350
in fact,

122
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,530
no one is willing to donate even a bowl of congee.

123
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,820
If we had not helped them,

124
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,170
half of them here would starve to death.

125
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,590
It's just a small favor.

126
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,860
At least, we can guarantee that they won't starve to death.

127
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,659
It's worth it.

128
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,880
We've given out all the food we got.

129
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,470
What about the soldiers of the Xiu Battalion?

130
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,670
Don't worry.

131
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,560
I'll think of a way to solve the problem at one stroke

132
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,420
to make sure that our buddies can eat and drink well.

133
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,650
Ming Yu.

134
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,950
After they finish giving out the congee,

135
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,140
ask our buddies to dismiss and do their own activities freely.

136
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,990
As long as they assemble in advance tomorrow morning, it'll be fine.

137
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,030
It's war time now.

138
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:14,990
There are so many soldiers.

139
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,030
How can we let them stay outside all night without coming back to the barracks?

140
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,690
It has been a long journey, and they are so tired.

141
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,610
Ming Yu, do as I said.

142
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,670
Okay.

143
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,900
Next one.

144
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,400
Don't you know these guys well?

145
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,870
If we still don't let them have some leisure time,

146
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,550
they might rebel soon.

147
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,880
Understand?

148
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,420
Thank you.

149
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,670
Sir.

150
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,750
Vegetables and fruits!

151
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,380
Come and have a look.

152
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,710
Vegetables and fruits!

153
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,490
It's quite fresh. Have a look, please.

154
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,800
Okay.

155
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,730
Please take it.

156
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,240
It's quite fresh. Have a look, please.

157
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,610
Please take it.

158
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,310
Okay.

159
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,030
Young man...

160
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,230
Give one of these to me.

161
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,350
Okay.

162
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,790
Please.

163
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,510
It's fresh.

164
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,150
This is really not expensive.

165
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,280
Just buy a straw hat.

166
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,070
Come on.

167
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,450
Come on. Cheers.

168
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,620
Come on.

169
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:39,840
Miss.

170
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,179
Sir.

171
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,070
Do you want to eat here or live here?

172
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,130
I want to live here.

173
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,610
There are really no rooms today.

175
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,110
Sir, please help me.

176
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,450
I've traveled a long way here and I'm so tired.

177
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,950
I just want to take a good rest.

178
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,620
There are no rooms.

179
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,270
Why are you staring at her without even blinking?

180
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,790
Sir.

181
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,880
-Please help me.
-Women from the city are so different.

182
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,670
She's quite attractive.

183
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,250
We should thank Lord Xiu.

184
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,350
As a soldier, I didn't expect that I could come out to relax.

185
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,630
He's really so considerate towards us.

186
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,160
He just wants to go out to have fun personally.

187
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,920
If a leader sets a bad example, it will be followed by his subordinates indeed.

188
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,670
For us, it's called, "If the leader has fun,

189
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,800
his subordinates will be happy, too."

190
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,940
Come on. Let's eat.

191
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,760
There are really no rooms.

192
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,970
Miss, I'll spare a room for you.

193
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,420
There's a big bathroom,

194
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,030
which can help to relieve your fatigue and relax your mind.

195
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,320
But it's a bit expensive.

196
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,300
It's okay. Give it to me.

197
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,870
It's a bit expensive.

198
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,350
Are these coins enough?

199
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,080
Yes.

200
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,240
Please come inside.

201
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,190
-Please. -This way.

202
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,680
There's the Emperor Casino near the east gate.

203
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,930
The Chunfeng Garden is at the south gate.

204
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,830
There's the Zuixian Restaurant in the west.

205
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,910
It is said that after drinking just a cup of wine there, people will get drunk

206
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,150
and feel high.

207
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,140
Will people get drunk

208
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,050
or feel so high as if they were flying away?

209
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,210
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,550
I didn't notice that someone was here.

211
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,320
Be careful.

212
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,670
You overturned my buddy's wine, and you only said sorry?

213
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,690
Your friend overturned it himself.

214
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,950
Why are you blaming me?

215
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,350
You all saw it, right?

216
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,790
Did you all see it?

217
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,270
Yes.

218
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,970
That cup of wine wasn't expensive. It was worth a hundred silk coins.

219
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,490
As long as you compensate us for it, everything will be fine.

220
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,490
There will be no problem.

221
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,270
As idiots, you even want to bully me like ruffians, huh?

222
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,000
When I was a ruffian, your hair hadn't fully grown yet.

223
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,110
That's right. Didn't you see my token?

224
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,630
We're the elite soldiers of the Zichuan Family.

225
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,230
We're real old ruffians.

226
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,680
The Zichuan Family.

227
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,890
Do you know who I am?

228
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,380
Come in.

229
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,510
There are some ruffians making trouble downstairs.

230
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,170
Don't go downstairs tonight.

231
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,630
Waiter.

232
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,820
Thanks for your hard work.

233
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,360
Thank you, Miss.

234
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,310
There's still some extra money after you paid today's rent.

235
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,190
I can't take the rent from you anymore.

236
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,920
Just take it.

237
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,620
I have something to ask you.

238
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,570
Go ahead.

239
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,620
Has any army been stationed in Kaige City recently?

240
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,830
There are many armies in our place.

241
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,220
I wonder which one you're asking about.

242
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,280
The Xiu Battalion.

243
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,880
The Xiu Battalion. Have they just arrived here recently?

244
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,140
I hardly heard of them.

245
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,750
Why are you looking for them?

246
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
I'm here to look for a friend of mine.

247
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't worry.

248
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,510
I'll ask around for you tomorrow morning.

249
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,740
Thank you so much.

250
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,110
Maocai, you're so unreliable.

251
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,980
Why didn't you bring anything when we were out to have fun?

252
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,230
As you said, we were out to have fun.

253
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,670
I didn't know this would happen.

254
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,830
But you shouldn't have taken some fireworks with you

255
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,900
to fool others.

256
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,310
I also don't know where the fireworks came from.

257
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,710
It seems that Lord Baichuan gave them to me.

258
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,260
But why didn't she give them to me?

259
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,760
What's your relationship with her?

260
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,020
These three poor people only brought five silver coins when they went out.

261
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,080
You even dared to come out to have a drink?

262
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,960
Throw them into the river behind the pub.

263
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
Wait.

264
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,630
We can ask someone to ransom us.

265
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,600
Okay. Chop off his fingers.

266
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,800
Send someone to collect the money.

267
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,570
Shaozi, don't push me.

268
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,600
Maocai, just make a sacrifice.

269
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,990
Boss.

270
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,340
Were you the ones who shot the White Light Arrows?

271
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,190
The White Light Arrows?

272
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,040
When the white light flashes, your buddy will come to see you.

273
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,170
Baichuan said it in class.

274
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,630
What were you doing at that time?

275
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,550
It has an effect like that?

276
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,190
You guys just had a drink.

277
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,610
Why did you have to make such a big fuss?

278
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,650
Yes.

279
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,270
Boss, it feels so good to be a soldier.

280
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,740
It feels so cool to be a member of an organization.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,540
By the way, ask Luo Jie to calculate the appearance fee.

282
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,570
It'll be deducted from your military pay for next year.

283
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,410
Boss, you're so greedy.

284
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:36,900
I...

285
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,720
In terms of the appearance fee,

286
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,370
my master was much greedier than me back then.

287
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,570
Ning was ususally very energetic.

288
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,430
Why did she suddenly catch a cold?

289
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,310
Maybe the weather has changed a lot lately.

290
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,810
Don't worry, Madam.

291
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,420
Her Highness is getting better.

292
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,350
This Purple Perilla and Notopterygium Tea can't be placed there for a long time.

293
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,640
I'll take it to Ning later.

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,430
Madam, I'll take it to her later.

295
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,350
The doctor has said that this flu is quite infectious.

296
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,150
Her Highness is worried that she might infect you.

297
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,070
This yard has been decorated and managed well.

298
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,070
Lord Chieftain.

299
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,600
-Lord Chieftain.
-Xiujia, you're also here.

300
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,820
Look. As for Ning,

301
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,830
I often ask her to study the political affairs of our clan.

302
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,430
She always refuses to make an effort.

303
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,150
But she never slacks off

304
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,220
while looking after these plants.

305
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,460
How is Ning? Is she feeling better today?

306
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,910
Yes, Her Highness has seen the doctor.

307
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,720
She's resting in her room now after taking the medicine.

308
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,470
Okay.

309
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,560
I'll go take a look.

310
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,510
My Lord.

311
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,720
The doctor has said that this flu is quite infectious.

312
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
It's infectious?

313
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,950
Why didn't you tell me

314
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,630
such an important thing?

315
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,630
Go away.

316
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,290
My Lord.

317
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,100
Go away!

318
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:21,910
My Lord.

319
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,880
Walk gently.

320
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,750
Yes.

321
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,470
This room is too stuffy.

322
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,650
We should open the windows for some fresh air.

323
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,700
Yes.

324
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,630
Ning.

325
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,490
Lord Chieftain, Her Highness...

326
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,280
Can't you talk in a low voice?

327
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,740
Is this how you take care of Ning?

328
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,150
If you want to tell me something, just say it now.

329
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,630
Her Highness had a fever for the whole night yesterday.

330
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,550
She just got better this morning.

331
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,900
She must be sleeping soundly now.

332
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,710
She had a fever all night last night?

333
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,579
Yes.

334
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,380
My Lord!

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,730
My Lord!

336
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,270
Is this Ning? Tell me!

337
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,100
My Lord, please spare my life!

338
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,470
Get out!

339
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,650
My Lord, please spare my life!

340
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,070
What's going on?

341
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,630
How dare you! Where is Ning?

342
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,640
Tell me now!

343
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,090
Lord Chieftain, Her Highness always likes to have fun.

344
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,860
She has been sick for so long.

345
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,840
She could finally get out of bed.

346
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,880
Maybe she has sneaked out to have fun somewhere.

347
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,740
Don't be angry.

348
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,600
I think she'll come back soon.

349
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,430
Ning, look. I found this sachet.

350
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,270
Princess Ka Dan.

351
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,800
Lord Chieftain.

352
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
Please wait a moment.

353
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,770
Why are you here, Princess Ka Dan?

354
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,030
A few days ago,

355
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,730
Ning left this lucky sachet in my room.

356
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,040
She thought it was lost,

357
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,080
so I specially brought it here to return it to her.

358
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,830
Returning this sachet to her is something very simple.

359
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,020
Why did you run?

360
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,350
This lucky sachet

361
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,740
was acquired by Ning through praying in Mount Xiang

362
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,480
for the sake of Lord Xiu.

363
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,890
Ning went to Mount Xiang?

364
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,070
Yes, Her Highness couldn't find the sachet a few days ago.

365
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,670
She was quite anxious.

366
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,820
Therefore, as she got better today,

367
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,480
she went to Mount Xiang alone.

368
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,670
She wanted to get another one for Lord Xiu through praying.

369
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,710
She was afraid that you might be angry,

370
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,240
so she claimed that she hadn't recovered yet.

371
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,260
Please punish me, My Lord.

372
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,770
Please punish me, My Lord.

373
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,090
I think I should kill

374
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,240
all of you, bitches!

375
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,300
Raise your head. Let me ask you.

376
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,930
So Princess Ning is not sick now?

377
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,470
Did anyone go to Mount Xiang with her?

378
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,540
Yes, a guard went with her.

379
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,310
Lord Chieftain, Ning is stubborn.

380
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,230
She can only be persuaded in a gentle and mild way, instead of being coerced.

381
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,500
If she can have more personal space,

382
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,190
she might have less personal secrets instead.

383
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,340
I'm always too strict when

384
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,600
educating Ning.

385
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,580
Don't tell Princess Ning that

386
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,820
I came here today. Got it?

387
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,560
-Yes. -Yes.

388
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,970
I'm leaving.

389
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,240
You may leave.

390
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,590
Yes.

391
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,660
Is there anything else, Madam?

392
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,790
Though you succeeded in deceiving the chieftain today,

393
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,230
how long can you hide it?

394
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,840
Madam.

395
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,960
Her Highness sneaked out of the eastern city gate a few days ago.

396
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,680
I covered it up for her.

397
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,810
I thought she would come back that day.

398
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,230
Who would have thought it would be delayed till now?

399
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,330
You saw her going out of the city?

400
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,400
The story about the sachet is not true.

401
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,670
Just tell me the truth.

402
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,960
Did Her Highness really go to Yuanzhou?

403
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,610
Yes, I tried to persuade her before she left.

404
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,270
But she had made up her mind.

405
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,660
Madam.

406
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,430
Madam, what's wrong?

407
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,310
Xiujia.

408
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,090
Why am I here?

409
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
You fainted just now.

410
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
I remember it now.

411
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,740
Ning went to Yuanzhou.

412
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,460
Ask some men to chase her now.

413
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,170
Ning?

414
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,770
All the guards in the city know her.

415
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,770
How did she leave?

416
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,570
On the day when we met each other at the city gate,

417
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,000
she pretended to be a clerk of the Jintai Restaurant,

418
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,860
and managed to get out of the city.

419
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,070
I thought she would just go out to have a tour for a few days.

420
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,920
Who would have thought that...

421
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,040
She went to see Xiu?

422
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,220
Well, if Lord Chieftain knows about this,

423
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,390
he will certainly vent his anger on Xiu.

424
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,590
Besides, it's too dangerous for Ning to be in

425
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,790
such a distant place alone.

426
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,850
It was all my fault.

427
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,310
I shouldn't have covered it up for her that day.

428
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,510
It was not your fault.

429
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,960
If you had known about the truth, you wouldn't have helped her.

430
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,020
According to the time when Ning left,

431
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,250
she must have reached the border of Yuanzhou by now.

432
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,830
Don't worry.

433
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,530
I'll ask someone to send a letter to Xiu now.

434
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,470
I'll tell Xiu to find Ning as soon as possible and then send her back.

435
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,680
There is such a long distance between the Imperial Capital and Yuanzhou.

436
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,540
I'm afraid it'll take too much time to send letters.

437
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,070
Xiujia, don't go anywhere these days.

438
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,300
Just stay at home.

439
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,550
I fainted only because I was too agitated.

440
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,630
I'm fine.

441
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,630
You have to listen to me this time.

442
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,710
Just stay at home.

443
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,030
The doctor checked your pulse just now.

444
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,270
You've been pregnant for three months.

445
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,470
Miss, I've asked around for you.

446
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,270
Most of the troops which have arrived in Kaige City in the past few days

447
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,070
will go to the Lunshan Fortress to assemble there.

448
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,930
What about the Xiu Battalion?

449
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,030
They have received the order, too.

450
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,630
According to the order, I think they already departed this morning.

451
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,870
Where is the Lunshan Fortress?

452
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,210
If you are in a hurry,

453
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,310
there is a small path outside the northern city gate.

454
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,310
It leads to the Lunshan Fortress directly.

455
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,590
It's safer during the daytime.

456
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,120
You can arrive in half a day.

457
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,170
Half a day? That's great.

458
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,100
Thank you.

459
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,940
How many times have I told you?

460
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,280
When you come from there,

461
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,680
you should inform me first.

462
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,540
As a man, I also need some privacy.

463
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,300
We've already received the military order that

464
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,870
we should go to the Lunshan Fortress.

465
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,300
Why haven't you made arrangements to set off yet?

466
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,440
What do you think we can get

467
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
if we go there now?

468
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,530
Besides, our purpose of coming to Yuanzhou is to find Lei Hong.

469
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,870
If we go with them,

470
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,270
I don't know when we can find him.

471
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,740
What's going on with those merchants?

472
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,400
What are Shaozi and the others doing?

473
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,310
Shaozi is helping our Xiu Battalion

474
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,410
show our style and features.

475
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,230
Showing our style and features? To those merchants?

476
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,320
If I had not let them check the goods first,

477
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,430
how would they pay the money?

478
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,130
Paying the money? What on earth are you doing?

479
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,290
Baichuan, have a seat.

480
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,720
As you know, I normally have

481
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,760
high requirements  for my quality of life.

482
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,310
As we left the Imperial Capital in such a hurry,

483
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:08,810
I can only borrow provisions

484
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,980
and cotton cloth from those guys.

485
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,690
You owe such a big debt. How are you going to pay the debt in the future?

486
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,090
You're so straightforward. How can you be my deputy general?

487
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,040
We're out here to fight in the war.

488
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,900
We can't stay in Kaige City forever if we're going to fight in the war.

489
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,660
So I...

490
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,600
So I don't need to pay off the debts

491
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,920
to them so hurriedly.

492
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,260
Zichuan Xiu.

493
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,830
After you arrived in Kaige City,

494
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,830
you're always missing all day long.

495
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,270
You even let your subordinates go out to have fun.

496
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,720
And now you're cheating Kaige's merchants here.

497
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,380
What on earth do you want to do?

498
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,140
Baichuan.

499
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,280
How can you call your officer by his name directly?

500
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,910
Boss!

501
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,840
Boss!

502
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,250
We have news about Lei Hong.

503
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,960
Lei Hong?

504
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,510
Where did you get the news?

505
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,870
The sister of the owner of the silk shop told me the news.

506
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,750
Her lover is the cousin of a financial magnate in Kaqi.

507
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,570
Alright! You know a lot of people.

508
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,660
They're all our boss's cooperation partners.

509
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,990
That was what they said.

510
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,240
Did you gather so many merchants here

511
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,760
in order to inquire about Lei Hong's news?

512
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,270
What?

513
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,750
Do I have to report my thoughts to you?

514
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,250
Luo Jie, tell Ming Yu to

515
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,550
gather all those buddies who are

516
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,600
having fun outside.

517
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,730
We have something important to do now.

518
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,190
Yes.

519
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,810
In that case, I've misunderstood you, haven't I?

520
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,480
Getting information is one of my purposes.

521
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,010
If I stay in touch with them, it'll be useful for me in the future.

522
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,720
Is the information you've gathered from these merchants reliable?

523
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,780
Those who can do business in Yuanzhou

524
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,470
are kind of capable.

525
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,900
According to the information, a trade caravan

526
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,100
once saw Lei Hong leading the rebel army

527
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,610
around the Sunset Valley.

528
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,910
That place is easy to defend and hard to invade.

529
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,040
It's also convenient to collect food.

530
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,860
Anyway,

531
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,090
we must go there to take a look.

532
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,030
I'll go help Luo Jie organize the troops at once.

533
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,230
We'll go to the Sunset Valley tomorrow.

534
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,320
Zhui, let's go.

535
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,580
Are you hungry again?

536
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,810
Is this the road that leads to the Lunshan Fortress?

537
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:42,930
Zhui.

538
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,070
Sorry to disturb you, Ma'am. Excuse me.

539
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,710
I got lost in this forest.

540
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,820
Can I have some water?

541
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,830
Miss, this way.

542
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,870
Here you are.

543
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,590
Thank you.

544
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,510
What is this?

545
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,370
This is wild vegetables soup.

546
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,340
In the remote suburbs,

547
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,120
we only have food like this.

548
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,270
Thank you.

549
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,070
Miss,

550
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,560
why did you come to a place like this alone?

551
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,820
There is danger everywhere in Yuanzhou.

552
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,470
It's too dangerous for you to be alone.

553
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,030
Why don't you take a rest here?

554
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,670
Is this your home?

555
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,430
Home?

556
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,840
Do we still have a home?

557
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,510
We are just some old, weak and disabled people.

558
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,270
There are wars everywhere.

559
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,710
We can't protect ourselves at all.

560
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,350
Now there's a famine, too.

561
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,390
We can only endure it as long as we can.

562
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,270
Ma'am, take this.

563
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,070
This is...

564
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,710
This is all that I have now.

565
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,440
When you get to the city,

566
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,490
you can exchange it for some food.

567
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,270
Thanks. Thank you.

568
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,760
Folks!

569
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,140
Everyone, come and take a look.

570
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,950
This is the jade bracelet our benefactor gave us.

571
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,150
Everyone, stand up and take a look.

572
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,880
Everyone, come and take a look.

573
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,810
This is the jade bracelet this noble lady gave us.

574
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,390
Twenty days ago in Yuanzhou,

575
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,510
Lei Hong incited the army groups

576
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,770
of all the tribes from Yuanzhou to rebel.

577
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,670
There was a stalemate between our Palace Guards

578
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,550
and them on the main highway of Yuanzhou.

579
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,480
But no one caught sight of Lei Hong.

580
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,540
Just now,

581
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,590
a merchant said that he saw Lei Hong and his army

582
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,230
show up in the Sunset Valley.

583
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,950
Lei Hong used to lead the 25 old regiments

584
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,350
of the Zichuan Family.

585
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,070
Now with a large number of rebellious troops,

586
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,830
in terms of military power, there is a big gap between them and us.

587
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,770
But we only have one target.

588
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,250
Lei Hong is our target.

589
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,840
Lei Hong was the one who killed Lord Ge.

590
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,700
It is said that the whole Yuanzhou is in chaos like this

591
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,230
because of his incitement.

592
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,230
Can we defeat him?

593
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,640
My Lord.

594
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,870
I've heard that those guys in Yuanzhou

595
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,190
can act very quickly.

596
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,890
They know valleys and jungles very well.

597
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,400
The key of military tactics is to take them by surprise when we attack the enemy.

598
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,260
If we fight against them in such a direct way,

599
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,260
I don't think the Xiu Battalion can get any advantage.

600
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,490
I also heard that

601
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,700
they are tall and look fierce.

602
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,060
They will eat humans.

603
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,150
They're so horrible?

604
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,880
What's so horrible about them?

605
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,870
We've been messing around in Yuanzhou for so many years.

606
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,970
We surely have some experience which we can teach you.

607
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,960
We've been making a living.

608
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,630
We've been making a living in Yuanzhou for so many years.

609
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,310
People in Yuanzhou are divided into many tribes.

610
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,390
One of them is the Zuoyi Clan which you often hear.

611
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,870
They're also known as the Orcs.

612
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,310
There are other tribes, too,

613
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,390
including the Dragon Race, the Snake Race, the Elves and the Gnomes.

614
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,070
But all these things are not important.

615
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,630
Just remember one thing.

616
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,100
They have a big appetite.

617
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Pork, beef, fat mutton,

618
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,550
steamed buns, steamed pork dumplings, tofu puddings,

619
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,520
rabbits, snakes, silly roe deer,

620
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,590
fried dough sticks, steamed twisted rolls and baked wheat cakes

621
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,390
are all their favorites.

622
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,440
They not only have a big appetite, but they're also gluttonous.

623
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,280
Wherever they go, they can eat up all the things.

624
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,480
Basically, no living creatures can survive.

625
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,490
Say something useful.

626
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,990
Why do you think what I said is useless?

627
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,030
What I said is useful to him.

628
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,550
Do you dare to....

629
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,150
No!

630
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,030
So do they eat humans or not?

631
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,140
Sit down.

632
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,340
They eat everything.

633
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,010
Sit down.

634
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,780
They'll even eat humans?

635
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,120
Everyone, let's calm down.

636
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,670
Just think about it.

637
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,030
We know nothing.

638
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,710
We only know to practice this "Ho-ha" skill.

639
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,650
How can we defeat the enemy?

640
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,240
How can we defeat Lei Hong?

641
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,400
Why don't we take a detour?

642
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,040
Our destination was the Lunshan Fortress at first after all.

643
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,100
We can't disobey the military order.

644
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,930
Why are you such a coward? After we've talked so much,

645
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,130
what's so scary about Lei Hong and the people of Yuanzhou?

646
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,590
Because they eat humans?

647
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,670
When the wolves are hungry, they'll also eat humans.

648
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,730
When we are hungry,

649
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,670
we'll also peel off the skin of animals and eat their meat.

650
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,190
Maybe we'll be the ones who eat them by that time.

651
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,270
Right.

652
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,500
Both sides are right.

653
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,910
The problem is that

654
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,990
we know Lei Hong very well.

655
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,450
Whether it's about his moral character

656
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,060
or tactical habits,

657
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,760
as long as we can catch him,

658
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,430
we'll be able to kill him easily.

659
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,450
By that time, we can kill him

660
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,040
as many times as we want.

661
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,120
The members of our Battalion will fight against the common enemy.

662
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,380
When you felt wronged,

663
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,010
Lord Xiu supported you.

664
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,490
Now, Lei Hong has killed Lord Xiu's teacher

665
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,970
and betrayed Lord Xiu

666
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,170
as well as our family.

667
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
What should we do?

668
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,000
Support Lord Xiu!

669
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,820
Support Lord Xiu! Take revenge!

670
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,870
Support Lord Xiu! Take revenge!

671
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,720
Support Lord Xiu! Take revenge!

672
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,590
Support Lord Xiu! Take revenge!

673
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,390
Support Lord Xiu! Take revenge!

674
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,060
-Support Lord Xiu!
-Alright!

675
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,720
If we don't kill Lei Hong,

676
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,460
we'll feel guilty to have received Lord Xiu's help with those several White Light Arrows.

677
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,700
-Yes! -Yes!

678
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,739
What's that smell?

679
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,560
Let's set off.

680
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,690
Prepare some food.

681
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,670
Kill Lei Hong!

682
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,020
What's that smell?

683
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,890
Give me another piece.

684
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,550
Ma'am, what kind of meat are you eating?

685
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,800
Miss, come on.

686
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,510
Come on.

687
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Thank you, Ma'am.

688
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,870
Just eat it.

689
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,460
I didn't expect that

690
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,530
I could eat such delicious food here.

691
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,700
Just eat it.

692
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,370
Ma'am.

693
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,000
I'll go find something to eat for Zhui, too.

694
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,550
You guys... You guys ate Zhui!

695
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,690
Miss, come and eat.

696
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
Let's survive today first.

697
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,490
Who... Who are you?

698
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,500
Don't come over.

699
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,610
I know a lot of people.

700
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,980
Don't try to hurt me.

701
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm not afraid of you.

702
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,120
Go away at once! Go away!

703
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,030
Don't come over!

704
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,450
Don't hurt me!

705
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,320
I'm not afraid of you.

706
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,660
You want to hurt me? That's impossible!

707
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,870
Go away! Don't chase me!

708
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,430
Xiu.

709
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,470
Ning has secretly escaped from the Imperial Capital for several days

710
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,930
in order to go after you and look for you.

711
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,330
The chieftain thought that Ning had merely gone to Mount Xiang.

712
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,520
But he has already got suspicious.

713
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,250
We can't hide this for too long.

714
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,730
If Ning has met you successfully,

715
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,540
please send her back to the Imperial Capital as soon as possible.

716
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,940
If you two haven't met each other,

717
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,830
you must find Ning

718
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,340
before the chieftain sends the search team to look for her.

719
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,950
Only in this way can you avoid this disaster.

720
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,210
According to the time,

721
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,320
she only set off two days later than you.

722
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,790
There's a chance that you can find her.

723
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,390
I hope you can act cautiously

724
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,930
and keep Ning safe.

725
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,480
Look. After the Xiu Battalion left the Imperial Capital,

726
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,910
it went forward or stopped for a rest from time to time.

727
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,790
It took almost twice more time than the original plan

728
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,920
to get to Kaige City.

729
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,600
If Ning took the official road,

730
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,930
according to her speed,

731
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,390
she should have arrived in Kaige City.

732
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,370
Don't let the buddies

733
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,430
of the Xiu Battalion know about this.

734
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,470
These brats are very gossipy.

735
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,890
If this news is spread out,

736
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,310
and the people outside know that Princess Ning of the Zichuan Family

737
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,310
is in Yuanzhou,

738
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,400
her situation will be more dangerous.

739
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,010
I won't let Ning encounter any danger this time.

740
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,630
But...

741
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,020
But as for Lei Hong,

742
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,030
it was not easy for you to finally find his whereabouts.

743
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,360
What are you going to do?

744
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,590
I'll look for Princess Ning carefully

745
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,910
in Kaige City.

746
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,520
You can lead the troops to depart immediately.

747
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,380
Don't delay it.

748
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,430
I'll go with you.

749
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,500
No, I can go faster if I travel alone.

750
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,000
If you come across Lei Hong on the way, stall him.

751
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,170
I'll arrive before dark.

752
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,020
No one has told me that

753
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,630
Orcs eat humans.

754
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,480
I don't want to die.

755
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,170
If I die, who will look after my flowers?

756
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,560
I haven't had time to wear the new clothes I bought.

757
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,450
I haven't seen Xiu yet.

758
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,540
It's all your fault.

759
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,310
It's all your fault, Zichuan Xiu!

760
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,050
I haven't had time to beat you up,

761
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,110
but I'm going to be eaten by them soon.

762
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,640
Do you remember me?

763
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,950
Yes, I do. I'll answer all your questions.

764
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,600
Have you seen a noble lady?

765
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,110
A noble lady?

766
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,280
There are so many guests visiting my inn.

767
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,500
I really can't remember them all.

768
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,670
Let me think about it carefully.

769
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,470
Think at once!

770
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,750
Sir, which lady are you looking for?

771
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,420
This is Ning's purse.

772
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,250
How come you have it?

773
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,690
A lady left it here.

774
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,950
You are her friend and the soldier

775
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,750
whom she was looking for, right?

776
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,020
You've seen her. Where is she now?

777
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,030
She went to the Lunshan Fortress.

778
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,120
This girl's skin is so fair.

779
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,180
It's so smooth that it's as if you would break it while touching it.

780
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,140
It's as smooth as streaky pork.

781
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,790
Streaky pork? I can't bear it anymore.

782
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,210
The water is boiling. Come and help me.

783
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:40,740
Let's go.

784
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,320
I just want to eat it raw.

785
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,980
Come on. Hurry up.

786
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,430
Don't run around. Don't move.

787
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,440
We'll eat you.

788
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,440
Hurry up, you two.

789
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,470
Where's the streaky pork?

790
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,930
The streaky pork has run away. Let's go after her!

791
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,130
Hurry up! The streaky pork has run away!

792
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,590
You can take a look over there.

793
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,230
Okay.

794
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,020
She's not here.

795
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,730
She's not here, either.

796
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,470
Where has the streaky pork gone?

797
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,590
I wonder, too. Let's go on looking for her.

798
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,230
I'll go over there to take a look.

799
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,360
You two can go there.

800
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,830
Okay.

801
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,510
Go now!

802
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,320
Is she over there?
