00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,810
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:43,870
My Lord,

5
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,120
I have a different opinion.

6
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,150
I think the two Lords

7
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,940
are too benevolent.

8
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,430
The hawks of the North Clan have won a great victory this time.

9
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,800
I believe there is no hope for peace talks.

10
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,490
Now, we have no choice but to flex our muscles by deploy our army to the border.

11
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,560
Di Lin.

12
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,450
Just tell us your thoughts.

13
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,710
First, put Ka Dan on house arrest.

14
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,110
Second, deploy 170,000 Palace Guards

15
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,310
to Yuanzhou to put pressure on the North Clan.

16
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,829
Third, do not make peace voluntarily.

17
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,110
After we force them to retreat with our powerful army,

18
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,440
we'll talk about peace.

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,250
In the whole of Zichuan,

20
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,030
Lei Xun's Palace Guards is the only army that is so powerful.

21
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,160
Lord Lei, if you lead the Palace Guards to the frontline,

22
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,829
you will protect the Imperial Capital and Zichuan for sure.

23
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,950
Am I right?

24
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,190
Our Palace Guards is more than capable

25
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,520
to deter the North Clan.

26
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,620
Lord Yang, what do you think?

27
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,930
I agree.

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,260
Okay. Then there's no problem.

29
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,390
Lei Xun,

30
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,000
just follow Lord Ge on the expedition.

31
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,470
Wait.

32
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,360
Lord Lei and Lord Si Yilin

33
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,380
have both committed a felony of neglecting their duties

34
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,680
during the peace talks.

35
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,760
If they lead an army, I'm afraid it won't convince the soldiers.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,870
This is concerning the military and the country. The regulations are dead,

37
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,270
but people are flexible.

38
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,310
The war is soon happening. Thus, we should attach more value to the military law at this moment.

39
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,110
That's right.

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,270
If we want to direct the army wisely, we should make clear what's to be rewarded and what is punished.

41
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,390
It's really a headache.

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,070
My Lord.

43
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,470
I, Di Lin,

44
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,829
Deputy Commander of the Ministry of War,

45
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,430
ask you to allow me to lead the army to Yuanzhou.

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,390
But I don't need 170,000 soldiers.

47
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,550
I only need 50,000.

48
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,829
Di Lin, you're young.

49
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,870
It's good that you have ambitions.

50
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,230
But do you know the battlefield is ruthless?

51
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,790
My Lord, I can make a pledge.

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,190
As long as I lose one battle,

53
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,530
I'll kill myself.

54
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,000
Lord Canxing said you were impulsive,

55
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,890
and you're having less and less decency.

56
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,500
How can you convince people by mere words?

57
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,630
Zichuan wants victory, not your head.

58
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,430
The people of all tribes in Yuanzhou have been fighting for years.

59
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,910
The bodies who died of hunger are piling at the roadside.

60
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,350
I'll attack the small cities first

61
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,160
and persuade all tribes in Yuanzhou to join our army.

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,550
Kill for steamed buns.

63
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,910
All tribes in Yuanzhou hate the North Clan so much

64
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,790
that our army will defeat the North Clan as easily as a knife splits a bamboo.

65
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,830
Lord Ge knows the war in Yuanzhou best.

66
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,230
What do you think?

67
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,850
Deputy Commander Di Lin is brave and resourceful.

68
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,390
He's indeed a promising

69
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,390
young hero.

70
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,510
The Palace Guards will stay in Zichuan.

71
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll give you 50,000 Yuanzhou Army. Can you do it?

72
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,690
Of course.

73
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,590
Good!

74
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:51,740
My Lord,

75
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,610
Si Yilin, Lord Yang,

76
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,670
Lei Xun, and I asked for punishment.

77
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,750
I don't think we can be pardoned.

78
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,580
The war is coming. Let the generals and soldiers see

79
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,370
that the Commander and Commander-in-Chief all punish themselves with military law.

80
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,870
That will undoubtedly spur the whole army.

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,390
Lord Ge, why are you bringing this up again?

82
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,450
Don't mention it anymore, okay?

83
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,460
Lord Yang knows how to run a country best.

84
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,430
What do you think, Lord Yang?

85
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,430
Yes, we all should be punished.

86
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,690
Lord Luo, what should the punishment be?

87
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,870
Lord Yang and Lord Ge failed to supervise the subordinates.

88
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,170
They should forfeit three years of salary and be demoted by one rank.

89
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,300
Lord Lei and Lord Si Yilin have neglected their duties.

90
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,770
They should be demoted by three ranks and be caned 30 times.

91
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,950
Also, they should forfeit three years of salary.

92
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,950
It's reasonable.

93
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,490
Being demoted would harm my prestige as the Commander-in-Chief.

94
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,560
I'd lose confidence to lead the army.

95
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,330
Why don't we make it quick?

96
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,760
How about we meditate on our faults behind closed doors for ten days?

97
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,630
Military affairs at the frontline are urgent.

98
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,550
Lord Ge, if you're going to meditate on your faults behind closed doors,

99
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,470
I'm afraid it will affect the government administration.

100
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,730
Without me hindering,

101
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,240
Deputy Commander Di Lin's abilities

102
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,150
of directing military affairs will emerge more clearly.

103
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,870
Fine.

104
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,190
In the next ten days, I will travel to Wayun day and night

105
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,510
and reflect on my faults in the carriage.

106
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,900
I will be able to make a good knife in ten days.

107
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,350
My Lords,

108
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,300
do you think the government affairs in the Imperial Capital

109
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,360
should be handed over to Xiao Long

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,550
or Lord Luo Minghai?

111
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,840
My Lord, you are the Chieftain.

112
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,770
Of course you should handle them.

113
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,190
No, I really can't.

114
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,230
I'm not in good health.

115
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,890
Lord Canxing.

116
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,780
Lord Yuanxing often led you to govern together.

117
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,370
This time, we're really going to count on you.

118
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,090
What do you think, Lord Yang?

119
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,050
My Lord, it's only ten days.

120
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,110
I'll get someone to take care of you

121
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,380
and make sure you're in a good situation. It'll be fine.

122
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,230
Lord Luo Minghai,

123
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,470
you must help me.

124
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,360
Lord Canxing, as the Chief Remonstrator,

125
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,800
I will assist you all the way.

126
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,810
Okay.

127
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,070
Sorry.

128
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,590
My stomach kept rumbling.

129
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,950
I'm really sorry.

130
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,760
Go on.

131
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,210
Come on, I need to go to the toilet.

132
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,170
Lord Ge, you have just returned to the Imperial Capital.

133
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,990
You haven't rested even for a while.

134
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,650
And now you're leaving again.

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,150
What can I do for you?

136
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm glad to have you in the Imperial Capital, Lord Yang.

137
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
I have no worries.

138
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,150
I hope you'll be well.

139
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,110
I will.

140
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,350
So, Yang Minghua

141
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,710
planned to send you to Yuanzhou in the first place?

142
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,510
Yes.

143
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,550
The bloody feather necklace which belonged to the princess

144
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,180
and made the envoys of the North Clan flee at once

145
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,060
was sent by me under Yang Minghua's instructions.

146
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,910
This pendant was sent at a critical time.

147
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,030
No matter how Lord Ge planned it,

148
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,350
it wouldn't help.

149
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,710
Exactly.

150
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,360
So I have to send it away

151
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,910
before the negotiation time.

152
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,750
Otherwise, you'll be exposed.

153
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,730
Fine, it's the Second Brother who's in bad luck.

154
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,630
He just experienced a jungle adventure,

155
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,800
and now his butt is badly injured.

156
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,980
Do you still remember me?

157
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,120
Your pants are stuck to your flesh, right?

158
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,380
Second Brother, I'm afraid you can't take a shower.

159
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,910
No.

160
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,670
I'm sorry. I meant it.

161
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,370
When I recover…

162
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,090
Big Brother, did they send you to Yuanzhou

163
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,220
to weaken Lord Ge's power?

164
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,030
Yes.

165
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,080
What are you going to do?

166
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,700
Only a real fight

167
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,210
can fool that old fox.

168
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,260
But I might have to trouble Lord Ge.

169
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,640
I know Lord Ge.

170
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,150
He won't just say yes.

171
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,710
Besides, Lord Ge must have his reason

172
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,790
for punishing him.

173
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,150
Anyway,

174
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,860
as long as Yang Minghua rebels,

175
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,670
the three of us will be finished.

176
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,180
Will Yang Minghua really rebel?

177
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,710
I don't think he will, as long as he still has a choice.

178
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,070
His goal is to check and balance.

179
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,690
By the way, have you found the assassin

180
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,590
who had fled from the War Prisoner Camp and assassinated the princess?

181
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,250
He must be Yang Minghua's spy.

182
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,940
Is he from the Royal Escorts?

183
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,450
No. He's someone near me.

184
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,710
My Lady, Lord Xiu is back.

185
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,710
Brother Xiu, you're just in time.

186
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,310
Can you give me some advice?

187
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,990
I've been hesitating…

188
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,270
If I participate

189
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,940
in an elegant activity,

190
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,070
do you think this outfit will do?

191
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,070
Yes.

192
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,390
I think this one looks good, too.

193
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,280
But

194
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,150
just in case,

195
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,150
I've prepared two more outfits. Take a look.

196
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,030
They all look good.

197
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,140
You'll look beautiful in anything.

198
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,210
Lord Xiu, you say she's pretty without even looking.

199
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,980
You need to feel the beauty with your heart.

200
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,600
You're still young.

201
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,200
When you grow up,

202
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,540
you'll slowly...

203
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,220
Brother Xiu,

204
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,400
you even prepared food for me.

205
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,240
I told you I'm on a diet.

206
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm doing it for you.

207
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,940
I can't wear it if I eat.

208
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,110
Shall I eat or not?

209
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,670
Ning.

210
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,710
Brother Xiu.

211
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,470
I can't let you down,

212
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,030
right?

213
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,910
So if I gain a little weight

214
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,830
after eating it,

215
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,120
don't dislike me.

216
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,550
Well...

217
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,870
No, this… that…

218
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,860
This...

219
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,290
I prepared this for Baichuan.

220
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,150
She just recovered from a severe illness.

221
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,420
I brought her some food.

222
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,880
Do you care so much about your subordinates?

223
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,250
I'm her boss.

224
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,780
Of course I care about her.

225
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,430
Whether she eats well or sleeps well,

226
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,050
whether she's bored or not, are all the things I have to care about.

227
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,500
Is Miss Baichuan that important?

228
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,830
Yes.

229
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,390
Lord Xiu, think about it again.

230
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,390
Is there anything more important than Lord Baichuan?

231
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,790
Yes, there is.

232
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,630
It's still early. The big event is tonight.

233
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,510
I do have

234
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,510
something very important tonight.

235
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,080
Brother Xiu,

236
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,910
go and take care of your subordinate now.

237
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,630
Okay.

238
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,350
Brother Xiu,

239
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,830
don't forget the important thing.

240
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,930
My Lady, Lord Xiu remembers.

241
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,710
Here.

242
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,070
I made these specially for you.

243
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,690
The ingredients are all nutritious.

244
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:15,760
Look.

245
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,510
For the first dish,

246
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,270
I used a chameleon plant,

247
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,840
bitter cypress, bitter lotus, bitter gourd, and bitter ginseng

248
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,300
and stewed them together.

249
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,150
Is it even drinkable?

250
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,230
Of course.

251
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,070
It took me so much effort.

252
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,670
I stewed it for four hours.

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,260
It is heat-relieving and detoxicating.

254
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,430
This dish

255
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,360
is called Endless Bitterness.

256
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,230
And the second dish.

257
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,670
Fish head stewed with Chinese angelica.

258
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,350
It's nourishing and replenishing. And it's good for your spleen and stomach.

259
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,750
This dish is called "Turning Back, and Salvation is at Hand."

260
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,650
And the third dish.

261
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,390
Steamed rice with potatoes and vermicelli made with bean starch.

262
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,630
What is this dish called?

263
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,140
This dish is called "Return after Getting Lost."

264
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,880
And the fourth dish.

265
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,590
"Wash your hands and quit your old business"?

266
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,250
You can also call it "a Horse Diving into Water."

267
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,520
Where's the horse?

268
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,050
That's a good question. It paused on the brink of the precipice.

269
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,040
Do you want to tell me something?

270
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,940
Baichuan, why are you so exasperated?

271
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,670
I merely care about my subordinate.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,130
I made these dishes specially for you.

273
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,090
Why don't you drink the soup while it's still warm?

274
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,030
Are you feeling pressured now that I'm watching you eat?

275
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,710
Then I'll leave kindly.

276
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,020
Enjoy.

277
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,870
[Ministry of War]

278
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,590
Lord Ge.

279
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,220
Lord Yang is currently

280
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,700
reflecting on his mistakes behind closed doors, as promised.

281
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,260
He doesn't want to see me.

282
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,220
It's okay. You go ahead with your business.

283
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,860
I'll talk to him at the door.

284
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,230
Lord Ge,

285
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,390
aren't you supposed to be on your way to Yuanzhou?

286
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,060
I told you not to disturb us!

287
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,170
Third Brother.

288
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,000
You don't want to see me, right?

289
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,350
Lord Ge.

290
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,020
I am a sinner now.

291
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,430
I am doing self-reflection.

292
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,770
Forgive me for being rude.

293
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,990
The peace negotiation failed.

294
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,850
I don't know when I'll return after I go to Yuanzhou.

295
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,150
Sometimes,

296
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,940
when I stood on the city tower of Wayun Fortress,

297
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,960
I would think

298
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,070
that we were both in our fifties

299
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,060
and might not meet again.

300
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,180
You were rather self-assertive in the court today.

301
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,540
Why are you suddenly so sad now?

302
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,010
Nowadays, there are many young people in the court.

303
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,590
I don't think many still remember

304
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,770
you, Yuanxing, and I

305
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,990
were once sworn brothers.

306
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,220
I protect Zichuan, and you guard Yuanzhou.

307
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,440
Of course we are brothers.

308
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,280
You know what I meant.

309
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,270
People in Zichuan all said you were arrogant, bash,

310
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,870
and disloyal for a long time.

311
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,870
But I know you're just vicious

312
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,140
for Zichuan's interest.

313
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,220
If you really want to rebel,

314
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,280
it must be because

315
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,170
those around you incite you.

316
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,930
Repeated slander makes people believe. Gossip is a fearful thing.

317
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,670
I guess that's what happened.

318
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,860
Am I right?

319
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,310
Don't listen to their nonsense.

320
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,810
Previously,

321
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,110
you, Yuanxing, and I fought together.

322
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,280
The one who liked making weapons was Yuanxing.

323
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,530
The one who wanted to collect 13 legendary weapons

324
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,589
was also Yuanxing.

325
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,710
Now,

326
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,160
you still keep his habits.

327
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,990
Ordinary people don't understand your deep love.

328
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,260
Back then, we were trapped among the enemy.

329
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,550
You had no breath already.

330
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,480
I didn't expect

331
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,520
Yuanxing would save you.

332
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,710
But he said if you had to die,

333
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,790
he would let you die in Zichuan at least.

334
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,900
So, in spite of the fact that he was shot 22 times by arrows,

335
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,360
he dragged you out of the pile of dead people.

336
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,690
That is the true meaning of life and death together.

337
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,950
You can't express your gratitude by saying thank you.

338
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,260
Second Brother,

339
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,780
I remember everything you said.

340
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,850
I've never forgotten it for a moment.

341
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,790
Now, the world

342
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,130
belongs to Yuanxing.

343
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,350
I swore to protect Zichuan

344
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,100
for Yuanxing.

345
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,740
Think about it.

346
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,460
How is it possible that I'd rebel?

347
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,030
Canxing is frail and sick.

348
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,740
He's also weak in character.

349
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,320
I know the difficulties you experienced

350
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,520
while supporting the whole country alone.

351
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,410
You had hundreds of thousands of soldiers in Yuanzhou,

352
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,590
but the North Clan was cruel, so you were in constant danger.

353
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,600
I understand

354
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,510
your difficulties, too.

355
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,910
So, after thinking about it many times,

356
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,010
I still wanted to come and see you.

357
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,620
The North Clan will definitely take the opportunity to attack us.

358
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,340
Once the war begins, my life will be at stake.

359
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,860
I may not come back alive.

360
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,260
Even if I survive, I don't know when I'll be back.

361
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,670
So...

362
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,790
I've found the 13 patterns

363
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,620
that you and Big Brother both like.

364
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,270
Actually, I've collected all of them for a long time.

365
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,030
Whenever I returned to the Imperial Capital, I always took them with me.

366
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,760
But I could never find a chance to give them to you.

367
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,340
I'll leave them at your door today.

368
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,480
Consider them a gift from me to our Big Brother and you.

369
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,940
The taste of liquor changes.

370
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,740
People change, too.

371
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,310
I understand it all.

372
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,530
I understand!

373
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,530
But Third Brother,

374
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,950
I'm begging you for one thing.

375
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,310
You must stay steadfast

376
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,240
and protect the country in place of our Big Brother.

377
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,690
What changed? It's still so sour.

378
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,320
Remember to pack all these things.

379
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,570
This bracelet is for repelling mosquitoes.

380
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,230
Medicine in this can cure malaria.

381
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,570
Did Xiu give you these things?

382
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,880
I interrogated Xiu for these.

383
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,870
You said nothing was missing, didn't you?

384
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,030
Stop talking nonsense and write quickly.

385
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,350
Think about it.

386
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,380
You should pack this, too.

387
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,960
Love letters?

388
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,670
It's some sentences written in the language of the North Clan.

389
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,550
For example, "surrender", "Spare my life",

390
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,960
or "I'm willing to be your slave."

391
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,490
They're all written in it.

392
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,470
I don't need it.

393
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,500
I know you don't need it.

394
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,810
I mean

395
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,340
if your enemy says these words to you,

396
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,100
you'll be able to understand and to spare them.

397
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,010
Since you know so much,

398
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,260
I guess I should take you with me.

399
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,100
Then you'll be the first person in the whole Zichuan

400
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,300
who brings his wife to the battlefield.

401
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,990
How awesome would that be!

402
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,570
Then, no one will dare to covet you.

403
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,700
You three agreed to divide the work,

404
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,150
but you are the one who had to be a spy.

405
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,320
Now, there's a war,

406
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,190
and they sent you to the front line.

407
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,150
Why do you think that is?

408
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,550
I know.

409
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,930
It's because you are the Big Brother.

410
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,720
But don't worry.

411
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,340
Good brothers should be through weal and woe together.

412
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,480
I won't let them live a good life in the Imperial Capital.

413
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,010
I'm willing to be your slave.

414
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,880
What did you say?

415
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,760
I'm willing to be your slave.

416
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,780
Then don't regret it.

417
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,150
I won't regret it in this life.

418
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,550
Then you have to listen to me on everything.

419
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,290
I'll listen to you on everything from now on.

420
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,280
I won't stop you from risking your life

421
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,990
because that way, you'd not be you.

422
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,910
I won't tell you not to get hurt

423
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,200
because I know you're going on a battlefield.

424
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,470
I only have one request for you.

425
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,310
Come back alive

426
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,470
because you're my husband.

427
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,850
Yes, Ma'am.

428
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,230
My brother wore this before.

429
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Yuanzhou is cold.

430
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,490
You take it.

431
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,830
That's too much an honor for me, My Lord.

432
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,630
The peace talks didn't work out.

433
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,310
I wouldn't dare to accept your grace, Lord Chieftain.

434
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,490
Besides, this is Lord Yuanxing's personal property.

435
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,820
It's to a royal specification.

436
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,920
I can't wear it.

437
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,310
You're my brother's sworn brother

438
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,290
and my trusted subordinate.

439
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,810
It's only an overcoat.

440
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,710
Why can't you wear it?

441
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,670
Come on.

442
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,160
It suits you well.

443
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,250
I appreciate

444
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,430
your kindness,

445
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,100
but I feel guilty to accept it.

446
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,190
What are you doing?

447
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,100
It suits you well.

448
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,770
In that case,

449
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,270
I won't force you anymore.

450
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,730
You're so…

451
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,750
Come here. Have a seat.

452
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,460
If Yang Minghua can be like you, Lord Ge,

453
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,080
I needn't worry.

454
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,230
Yang Minghua destroyed the peace talks

455
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,450
because he was afraid that I would come back to the Imperial Capital and take his power.

456
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,880
Although he is determined to take power,

457
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
I believe

458
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,260
he's loyal to Zichuan.

459
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,210
We both know that.

460
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,920
It's rumored that he...

461
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,540
That's why I made this arrangement today.

462
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,940
It's just ten days.

463
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,900
How can we take his power in such a short time?

464
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,750
Of course not.

465
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,570
But through these days,

466
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,530
I hope we can find out if Yang Minghua wants to rebel.

467
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:19,960
My Lord,

468
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,750
please cooperate.

469
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,310
Fine.

470
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,480
I'll do my best.

471
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,150
But today,

472
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,510
I still have a lot to deal with.

473
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,340
It's really a headache for me.

474
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,260
Luckily, Luo Minghai helped Yang Minghua before.

475
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,750
He's resourceful.

476
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,160
I handled this thing myself today.

477
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,610
I've placed

478
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,500
Princess Ka Dan in Ning's place.

479
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,970
What do you think?

480
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,050
They are of the same status.

481
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,380
The Zichuan Ning's Mansion is well-equipped with top Royal Escorts.

482
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,630
Certainly it's safe.

483
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,020
It's a good arrangement.

484
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,550
There's one more thing, Lord Ge.

485
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:18,510
Why did you allow Di Lin to go to Yuanzhou?

486
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,590
If he becomes a big shot in the future,

487
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,590
won't it affect

488
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,210
your clout in Yuanzhou?

489
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,470
Di Lin is meticulous and good at fighting.

490
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,440
He'll be a big help to me if he's in Yuanzhou.

491
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,640
It will take some time to make a foothold in Yuanzhou.

492
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,500
It's far from easy

493
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,870
to subdue the 50,000 Yuanzhou soldiers.

494
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,110
If he really does it,

495
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,150
he will be the mainstay of Zichuan in the future.

496
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,030
I will do my best to make him work for you, Chieftain.

497
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,230
If he doesn't listen to the orders,

498
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,570
I will kill him myself.

499
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,350
Lord Ge.

500
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,730
You're very foresighted.

501
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,070
I'm lucky to have you.

502
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,880
Zichuan is lucky to have you.

503
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,670
My Lord, the medicine is ready.

504
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,460
Yang Minghua

505
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,580
really takes good care of me.

506
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,660
Take the medicine for example.

507
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,240
He chose it himself.

508
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,350
If he wants to replace me,

509
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,780
it'll be too easy for him.

510
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,110
You're right, My Lord.

511
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,430
I talked a lot with Lord Yang today.

512
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,840
He still has an emotional attachment

513
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,380
to Lord Yuanxing and Zichuan.

514
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,300
In my opinion,

515
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,770
unless he was forced or instigated by bad people,

516
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,500
he won't rebel easily.

517
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,680
If

518
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,940
he dares to rebel,

519
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,240
I have the countermeasure, too.

520
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,150
Actually, it's not really my plan.

521
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,130
My brother had plans.

522
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,890
Lord Ge, please wait a minute.

523
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,920
My brother gave me this before he died.

524
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,920
He said once Yang Minghua rebelled,

525
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,720
we could subdue him with this.

526
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,720
Lord Yuanxing

527
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,280
hoped

528
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,180
we wouldn't go this far

529
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,830
as long as we still have a chance.

530
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,430
Yes, I just want to show you this

531
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,840
so that you can rest assured during the trip.

532
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,370
Thank you, My Lord.

533
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,720
All right.

534
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,320
It's getting late.

535
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,040
Lord Ge, you have to leave early tomorrow morning.

536
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,560
You should go back and rest.

537
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,140
Take care, Lord Ge.

538
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,350
He...

539
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,140
must rebel.

540
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,750
Hello, I'm Zichuan Ning.

541
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,180
Please allow me to express my sincere greetings to you.

542
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,060
Thank you. I'm a little tired.

543
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,070
I want to go back to my bedroom to rest. Is it okay?

544
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,480
This way, please.

545
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,670
I will take you to the bedroom myself.

546
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,070
Don't bother, Lady Ning.

547
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,100
Just let the maid take me there.

548
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,410
Mei, take the princess to rest.

549
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,230
Yes.

550
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,910
If possible,

551
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,500
can you lend me a carving knife?

552
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,010
Someone will send it to you later.

553
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,310
The first time I met Ka Dan,

554
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,560
we didn't have a friendly chat

555
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,790
or a dinner together,

556
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,230
nor did we communicate the situation of the two families.

557
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,070
Is it a bit rude?

558
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,020
My Lady, it's not your fault.

559
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,240
After all, she is a princess of the North Clan.

560
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,260
Maybe they have different etiquette from us.

561
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,310
Besides, she was just assassinated.

562
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,240
So surely she's…

563
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,100
Yes, she was assassinated!

564
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,710
So, my focus now

565
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,250
should not be on etiquette,

566
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,310
but on comforting her frightened heart.

567
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:09,340
Here.

568
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,210
Put it back on for me.

569
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:11,659
Yes.

570
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,179
Why do you think Princess Ka Dan wants a carving knife?

571
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,600
She's not committing suicide, is she?

572
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,130
What should we do, My Lady?

573
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,730
I've sent it to her already.

574
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:25,780
Let's go and have a look.

575
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,780
We can't let anything happen to her.

576
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,750
Princess Ka Dan,

577
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,820
I asked my servants to prepare a delicious meal.

578
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,610
Are you interested in having dinner tonight?

579
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,100
I've had a long journey.

580
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,840
I am still resting.

581
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,949
It's not convenient for me to entertain guests.

582
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:57,750
I'll come again next time.

583
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

584
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,250
No, it's not right. Come here.

585
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,930
Why did she raise the knife?

586
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,030
She also lit the incense.

587
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,600
Is this some kind of ceremony

588
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,190
for committing suicide?

589
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,500
And there's a handkerchief.

590
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,560
Is she going to wipe the blood with it?

591
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,040
To make sure she doesn't die in an ugly way.

592
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,440
Princess Ka Dan.

593
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,180
If something's bothering you,

594
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,710
tell me. Don't kill yourself.

595
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,070
The world is so beautiful.

596
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,070
-What are you doing?
-I am not.

597
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,980
You still deny it?

598
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,630
If you are not killing yourself,

599
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,830
why are you holding the carving knife?

600
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,830
I just want to write a letter.

601
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,540
Are you kidding me?

602
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,920
Who wrote a letter with a knife?

603
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,160
Because it's written on wood.

604
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,110
Stop looking for excuses.

605
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,710
I saw everything. I gave you…

606
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,470
Wood.

607
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,730
It represents that I'm well.

608
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,160
You really didn't try to commit suicide?

609
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,250
The hawks of our Clan

610
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,320
wanted to start a war with the excuse of my death.

611
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,580
It's hard for Zichuan envoys to prove that I'm still alive.

612
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,240
Father gave me this wooden sculpture.

613
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,350
I carved a pattern representing safety on it.

614
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,310
Father will understand when he sees this token.

615
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,420
Why did you light the oil lamp?

616
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,360
Because I couldn't see clearly.

617
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,630
What about the handkerchief?

618
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,410
It was used to clean the wood chippings.

619
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,890
What about the incense?

620
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,350
It's not a ceremony to commit suicide, is it?

621
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,330
There was already the incense

622
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,180
in the room.

623
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,300
I remember. I lit it.

624
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,470
But I forgot because I was in a hurry.

625
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,280
Mei, I knew it.

626
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,430
You are always careless.

627
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,910
Look what you have done

628
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,910
to us princesses.

629
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,160
Don't do this again.

630
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,020
It's okay.

631
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,520
Your eyes were filled with tears just now.

632
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,310
I saw it clearly.

633
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,440
Don't try to deny it.

634
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,260
I'm homesick.

635
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,350
It's only normal to be sad.

636
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,440
If you're in a bad mood, I have an idea.

637
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,780
Let's do whatever we want tonight.

638
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,270
Let me see your hands.

639
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,250
Let's cheer…

640
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,010
up!

641
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,830
How is it? Are you happy in my mansion?

642
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,870
I didn't expect that after sweating,

643
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,790
I feel so good.

644
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,230
Of course.

645
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,580
Let me tell you.

646
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,310
I have a lot of fun things here.

647
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,150
Don't worry. Take your time.

648
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,930
Is this how all the girls live in Zichuan?

649
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,180
No way.

650
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,950
Girls from Zichuan

651
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,090
live a much happier life than me.

652
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,010
I can only eat at home

653
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,280
and dance at home.

654
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,460
I heard there is a kind of sport.

655
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,210
You tie a rope on your waist

656
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
and jump off the cliff.

657
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,440
It's very exciting.

658
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,590
But I'm sure that Uncle won't let me go.

659
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,790
I didn't know you had such worries, too.

660
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,920
If you ignore worries,

661
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,960
they will disappear.

662
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,440
Let's not talk about this.

663
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,970
Tomorrow, I'll ask the tailor

664
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,330
to make you a new dress.

665
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,940
Choose the most popular style in the Imperial Capital.

666
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,930
This is the most important thing tomorrow.

667
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,150
To save you,

668
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,480
I mobilized the Yuanzhou Army.

669
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,540
It's time to leave,

670
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,460
yet you just treat me to a bowl of noodles.

671
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,260
Alright, Master. I understand.

672
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,320
Sir, one portion of meat.

673
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,640
Sorry.

674
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,240
The meat is sold out today.

675
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,030
Master, it's not that I don't want to spend money.

676
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,090
It's your bad luck.

677
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,270
What's the use of teaching you?

678
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,870
How can you say that?

679
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,100
Master, what do you want me to do?

680
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,730
Everyone says Yang Minghua wants to rebel,

681
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,970
but no one knows if he will do it

682
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,240
and how he will do it.

683
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,790
Your task is simple.

684
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,860
Find out the truth.

685
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,310
How can I find out the truth in just ten days?

686
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,170
In the ten days,

687
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,240
Lord Canxing will review all the documents

688
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,370
Yang Minghua had read and given remarks in recent years.

689
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,540
Do you have any thoughts?

690
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,310
If Yang Minghua really wants to rebel,

691
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,720
he definitely has some kind of financial support.

692
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,940
Yang Minghua has roped in many trusted followers over the years.

693
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,980
We should

694
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,630
guard against all of them.

695
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,860
Master, this is such a critical mission.

696
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,900
I'm in danger.

697
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,990
My life is in danger.

698
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,990
Shouldn't you pay me double?

699
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,770
Should I buy you a house

700
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,290
in the Imperial Capital?

701
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:38,840
A house?

702
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,730
Really?

703
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,020
Wait, Master.

704
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,740
Why does it sound so unreal

705
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,070
that it comes from your mouth?

706
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,880
Wait, if I can't find out...

707
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,470
I mean, if.

708
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,130
Can you still keep your word?

709
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,650
I hope you won't find anything.

710
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,740
Master, this meal…

711
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,390
You don't even want to treat me to this meal?

712
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,790
Wait.

713
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,430
Okay, my treat.

714
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,340
Bye.

715
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,420
Master.

716
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,770
I'll order some meat for you when you come back.

717
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,070
And you buy me a house.

718
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,460
Deal.

719
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,530
This is something very important.

720
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,260
How about this?

721
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,330
Pick some masters in the Royal Escorts

722
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,020
and catch up with Ge Yingxing.

723
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,790
Give it to him in person.

724
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,380
Yes.

725
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:16,900
Understood?

726
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,220
Yes.

727
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,330
Ning, you're really good.

728
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,140
You can help me

729
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,690
with the administration now.

730
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,250
You've grown up. Our family has hopes.

731
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,230
No, it's because you taught me well, Uncle.

732
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,550
This time, we should also thank Princess Ka Dan.

733
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,610
She is thoughtful.

734
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,450
Uncle,

735
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,630
if there's nothing else,

736
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,450
I'm leaving.

737
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,830
What's the rush?

738
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,380
I'm going to play the music with Brother Xiu tonight.

739
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,500
Look.

740
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,780
I just said you've grown up.

741
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,350
Now you're pestering Xiu

742
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,630
like a child.

743
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:03,860
No.

744
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,350
I was wrong.

745
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,470
You've indeed grown up.

746
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,090
You're going to do something big.

747
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,660
Okay.

748
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,610
I won't ask about

749
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,280
the things among you young people.

750
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,250
Xiu has been back for days.

751
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,670
It's been a long time

752
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,390
since our family ate together.

753
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,030
Let's have a family dinner

754
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,210
in my place tomorrow.

755
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,760
Okay, I'll tell him when I get back.

756
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,100
I'm leaving, Uncle.

757
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,060
Okay.
