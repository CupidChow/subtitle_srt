[Episode 10]

4
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,830
Pay up.

5
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,140
100 taels of gold.

6
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,229
What gold?

7
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,250
What are you doing?

8
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,210
The expenses in Chunfeng Garden are too high.

9
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,540
It'd better be worth the 100 taels.

10
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,990
It was very fruitful.

11
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,400
The people who frequent Chunfeng Garden are all high-ranking and noble,

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
so the girls there

13
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,800
hear a lot of gossip.

14
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,030
The gossip may not seem to matter,

15
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,370
but after you collect

16
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,500
and analyze it carefully, you'll find it to be valuable.

17
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,970
There are not only people inside Chunfeng Garden

18
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,700
but also those barbers and cart pullers outside.

19
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,150
Over time,

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,250
all these people would form an invisible net together.

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,510
The person behind this

22
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,490
uses these small potatoes

23
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,130
to grasp the secrets of all the big shots in the Imperial Capital.

24
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,540
If the person behind this

25
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,329
is the one from the Ministry of War,

26
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,350
our actions will all be transparent to him.

27
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,270
If not,

28
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,970
they have to work for us.

29
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,130
Just tell me what you want me to do.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
Nothing for now.

31
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,700
Wait until I find out who's behind this.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,510
How about it? The news I brought?

33
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,350
Don't squander it.

34
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,910
Okay, I'll ask Sister-in-law for a bottle of wine.

35
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,390
Are you going out so late?

36
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,110
I dare not stay here.

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,220
Didn't Lord Chieftain

38
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,260
agree to your relationship?

39
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,910
I screwed up

40
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,440
my relationship with Ning.

41
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,390
Weren't you rather overbearing?

42
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,710
You even wanted to run away from home

43
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,630
and go to Chunfeng Garden to find ten prostitutes…

44
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,760
Keep your voice down, Second Brother!

45
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,270
Why is this woman so hard to please?

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,350
How can she forgive me?

47
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,590
Weren't you quite carefree during the seven years when you were in Yuanzhou?

48
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,350
Why can't you even handle Ning?

49
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,650
At war, you should know yourself and your enemy well.

50
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,150
But women… Do you understand them?

51
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,270
This is the most reliable thing.

52
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,070
How about I find you a counselor?

53
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,790
Counselor?

54
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,800
Let‘s go.

55
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,230
Girls are sensitive.

56
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,680
What matters to them is

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,710
whether you really care about them.

58
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,310
If you want Ning to stop being mad at you,

59
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,170
you need to make her think you've devoted yourself.

60
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,510
Do you understand?

61
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,510
I seem to understand every word,

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,490
but I don't seem to understand

63
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,840
the whole sentence.

64
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,810
Princess, Xiu wants to know

65
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,610
if there's

66
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,350
a simpler and more direct way to apologize.

67
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,390
You grew up together.

68
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,250
If you are willing to put your heart in it,

69
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,040
my method is not worth mentioning.

70
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,560
Give me a hint.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,080
What she cares, what she likes,

72
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,310
what the most important thing to her is,

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,090
if you can remember all of these, you must have put your heart in it.

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Sorry to bother you, Your Highness.

75
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,230
Lord Si Yilin, you've helped me a lot.

76
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,720
You're welcome.

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,310
We'll leave now.

78
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,270
Please wait a moment.

79
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,050
I have something for you.

80
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,430
I was struggling in the War Prisoner Camp.

81
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,720
Luckily, you protected me.

82
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,390
I acted on my own and modified

83
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,390
this military uniform for you.

84
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,030
I hope you won't blame me.

85
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,150
For us, the North Clan,

86
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,270
only warriors

87
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,930
deserve the honor of having a cut in the uniform.

88
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,210
The more cuts there are, the braver the warrior must be.

89
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,550
In my heart,

90
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,210
you are a true warrior.

91
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,030
Princess Ka Dan, please sew it up.

92
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,110
In the Royal Escorts, those who are not dressed properly are not allowed to be hired.

93
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,550
But I, Si Yilin,

94
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,370
want to wear the military uniform

95
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,180
that you sew.

96
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,230
Well,

97
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,290
please come to pick it up in a few days.

98
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,350
You have so many military uniforms,

99
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,210
and yet you want this patched one?

100
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,360
You like Ka Dan?

101
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,950
The moon is so round tonight.

102
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,880
Did you admit it?

103
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,450
I didn't.

104
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,470
You're a fool.

105
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,950
If you don't like her, you'd say so.

106
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,150
You said the moon was round tonight.

107
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,230
I must be right.

108
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,910
Don't tell anyone.

109
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,270
I do like her,

110
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,100
but the state affairs are not over yet.

111
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,150
I'm not going to be concerned with romance.

112
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
I was right, indeed.

113
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,340
Second Brother, you win.

114
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,490
Not only is she a princess,

115
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,530
but she's also the enemy princess.

116
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,070
But I'm not going to tell her.

117
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,070
You can't control love.

118
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,400
You love each other, but there are obstacles.

119
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,810
I'm afraid it's our fate.

120
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,430
We are useless and cowardly jerks.

121
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,590
So what?

122
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,680
Second Brother,

123
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,480
can you stop being so depressed?

124
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,310
Now Princess Ka Dan is in a foreign land.

125
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,390
Maybe your existence

126
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,250
is a kind of comfort for her.

127
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,350
If you dare, I'll help you elope.

128
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,780
Think about yourself instead.

129
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,400
Aren't you in love with a princess too?

130
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,430
And an angry princess, too!

131
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,570
Have you figured out how to make her happy again?

132
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,230
Brother Xiu?

133
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,130
Today is a special day.

134
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,990
This is my gift to you.

135
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,240
Did you remember my birthday wrong again?

136
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,150
When I wasn't in the Imperial Capital,

137
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,490
there were many occasions worth celebrating,

138
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,550
but I could only keep them in my heart.

139
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,910
Now, I want to make up for those regrets.

140
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,820
I remember one year, on your birthday,

141
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,830
you wore a formal dress for the first time.

142
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,270
You were so beautiful.

143
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,750
I hope this gift

144
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,310
can commemorate

145
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,030
that unforgettable moment in my life.

146
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,790
Thank you.

147
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,020
There's another thing worth remembering.

148
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,070
The first time I got hurt,

149
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,490
you bandaged my wound.

150
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,070
I owe you an apology.

151
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,200
I hope this gift

152
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,670
can commemorate

153
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,110
that unforgettable moment in my life.

154
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,150
Is there anything else worth remembering?

155
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,770
Stop smiling. Tell me.

156
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,750
Fifteen years ago, you were about to be three.

157
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,360
Do you remember the last time you wet your bed?

158
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,110
Do you remember this?

159
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,160
Go ahead.

160
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,120
Thirteen years ago…

161
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,150
Do you want to apologize?

162
00:10:59,310 --> 00:10:59,710
Yes.

163
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,870
It's simple. Can you perform

164
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,110
the duet with me today as you promised?

165
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,750
Yes.

166
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,020
It was so beautiful, My Lady.

167
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,310
This tune only belongs to heaven.

168
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,980
The mortals cannot hear it often.

169
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,470
Great, Brother Xiu!

170
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,230
We finally performed the duet!

171
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,280
To be honest, this is the most satisfying one.

172
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,710
As long as you're happy…

173
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,550
I'm happy.

174
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,590
I'm very happy.

175
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,870
I've made up my mind.

176
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,740
I want to perform it again

177
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,430
in front of all the officials

178
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,070
at my birthday banquet.

179
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,670
Ning, I don't think so.

180
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,360
Yes, My Lady. Why don't you reconsider it?

181
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,430
Reconsider it.

182
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,990
Have you read the battle report?

183
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,430
Yes.

184
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,880
We all think that Lord Di Lin is in a pickle.

185
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,680
He is all alone and has no backup.

186
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,060
Formidable enemies are blocking the way ahead, so he can't move forward.

187
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,860
Teach them.

188
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,440
I can't. They are not like me.

189
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,600
Let me tell you.

190
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,910
Di Lin has the upper hand.

191
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,500
My Lord, all troops are ready.

192
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,900
Give out my order. Attack.

193
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,190
If Di Lin keeps doing that,

194
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,720
how are we going to clean up the mess he causes?

195
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,970
The peace talk is impossible.

196
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,850
The North Clan can throw its full weight to fight back anytime.

197
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,010
We need to prepare in advance.

198
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,310
Especially you, the Border Appeasement Army and the Black Banner Army,

199
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,640
you need to be ready for backup at any time.

200
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,750
I didn't expect that Fang Jing and I would receive such news

201
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,870
[Ming Hui]

202
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,270
just after we returned to the Imperial Capital.

203
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,350
My Border Appeasement Army is far from Yuanzhou.

204
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,790
Besides, I have to watch the Liufeng Family

205
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,670
and beware of them taking the opportunity to attack.

206
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,190
The backup thing would have to depend on Commander Fang.

207
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,430
Protecting our country is the duty of the Black Banner Army.

208
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,790
[Fang Jing]

209
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,550
No matter where the battlefield is,

210
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,010
we won't abandon our duty.

211
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,230
It's just that Di Lin slaughtered the city for a moment of delight.

212
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,430
Who dares surrender to us in the future?

213
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,020
Now, we can only fight to the end.

214
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,070
When our Black Banner Army reaches the battlefield in Yuanzhou,

215
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,750
not only will we fight the North Clan,

216
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,270
but we'll also have to guard against the people of all tribes in Yuanzhou.

217
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,450
What he did

218
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,150
was too reckless.

219
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,730
He attacked the city without any room for leniency.

220
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,520
He has indeed lost the people's support.

221
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm afraid my family won't be able to

222
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,750
keep a foothold in Yuanzhou in the future.

223
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,400
What's there to be scared of?

224
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,470
Lord Canxing

225
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,670
is afraid of losing

226
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,460
the support of the people in Yuanzhou.

227
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,260
But we don't need their support.

228
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,670
The reason we can occupy Yuanzhou

229
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,910
comes down to

230
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,920
our swords.

231
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,010
As far as "support" is concerned,

232
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,240
they'll only support people with swords.

233
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,220
What do you think, Lord Canxing?

234
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,860
Yes. Yes, you're right.

235
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,670
Lord Yang, won't you leave a way out for Zichuan?

236
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,140
Zichuan's strength is the best way out.

237
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,950
Lord Canxing,

238
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,410
a field commander must decide even against the king's orders.

239
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,870
We can't control much

240
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,130
of what Di Lin is doing,

241
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,760
I think we might as well deal with the essential matters.

242
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,240
Yes.

243
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,270
What else do you want to report, everyone?

244
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,370
My Lord, Princess Ning's birthday is coming.

245
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,430
I think we should prepare for it immediately.

246
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,950
Big deal. That is the big deal.

247
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,960
The momentum of the North Clan has been suppressed by Di Lin.

248
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,349
Why don't we call him back to celebrate the princess's birthday?

249
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,480
Okay.

250
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,310
Okay.

251
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,510
Good idea.

252
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,079
Very good.

253
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,450
Here.

254
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,210
Now that we've had three cups of liquor.

255
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,790
You can be frank, My Lord.

256
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,180
You suddenly invited us to dinner.

257
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,580
I guess you have something to tell us.

258
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,830
I just want to catch up.

259
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,170
Yes.

260
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,480
Thank you for your kindness, Lord Yang.

261
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,150
It's best that you just want to catch up.

262
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,480
After all, Ming Hui and I both lead armies.

263
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,000
We can't afford to be accused of befriending powerful officials.

264
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,800
Lord Fang, you'd hurt our feelings

265
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,790
by saying that.

266
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,210
We are colleagues.

267
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,080
We should be united.

268
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,560
If we are united for Zichuan,

269
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,420
I'll surely do my best.

270
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,430
Lord Fang, did you mean

271
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,700
that I didn't do it for Zichuan?

272
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,640
A country governed by a young monarch is unstable…

273
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,100
Since we're all for Zichuan, that's enough.

274
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,690
Lord Yang, a toast to you.

275
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,730
My Lord, do you think you're doing this for Zichuan

276
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,800
or the Zichuan family?

277
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,690
Lord Luo, you must be drunk.

278
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,510
Why don't Commander Fang and I take the…

279
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,750
Lord Luo,

280
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm afraid I can't agree with you.

281
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,430
Lord Fang, listen to me.

282
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,000
All these years,

283
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,210
you've been asking Lord Chieftain

284
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,140
for more provisions and funds for the troops.

285
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,870
You said the soldiers were poor

286
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,120
and needed more provisions.

287
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,660
That's right.

288
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,130
The southwest officers and soldiers all thank you for your kindness, Lord Commander-in-Chief.

289
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,370
The funds were approved smoothly.

290
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,410
Don't you think they were done too smoothly?

291
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,340
The treasury has been empty these years.

292
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,530
The military expenditure has been limited.

293
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,300
But only the Border Appeasement Army and the Black Banner Army

294
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
got all their provisions and funds.

295
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,460
Do you know

296
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,190
that Lord Yang took money out of his private vault

297
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,630
to provide you with subsidies?

298
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,310
Do you think Lord Yang did this

299
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,600
for Zichuan or the Zichuan family?

300
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,060
Why did you bring that up? We are for the same cause.

301
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,350
Please be frank.

302
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,270
If the top leader in the Imperial Capital changes one day,

303
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,950
for the sake of Zichuan,

304
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,740
can you two stay put?

305
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,990
My Lord, you are indeed ambitious.

306
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,230
I can't help you.

307
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,790
I can't do anything else, either.

308
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,510
Good.

309
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,610
Lord Ming, let's drink this up.

310
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,790
Please.

311
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,670
Here.

312
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,970
Lord Fang, can we drink this?

313
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,300
I didn't know

314
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,390
Lord Yang provided for the subsidies.

315
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,940
However, I will never do anything wrong

316
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,770
to Zichuan and the family.

317
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,900
I will confess this to Lord Chieftain.

318
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,190
Lord Fang is full.

319
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,750
You can send him back.

320
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,720
I'll have a few more drinks with Lord Ming Hui.

321
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,870
Okay.

322
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,250
Lord Fang.

323
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,710
Lord Fang.

324
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,560
Here.

325
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,330
Let me fill it up for you.

326
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,400
Lord Fang, please wait.

327
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,030
Have you really thought it through?

328
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,330
Please tell Lord Yang

329
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,980
that the Black Banner Army has a spine.

330
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,840
We won't be indebted to Lord Yang.

331
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,830
We will repay all the provisions we received,

332
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,400
but if anything happens here in the Imperial Capital,

333
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,880
I won't turn a blind eye to it.

334
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,060
Lord Fang, it's easy to repay the money,

335
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,490
but hard to repay the kindness.

336
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,510
What do you mean?

337
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,270
Let's talk in private.

338
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,110
Come here.

339
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,470
Here.

340
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,270
I heard that you have a gifted daughter.

341
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,940
With martial arts you've taught her, she's brave and heroic.

342
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,310
She can really carry on your Fang family.

343
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,050
But your daughter always likes to fight injustice.

344
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,420
One time, in order to punish some idle men,

345
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,090
she accidentally killed one.

346
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,400
Do you know who paid to support

347
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,790
the mother of that man?

348
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,270
You…

349
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,990
Lord Fang,

350
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,950
even if your daughter is spared the death penalty,

351
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,430
she'll still be sentenced to jail.

352
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,570
Lord Yang just wants you to stay put.

353
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,870
Can Lord Yang guarantee

354
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,100
the safety of Lord Canxing and Princess Ning?

355
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,310
Fang,

356
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:48,630
I advise you to protect your family first.

357
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,620
I'll rush back to the Black Banner Army tomorrow

358
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,550
and not enter the Imperial Capital.

359
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,410
Now, the North Clan is in high spirits for a counterattack.

360
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,960
Liuyang, Jiasha, Xiluo, and Wuyan,

361
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,570
these provinces are all severely attacked.

362
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,290
The four of you guard one place each.

363
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,340
You only need to guard the city.

364
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,480
No need to attack.

365
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,050
Understand?

366
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,990
Yes.

367
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,860
I don't understand.

368
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
Why?

369
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,890
Why do we have to clean up

370
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,990
[Lei Hong]

371
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,710
the mess Di Lin caused?

372
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,810
He's enjoying killing at the front.

373
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,410
He slaughtered the cities as he wanted.

374
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,790
He pissed the North Clan off,

375
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,990
and now, they came to seek revenge on us.

376
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,860
Lei Hong, what do you mean?

377
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,630
[Lin Bing]

378
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,370
I don't mean anything.

379
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,140
I can also fight a war.

380
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,140
As long as you allow me to attack,

381
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,360
I'll take my 20,000 men

382
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,700
to take down four cities immediately.

383
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,690
What kind of tactics did Di Lin use?

384
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,270
Anyone who doesn't surrender

385
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,590
will be executed, no matter whether they're soldiers or civilians.

386
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,010
Then, he uses the surrendered troops of the North Clan as the vanguard.

387
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,600
Then, he repeats the process.

388
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,530
That's how he expanded the army of 50,000 to 200,000.

389
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,510
Why? Do you want to follow his example?

390
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,730
I don't care what tactics he used.

391
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,770
It's better than being a coward.

392
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,510
Lei Hong,

393
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,100
if you want to fight, you can do it alone.

394
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,050
Then, you'd no longer be the Deputy Commander of the Yuanzhou Army.

395
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:43,950
My Lord.

396
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,260
Yuanzhou has been through a hundred years of bloodshed.

397
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,350
In fact, if we want to negotiate,

398
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,870
we can negotiate.

399
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,340
Now, outside, the North Clan is pressing us at the border,

400
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,600
and inside, Di Lin is eyeing us hungrily.

401
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,530
I would like to ask you, My Lord.

402
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,620
Are we waiting for Di Lin to expand his army to a million

403
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,170
and make himself a king in Yuanzhou?

404
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,020
The soldiers in Yuanzhou and I

405
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,980
have followed you for decades.

406
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,610
The suits of armor reflect the moonlight.

407
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,790
The smiling faces are exposed to the cold rain.

408
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,650
The soldiers looked at their hometown

409
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,740
and their eyes were bleeding with longing.

410
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,750
My Lord, if you keep enduring like this,

411
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,410
there is no place for us to stand

412
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,270
not only in Yuanzhou,

413
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,870
but also

414
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,120
in the whole of Zichuan.

415
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,150
My Lord,

416
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
please think twice.

417
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,710
Lin Bing.

418
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,950
My Lord.

419
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,680
Where did Luo Bo go?

420
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,170
Please forgive me.

421
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,890
He told me not to tell you.

422
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,160
He said you would stop him from looking for Di Lin.

423
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,270
Most of Di Lin's 50,000 soldiers

424
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,150
were trained by him.

425
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,230
You go first. Guarding the city is more important.

426
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,870
Yes.

427
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,910
Di Lin is trying to mess up the situation in Yuanzhou

428
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,240
and trap you here

429
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,800
so that you can't do anything else.

430
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:55,590
I knew Di Lin was a double-edged sword,

431
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,070
but I didn't expect that

432
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,390
he was so decisive and sharp.

433
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,990
I underestimated his schemes.

434
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,020
If Yang Minghua takes this opportunity to rebel,

435
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,150
what should we do

436
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,300
without any backup?

437
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,950
Master Zuo Jiaming is the top master of the Xichuan Continent.

438
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,310
With his ability,

439
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,290
he can definitely

440
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,230
protect Lord Canxing and Princess Ning.

441
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Will he save Zichuan?

442
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,880
I'll invite him myself.

443
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,460
My Lord, have some porridge.

444
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,720
Where's Di Lin?

445
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,930
Deputy Commander Luo Bo, you have such a short temper.

446
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,430
There were 50,000 soldiers.

447
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,440
Now, there are only 20,000 of them after your massacre.

448
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,510
As soldiers,

449
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,580
it's their honor to die on the battlefield.

450
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,760
It is their honor to die on the battlefield,

451
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,690
but it's a shame to be killed by you.

452
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,790
I killed them according to the military law.

453
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,910
Those who disobey orders will be executed.

454
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,860
Those who don't kill enough enemies will be executed.

455
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,630
Those who fall behind in a charge will be executed.

456
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,430
What military order? Nonsense!

457
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,950
It's my order.

458
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,840
With these orders, I took ten cities in a row.

459
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,570
What about you?

460
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,860
You kept attacking the North Clan.

461
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,690
That's why the war in Yuanzhou cannot end.

462
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,120
What are you up to?

463
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,560
I want them to be too powerless to fight any longer, of course.

464
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,020
My Lord, the newly surrendered captives

465
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,000
are willing to join our army.

466
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,430
Okay.

467
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,650
Kill the one who surrendered last.

468
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,630
Yes.

469
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,460
He's already surrendered.

470
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,990
Why do you still kill him?

471
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,900
Deputy Commander Luo Bo,

472
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,980
the provisions are limited in the army.

473
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,600
You wasted one person's food,

474
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,690
so I have no choice but to kill him.

475
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,950
Otherwise,

476
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,790
the one starved to death will be one of the Yuanzhou soldiers that you care so much about.

477
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,070
He dies because of you.

478
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,750
If you want to stay here,

479
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,070
more people will die because of you.

480
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,390
You are a complete jerk!

481
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,330
My Lord, an emergency military order. They summon you back to the Imperial Capital.

482
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,360
My Lord.

483
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,370
Di Lin gained a lot

484
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,720
on this trip to Yuanzhou.

485
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
He will arrive in the Imperial Capital soon.

486
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,560
This is the arhat pine sent by the Governor of Xincheng Province.

487
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,340
What do you think of it?

488
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,870
It flourishes and has luxuriant foliage.

489
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,120
Congratulations, My Lord.

490
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,270
Gardening is a delicate task. You need to be calm.

491
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,480
Before the great cause,

492
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,010
if we can get Zichuan Xiu and Si Yilin dealt with,

493
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,220
you can rest more assured.

494
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,520
It's just that Zichuan Xiu is a rogue.

495
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,000
If we can't hit him in one shot,

496
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,970
he may bite back.

497
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,310
You have to hit where it hurts most.

498
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,790
Zichuan Xiu's soft spot is Lord Ge.

499
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,130
So, don't worry.

500
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,180
If Zichuan Xiu finds out

501
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,390
Lei Hong is by Lord Ge's side,

502
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,770
he will panic.

503
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,980
We can see the world compacted in a small space.

504
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,790
This bonsai is already very beautiful.

505
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:07,650
In the small space, you can see yourself.

506
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,270
It's indeed beautiful,

507
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,160
but I don't like it.

508
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,780
It looks better this way.

509
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,870
I see.

510
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,530
Your identity is special.

511
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,930
The identity of our boss is more special.

512
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,390
That's all I can do for you.

513
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,000
The rest is up to you.

514
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,250
You really helped me a lot this time.

515
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,460
I'll introduce you to more clients in the future.

516
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,380
What should I call you then?

517
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,270
I'm the third among my brothers.

518
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,680
I'll call you Third Master, then.

519
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,410
Okay.

520
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,830
Oh?

521
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,600
Lord Xiao.

522
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,520
Looks like I'm really lucky today.

523
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,100
I didn't expect to see you here, Lord Xiao.

524
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,670
Since you're here,

525
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
come and try Liu's skills, will you?

526
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,880
Hello, My Lord.

527
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,490
I've never tried

528
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,160
such delicate stuff.

529
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,040
Fine, I'll have a try.

530
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,489
Aren't you afraid

531
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,570
you'd die here today?

532
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,469
Lord Xiao, if you want to kill me,

533
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,760
I may not have been able to see you alive today.

534
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,429
Come on.

535
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,280
You're quite scheming, too.

536
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,969
You've caused a lot of trouble for Lord Yang recently.

537
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,710
You also found my spies.

538
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,710
I was just lucky.

539
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,429
You went through so much trouble.

540
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,170
I don't think you did it for a reason as simple as you want to see me.

541
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,469
Of course not.

542
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,920
I want to know if Yang Minghua is behind you.

543
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,810
You two tricked me together.

544
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,880
The thing is still fresh in my memory.

545
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,190
You all think I work for Yang Minghua.

546
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,530
Actually, we just work together.

547
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,610
It's business.

548
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,300
As long as the price is right,

549
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,090
I will treat everyone fairly.

550
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,520
The reason my spies exist

551
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,830
is because I'm fair.

552
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,290
It's the same for managing the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

553
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,620
Fair?

554
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,370
Do you have another menu

555
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,350
with the prices clearly marked?

556
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,130
We don't talk about money.

557
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,520
You just need to share with me the information of the same value.

558
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,230
You're willing to see me,

559
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,470
which means I'm still useful.

560
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,470
Let's start doing business now.

561
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,400
Lord Xiu, what do you want to know?

562
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,080
I want to know

563
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,960
if Yang Minghua controls the Three Central Offices.

564
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,480
Young man, you have sharp eyes.

565
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,760
No wonder they all say you're a young hero

566
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,650
and you can't be underestimated.

567
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,850
The members of the Three Central Offices

568
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,770
are all from the noble families in Zichuan.

569
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,250
At critical moments, every vote from these 30 people

570
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,590
can decide the political prospects of Zichuan.

571
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,590
Lord Xiu, this is big news.

572
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,150
You have to exchange it with valuable information.

573
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,460
How about the news about the Chieftain's Mansion?

574
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,200
You are sincere.

575
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,190
I can tell you that

576
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:08,030
more than half of the Three Central Offices support Yang Minghua.

577
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,080
Lord Xiu,

578
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,590
what's the news about the Chieftain's Mansion?

579
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,740
Princess Ning in the Chieftain's Mansion

580
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,430
likes me.

581
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,170
Are you fooling me?

582
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,210
Do you know what is the smallest bone in the human body?

583
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,900
It's the ossicle.

584
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,810
The ossicles of the people who lied to me

585
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,770
have been removed

586
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,960
and made into a wind chime.

587
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,230
I was not lying,

588
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,000
because this piece of news

589
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,440
is to do with Zichuan's future.

590
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,410
That makes sense.

591
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,940
But this piece of news is not worth it.

592
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,940
Unless… you answer me one more question.

593
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,080
Go ahead.

594
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,390
Do you

595
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,470
like Zichuan Ning?

596
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,700
Are you fooling me too?

597
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,060
I'm not lying, either.

598
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,320
This is to do with

599
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,210
which side you'll be on in the future.

600
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,560
I didn't expect it to be Xiao Long.

601
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,240
He comes from a wealthy family.

602
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,020
And the spies of the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs are everywhere.

603
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,420
This is also expected.

604
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,070
The Imperial Capital

605
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,190
seems calm on the surface.

606
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,240
However, violence is brewing beneath it.

607
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,350
There's always a way.

608
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,920
I won't be afraid of anyone.

609
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,390
Do you know what the biggest trouble

610
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,120
is now?

611
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,450
It's a woman's birthday.

612
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,880
I've decided on

613
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,150
Ning's birthday present.

614
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,160
As the saying goes, teaching one to fish is better than giving him fish.

615
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,750
I want to give Ning her dignity.

616
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,720
Brother Xiu, do I really need to learn guqin?

617
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,170
I've already played it so well.

618
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,220
I'm just asking you to make it even better.

619
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,580
Your birthday banquet is in a couple of days.

620
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,150
Learn some performing skills

621
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,850
and amaze those old men by then.

622
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,250
You're right.

623
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,440
But I'm afraid my performance skills

624
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,390
have no room to improve already.

625
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,350
Trust yourself.

626
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,230
Let me introduce you two.

627
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,530
Student.

628
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,110
Teacher.

629
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,810
I heard from Third Master

630
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,110
you can play the guqin already.

631
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,040
Let's take today as a chance to learn from each other.

632
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,190
Teacher, my guqin

633
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,250
is made from the fir in the cold areas.

634
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,640
It has an excellent timbre.

635
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Please pardon my competitiveness.

636
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,390
Stop.

637
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,430
What's wrong, Teacher?

638
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,390
Don't you think

639
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,070
there was something wrong with your performance?

640
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,660
No.

641
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,770
The pitch was not accurate.

642
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,070
No way.

643
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,180
I'm most familiar with this song.

644
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,940
Third Master, was the pitch accurate?

645
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,210
Was it not accurate?

646
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,420
Yes, it was very accurate.

647
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,160
Let me tell you.

648
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,390
You must be paid extra money for this.

649
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,110
500 taels of gold per class.

650
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,310
It is already a high price.

651
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,300
And she's not starting from knowing nothing.

652
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,420
Yes, but she has negative knowledge.

653
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,820
Actually, I asked you to teach her

654
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,150
to cope with

655
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,750
a performance later.

656
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,830
How about this?

657
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,060
You tamper with her guqin

658
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,610
and by then, you can play it at the same time.

659
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,760
Then she can play whatever she wants.

660
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,070
Just get it over with.

661
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,030
No way.

662
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,000
That is an insult to art.

663
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,620
Mingyue,

664
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,390
your respect for art

665
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,390
really impressed me.

666
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,430
This is respect for money.

667
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,370
This is my self-request as the head performer in Chunfeng Garden.

668
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,900
Zichuan's food is very different from that of the North Clan.

669
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,390
Princess Ning is afraid that you're not used to it,

670
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,430
so she prepared these cooking utensils.

671
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,070
You can make some desserts

672
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,160
to relieve your homesickness.

673
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,390
Thank you.

674
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,740
Dream in the Clouds!

675
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,590
This is a unique spice of our North Clan.

676
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,580
It must be hard to find it in the Imperial Capital, right?

677
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,790
I found it at a grocery store.

678
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,050
The owner of the grocery store

679
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,980
often deals with Orcs in Yuanzhou.

680
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,050
That's why he has something from the North Clan.

681
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,250
Dream in the Clouds

682
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,510
is an essential spice for making desserts.

683
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,970
Without it, the desserts will be tasteless.

684
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:25,310
That's all I can do for you.

685
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,950
You're a princess.

686
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,280
If you don't mind,

687
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,110
you can teach me how to make it.

688
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,520
I will do it for you.

689
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,350
My Lord, you've been taking good care of me during this time.

690
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:43,130
And I can't be called a princess anymore.

691
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,400
My Lady, how about I play a song for you?

692
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,980
What do you think?

693
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,250
I'll tell you the truth then.

694
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,720
Your fingering is quite skillful,

695
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:35,170
but the sound of the guqin…

696
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,980
is unpleasant to the ears.

697
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,380
But I played it like you did.

698
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,890
Really?

699
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,390
Don't cry.

700
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,220
It turns out that I don't play well.

701
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,230
It was nice.

702
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,510
But I couldn't tell

703
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,890
I was not good at playing the guqin.

704
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,380
It's okay. I could tell.

705
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,050
You all lied to me.

706
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,820
Ning,

707
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:16,470
in my mind, you're the best at playing the guqin.

708
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,270
You're lying.

709
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:18,820
You're lying.

710
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,150
Then, don't learn it.

711
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,510
Don't play at the banquet, either.

712
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,370
I want to learn.

713
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,130
I want to learn.

714
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,790
Learning guqin is hard work.

715
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,320
I'm not afraid of hard work.

716
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,210
I'm the princess of Zichuan.

717
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,500
I'm also the heir to Zichuan.

718
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,950
There are so many people at my birthday banquet.

719
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,930
It'll be embarrassing if I don't learn.
