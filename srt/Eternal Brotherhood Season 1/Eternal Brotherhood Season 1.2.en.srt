[Eternal Brotherhood 1]

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,820
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,570
My Lord, sorry to disturb you.

5
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,670
Looks like we were used by Yang Minghua.

6
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,040
We made so much effort to make the people think

7
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,430
the victory at Hengchuan was something to celebrate.

8
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,590
Yet he used the public's attention

9
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,320
to take Xiu to court.

10
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,560
That was a risky move.

11
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,900
Even if Luo Minghai testifies it himself,

12
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,190
he won't have any guarantee of success in the court trial.

13
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,829
Besides,

14
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,170
he has another unpredictable variable.

15
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,250
Minister of Military and Legal Affairs, Xiao Long.

16
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,050
If we say Ge Yingxing has the army's loyalty,

17
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,810
Xiao Long has won the people's support.

18
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,270
I didn't expect that under the circumstances,

19
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,079
Yang Minghua would hand this matter to Xiao Long.

20
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,690
I'm afraid Yang Minghua has a backup plan.

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,360
My Lord,

22
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,180
what backup plan can Yang Minghua have?

23
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,190
I don't know yet.

24
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,510
But if you hear anything from the prison,

25
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,550
let me know anytime.

26
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,950
Yes.

27
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,950
What's wrong?

28
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,010
[Ge Qing]

29
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,750
I just think

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,180
you always go that far to go to the toilet.

31
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,270
How can you bear it…

32
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,480
That's not what I meant.

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,740
You are in good health.

34
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,820
My Lord, the result is certain.

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,880
However, Zichuan Xiu is so eloquent.

36
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,829
There will be many people watching in the court.

37
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,470
That rascal won't really succeed in defending himself, will he?

38
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,950
Why allow him to talk?

39
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,780
That's also what Di Lin wants.

40
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,990
We don't need him to do this. You go and arrange it.

41
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,080
Yes.

42
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,630
Lord Canxing instructed us

43
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,360
to take the prisoner, Zichuan Xiu, to the Chieftain's Mansion now!

44
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,220
Hurry!

45
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,550
Hurry up.

46
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,600
What are you looking at?

47
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,320
Lord Chieftain is waiting.

48
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,510
The masters of the Ministry of War

49
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,620
condescendingly pretend to be prison guards.

50
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,020
You've suffered wrongs.

51
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,070
You didn't even remove the Ministry of War logos from your boots.

52
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,330
Everyone can see that.

53
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,170
Besides, the Chieftain's Mansion is in the east,

54
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,770
but we've been heading west.

55
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,710
We're going to

56
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,770
the graveyard Commander Yang picked for me, aren't we?

57
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
It hurts.

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,210
You go first. Leave this to me.

59
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,990
Take it as my medical fee.

60
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,010
If you want to live, do as I say.

61
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,030
Tell the groom to go along Qiuxi Road

62
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,300
and leave the city through Mingyue Temple Path.

63
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,440
We haven't met for so long, yet you're still so naughty.

64
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,520
Brother Xiu, you haven't been home for so long

65
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,190
that you don't even know the way?

66
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,630
There are guards of the Ministry of War on Qiuxi Road.

67
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,960
Are you going there to greet Yang Minghua?

68
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,170
Go north along the path by the river.

69
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,450
Go to Qingfeng Villa.

70
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,070
Yes.

71
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,630
Be gentle.

72
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,660
Be gentle.

73
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,970
-What's wrong?
-It hurts.

74
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,840
You're hurt?

75
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,990
-Where? Let me see.
-No, nothing serious.

76
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,830
Don't...

77
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,310
Why are you dressed like that?

78
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,830
What is that?

79
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,400
It's so ugly.

80
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,490
You've seen my ugliest look.

81
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,320
You have to be responsible for me.

82
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,230
You're hurt?

83
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,770
Let me see.

84
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,920
Brother Xiu, it's been seven years since we last met.

85
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,180
You've gained weight.

86
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,730
What have you been doing these seven years?

87
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,000
The first rule of Marching Instructions is

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,860
those who leave the Imperial Capital for a long trip

89
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,440
should bring gifts for their old friends when they are back.

90
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,410
Where's the gift?

91
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,610
It hurts.

92
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,360
I haven't touched you yet.

93
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,720
Really?

94
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,120
Don't change the subject.

95
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,590
Where's the gift?

96
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,929
It's fine if you don't have any. Then get ready

97
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,870
and marry me as a gift.

98
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,429
Gift?

99
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,430
Gift!

100
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,480
I bought you this with all my fortune.

101
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,570
Yuanzhou Fantastic Moonlight Stone.

102
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,270
Rub this stone with your hands

103
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,780
day and night.

104
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,340
It will become transparent and bright.

105
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,240
It'll be as bright as the Moon and as glittering as jade.

106
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,700
Not only can it exorcise evil spirits,

107
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,740
but it also is good for your skin and body.

108
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Is it also good for the skin and body?

109
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,790
Of course it's fake.

110
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,440
I picked it up casually.

111
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,510
But since it can make you happy,

112
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,070
my gift is not a total failure.

113
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,790
It is indeed fake.

114
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,040
I don't care.

115
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,980
You said you would give it to me.

116
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,690
Then it is a moonlight stone.

117
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,460
[Lin Xiujia]

118
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,450
Sister-in-law? Long time no see!

119
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,970
I remember you need the password to enter the secret room.

120
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,040
I think I forgot it.

121
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,590
Seems that I need to kiss you.

122
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,700
What happened?

123
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Did you tease Sister-in-law again?

124
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,700
Let's get down to business.

125
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,500
Now Yang Minghua wants him dead.

126
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,960
Anyone who stands out will die with him.

127
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,560
Si Yilin and I have prepared the traveling expenses for you.

128
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,270
Get lost.

129
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,470
I can't.

130
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,080
If I run away, it'll be like I want to escape punishment.

131
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,930
If I can't be blamed,

132
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,150
the blame will be on Lord Ge Yingxing.

133
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,890
I think you can get lost.

134
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,470
Yang Minghua and Lord Ge

135
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,970
have been enemies for so long,

136
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,830
but there's no result about who's better.

137
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,890
If you get lost now,

138
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,660
Lord Ge can handle it.

139
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,830
Second Brother,

140
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,760
do you remember what you said to me?

141
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,440
The honor of a soldier is more important than his life.

142
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,480
All these years,

143
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,000
you fought against Yang Minghua with all your heart.

144
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,470
Now you teach me to escape punishment?

145
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,620
Okay, how about this?

146
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,760
You stay.

147
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,840
I've been sleeping with the wolf these seven years.

148
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,870
I won't stand it anymore for your sake.

149
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,080
The three of us can hold our knives

150
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,870
and go straight to the Ministry of War to assassinate him.

151
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,870
At worst, we'll sacrifice bravely.

152
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,840
At that time, when the army is deployed in front of the Chieftain's Mansion

153
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,110
and Lord Chieftain is forced to abdicate,

154
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,710
he will thank the three of us.

155
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,830
I can't just go anyway.

156
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,510
You really can.

157
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,850
And you have to.

158
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,360
I really...

159
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,350
Here, Xiu.

160
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,470
Have some tea.

161
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,790
Sister-in-law is the best.

162
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,510
Thank you.

163
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,740
I can't stand you keep talking about "getting lost."

164
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,400
You three are all so hesitant.

165
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,180
Xiu, look at me.

166
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,560
Three.

167
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,360
Two.

168
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,530
One.

169
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,070
I have sent people to set up more checkpoints both inside and outside the Imperial Capital

170
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,150
to inspect and search the city

171
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,590
strictly and thoroughly.

172
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,650
Within three days,

173
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,840
we'll definitely get Zichuan Xiu…

174
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,730
The trial is tomorrow,

175
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,770
not three days later.

176
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,430
You may leave.

177
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,990
Yes.

178
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,390
Go pick some handy weapons.

179
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,640
Take care.

180
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,190
Tieshou has never missed anyone he's determined to arrest.

181
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,520
He can defeat hundreds of elite soldiers.

182
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,570
If he does it,

183
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,230
Zichuan Xiu will die within one day.

184
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,240
[Xiao Long]

185
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,490
The wrongs our family suffered

186
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,390
were only redressed thanks to your impartiality, Lord Xiao.

187
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,680
How could I take your money?

188
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,670
I haven't paid you the previous two times.

189
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,310
Today, I ate half a can of your nuts.

190
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,510
That's the right amount.

191
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,530
If you don't accept it,

192
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,360
I dare not come again.

193
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,290
I'll make you some good tea.

194
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,350
Lord Xiao, you're a clean-fingered official.

195
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,780
No wonder you're so favored by the people.

196
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,940
It was all thanks to your favor, Commander Yang.

197
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,040
As for the Zichuan Xiu case,

198
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,150
according to the military order from the Yuanzhou Army,

199
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,870
the regional station troops should all be transferred to the border of Zichuan

200
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,670
and several critical passes to defend against the enemy.

201
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,410
In the battle of Hengchuan, he deployed the troops without permission.

202
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,990
A field commander must decide even against orders from above.

203
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,720
Among these 10,000 prisoners of war,

204
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,050
there is Princess Ka Dan of the North Clan.

205
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,610
But he didn't report it.

206
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,860
Counting the prisoners of war and reporting them one by one

207
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,460
are the duty of other people.

208
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,310
This is not really a crime.

209
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,310
I understand.

210
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,050
Everyone will be watching the trial.

211
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,340
Naturally, we should convince people by reasoning.

212
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,540
We must have both the testimony of the witnesses and the material evidence.

213
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,000
He is a young hero.

214
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,970
We can't falsely accuse him.

215
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,090
Don't worry, Commander Yang.

216
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,190
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs is impartial.

217
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,470
There is no injustice under my command.

218
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,150
My Lord, we've found the target.

219
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,810
He's six feet tall and has an attractive appearance.

220
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,870
His face is like a sculpture, with a florid complexion.

221
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,470
What a pity.

222
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,940
The Flower of Yuanzhou is going to wither.

223
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,340
The victory at Hengchuan brings joy to the country.

224
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,340
The Ministry of War should have rewarded every one according to their merits.

225
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,150
But when we were checking Yuanzhou Captain Zichuan Xiu's

226
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,160
seven-year records of military affairs,

227
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,420
we found that he behaved in a perverse way

228
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,890
and did countless shameless things.

229
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,130
He even seemed to have sought victory by collaborating with the enemy.

230
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,950
Zichuan Xiu knew that he had failed the family's trust.

231
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,080
He committed suicide by taking poison last night.

232
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,850
His face festered and swelled

233
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,980
due to severe poison.

234
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,950
How can you prove he is Zichuan Xiu?

235
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,260
Lord Xiao, please summon the witness.

236
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:55,800
Send him in.

237
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,140
Kneel!

238
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,190
My Lords,

239
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,260
I'm the guard guarding Zichuan Xiu.

240
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,630
I didn't expect him to escape with a guilty conscience.

241
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,690
The wound on my body

242
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,740
was left at the time when I was chasing him.

243
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,550
Zichuan Xiu realized that he couldn't escape whatsoever,

244
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,700
so he admitted he had colluded with the enemy to win,

245
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,359
and then he committed suicide by taking poison.

246
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,470
Next witness.

247
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,650
How could there be a next witness?

248
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,100
Couldn't you kill him?

249
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,670
I followed him to the valley.

250
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,500
After entering the mountain area, he disappeared after a bend.

251
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,250
Then, I was attacked

252
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,770
by someone from above.

253
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,310
The knife came so fast, and the attack was so cruel

254
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,960
that there was no chance to fight back.

255
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,720
Are you sure that was Zichuan Xiu?

256
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,870
I heard that I had died.

257
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,330
I'm here to mourn over my own death.

258
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,510
What's with this body?

259
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,590
Lord Luo,

260
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,220
if you want to charge me,

261
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,410
just tell me.

262
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,010
Why do you bring charges against a dead man?

263
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,430
But then again, he really looked like me.

264
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,340
Zichuan Xiu.

265
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,590
You should have been in prison to wait for the trial.

266
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,620
Why did you break out of prison?

267
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,750
Break out of prison?

268
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,310
Lord Xiao,

269
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,410
yesterday, several people

270
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,410
took me out of prison,

271
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,320
saying that the Chieftain wanted to bring me to trial.

272
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,600
But they tried to kill me just a few steps out of the prison.

273
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,290
It took me a lot of effort to get away.

274
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,800
I hurried here to ask you to interrogate me.

275
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,310
Zichuan Xiu, don't call white black here.

276
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,510
Weren't those who took you away yesterday your accomplices?

277
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,190
Otherwise,

278
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,950
you wouldn't be standing here.

279
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,110
We couldn't resist them yesterday

280
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,190
and let him get away.

281
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,710
We found a body to replace him to avoid punishment.

282
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,860
Please show mercy, My Lord.

283
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,860
You spoke nonsense before the court.

284
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,750
And you deceived the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs with a fake body.

285
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,400
You should be executed.

286
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,200
Guards, take him away.

287
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,820
Yes!

288
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,670
Please spare my life, My Lord.

289
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,870
Please spare my life!

290
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,690
My Lord, please spare me!

291
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,650
My Lord!

292
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,590
Breaking out of prison is a small matter, but colluding with the enemy is a big deal.

293
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,680
Luo Minghai.

294
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,980
Lord Luo.

295
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,930
Just now, you accused me of breaking out of prison,

296
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,910
and now you are accusing me of colluding with the enemy.

297
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,990
Do you really think

298
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,720
you can wrongfully accuse me like seven years ago?

299
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,970
Listen.

300
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,920
I've grown up.

301
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,420
Zichuan Xiu, this is a trial.

302
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,460
Watch your language and attitude.

303
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,890
Zichuan has strict laws.

304
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,860
The trial is held today,

305
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,380
which means there are sufficient witnesses and evidence

306
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,990
to testify against you.

307
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,240
If you haven't broken the law,

308
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,090
don't worry,

309
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,590
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs will undoubtedly clear your name.

310
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,520
Okay, Lord Luo.

311
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,390
What other charges do I face?

312
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,070
Why don't you tell me all at once?

313
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,280
Lord Xiao,

314
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,480
After being investigated by the Ministry of War

315
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,360
and reviewed by the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs,

316
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,030
Yuanzhou Captain Zichuan Xiu is charged with eight crimes.

317
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,070
Uncle.

318
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,710
Uncle.

319
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,310
Uncle.

320
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,660
Uncle.

321
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,190
Lady Ning.

322
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,390
I want to see my uncle.

323
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,100
Do you know

324
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,130
that before the court,

325
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,230
Yang Minghua instigated Luo Minghai to call white black

326
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,270
and frame the loyal official.

327
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,270
Now, I can only ask my uncle for help.

328
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,970
Your Highness, Chieftain said

329
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,450
the trial will be over in a couple of hours.

330
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,450
He can't change anything.

331
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,690
Please go back, Your Highness.

332
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm not going back.

333
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,240
I'll kneel here

334
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,390
until Uncle comes out to see me.

335
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,750
Chieftain knew you would do this.

336
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,600
He asked me to give this to you.

337
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,770
It's more comfortable to kneel on it.

338
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,890
Goodbye.

339
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,690
Zichuan Xiu.

340
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,510
About the eight crimes that Lord Luo accused you

341
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,110
on behalf of the Ministry of War,

342
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,110
do you have anything to say?

343
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,630
Of course.

344
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
I didn't expect Lord Luo

345
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,550
to memorize these eight crimes so well.

346
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,770
He's eloquent, and the wording is refined.

347
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,590
Lord Luo said it with one breath

348
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,600
without his face turning red or his breath getting ragged.

349
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,410
I think

350
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,610
Lord Luo is still very tough, considering his age.

351
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,740
Zichuan Xiu, when Hengchuan was at war,

352
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,890
you slept in front of the battle, yes or no?

353
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,640
If you hadn't colluded with the enemy

354
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,970
and knew the trends before the war,

355
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,240
how could you sleep?

356
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,520
I was really sleepy.

357
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,920
You captured Princess Ka Dan of the North Clan,

358
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,320
yet you didn't report it.

359
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,200
You used the pretext of coveting Ka Dan's beauty to protect her.

360
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,660
In fact, you wanted to send her away.

361
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,890
All your soldiers and prisoners of war can testify.

362
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,010
Everyone, we are all men.

363
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,000
How can you pretend to be coveting a beauty?

364
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,930
It's…

365
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,270
It's real.

366
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,040
Besides, Lord Luo, if you saw

367
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,430
how beautiful Princess Ka Dan of the North Clan was,

368
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,440
I believe

369
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,940
you would

370
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,000
be like an old dog in heat.

371
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,180
Your love would be rekindled.

372
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,040
Zichuan Xiu!

373
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,150
Do you think this is the place for you to play dirty?

374
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,310
Am I the one who's playing dirty?

375
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,790
30,000 soldiers chased 300,000 enemies.

376
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,910
Seen by anyone,

377
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,390
it would be a loyal act by someone who put one's own life and death aside.

378
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,740
But you said I colluded with the North Clan and put on an act.

379
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,080
The North Clan pretended to attack other critical passes,

380
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,620
but in fact, they raided Hengchuan.

381
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,590
I led troops to fight the enemy

382
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,500
and didn't lose one city of Zichuan.

383
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,560
And yet you said I deliberately disrupted the war situation in Yuanzhou.

384
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,390
Besides, it's freezing in Yuanzhou.

385
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,510
I used gold coins to exchange socks with the North Clan.

386
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,300
But you said

387
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,710
I sent a private message to the North Clan.

388
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,120
Okay, I'll take off my shoes

389
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,390
and show you my socks.

390
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,210
Check them.

391
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,270
Zichuan Xiu!

392
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,170
Zichuan Xiu, you said you were wronged.

393
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,400
Fine, let me ask you.

394
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,380
How did the North Clan lose?

395
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,510
It is said that

396
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,520
the strongest general and the commander-in-chief of the North Clan, Ge Sha,

397
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,110
was killed before he reached Hengchuan.

398
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:46,270
This is the key to the defeat of the North Clan in the Battle of Hengchuan.

399
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,690
Did you kill him?

400
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,880
No.

401
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,110
Of course not!

402
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,480
Because judging from the time,

403
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,440
you were fast asleep in your bed!

404
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,240
Did you know he was dead back then?

405
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,030
If you didn't,

406
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,020
how dare you have ordered to chase the enemy?

407
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Or is he still alive?

408
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,180
Had you colluded long before that?

409
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,630
Who?

410
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,900
Uncle.

411
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,390
The more powerful Yang Minghua is,

412
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,550
the more precious

413
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,460
a loyal general like Brother Xiu will be.

414
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,390
Whether it's for me or for Zichuan,

415
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,220
you must save Brother Xiu.

416
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,260
Ning, to be honest,

417
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,330
I just don't like Zichuan Xiu.

418
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,990
Mainly I don't like

419
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,130
that he didn't teach you any good stuff

420
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,420
but only how to enter through the window or things like that.

421
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,760
Uncle, I was wrong.

422
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,930
I won't enter through the window again.

423
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,970
Please save Brother Xiu.

424
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,310
I beg you.

425
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,440
Ning.

426
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,820
Yang Minghua's current power

427
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,430
is even greater than seven years ago.

428
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,430
It'd be useless even if I went there.

429
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,710
Even if I disturbed the trial,

430
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,480
it would only be delayed a while.

431
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,410
The result would still be the same.

432
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,310
Ning, I'm afraid if you go with your hopes high

433
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,930
and come back disappointed,

434
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,610
you'd be even sadder then.

435
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,950
I don't care, Uncle.

436
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,750
As long as Brother Xiu can live a while longer,

437
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,310
I can be a little less sad.

438
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,210
If he dies,

439
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,790
what's the point of me living alone?

440
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,310
Lord Yuanxing shed tears in front of me.

441
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,680
He held my hand tightly

442
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,390
and pointed to the east firmly and solemnly.

443
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,520
He...

444
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,840
Okay, thank you.

445
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,330
He patted my hand and said in a trembling voice,

446
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,850
"Xiu, do not scruple. Just go.

447
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,030
The victory will be yours for sure.

448
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,660
It will belong to Zichuan for sure!"

449
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,570
Enough!

450
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,140
Zichuan Xiu, according to what you said,

451
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,510
before your nap,

452
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,270
our late Chieftain, Lord Zichuan Yuanxing,

453
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,040
came to your dream

454
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,250
and told you that Ge Sha was dead?

455
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,880
And it was he who ordered you to chase the enemy?

456
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,150
Exactly.

457
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,750
I didn't expect

458
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,980
that you could finally understand me, Lord Xiao!

459
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,950
Nonsense!

460
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,480
How could you say

461
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,810
such a ridiculous thing as a ghost entering into your dream?

462
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,770
How dare you mention the spirit of Lord Yuanxing

463
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,180
to defend you?

464
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,070
Such sophistry

465
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,470
is a contempt of court.

466
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,930
Shameless!

467
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,070
Shameless?

468
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,540
In order to kill me,

469
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,550
My Lords, you really all made a lot of effort.

470
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,830
You never repent.

471
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,200
Lord Xiao,

472
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,820
I have a question.

473
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,310
Si Yilin.

474
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,680
You are just the Deputy Commander of the Royal Escorts.

475
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,160
You can only sit by but have no right to ask questions.

476
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,790
I know.

477
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,470
But the eight crimes you just discussed

478
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,110
and the evidence-searching process

479
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,870
have a highly complex process.

480
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,300
The case should be reported by the Yuanzhou Army,

481
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,840
confirmed by the Ministry of War,

482
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,990
and examined by the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

483
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,420
In the end, the case will be handed over to the Chieftain's Mansion.

484
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,220
According to the Law of Zichuan,

485
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,320
if we don't follow this procedure,

486
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,050
then everything will be deemed invalid.

487
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,640
The Battle of Hengchuan is not a trivial matter.

488
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,590
Yesterday, I requested Lord Chieftain

489
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,190
to make a secret order

490
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,120
to authorize the power to retrieve the files of all bureaus and armies to me.

491
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,570
At the same time, I have informed all of my peer officials to cooperate with the inspection.

492
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,470
As for the solid evidence,

493
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,330
let's summon the Lieutenant of Zichuan Xiu,

494
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,530
Baichuan.

495
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,250
Lord Xiao,

496
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,280
these are the records of military affairs provided by Baichuan.

497
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,240
It records Zichuan Xiu's daily behaviors,

498
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,130
like how he exchanged things with the North Clan

499
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,350
and how he sneakily tipped them off.

500
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,800
They are entirely consistent with the eight crimes.

501
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,750
Baichuan, you wrote this yourself, right?

502
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,800
Yes.

503
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,150
Recording the Captain's daily lives, daily activities,

504
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,350
marching arrangement and core orders…

505
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,350
That's my duty.

506
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,170
Are the records authentic?

507
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,320
Yes,

508
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,910
but…

509
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,300
I, Xiao Long,

510
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,740
hereby declare that…

511
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,540
Lord Xiao,

512
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,340
even if Baichuan's records are true,

513
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,090
Zichuan Xiu is also right.

514
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,250
Yuanzhou is indeed a stark place.

515
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,310
We've been fighting with the North Clan for years.

516
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,150
It has become a custom

517
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,190
to barter.

518
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,120
If Zichuan Xiu is found guilty based on that,

519
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,120
none of the Yuanzhou soldiers will be innocent.

520
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,610
If Zichuan Xiu is convicted of betraying the country and conspiring with the enemy,

521
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,920
none of the tens of thousands of Yuanzhou soldiers

522
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,640
who had fought battles for Zichuan

523
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,220
will be innocent.

524
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,260
My Lord, Lord Si Yilin is right.

525
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,280
If we convict Lord Xiu of betraying the country just based on the records,

526
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,340
it is far-fetched.

527
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,250
As far as I know,

528
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,180
Lord Zichuan Xiu may seem to be careless about trivial stuff on the face of it,

529
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,820
but he's loyal to his family.

530
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,270
If not,

531
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,490
how can he live in a shabby place like Hengchuan

532
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,620
for seven years, eating mice and ants?

533
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,650
Careless about trivial stuff?

534
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
Since when

535
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,340
did the foundation of the country become a trivial matter?

536
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:57,950
My Lord!

537
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,670
The Lieutenant of Yuanzhou Army, Baichuan,

538
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,120
obtained the evidence that her senior officer was colluding with the enemy.

539
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,110
Not only did she hide that for years,

540
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,770
but she also helped him rebel.

541
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,620
According to the Law of Zichuan,

542
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,690
she will be sentenced to the same sentence as colluding with the enemy.

543
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,420
Cane her to death outside the court immediately.

544
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,230
Take her away.

545
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,060
Who dares to touch her?

546
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,820
The ninth crime:

547
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,530
disturbing the order of the trial,

548
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,970
and attempting to rebel.

549
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,080
Zichuan Xiu, are you still not pleading guilty?

550
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,730
You have to turn the victory at Hengchuan

551
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,410
into the shame of Hengchuan?

552
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,750
I'm not guilty.

553
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,390
Also,

554
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,950
you are insulting not only me

555
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,400
but the entire Yuanzhou.

556
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,430
The eight crimes are ridiculous.

557
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,240
You know clearly that I'm not guilty, and I've performed meritorious service.

558
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,150
Shameless!

559
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,080
Now, you take out the seals of the three Ministries

560
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,210
to frame me.

561
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,850
It's useless for me to say anything.

562
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,700
Zichuan Xiu.

563
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,820
It's your own fault.

564
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,040
You shouldn't disgrace the Yuanzhou Army altogether.

565
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,550
If you are determined

566
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,650
to shift the blame,

567
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,580
it can only prove that Luo Bo and Ge Yingxing

568
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,310
were not strict with their subordinate and spoiled you.

569
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,840
How many more people do you want to implicate?

570
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,889
In the Battle of Hengchuan,

571
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,159
there is solid evidence to prove that Zichuan Xiu colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country.

572
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,590
I, Xiao Long, hereby declare, in the name of the family,

573
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:25,650
that his military rank is to be stripped and his property confiscated.

574
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,630
And he'll be executed immediately.

575
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,090
Take him away!

576
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,190
Lord Canxing has recovered.

577
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,320
That's a blessing to Zichuan.

578
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,340
Lord Chieftain, we have witnesses and evidence.

579
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,040
Zichuan Xiu and his subordinate have also pleaded guilty.

580
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,330
Ning, don't look at that.

581
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,900
Lord Chieftain, no matter how much you adore this child,

582
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,300
as Minister of Military and Legal Affairs,

583
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,700
I have to be responsible for the dignity of the Law of Zichuan,

584
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,230
so I have to get rid of this traitor.

585
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,560
Lord Canxing.

586
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,170
They... I...

587
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,170
I want to stab you to death.

588
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,190
I'll kill you for my brother.

589
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,630
You're a disloyal and treacherous man.

590
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,930
You deserve to be killed for treason.

591
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,430
And even death would not be a sufficient punishment!

592
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,170
My Lords.

593
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,200
-Lord Chieftain, please take a seat.
-Brother Xiu, get up.

594
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,970
Please sit down.

595
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,510
My Lords.

596
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,770
Lord Chieftain,

597
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:54,070
Zichuan Xiu is the child of Zichuan Yuanxing.

598
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,880
My Lord, he's just adopted.

599
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,870
No need to be too sad.

600
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,730
One more thing:

601
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,210
he doesn't deserve to use the surname of the royal family anymore.

602
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,010
He should change back to his original name, Lin He.

603
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,240
My Lords.

604
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,310
Please understand.

605
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,560
Before Zichuan Yuanxing died, he held my hand

606
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,870
and entrusted Ning and Xiu to me.

607
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,700
Now, Zichuan Xiu has committed such a grave crime,

608
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,380
I'm also responsible for not teaching him well.

609
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,780
For my sake,

610
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,160
would you allow me to have a meal with Zichuan Xiu?

611
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,980
Consider it the last meal.

612
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,740
I'd like to send him on his way to the River Styx.

613
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,190
Just four hours.

614
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,310
When the time comes, you can execute him.

615
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,340
What do you think?

616
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,560
Then I'll listen to Lord Canxing's order.

617
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,190
Yes, we'll listen to your command, Lord Chieftain.

618
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,390
Thank you.

619
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,840
Yang Minghua made preparations beforehand.

620
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,840
He had colluded with Xiao Long in private long before.

621
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,110
This time, he's going to

622
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,620
kill Xiu at all costs.

623
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,230
Fine.

624
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,290
Xiu is unlucky.

625
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,790
He was born to implicate people.

626
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm going to gather my trusted subordinates now.

627
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,560
If there is no way out,

628
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,030
we have to break into the execution ground.

629
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,480
You're not the one who should go.

630
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,710
You've been lurking beside Yang Minghua's side for seven years.

631
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,930
If he wants to rebel,

632
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,150
you'll be the most powerful trump card.

633
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,120
Give your men to me. I'll go.

634
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,910
Okay.

635
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,580
My Lord.

636
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,130
These are some light dishes

637
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,690
sent from Commander Yang.

638
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,810
This is my favorite.

639
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,430
Wait a minute.

640
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,160
No matter who sent it,

641
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,510
you must be careful.

642
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,690
It's okay. The color doesn't change.

643
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,160
I'll eat it then.

644
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,920
Eat up.

645
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,910
Try this chicken.

646
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,210
It's really delicious.

647
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,170
Why did you come back?

648
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,880
I'm asking you. Why did you come back?

649
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,310
I'm not here to see you cry, anyway.

650
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,930
Brother Xiu,

651
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,150
take this to pick the lock and run.

652
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,040
Don't worry.

653
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,370
If God sees

654
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,920
that I'm not a good person,

655
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,100
he'll allow me to live a long life.

656
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,440
Don't worry.

657
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,390
My Lord, it's time.

658
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,590
I'm done. You can leave.

659
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,870
Ning,

660
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,670
the stone I gave you is indeed a piece of rubbish.

661
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,870
Throw it away.

662
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,520
I'm just a piece of rubbish, too.

663
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,700
Useless.

664
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,550
You can leave.

665
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,950
Uncle.

666
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,680
Uncle, we made a deal.

667
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,140
He won't live if you stay here.

668
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,730
How dare you betray your family?

669
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,060
How dare you glare at me? Useless traitor!

670
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,910
Lord Di Lin!

671
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,390
She is tough.

672
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,110
There's no need

673
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,310
to waste your energy on a traitor who's sentenced to death.

674
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,790
Yes.

675
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,110
Take her away!

676
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,090
Execute her with Zichuan Xiu!

677
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:46,750
Bro, you're about to kill, but you just use Sticky Rice Wine to wash your knife?

678
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,220
The treatment I receive is so bad.

679
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,680
Do you have Kaoliang Wine?

680
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,640
The Sticky Rice Wine is actually quite fragrant.

681
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,510
Why did you come back?

682
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,940
To kill me?

683
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,670
Don't be afraid.

684
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,400
How about

685
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,880
you lick it?

686
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,290
Drinking wine can relieve your pain.

687
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,350
Get lost!

688
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,600
My Lord, it's time.

689
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,360
Young hero.

690
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,800
To be honest,

691
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,790
it's a pity.
