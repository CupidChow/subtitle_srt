00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:42,820
[Episode 16]

4
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,570
My Lord.

5
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,520
What's wrong?

6
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,830
Si Yilin's army still gave an order to pursue the enemy.

7
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,990
Now they've crossed Chishuitan

8
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,419
and entered the central region of Yuntai.

9
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,389
They ignored the military order from the Ministry of War.

10
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,990
Deputy Commander Luo Bo has been handed over to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

11
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,710
Okay.

12
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,410
Tell Di Lin to punish him severely.

13
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,670
Yes.

14
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,230
Mr. Xiu.

15
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,079
If you think it's a dilemma for you,

16
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
I can understand.

17
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,180
Lord Luo has done me a great favor.

18
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,300
I will do my best.

19
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,480
Luo Bo didn't misjudge you.

20
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,700
Lord Ge Yingxing didn't misjudge you, either.

21
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,520
Speaking of Lord Ge,

22
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,950
there's one thing I've been unable to understand.

23
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,480
Go ahead.

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,030
Why did Lord Ge take the road that was within the Lin Family's territory?

25
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,340
The Imperial Capital was in danger at that time.

26
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,540
The Yuanzhou Army was restrained by the North Clan and couldn't fight back.

27
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,079
However, time was limited.

28
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,680
Lord Ge made a detour in the Lin Family's area

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,080
in order to ask Master Zuo Jiaming for help.

30
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,710
Before Lord Ge died, he told me that

31
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,430
he was worried that no one could restrain Yang Minghua after his death.

32
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,160
He said if it really happened one day,

33
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,070
I should give this box to Zichuan Xiu,

34
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,500
and tell Zichuan Xiu to find the owner of the box

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,829
in order to ask him to eliminate Yang Minghua.

36
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,430
That's what Lord Ge said.

37
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,960
So Master Zuo Jiaming really exists?

38
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,770
Rumour has it that every generation of every family

39
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,510
has a powerful man who is known as the top martial arts master.

40
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,170
But among these powerful men,

41
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,040
only one of them is recognized by

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,110
the whole continent,

43
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,770
namely, Master Zuo Jiaming from the Lin Family.

44
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,630
It is said that he's over 300 years old now.

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,870
I had thought that it was just a legend.

46
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,960
Master Zuo Jiaming was born in the Guangming Empire.

47
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,790
When he was 21, he was appointed

48
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,940
as the State Preceptor by Lin Jianyi, the emperor of the Guangming Empire.

49
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,710
He once used his own power

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,950
to repel the North Clan's army consisting of 100,000 soldiers,

51
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,350
and killed 3,000 people.

52
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,870
Later, he acknowledged Lin Jianyi's daughter,

53
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,780
Lin Fengxi, as the head of the family.

54
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,840
He protected the Lin Family for several hundred years.

55
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,240
I will keep it well.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,640
However, it shouldn't be given to me so early.

57
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,140
By the way, did you guys see Lei Hong in Yuanzhou?

58
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,940
We did fight with Lei Hong's rebel army several times.

59
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,110
But we didn't see him in person all the time.

60
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,110
He was so cunning.

61
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,190
No matter where he hides,

62
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,710
I'll find him eventually.

63
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,900
Let's not talk about this now.

64
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,430
The most important thing now

65
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,110
is Lord Luo's problem.

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,410
In fact, the most suitable person is my Big Brother, Di Lin.

67
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,460
I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

68
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,940
Now I have to beg him.

69
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,040
[Di's Mansion]

70
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,720
What? You lost your own statue,

71
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,360
so you want to take mine away?

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,409
It's just a statue.

73
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,680
If Xiu likes it, can you really refuse to give it to him?

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,860
I even want to take away all the objects

75
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,010
in your study room.

76
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,700
Okay. Take them away if you're strong enough to carry them away.

77
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,190
Xiujia, go get some rest first,

78
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,110
in case someone should pretend to be drunk later after taking just a sip of wine,

79
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,770
and take advantage of my wife.

80
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,750
I haven't seen your Big Brother be so happy for a long time.

81
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,550
You guys talk.

82
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,730
Have a seat.

83
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,310
Are you here for Luo Bo?

84
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,690
Can he be saved?

85
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,100
I'll do my best.

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,670
Really?

87
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,830
It seems that people can't tell lies all their lives.

88
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,150
I only lied to you once.

89
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,490
I'm afraid you'll hate me all your life, right?

90
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,970
Don't you need my help to solve your own problem?

91
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,790
What problem can I have?

92
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,300
The Reserve Service Troops heading for Yuanzhou

93
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,470
have long departed.

94
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,520
But you were the only one who didn't receive the transfer order.

95
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,160
That means Lord Chieftain

96
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,130
wants to turn you into a useless pawn deliberately.

97
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,010
It's good to be a useless pawn.

98
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,260
A useless pawn can enjoy a leisure life.

99
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,500
Xiu, that day, I...

100
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,720
Big Brother, I understand.

101
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,030
You did it for my own good.

102
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,230
I still let you down in the end.

103
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,830
I'm happy that you called me Big Brother again.

104
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,250
Come on.

105
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,440
Here you are.

106
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,750
It's good to be in the Imperial Capital.

107
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,280
Now Luo Minghai is determined to deal with me.

108
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,080
Now I'm doing everything I can to protect myself.

109
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,710
Though I'm confident that I won't lose to him,

110
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,110
things are unpredictable. Who knows what the result will be?

111
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,270
If anything wrong happens to me,

112
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,710
please take care of Xiujia.

113
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,560
Big Brother.

114
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,050
Don't worry. I promise you that

115
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,920
as long as I'm alive,

116
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,050
I won't let your wife get hurt.

117
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,400
Forget what I said.

118
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,539
My Lord.

119
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,310
Di Lin sentenced Luo Bo to death.

120
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,790
What?

121
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,650
According to the law of Zichuan,

122
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,990
those who disregard military orders and cause major losses

123
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,080
should be removed from their posts and put into jail.

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,100
Luo Bo shouldn't have been sentenced to death.

125
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,110
Di Lin has the nickname of Executioner.

126
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,790
It's not out of expectation that he did this.

127
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,360
No. When Yang Minghua was still an influential minister,

128
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,030
Di Lin already wanted to interfere in Yuanzhou's affairs.

129
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,720
This time, he took the chance to punish Luo Bo.

130
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,570
I think his purpose is to take over Yuanzhou's deployment in the future.

131
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,050
My Lord, you think that

132
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,070
Di Lin has an ulterior motive for punishing Luo Bo?

133
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,410
We can't make this conclusion so easily.

134
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,000
We still need to ask for Lord Chieftain's instructions.

135
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,650
Just as you expected,

136
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,550
since you want to kill Luo Bo, he's going to intercede for him.

137
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,140
Luo Minghai is an honest and diligent official.

138
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,020
But he has been working for Yang Minghua for so long that he has become adept at scheming.

139
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,350
Besides, he's determined to deal with me.

140
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,810
A wise man can be ruined by his own wisdom.

141
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,940
In this way, Second Brother should be happy.

142
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,340
My Lord.

143
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,460
Princess Ning wants to see you.

144
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,670
Ning

145
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,830
hasn't come to see me for five or six days.

146
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,560
What's wrong today? She has thought of me?

147
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,030
Let her in.

148
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,840
Well, Her Highness...

149
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,240
What's wrong?

150
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,710
Ning, why are you kneeling?

151
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,270
Come on. Stand up.

152
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,550
Uncle, I have something to say.

153
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,070
But you'll definitely be angry after you hear it.

154
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,430
So I'd better go on kneeling.

155
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,590
What are you talking about?

156
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,750
After I get angry, I'll be even angrier if you go on kneeling.

157
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,420
Stand up. Just tell me what you want to say. Come on.

158
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,880
Uncle, listen to me first.

159
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,680
When my father was alive,

160
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,830
he once told me that

161
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,530
I had been weak in childhood.

162
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,910
I even almost died from a serious disease when I was a kid.

163
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,320
A doctor prescribed a folk prescription.

164
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,380
He said there was a kind of Phoenix Bee in the wilderness of the North Clan.

165
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,010
It chirped like a phoenix,

166
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,960
and its honey could be used to cure my disease.

167
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,500
You sneaked into the North Clan to find and get this honey.

168
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,940
This is the Phoenix Bee honey found by you.

169
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,180
It saved my life.

170
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,150
Because of it, I've remained healthy until now.

171
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,480
Therefore, I've been very grateful to you

172
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,930
since I became a sensible child.

173
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,670
It is indeed hard to find this kind of honey.

174
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,150
But as long as we manage to open all kinds of channels,

175
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,610
there will be such honey every year.

176
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,510
And this Glittering Cloak, too.

177
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,300
When I was ten years old, the officials came to congratulate me.

178
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,470
You made this for me.

179
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,150
At that time, my father said I was just a kid,

180
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,890
so the adults shouldn't spoil me too much.

181
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,210
But you said I was the most beautiful princess in Zichuan,

182
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,830
so only the most gorgeous clothes

183
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,070
could match me.

184
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,020
Uncle, you've been doting on me and loving me since I was a kid.

185
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,410
After my father passed away,

186
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,590
your love for me has only increased without decreasing.

187
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,050
No matter what I asked for,

188
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,750
you never said no.

189
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,390
Ning,

190
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,660
what on earth do you want to say today?

191
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,390
I have another request for you, Uncle.

192
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,460
Please grant me a marriage. I want to marry...

193
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,410
Stop saying it.

194
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,950
Ning, I dote on you and love you,

195
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,970
not only because you're my elder brother's daughter

196
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,900
and my niece.

197
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,180
More importantly,

198
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,910
the reason is that you're the princess of the Zichuan Family.

199
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,800
Thus, you must be careful with

200
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,910
your words and actions.

201
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,940
You can't talk willfully.

202
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,230
Uncle, I'm not wilful.

203
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,910
I've thought it through.

204
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,750
Uncle, you know what?

205
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,650
I was born in an imperial family, and I've lived a prosperous life.

206
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,250
Everyone is nice to me.

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,620
People all dote on me so much that

208
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,620
they always protect me from any harm.

209
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,030
Everyone takes care of me

210
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,350
like looking after the flowers in the greenhouse.

211
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,180
But people are afraid of me, too.

212
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,560
Only Xiu

213
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,340
doesn't regard me as the Princess of Zichuan.

214
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,380
He really treats me as Zichuan Ning.

215
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,070
So, Uncle,

216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,100
I just want to be myself this time.

217
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,660
I want to be with Xiu.

218
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,920
Please give us your blessings, will you?

219
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,170
How does Zichuan Xiu deserve to be your husband?

220
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,400
He's just a deputy commander,

221
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,950
and he's even in the Reserve Service Troops.

222
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,110
Who are you?

223
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,120
You're the princess of the Zichuan Family. You're the heir.

224
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,240
How could you kneel in front of me

225
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,110
and beg me to let you marry him?

226
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,430
I don't care about all these things.

227
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,470
I only care about Xiu.

228
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,710
As long as I can be with him,

229
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,990
I can give up anything.

230
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,550
I can even give up my identity as a princess.

231
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,220
Nonsense!

232
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,310
You're just talking nonsense, aren't you?

233
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,590
You're the princess of the Zichuan Family.

234
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,840
You keep pestering that brat

235
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,990
all day long.

236
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,470
What's the point of that?

237
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,460
Right. It's my fault.

238
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,950
I didn't educate you well.

239
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,090
It's all my fault.

240
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,400
Uncle, that's not what I meant.

241
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,190
I didn't forget my own responsibilities.

242
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,750
I mean...

243
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,920
Ning, Xiu has his strengths.

244
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,790
I can understand his position in your heart.

245
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,110
But you have to think about it.

246
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,870
If you do this for him,

247
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,130
what will happen to the Zichuan Family in the future?

248
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,270
What will happen to the Zichuan Clan in the future?

249
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,270
What will happen to the tens of millions of people of the Zichuan Family?

250
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,750
You're 18 years old now.

251
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,030
You can't be like a kid anymore.

252
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,190
Just think about it.

253
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,750
Tell the Ministry of War

254
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,000
to order Zichuan Xiu to lead the Xiu Battalion to leave for Yuanzhou immediately.

255
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,160
My Lord, which province should he go to specifically?

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,480
Find a place in Yuanzhou.

257
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,680
The farther away from the Imperial Capital, the better.

258
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,280
Go at once.

259
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,610
Yes, My Lord.

260
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,500
Brother.

261
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,830
I'll deal with

262
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,350
Ning's matters well.

263
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,750
I won't let anyone disturb Ning.

264
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,100
Please don't worry, Brother.

265
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,590
You're here. I'm exhausted.

266
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,970
I've packed the things for you. Get ready to go.

267
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,590
Why are you laughing?

268
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,190
I'm not laughing.

269
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,150
You did laugh.

270
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,230
Do you think this is a transfer order?

271
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,190
This is obviously an exile order.

272
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,240
Anyway, I'm going to sell my ax.

273
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,680
I'll bribe the minister of the Ministry of War.

274
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,260
We might be able to escape this trouble.

275
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,720
How is that even possible?

276
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,750
Who dares to take our bribes now?

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,390
Isn't it good to go back to Yuanzhou?

278
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,700
At this time?

279
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,570
With this position?

280
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,360
With such a low salary?

281
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
Let's face the reality.

282
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,470
Although Zichuan Xiu has been longing for the transfer order,

283
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,210
he did offend Lord Chieftain.

284
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,670
The place which we're going to in our expedition this time

285
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,670
is basically in the center of the rebel army's region.

286
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,000
He wants you to die in Yuanzhou.

287
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,510
Have you finished talking?

288
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,160
Yes.

289
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,119
Look at you guys.

290
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,150
With your abilities,

291
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,760
you can only develop well in Yuanzhou.

292
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,900
Chuan, we used to be an army.

293
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,670
What about now? We're just rascals.

294
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,990
Don't be like this. We are bandits now.

295
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,590
Don't worry.

296
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,630
I won't let you guys suffer after we go back.

297
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,070
I've never suffered

298
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,460
while working for Lord Xiu.

299
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,990
In that case, I think you've been used to it.

300
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,860
Go tell our soldiers now.

301
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,460
We'll depart tomorrow.

302
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,990
If we ask Lord Di Lin for help now...

303
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,010
Baichuan.

304
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,390
I'm the one who wants to go back to Yuanzhou.

305
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,450
I'll inform the Xiu Battalion immediately.

306
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,410
Let's go back to Yuanzhou.

307
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,230
In Yuanzhou, there is everything that was left by my master.

308
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,100
Lei Hong is there, too.

309
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,950
My Lady, please come down now.

310
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,970
It's too dangerous up there.

311
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,670
Keep your voice down. The swallows have even left because you were so noisy.

312
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,730
Give me the branch.

313
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,010
Ning.

314
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,940
Xiu.

315
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,410
What are you doing?

316
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,310
It's too dangerous for you to be like this.

317
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,510
Keep your voice down.

318
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,510
You're finally back.

319
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,680
Why are you getting more and more naughty now?

320
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,510
You've even learned to go up to the ceiling.

321
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,190
The swallows built a nest here previously.

322
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,020
I found out that they had given birth to several little swallows, too.

323
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,790
I thought I should build a nest for them.

324
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,630
For something like this, you can ask the servants

325
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,580
or the guards to do it.

326
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,710
Why do you have to...

327
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,080
Come down now.

328
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,590
I'll come down at once. Keep your voice down.

329
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,510
Be careful.

330
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,600
You don't understand.

331
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,560
For something like this, it's fun to do it myself.

332
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,870
What about you? Why did you come back?

333
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,440
Are you here to borrow money or wine from me?

334
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,700
I'm going back to Yuanzhou.

335
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,700
Remember to come home early.

336
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,500
Win the war and come home early.

337
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,720
Ning, I remember that you were very afraid of the dark when you were a kid.

338
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,510
You always cried, too.

339
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,190
When you cried, you kept shedding tears.

340
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,630
Lord Yuanxing even specifically asked me to

341
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,840
take good care of you.

342
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Give me that hand.

343
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,120
But what did I do?

344
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,210
As your brother, I didn't look after you well.

345
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,050
Instead, you had to take care of me many times.

346
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,010
It's done.

347
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,850
It's not like that.

348
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,060
Do you remember this?

349
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,550
Many years ago, there was a riot in the Imperial Capital.

350
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,630
My father was not at home at that time.

351
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,530
Even the guards ran away.

352
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,840
Those mobs

353
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,790
intruded into my house furiously.

354
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,040
I was so scared that I only dared to cry in bed.

355
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,000
I remember that you were eight years old at that time.

356
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,520
You protected me

357
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,260
with a sword at my bedside every night.

358
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,630
I looked at you from under the quilt.

359
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,370
Although you were only eight years old,

360
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,100
you looked quite mighty with a sword in your hand.

361
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,890
Did you think that I didn't see it?

362
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,120
It was so embarrassing. Stop talking about it.

363
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,380
It was really embarrassing at that time.

364
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,420
I saw someone walk into the room.

365
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,680
I attacked him with my sword.

366
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,470
Then when I looked back,

367
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,680
someone kicked me.

368
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,670
I wanted to drag him with me.

369
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,120
But in the end, I saw that it was Lord Yuanxing who had come back.

370
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,740
After he kicked me, I had to

371
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,620
lay in bed for a whole week.

372
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,870
But I think you looked very handsome

373
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,470
when you went out of the room.

374
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,660
As your brother, that was all that I could do.

375
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,910
It was enough.

376
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,310
Ning,

377
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,810
why don't we be brother and sister for the rest of our lives?

378
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,670
We've always been good brother and sister.

379
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,230
Let me put it another way.

380
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,850
I'm going to Yuanzhou in two days.

381
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,780
I may not be able to come back for a long time.

382
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,500
I know. I'll wait for you.

383
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,510
Maybe I won't be able to come back.

384
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,710
It won't be like that.

385
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
I'll wait for you.

386
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,680
Okay.

387
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,230
Right. It won't be like that.

388
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,980
You can wait for me.

389
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,950
But while you're waiting for me,

390
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,780
you can do other things, right?

391
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,030
For example, you can go out to take a look,

392
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,670
go shopping,

393
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,110
buy some rouge and lipsticks which you like,

394
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,310
and meet some new boys.

395
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,210
Ning, to be honest, I've found that

396
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,960
you hardly have any male friends by your side.

397
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,110
Now you're 17 or 18 years old,

398
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,470
and that is not quite normal for you.

399
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,530
It's not like that.

400
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,540
I have many male friends.

401
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,830
Si Yilin, Luo Jie and Ming Yu

402
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,160
are all my good friends.

403
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,460
Ning.

404
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,470
The male friend I'm talking about is that kind of friend.

405
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,960
You mean that kind of friend?

406
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,700
Zichuan Xiu, I'll ask you one more time.

407
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,040
Are you talking about that kind of friend?

408
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,760
Just like...

409
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,040
Just like Si Yilin and Ka Dan?

410
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,150
Fine. Zichuan Xiu.

411
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,670
I got it.

412
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,790
I got it.

413
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,140
Mei, it's late now. Let's build the nest tomorrow.

414
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,710
See the guest out.

415
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,670
♫Your smile is like a flower blooming in my heart♫

416
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,790
Lord Xiu.

417
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,490
♫My dream hid inside my chest♫

418
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:29,700
♫Since then, there has been no end in this vast world♫

419
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,030
♫I sacrificed everything I had on your path of flowers♫

420
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,030
♫Though the sun and the moon keep changing, this love will last forever♫

421
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,740
♫I'll love you forever♫

422
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,090
♫Time brings great changes to the world, and I hope that there will be no end♫

423
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,500
♫You're swimming happily in my dream river♫

424
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:04,900
♫One of my thoughts turned into trouble and I missed you in thousands of ways♫

425
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,020
♫It's you♫

426
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,640
♫You're like clouds and smoke in my mortal world♫

427
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,450
♫You keep coming and going, being so far away♫

428
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:26,500
♫Although death is far away, I miss you in my dream♫

429
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,100
♫It's you♫

430
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Zichuan Xiu.

431
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,830
♫I'm willing to watch the change of time with you♫

432
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,750
You deserve to go to hell.

433
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,180
♫My love for you is sincere♫

434
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,690
Zichuan is the most important!

435
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,950
Lin He, don't forget who you are.

436
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,200
Goodbye, Ning.

437
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,190
Forgive my ruthlessness.

438
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,990
♫Your smile is like a flower blooming in my heart♫

439
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,700
♫My dream hid inside my chest♫

440
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,130
♫Since then, there has been no end in this vast world♫

441
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,430
♫I sacrificed everything I had on your path of flowers♫

442
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,700
♫Though the sun and the moon keep changing, this love will last forever♫

443
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,740
When that day comes, and you become the chieftain,

444
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,140
♫I'll love you forever♫

445
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:34,770
you will understand why I did this.

446
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,480
♫Time brings great changes to the world, and I hope that there will be no end♫

447
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:39,670
When that day comes,

448
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,490
♫You're swimming happily in my dream river♫

449
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,290
and you walk into the wedding hall with your beloved man,

450
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,550
♫One of my thoughts turned into trouble and I missed you in thousands of ways♫

451
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,470
I will give you two my best wishes from afar.

452
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,640
By that time, will you still remember

453
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,990
♫It's you♫

454
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,520
the person you used to like?

455
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,020
♫You're like clouds and smoke in my mortal world♫

456
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,920
♫You keep coming and going, being so far away♫

457
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:16,300
♫Although death is far away, I miss you in my dream♫

458
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,980
Get ready. We'll set off soon.

459
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,630
My Lord.

460
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,060
We're really so tired.

461
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,530
When will we arrive?

462
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,120
Haven't you seen the military order?

463
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,350
We have to arrive in Kaige City in three days to get the military supplies.

464
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,950
We won't take any rest in the next two days.

465
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,190
We should eat on the way.

466
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,740
Well, what do you mean?

467
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,910
We are so tired.

468
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,470
You want us to eat while running forward?

469
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,770
The front line is already out of food. We can only eat wild vegetables.

470
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,210
If we don't hurry up now,

471
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,490
maybe we can't even eat wild vegetables.

472
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,770
You chose such a bunch of unreliable people

473
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,230
to go to Yuanzhou with you,

474
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,470
instead of choosing elite soldiers from the Reserve Service Troops.

475
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,600
This is a smart move.

476
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,670
If I were you, I would have done the same thing.

477
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,980
Because in the Reserve Service Troops,

478
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,640
there might be an informant planted by someone.

479
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,920
Though Maocai and the others are inexperienced,

480
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
and they're not quite disciplined,

481
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,360
this military force truly belongs to you.

482
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,700
You've thought too much.

483
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,030
I just want to return to Yuanzhou as soon as possible.

484
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,590
After all, at the gate of the Imperial Capital,

485
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,070
there is a noodle stall where we can't get any extra meat.

486
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,060
And Yuanzhou is the place where that man stays now.

487
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,210
Yuanzhou is so big. Can you find Lei Hong?

488
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,080
We need to eat well

489
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,050
and sleep well.

490
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,690
We should also take revenge carefully.

491
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,430
Since you had wrriten him a letter,

492
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,060
why didn't you give it to him?

493
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,710
What's the use of giving it to him?

494
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,870
Giving him the letter doesn't mean that it has to be useful.

495
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,400
But you need to let him know.

496
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,470
Whether I like him or not

497
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,110
is my own business after all.

498
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,320
Why should I let him know?

499
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,270
After meeting you,

500
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,250
I've thought that people of the North Clan are brave to love and hate.

501
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,580
With your personality,

502
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,280
you won't make yourself have any regrets.

503
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,360
Right?

504
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,950
What should I do to make myself have no regrets?

505
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,180
Give him the letter.

506
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,190
He's on the battlefield. How can I give it to him?

507
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,470
Use the express service which travels 800 miles a day.

508
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,550
Since the military report can be delivered,

509
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,850
why can't your letter be delivered?

510
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,030
I'm the princess of the North Clan.

511
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,630
He is the general of Zichuan.

512
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,840
It's unforgivable for us to communicate with each other through letters privately.

513
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,330
I'm the princess of Zichuan.

514
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,530
It's just a letter, and after I add my personal seal to it,

515
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,430
no one will dare to open and read it without permission.

516
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,670
According to what you said, there won't be any barriers.

517
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,540
Of course.

518
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,870
Are you comforting me

519
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,920
or encouraging yourself?

520
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,760
For some things, we can encourage others,

521
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,320
but we can't encourage ourselves.

522
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,050
Come on. Give me a bowl of that.

523
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,160
My Lord, the Border Appeasement Army is here.

524
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,530
Really? Come on. Invite them to come here.

525
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:28,950
Yes.

526
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,910
General Ming Hui.

527
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,710
Lord Si.

528
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,830
I've long heard that our Border Appeasement Army is brave and fearless.

529
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,310
We can finally have a rest after you've arrived here.

530
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,470
It's just a rumor.

531
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,190
Compared with the buddies of the Palace Guards,

532
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,850
the Border Appeasement Army is really living a comfortable life.

533
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,710
We used to be the second unit to defend against the Lin Family.

534
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,640
But since we're here, we can't come here for nothing.

535
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,230
This is the Weiyu Forest.

536
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,630
The main force of the rebel army is in the east.

537
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,530
And this area is the defence area of your troops.

538
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,590
My troops

539
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,160
are going to take defensive measures in this zone

540
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,670
in order to fight against the rebel army with your troops.

541
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,270
The Border Appeasement Army's defensive deployment

542
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,710
is nearly all set up behind the Palace Guards' defensive deployment.

543
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,860
This is considered as fighting side by side?

544
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,920
Your troops are more familiar with this place.

545
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,400
We still need to get adapted to it.

546
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,120
Let's all try to understand each other.

547
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,870
Okay. Got it.

548
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,510
It's getting late.

549
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,610
We had a long trip today.

550
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,630
Let's talk about the rest of the plan tomorrow.

551
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,230
Ning.

552
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,920
Just now, I saw a servant

553
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,580
sneak into your room.

554
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,310
Did you see him?

555
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,970
No, I think I've caught a cold.

556
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,070
I don't even have the strength to get out of bed.

557
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,130
Don't come near me.

558
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm afraid I'll infect you.

559
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,790
Okay. I got it.

560
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,290
You...

561
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,400
Are you leaving?

562
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,790
No. I'm not feeling well, right?

563
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,239
I thought it was too stuffy,

564
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,100
so I needed to go out to take a walk.

565
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,040
The map of Yuanzhou.

566
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,679
Can you take a walk to Yuanzhou?

567
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,270
Ka Dan, what you said...

568
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:45,920
No.

569
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,760
My own words have made me figure it out.

570
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:53,179
I should bear both the happiness and pain myself.

571
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,360
I regret that I didn't ask him clearly that day.

572
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
He probably hasn't gone far.

573
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
It's not too late for me to set off now.

574
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,420
I must ask him to give me

575
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,500
a clear answer.

576
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,700
Now it's not the time to ask him clearly.

577
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,160
You can wait for him to come back.

578
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,710
Ka Dan, the person I like

579
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,870
doesn't allow me to wait for him.

580
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,060
What if he really doesn't come back?

581
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,860
What if he falls in love with someone else,

582
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,400
gets married and has children in Yuanzhou?

583
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,380
What if he still doesn't come back

584
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,250
as I keep waiting for him?

585
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,180
But Ning,

586
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,190
Yuanzhou is not like the Imperial Capital.

587
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,110
You're used to living in a prosperous city,

588
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,640
and you can't imagine the environment there.

589
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,190
I was captured in Yuanzhou.

590
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,880
The wilderness and corpses there

591
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,110
are still lingering in my mind.

592
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,950
The refugees who were driven crazy by the war,

593
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,190
the soldiers who lacked food,

594
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,150
and the people from Yuanzhou who were in a desperate situation.

595
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,550
Branches, hoes,

596
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,700
and even stones on the roadside

597
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,760
could be their life-saving weapons.

598
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,220
In order to survive, they would kill anyone.

599
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,850
I know.

600
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,790
You don't know!

601
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,140
You don't know.

602
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,750
You are the heir of the Zichuan Family.

603
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,650
Your safety affects the entire country of Zichuan

604
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,190
and even the situation of the war.

605
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,110
Though I'm the heir, so what?

606
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,630
I still can't keep the person I love by my side.

607
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,620
I shouldn't have said those words to you.

608
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,330
No, Ka Dan.

609
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
I'm grateful for what you said to me.

610
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,990
If it weren't for you,

611
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,330
now I would still be a fool who could only feel sad.

612
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,450
I've made up my mind.

613
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,460
I must go to Yuanzhou.

614
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,430
Your Highness! Your Highness!

615
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,080
What should we do?

616
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,150
No, no, no.

617
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,980
Princess Ning has caught a cold because she indulged in having fun.

618
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,840
Butler, please send for a doctor.

619
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,040
Okay.

620
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,430
I knew you would help me.

621
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,140
I can't get off the pirate ship now, can I?

622
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,220
No, you can't.

623
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,970
Currently, the news that I have a cold

624
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,130
has been spread out.

625
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,910
During my trip to Yuanzhou,

626
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,120
just say that Princess Ning

627
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,990
has been infected with plague, which is infectious,

628
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,520
so it's not appropriate for her to see anyone.

629
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,360
However, there is a war now.

630
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,150
When soldiers check people who enter or leave the Imperial Capital,

631
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,210
they'll definitely be very careful.

632
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,430
Have you thought about how to get out of the city?

633
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,470
I thought of someone from somewhere.

634
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,730
The soldiers guarding the city gate won't dare to stop her.

635
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,820
The business in the restaurant has been very good recently.

636
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,150
The clerk went to replenish stocks again.

637
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,640
Show me the passing permit.

638
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,890
Wang Dazhuang.

639
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,710
What's wrong?

640
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,460
He's a clerk from Lord Di Lin's restaurant.

641
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,260
How dare you call him by his name?

642
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,830
Mr. Dazhuang, please.

643
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,030
Give my regards to Lord Di Lin for me when there's a chance.

644
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,190
There's no need to give regards to me.

645
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,480
Are you doing your job well?

646
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,830
Lord Di Lin.

647
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,560
There were 572 people passing the city gate today.

648
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,510
We all searched them one by one.

649
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,110
Only after we confirmed their identities did we dare to let them pass the gate.

650
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,390
This is a clerk from the Jintai Restaurant, isn't he?

651
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,790
We definitely trust him.

652
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,510
Are you a new clerk recruited by Xiujia?

653
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,600
You can't even recognize the new clerk in our restaurant.

654
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,540
It shows that you rarely come to our restaurant.

655
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,510
Why are you here?

656
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,580
Is it beautiful?

657
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,870
Yes, it's called, "I could see her hands after her sleeves were rolled up.

658
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,690
There were golden bracelets on her white wrists."

659
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,710
Stop looking at us. Get out of the city at once.

660
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,110
You won't be able to get fresh Baishui Fish if you don't hurry up.

661
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,590
Yes.

662
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,990
You're still looking at him?

663
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,070
It's late now. Why don't you go home?

664
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,330
I've already made some soup.

665
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,590
Okay. I need to talk to Ge Qing about something.

666
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,590
I'll be back soon.

667
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,910
It was really Princess Ning.

668
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,590
But she went out

669
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,590
in the name of our Jintai Restaurant just like that.

670
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,950
Is it really okay?

671
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,300
My husband has never been considerate

672
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,780
towards such things.

673
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,770
Princess Ning is just being playful.

674
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,840
She will be back in a couple of days.

675
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,430
Zhui.

676
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,090
I usually feed you with such good fodder.

677
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,280
You must help me catch up with Xiu.

678
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,710
Lord Xiu.

679
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,610
Thanks for your hard work.

680
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,520
Lord Xiu.

681
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,800
Lord Xiu.

682
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:39,930
Thanks for your hard work.

683
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,460
Lord Xiu.

684
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,940
It smells so good.

685
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:44,970
My Lord!

686
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,410
You are back.

687
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,550
My Lord, we are back.

688
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,970
Put your hand down.

689
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,160
My Lord, you shouldn't have asked me

690
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,070
to communicate with the people of the Logistics Ministry.

691
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,930
They're just a bunch of villains.

692
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,920
What happened?

693
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,060
Those several bastards

694
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,630
didn't open the granary for us.

695
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,870
They also said that they would ask their superiors to check us again.

696
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,230
They said that our Xiu Battalion

697
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,270
wasn't considered as a regular army,

698
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,960
and our soldiers were just a bunch of ruffians and rascals.

699
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,890
So you two came back empty-handed,

700
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,070
and didn't bring any provisions back?

701
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,280
I tried to use force to take some provisions, but in the end...

702
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,630
In the end, Luo Jie failed to take anything away.

703
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,430
He was even kicked twice by them.

704
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,860
He was even kicked twice? Which part?

705
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,710
My butt, but I'm fine.

706
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,990
No, you're not fine.

707
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,810
I'm really fine.

708
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,120
I...

709
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,090
I'm not fine.

710
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,490
How dare they call us ruffians and rascals?

711
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,240
What they said is right. Come here.

712
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,610
Let's show them

713
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:54,870
what real ruffians and rascals are like.
