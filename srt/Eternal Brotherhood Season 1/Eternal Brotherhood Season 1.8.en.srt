[Episode 8]

4
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,460
Lady Ning, slow down.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,380
We can make it.

6
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,320
We might not.

7
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,390
I also need to take a bath, smoke incense,

8
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,950
trim my eyebrows, apply makeup, and change clothes.

9
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,310
Didn't you just dress up?

10
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,830
That was a long time ago.

11
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,479
See for yourself

12
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,130
whether my face is okay.

13
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,229
And I need to wash my hair.

14
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,670
There's no time.

15
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,830
How about just washing the fringe?

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,640
No, I still need to wash all of my hair.

17
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm going to see Brother Xiu.

18
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,669
My Lady.

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,390
What's the problem if you're late?

20
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,230
You should have asked him to wait for you.

21
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,910
What do you know?

22
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,380
I will miss the auspicious time if I'm late.

23
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,670
Go now.

24
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,630
Yes.

25
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,110
What's the rush?

26
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,680
A secret guard from the Chieftain's Mansion sent a message.

27
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,590
There's no need to bother the Lord Commander-in-Chief for such a trivial matter.

28
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,750
I'll take care of it. Go.

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,590
Yes.

30
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,870
Brother Xiu wouldn't

31
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,530
dislike this dress, would he?

32
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,990
Didn't Lord Xiu say that

33
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,230
you look beautiful in anything?

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,210
Go and see if he's back.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,470
Lady Ning, it's only half an hour.

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,980
You've sent me to see if he's back six or seven times.

37
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,700
Why isn't he back yet?

38
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,470
Did he forget?

39
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,950
No way.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,600
Lord Xiu said he had something important to do yesterday.

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,630
What's more important than this?

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,960
But it's almost time.

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,800
Lord Xiu must

44
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,620
want to give you a surprise at the last moment.

45
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,840
He should be back soon.

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I'll go greet him.

47
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,100
Lord Xiu, you're back.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,660
You're actually back.

49
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,430
Brother Xiu.

50
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,310
Where are you going?

51
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,190
I'm not going anywhere.

52
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,940
Why are you dressed so fancy?

53
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,370
You just came back?

54
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,950
Lord Xiu.

55
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,630
Didn't you say you had something important to do today?

56
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,710
Yes. I sent Lord Ge back to Yuanzhou.

57
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,960
The important thing you said

58
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,230
is sending Lord Ge back to Yuanzhou?

59
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,230
Of course.

60
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,370
What else

61
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,550
is more important than sending Lord Ge back to Yuanzhou?

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,450
Even if there's nothing more important

63
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,190
than sending Lord Ge back to Yuanzhou,

64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,230
there should be

65
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,680
the same important thing.

66
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,409
The same important thing?

67
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,720
Baichuan. I need to see her.

68
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
I wonder if she likes

69
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,510
the lunch today.

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,660
I'll go first.

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,490
Zichuan Xiu.

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,190
I don't think it's appropriate.

73
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,910
Mei, am I such a person?

74
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,840
Lord Xiu, have you forgotten

75
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,660
you have a date with Lady Ning on this auspicious day?

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,159
The auspicious day?

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,490
The auspicious day.

78
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,560
Today is your birthday...

79
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,710
Of course not.

80
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,550
Your birthday is not today at all.

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, today must be my birthday.

82
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,190
Zichuan Xiu!

83
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,060
Lord Xiu, you promised to play the guqin with Lady Ning.

84
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,410
How could you forget?

85
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,350
Ning, let's play it now.

86
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,560
I won't.

87
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,190
I'm tired.

88
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,510
Lord Xiu, you can play cotton-fluffing by yourself.

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,110
Lord Xiu, please leave.

90
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,170
Play!

91
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,150
The stone I gave you is a piece of rubbish.

92
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,490
Throw it away. I'm a piece of rubbish too.

93
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,710
No need.

94
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
You can leave now.

95
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Zichuan Xiu!

96
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,740
Many refugees have gathered in the suburbs of the Imperial Capital recently.

97
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,510
I suggest taking care of them

98
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,760
in case they become bandits and harm the surroundings.

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,160
There are many refugees.

100
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,960
If we arrange them one by one, it will cost a lot.

101
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,300
Also, more and more refugees

102
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,510
will rush to the Imperial Capital.

103
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,640
It will be more difficult to deal with.

104
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,270
Lord Luo.

105
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,160
Do you have any suggestions?

106
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,390
Lord Yang

107
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,910
handled similar cases before.

108
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,030
He arranged refugees in provinces

109
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,760
near the Imperial Capital.

110
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,310
The young and strong

111
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,600
participated in the local construction.

112
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,659
Each province received cheap labor.

113
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,710
It's natural for them to take care of the old, the weak,

114
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,320
the women, and children.

115
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,670
That's a good idea.

116
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,610
Let's do it then.

117
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,590
Anything else?

118
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,190
The locusts have been spreading lately.

119
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,450
We haven't sprayed medicine to prevent those insects yet.

120
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,910
This medicine has a small amount of poison.

121
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,410
Lord Canxing. Please make a decision.

122
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,360
The new bandits are rampant in Xinji Province.

123
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,830
The Governor asked for a loan to manage it.

124
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,980
But the war in Yuanzhou is around the corner. The treasury is tight.

125
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,090
Please make a decision.

126
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,020
Okay.

127
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,550
My head is numb.

128
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,190
Lord Yang Minghua

129
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,390
was really working hard.

130
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,510
There are many government affairs now.

131
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,320
I can't figure out

132
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,990
all of them for now.

133
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,110
Go get me the documents of Lord Yang Minghua's

134
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,040
handling of government affairs in the past few years

135
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,110
for me to refer to.

136
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,750
Yes.

137
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,200
Princess Ka Dan has moved to Zichuan Ning's Mansion.

138
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,830
Lord Ge Yingxing led his army

139
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,670
to go to Yuanzhou last night.

140
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,170
Di Lin followed him.

141
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,310
They should have left the Imperial Capital by now.

142
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,030
Lord Chieftain is busy with government affairs.

143
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,660
He even called out the documents

144
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,990
you handled a few years ago for reference.

145
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,580
But it didn't help much.

146
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,230
It seems that Lord Chieftain

147
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,000
wants you to leave seclusion early to deal with government affairs.

148
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,410
I should have taken my collections

149
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,060
out and sorted them out long ago.

150
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,910
But I didn't have time.

151
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,930
To be honest,

152
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,600
I have to thank Lord Chieftain

153
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,690
for making me reflect on my mistakes.

154
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,320
By the way, My Lord, there is one more thing.

155
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,580
It was protected by three advanced Royal Escorts last night.

156
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,260
They wanted to send it to Ge Yingxing.

157
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,060
This is the safety information

158
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,260
sent by Princess Ka Dan to the North Clan

159
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,530
to restart the peace talks.

160
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,140
Everyone has been in our mansion for days.

161
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,060
Lady Ning is in a good mood today.

162
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,830
So she specially prepared gifts for you.

163
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,190
Lord Luo Jie.

164
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,680
Lord Ming Yu.

165
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,870
These are for you.

166
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,130
They are said to be the best military books in the world.

167
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,820
Isn't this Lord Xiu's porn...

168
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,020
Anything good happened? Why...

169
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,230
Isn't this mine?

170
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,410
Mei, go on.

171
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,640
It's mine now.

172
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,160
Give it to me.

173
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,660
Princess Ka Dan, you just came to the Imperial Capital.

174
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,380
You must have a lot to buy.

175
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,660
This is for you.

176
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,350
I don't think it's appropriate.

177
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,950
It's fine.

178
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,590
Even if it's to make Lady Ning happy,

179
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,650
you have to take it.

180
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,350
It's fine.

181
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,830
Lord Baichuan, you just recovered.

182
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,820
You should buy something to nourish yourself.

183
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,680
This is for you.

184
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,500
Why does the money smell weird?

185
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,150
It smells like...

186
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,990
Mei, this is for you.

187
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,210
This is my money.

188
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,630
The private money that I've kept for seven years.

189
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,800
Zichuan Ning, wait and see.

190
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,210
I don't want the money back.

191
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,470
Did Lord Xiu offend Lady Ning?

192
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,580
Zichuan Ning.

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
You pretend you can't see me?

194
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,630
Okay.

195
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,800
This rouge...

196
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,030
Ka Dan, the Imperial Capital has a lot of delicious food.

197
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
I'll bring them all to you next time.

198
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,420
What is this?

199
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,550
This seems to be the most expensive

200
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,810
rose serum in the Imperial Capital.

201
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,670
It smells so good.

202
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,190
I should have

203
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,990
changed the cosmetics long ago.

204
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,480
I don't like them anymore.

205
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,000
All of them should be replaced with new ones.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,330
Miss Baichuan, join me.

207
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,100
Sure.

208
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,780
What is this?

209
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,720
Pearl handbag.

210
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,670
It's made of the craftsmanship of the Lin family.

211
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,470
I think there are only two in the Imperial Capital.

212
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,690
I'll tear it now.

213
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,310
We can buy some handbags.

214
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,870
Yes.

215
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,410
The most important thing for Ning

216
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,710
is me, Brother Xiu.

217
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,020
Lord Xiu, aren't you too confident?

218
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,750
Who's Lord Xiu?

219
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,420
Zichuan Ning.

220
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,930
If you continue to pretend not to hear me,

221
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,860
I'll jump from here.

222
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,530
I'll count to three.

223
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,390
Three.

224
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,280
Let's pack up and go.

225
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,550
Two.

226
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,750
If we're late, we won't be able to buy good ones.

227
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,560
One.

228
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,990
One.

229
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,960
Come on.

230
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,840
Wait and see.

231
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Why do you look worse than me?

232
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,680
Yes, I'm badly hurt.

233
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,750
I have nothing now.

234
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
If I don't want to live on the street,

235
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,370
I can only live in the Chieftain's Mansion.

236
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,320
I don't care where you live.

237
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,940
Let's get down to business.

238
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,070
I'm going to live in the Chieftain's Mansion.

239
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,550
Let's get down to business.

240
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm talking business.

241
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,230
How?

242
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,920
This is the task given to me by Lord Ge.

243
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,450
I can only see the documents

244
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,690
handled by Yang Minghua over the past few years

245
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,820
by living in the Chieftain's Mansion.

246
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,450
Then I can check what cards he has.

247
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,950
I am the Deputy Commander of the Royal Escorts.

248
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,610
It's reasonable for me to live there, but you...

249
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,430
Didn't I quarrel with Ning?

250
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,460
I'm kicked out and homeless.

251
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,910
Isn't it reasonable

252
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,200
to ask my uncle to take me in?

253
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,310
Good.

254
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,950
Tell him at the family banquet tonight.

255
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,340
The family banquet?

256
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,660
What family banquet?

257
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,190
Here's the thing. Mei told Baichuan.

258
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,760
Baichuan told Luo Jie.

259
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,880
Luo Jie told Ming Yu.

260
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,590
Ming Yu told me.

261
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,150
Then he asked me to tell you

262
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,720
that you're attending Lord Canxing's family banquet tonight.

263
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,030
I see.

264
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,140
Zichuan Ning told me to attend the family banquet.

265
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,940
That's right.

266
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,750
Uncle, the meat is delicious.

267
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,590
Eat more.

268
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,560
I think this is also delicious.

269
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,550
Delicious.

270
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,350
Ning.

271
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,740
You have to make Xiu full, okay?

272
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,120
Let him eat more.

273
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,830
This is a family banquet after all.

274
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,240
You can't let him starve.

275
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,550
Uncle, who is Xiu?

276
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,110
There are only the two of us here.

277
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,970
My Lord, this is not a family banquet.

278
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,640
If Ning doesn't consider me as her brother,

279
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,630
I'll pretend I don't have her as my sister.

280
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm done. Enjoy...

281
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,950
No, I didn't eat at all.

282
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,400
Goodbye, My Lord.

283
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,790
Xiu.

284
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,440
What's going on?

285
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,340
You were fine yesterday.

286
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,640
Today you are fighting.

287
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
Didn't you agree to play the guqin?

288
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,910
I never said that.

289
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,869
I didn't say that. You got it wrong.

290
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,630
I forgot. It was my fault.

291
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,990
But when can't we play the guqin?

292
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,329
Why are you so angry?

293
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,390
Zichuan Xiu, do you know

294
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,520
you are a shameless scoundrel

295
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,530
who goes back on your word?

296
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,920
Uncle, I have something to do at home.

297
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,800
I'll leave now.

298
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,240
Send Lord Ning out.

299
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,680
Yes.

300
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,850
I think I stepped on something.

301
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,020
But I hope we can check whether Yang Minghua wants to rebel

302
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,350
through these days.

303
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,390
My Lord, please cooperate.

304
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,950
Lord Xiu.

305
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,120
You can stay in the study for the next few days.

306
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,210
Have a good rest.

307
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,550
I really want to sleep a little longer.

308
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,380
Stop pretending to be drunk.

309
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,550
When the false appears as true, the true appears as false.

310
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,320
Alcohol does not make people drunk. Men get themselves drunk.

311
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,980
Drinking makes things worse.

312
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,330
After drinking a little wine,

313
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,300
I will forget the self-blame,

314
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,540
missing, and worry.

315
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,170
Lady Ning...

316
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,250
If you don't tell, your life will be happier.

317
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,040
So much work. Get to work.

318
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,180
Zichuan Xiu has been staying in the Chieftain's Mansion for three days.

319
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,620
I heard he had a fight with Lady Ning.

320
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,020
I hope he didn't disturb Lord Canxing.

321
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,440
A few days ago, to deal with government affairs, Lord Canxing

322
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,750
called up the documents handled several years ago

323
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,080
and read them all night.

324
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,470
After Zichuan Xiu made a fuss,

325
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,420
it must have caused Lord Canxing more trouble.

326
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,690
Take this.

327
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,950
It seems that Lord Canxing has been troubled.

328
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,790
There're so many documents.

329
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,220
Can Lord Canxing finish them in ten days?

330
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,050
It seems to be a little difficult.

331
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,450
If there are more,

332
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,810
he mustn't be able to finish them.

333
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,640
Since Lord Canxing is so diligent,

334
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,080
our Ministry of War should try our best to cooperate.

335
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,390
Yes, I'll do it right away.

336
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,430
Don't miss anything.

337
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,160
Got it.

338
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,830
I can rely on my talent.

339
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,510
Why do I have to do such physical work?

340
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,590
Cut the crap.

341
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,210
Hurry up and finish copying.

342
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,330
Lord Luo, Lord Chieftain is asleep.

343
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,400
Lords. Sorry to disturb you.

344
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,210
Xiu.

345
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,130
Lord Luo is here.

346
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,020
Lord Xiu is...

347
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,150
Xiu drank too much last night.

348
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,950
He hasn't woken up yet.

349
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,310
Look at this place. He did it last night.

350
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,630
Lord Xiu is so drunk.

351
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,980
He might catch a cold.

352
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,230
Lord Luo.

353
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,570
Xiu.

354
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,540
Lord Luo, why are you here?

355
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,760
I brought the documents to Lord Chieftain.

356
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,470
Commander Yang was afraid that the previous documents were not detailed enough,

357
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,740
so he deliberately retrieved the documents for nearly ten years,

358
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,510
hoping to help Lord Chieftain.

359
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,360
Thanks to Commander Yang.

360
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,080
I’ll tell Lord Chieftain.

361
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,650
Okay.

362
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,580
Lord Luo, thank you.

363
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,920
A toast to you.

364
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,970
This place is so dirty.

365
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,510
How can Lord Xiu rest?

366
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,330
Hurry, clean it up.

367
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,630
You must know

368
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,800
this is Lord Canxing's study.

369
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,250
Even a piece of paper is related to government affairs.

370
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,070
Clean this place carefully.

371
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:45,830
Yes.

372
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,870
Lord Luo, it's all cleaned up.

373
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,700
[The most difficult thing to understand is the heart of a woman, which can make people laugh and cry]

374
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,930
I'll leave you two alone.

375
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,800
Goodbye.

376
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,460
Luckily, you prepared this.

377
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,550
Otherwise, we would be in trouble.

378
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,800
Obviously he knows what we are doing.

379
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,880
Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent so many documents.

380
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,910
Obviously, they want us to copy them.

381
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,570
The mission is heavy tonight.

382
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,970
In that case, cut the crap.

383
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,950
Go ahead.

384
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,990
It's your turn.

385
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,710
My Lady.

386
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,830
My Lady.

387
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,590
It's time to practice the guqin.

388
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,590
Practice the guqin? What guqin?

389
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
I won't practice the guqin anymore.

390
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,970
Really?

391
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,310
That's terrible.

392
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,920
Another wonderful melody will be missing in the world.

393
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,310
I think Lord Xiu

394
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,830
will feel very regretful, too.

395
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,850
But Lady Ning,

396
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,320
it's been so many days.

397
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,080
You should calm down.

398
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,300
Why don't we call Lord Xiu back?

399
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,470
I heard that

400
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,310
he has been reflecting on himself

401
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,240
and drinking every night at Lord Canxing's mansion.

402
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,730
Let's call him back

403
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,300
so that he won't embarrass himself outside.

404
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,570
I don't know who you're talking about,

405
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,670
but the house has been quite quiet these days.

406
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,390
If you want someone to come back to make the house lively,

407
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,500
just go.

408
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,820
Yes, My Lady!

409
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,750
Lord Xiu.

410
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,350
Lord Xiu.

411
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,080
Lord Xiu.

412
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,110
What brings you here?

413
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,440
I have good news for you.

414
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,340
You can go back to our mansion now.

415
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,800
Lady Ning has calmed down.

416
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,260
Shouldn't you go back and comfort her?

417
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,540
No, I'm still angry.

418
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,980
I'm not going back.

419
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,010
If you don't go back,

420
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,460
where are you going?

421
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,510
Mei came to see me.

422
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,110
She brought me

423
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,470
a piece of information

424
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,920
that can help us complete this mission successfully.

425
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,850
Yang Minghua found out something?

426
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,830
Zichuan Ning is no longer angry.

427
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,720
What does that have to do with us?

428
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,730
Zichuan Ning is no longer angry.

429
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,430
It means I have to go back to Zichuan Ning's Mansion.

430
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,110
So to maintain her anger,

431
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,400
and for us

432
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,620
to complete the mission successfully,

433
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,730
I decided to sacrifice myself.

434
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,560
So you came here?

435
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,570
[Chunfeng Garden]

436
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,670
Send me the ten most beautiful ladies.

437
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,910
My Lady, Lord Xiu has gone too far.

438
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,870
He said he was going to Chunfeng Garden

439
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,150
and asked for ten ladies.

440
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,470
How many?

441
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,990
Ten. And he said he wouldn't come back until he gets drunk.

442
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,420
But, My Lady.

443
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,510
In my opinion, even if Lord Xiu goes,

444
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,830
he can't do anything

445
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,790
with his financial situation.

446
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,950
Calm down, My Lady.

447
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,630
This is her fortune today.

448
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,350
What is it?

449
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,340
What is it?

450
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,350
I can't say anything else. Otherwise, you'll be charged.

451
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,830
Say something.

452
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,790
Tell us.

453
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,990
Why not?

454
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,120
If I really say it...

455
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,580
Sister Linglong.

456
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,550
Can you tell my fortune?

457
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,390
Okay.

458
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,630
Come on.

459
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,820
Payi's unique blue bracelet.

460
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,160
You're from Payi?

461
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,170
How do you know I'm from Payi?

462
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,550
What else do you know?

463
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,230
Tell us.

464
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,330
Tell us.

465
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,490
It’s a secret.

466
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,320
Please tell us.

467
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,480
Okay. But remember,

468
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,350
don't go out today.

469
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,740
Or you'll suffer a bloodshed disaster.

470
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,810
A bloodshed disaster?

471
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,270
What bloodshed disaster?

472
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,310
-Tell mine.
-Okay.

473
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,790
Tell mine.

474
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,910
I can't go out today.

475
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,250
You will deliver this.

476
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,090
Don't worry. I'll deliver it.

477
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,840
I made it up.

478
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,570
Chunfeng Garden is not simple.

479
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,610
My Lord, the medical record of the Imperial Hospital has arrived.

480
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,080
He is exhausted and can't sleep at night.

481
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,230
It seems that Zichuan Xiu

482
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,750
has caused Lord Canxing a lot of trouble.

483
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,510
In the daytime, Lord Canxing

484
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,260
has been researching the documents for these years.

485
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,670
And we gave him some more last time.

486
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,470
He's really tired.

487
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,430
Zichuan Xiu is capable,

488
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,290
but he's very capricious.

489
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,710
He'll definitely influence Lord Canxing there.

490
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,170
I'd better not let him bother Lord Canxing.

491
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,340
Okay.

492
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,240
Fortunately, we prepared early.

493
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,810
We copied the focus of the documents.

494
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,750
They kicked us out this morning.

495
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,530
These things are hidden in the details.

496
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,760
Let's begin.

497
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,350
There's something wrong with these provinces.

498
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,960
Take Xincheng for example.

499
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,760
It took in one-quarter of the refugees.

500
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,030
Many places

501
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,950
avoid refugees.

502
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,070
Why did Xincheng Province

503
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
take in such a large group of people?

504
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,390
That's the problem.

505
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,250
An iron mine was found in Xincheng Province.

506
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,070
They reported it to Lord Chieftain.

507
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,270
Lord Chieftain didn't approve of the mining.

508
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,570
So you mean

509
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,670
these refugees went to mine in private mines?

510
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,670
It's very likely.

511
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,430
Because there are many wars in Yuanzhou.

512
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,140
They have a large demand for weapons.

513
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,060
If that's the case,

514
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,590
Yang Minghua must have made a fortune in war.

515
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,380
By the way, something is wrong with Dake Province.

516
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,030
The provisions sent to Yuanzhou

517
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,960
would gather there for a while.

518
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,550
But there will be some

519
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,430
losses on the way to Yuanzhou

520
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,490
in the final gathering.

521
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,160
The data shows

522
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,640
that the consumption is within the normal range.

523
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,430
Actually, looking at the data in recent years,

524
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,560
there's no problem.

525
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,910
But I compared it

526
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,120
with the losses in years before Luo Minghai took it over.

527
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,040
The difference was very large.

528
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,030
They want to trick us this time.

529
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,790
They were trapped by their own cleverness.

530
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,250
Alright, since the investigation is clear,

531
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,150
the end of the ten days is coming.

532
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,460
Let's split up and take action.

533
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,850
I'll deal with the provisions and you go to the iron mine?

534
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,910
Okay, what are you going to do?

535
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,370
If Yang Minghua is really

536
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,150
involved in the Dake Province's provisions case,

537
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,870
I'll use it for the people.

538
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,230
Don't you need Yang Minghua's seal?

539
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,900
The seal is with Tieshou?

540
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,050
I'll kill him then.

541
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,690
Wait, why?

542
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,460
I had three men

543
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,050
escort Princess Ka Dan's token to Yuanzhou.

544
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,680
They were killed on the way.

545
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,680
I suspect Tieshou did it.

546
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,950
If he is Yang Minghua's killer,

547
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,580
let's remove one of Yang Minghua's arms.

548
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,910
Not only do you want revenge.

549
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,910
He tried to kill me during the trial.

550
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,070
Leave it to me.

551
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,450
Since I found the seal with him,

552
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,850
I began to observe him.

553
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,600
Every day at 9 p.m., he would go outside the city

554
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,460
to fetch mountain spring water for Yang Minghua to use in making iron.

555
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,830
Who are you?

556
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,000
Zichuan Xiu.

557
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,950
My Lord, I've verified it. It's indeed a private mine.

558
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,680
And all the income flows to the Imperial Capital.

559
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,910
Have the explosion points been set up?

560
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,110
Everything is ready.

561
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,980
Blow it up.

562
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,580
So troublesome.

563
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,500
You want me to fake Lord Yang's order?

564
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,030
This is Yang Minghua's private food storage.

565
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,500
What do you think he wants?

566
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,020
There are 200,000 refugees outside the Imperial Capital.

567
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,480
They won't starve to death

568
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,400
if we distribute grains.

569
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,610
Understand?

570
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,430
You want me to go?

571
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,340
Of course, you should go.

572
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,220
I have a more important task.

573
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,320
Yang Minghua is managing government affairs tomorrow.

574
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Time is precious.

575
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,840
Hurry up and come back soon.

576
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,100
Go now.

577
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,690
It's time to face Ning.

578
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,949
My Lady.

579
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,550
My Lady, Lord Xiu is back.

580
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,320
He's coming this way. Stop drinking.

581
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,719
Who is Lord Xiu?

582
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,020
It's none of my business whether he comes back or not.

583
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,510
My Lady.

584
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,060
Who are you?

585
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,920
Lord Xiu, you've gone too far.

586
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,180
You've left for so long.

587
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,840
Lady Ning has been suffering.

588
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,250
She cried

589
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,870
and drank every day.

590
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,900
I'm Xiu.

591
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,420
Brother Xiu, you're back.

592
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,840
I've been waiting for you for so long.

593
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,270
It's been seven years.

594
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,910
Mei, your lady is drunk.

595
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,330
Make some hangover soup.

596
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,000
Yes, I'll be right back.

597
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,670
Who are you?

598
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,430
I'm Xiu.

599
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,300
Zichuan Xiu.

600
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,310
Fine, I shouldn't have pissed you off.

601
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,510
I shouldn't have left you for seven years.

602
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,200
It doesn't matter if you leave for a long time.

603
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,990
Listen.

604
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,990
You've been sending me things.

605
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,210
People say they're rubbish.

606
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,960
But...

607
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,860
But I know these are all your treasures.

608
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,790
Brother Xiu,

609
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,190
you only hold it in your heart when you're wronged.

610
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,300
When you were sad, you would smile to get it through.

611
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,400
When you missed me,

612
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,800
you would send me these treasures.

613
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,730
Do you think I don't know?

614
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,610
How could I not know?

615
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,440
Brother Xiu, am I right?

616
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,210
Sit down for a while.

617
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,430
Don't throw up. Have some water.

618
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,880
Here's the water. Here.

619
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,260
Slowly.

620
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,920
One more sip.

621
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,100
Who are you?

622
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,400
I'm Xiu. Zichuan Xiu.

623
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,320
Why didn't you go home?

624
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,390
I'm back now.

625
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,510
No.

626
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,910
You've been avoiding me since you came back to the Imperial Capital.

627
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,310
If it weren't for Miss Baichuan,

628
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,470
you wouldn't have come home.

629
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,960
And every time I wanted to go shopping with you,

630
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,510
you always avoided me.

631
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
Do you think I want to play so much?

632
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,580
That's because...

633
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,230
I was wrong. I...

634
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,560
You didn't do anything wrong. I was wrong.

635
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,340
I thought I knew you the best.

636
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,120
I really thought I knew you so well when I was young.

637
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,140
I used to know what you were thinking

638
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,940
and what you were talking about.

639
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,620
But after you came back this time,

640
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,990
I have no idea

641
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,780
what you're thinking

642
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,260
and what you care about.

643
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,780
Brother Xiu.

644
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,460
Do you not like me anymore?

645
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,350
Do you hate me?

646
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,600
I don't hate you. I just...

647
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,100
Brother Xiu, you know what?

648
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,450
I had been waiting so long

649
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,190
for the duet.

650
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,430
I was so happy.

651
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,110
I chose the most beautiful dress.

652
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,150
I also chose the best song.

653
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,470
How could you forget it?

654
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,270
You've changed.

655
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,750
In the past,

656
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,340
you always prioritized my matters.

657
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,250
Okay, stop crying.

658
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,910
Don't touch my fringe.

659
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,390
You've changed.

660
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,220
You don't care about me anymore.

661
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,510
But I've changed too.

662
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,510
In the past, I wouldn't be

663
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,760
angry about these things.

664
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,710
Didn't you just bring something delicious

665
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,260
for Miss Baichuan?

666
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,180
You just forgot to play.

667
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,640
What's the big deal?

668
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,970
But... But I...

669
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,750
I mind.

670
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,500
I feel sad.

671
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,830
I'm petty.

672
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,180
Brother Xiu.

673
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,790
It's not good to grow up.

674
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,340
I don't want to grow up.

675
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,980
I don't want to like you anymore.

676
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,530
Ning.

677
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,130
Ning.

678
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,560
How could I hate you?

679
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,260
I hate myself.

680
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,730
I hate myself for breaking my promise.

681
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,190
I promised

682
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,590
I would always be with you and protect you.

683
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,190
But I left the Imperial Capital and you.

684
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,080
I hate being timid.

685
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,080
Every day in Yuanzhou,

686
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,530
I wanted to write to you, but I dared not.

687
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,600
You don't know how happy I was

688
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
to come back to the Imperial Capital

689
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,440
and to see you

690
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,990
again.

691
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,960
You seem to have grown up.

692
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,360
Yet you seem to haven't changed at all.

693
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,960
You're still the same.

694
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,430
As for me,

695
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,660
I don't know if I'm still the same person I used to be.

696
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,590
I just don't want to live here.

697
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,570
I don't dare to see you every day.

698
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,840
As to what I'm saying now,

699
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,240
I didn't dare to tell you.

700
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,670
Ning.

701
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,140
Ning.

702
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,490
You're right.

703
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,360
It's not happy to grow up.
