[Episode 9]

4
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,470
Tieshou has never come back late.

5
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,789
Go take a look.

6
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,470
Yes.

7
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,940
What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

8
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,490
I've just received a piece of news.

9
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,130
A mining accident happened in Xincheng Province.

10
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,590
Are there any casualties?

11
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,320
We're still investigating it.

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,320
It will be a good thing if there are no casualties.

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,190
Yes.

14
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,870
My Lord, there's one more thing.

15
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,180
This morning,

16
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,150
someone took the document signed by you

17
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,190
to open the granary in Dake Province

18
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,030
and help the victims of the natural calamity.

19
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,790
My Lord!

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,880
My Lord, Tieshou was assassinated in the suburbs.

21
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,310
His body has just been carried back.

22
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,780
Investigate this case thoroughly.

23
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,400
After I come back from the Chieftain's Mansion,

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
report it to me in detail.

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,760
My Lord, Lord Chieftain is here.

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
Lord Canxing.

27
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,410
Lord Yang.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,140
I've been so tired from dealing with

29
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,720
the political affairs these ten days.

30
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,730
But I thought about it after that.

31
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,990
You've been working like this for many years.

32
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,070
I sincerely admire you.

33
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,710
You're amazing.

34
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,950
I'm flattered, Lord Canxing.

35
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,020
This is my duty as I'm the Commander-in-Chief.

36
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,990
I've made up my mind.

37
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,180
From now on, you'll be in charge of handling

38
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,390
all the important and trivial matters in Zichuan.

39
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,079
I won't interfere anymore,

40
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,680
and I don't have the ability to interfere.

41
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,890
Why?

42
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,230
I had a dream last night.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,270
I saw an old man with a white beard.

44
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
He came to my bedside,

45
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,510
and lifted me up at one stroke.

46
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,090
He mentioned my name and asked me,

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,400
"Zichuan Canxing,

48
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,430
tell me what politics and power are."

49
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,910
He really scared me.

50
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,270
I just wanted to see who this man was.

51
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,690
Then...

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,120
Then I woke up from my dream.

53
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,150
When I went to the toilet today,

54
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,909
I suddenly seemed to figure it out.

55
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,170
It's complicated.

56
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,350
That... That was too scary.

57
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,270
By the way,

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,790
there is another very important thing,

59
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,630
because for many years,

60
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,070
I've been so eager to talk about this secret.

61
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,290
But I've finally figured it out in the past ten days.

62
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,090
I can't hide it from you anymore.

63
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,790
What is this?

64
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,800
My elder brother left it to me.

65
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm a weak man.

66
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,150
I'm far less capable than you.

67
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,860
But there are always some ministers slandering you and saying that you want to rebel.

68
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,720
In that case, my brother gave this to me

69
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,950
when he was dying.

70
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,870
He said if one day you really want to rebel,

71
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,030
the object in this box

72
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,670
would be the key to control you.

73
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,750
My brother

74
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,180
planted a spy by your side.

75
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,140
Tongchui?

76
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,410
I know you're loyal to Zichuan.

77
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,990
If this object remains with me,

78
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,270
I can't bear to keep it.

79
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,870
I might as well give this

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,770
to you today.

81
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,070
In this way, from now on,

82
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,510
there won't be any ill feelings between you and me.

83
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,670
There won't be any ill feelings.

84
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,510
You trust me so much.

85
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,909
I really don't know how to repay your kindness.

86
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,790
But there is one thing I want to tell you.

87
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,620
My trusted subordinate Tieshou

88
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,310
had an accident when he went out

89
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,110
to do a task for me today.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
I want to take a day off.

91
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,110
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,150
You don't have to mention this to me.

93
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,440
You can make your own arrangements.

94
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,470
Alright. I won't disturb you any longer.

95
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,710
I have to go back.

96
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,350
This is the coal clamp which Tieshou usually used.

97
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,110
I'll wash it.

98
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,710
How many years have you been working for me?

99
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,600
Eight years.

100
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,120
I started two years later than Tieshou.

101
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,669
Both of you are my closest men.

102
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,520
Losing either of you is like losing either of my arms.

103
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,929
From now on, I'll be in charge of these chores such as adding coal and fetching water.

104
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,530
You two were close to each other, weren't you?

105
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,990
Yes, we once swore that

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,330
though we had not been born on the same day,

107
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,630
we wished to die on the same day.

108
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,220
Back then, Yuanxing,

109
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,080
Ge Yingxing and I once made a similar vow, too.

110
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,560
Unfortunately, this vow has been broken.

111
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,960
He passed away first.

112
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,670
Now that he has passed away, are you very sad?

113
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,800
I still don't dare to take a look at Tieshou's body up till now.

114
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,170
I'm talking about Yuanxing.

115
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,190
I only found out today that

116
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,910
you made friends with Yuanxing much earlier than me.

117
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,150
What is your mission?

118
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,430
If you rebel,

119
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,780
I'll kill you on the spot.

120
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,860
If you don't rebel,

121
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,550
I'll be your follower till my death.

122
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,320
Do you think I will rebel?

123
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,670
You and Lord Yuanxing were close friends and loyal to each other.

124
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,830
You won't rebel.

125
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,840
I'll be your follower till my death.

126
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,230
We were close friends and loyal to each other?

127
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,430
But I just want to rebel.

128
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,190
Do you know

129
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,150
how miserable it feels when one is suspected

130
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,230
by his closest person?

131
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,290
Liquor tastes sour.

132
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,630
To be honest,

133
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,410
even till now, I still don't understand why you and Ge Yingxing

134
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,440
like drinking it.

135
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,080
[The Memorial Tablet of Zichuan's Chief Saint]

136
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,350
I just like good wine, delicacies,

137
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
fine horse and precious swords.

138
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,750
But you said I was too afraid of being poor.

139
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,840
Yes, I was just a beggar back then.

140
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,230
You took a fancy to me,

141
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,470
and sent me to a martial arts school in Yuanzhou.

142
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,620
Since then, you, Ge Yingxing and I

143
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,510
had fought together on the battlefield.

144
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,350
You gave me everything.

145
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,220
Later, you were seriously injured.

146
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,080
But you still didn't forget to save me from the piles of dead people.

147
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,150
From then on, I swore that

148
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,280
I would protect you and Zichuan all my life.

149
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,110
However, you passed away.

150
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,350
You suddenly passed away.

151
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,910
I couldn't accept it.

152
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,830
I was even seriously ill because of that.

153
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,860
Later, I thought

154
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,990
I couldn't fall sick, right?

155
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,140
I have to protect Zichuan's century-old achievements

156
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,950
for you.

157
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,840
Everyone thinks that I want to rebel.

158
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,380
I don't care.

159
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,270
As long as you trust me,

160
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,520
it'll be enough.

161
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,030
However,

162
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:28,350
you still don't trust me.

163
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,750
Back then, you led the army to fight,

164
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,100
and you knew the enemies so well that you always defeated them.

165
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,620
But why do you think that I want to rebel?

166
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:59,300
I guess I can't let you down.

167
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,470
What is it?

168
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,670
W-w-what now?

169
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,870
Who are you? Why are you here?

170
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,930
I already answered

171
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,940
this question hundreds of times last night.

172
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,020
I'm Zichuan Xiu!

173
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,820
Go away. I don't know you.

174
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,490
That was not what you said last night.

175
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,070
That's impossible.

176
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,200
I don't know a rascal like you.

177
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,110
A rascal?

178
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:09,680
Fine.

179
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,040
Ask her if you don't believe me.

180
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,700
My Lady,

181
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,960
you did forgive Lord Xiu last night.

182
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,170
What did I do last night?

183
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,310
How come your face is like this?

184
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,610
You don't remember what happened?

185
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,790
This is really a good question.

186
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,960
It's all my fault.

187
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,350
Just tell me what I should do to make you forgive me.

188
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,120
I'm willing to do anything.

189
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,020
You're really willing to do anything?

190
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,800
Do you like it?

191
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,950
I...

192
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,480
I like it.

193
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,869
Do you have a veil or something like that?

194
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,630
I think I'll look more stylish if I wear a veil.

195
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,470
Of course.

196
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,290
It's inappropriate, right?

197
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,910
No.

198
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,060
Now it's really not the right time for us to do something like this.

199
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,950
I, Zichuan Xiu...

200
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,890
I, Zichuan Xiu....

201
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,080
Swear allegiance to Zichuan Ning till death.

202
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,840
Swear allegiance to Zichuan Ning till death.

203
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,440
She is the prettiest woman in Zichuan. I'll only look at her

204
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,100
and I'll do anything she says.

205
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,850
She is the prettiest woman in Zichuan. I'll only look at her

206
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,600
and I'll do anything she says.

207
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,060
I will not avoid her. I will look for her.

208
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,310
If she asks me about something,

209
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,050
I must tell her the truth.

210
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,750
If she doesn't ask me,

211
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,830
II will still take the initiative to say it.

212
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,320
What did you say?

213
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,390
I will not avoid her.

214
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,030
I will look for her.

215
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,020
I will not avoid her.

216
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,360
I will look for her.

217
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,420
If she asks me about something,

218
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,890
I must tell her the truth.

219
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
If she doesn't ask me,

220
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,590
I will still take the initiative to say it.

221
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,090
Also, I must not face difficulties alone.

222
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,230
I need to help Ning become stronger.

223
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,110
Then we can face difficulties together.

224
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,070
Also, I must not face difficulties alone.

225
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,670
I need to help Ning become stronger.

226
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,930
Then we can face difficulties together.

227
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
I, Zichuan Ning...

228
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,320
Ning, you said it incorrectly. Zichuan Xiu.

229
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,140
I, Zichuan Ning, will always love and protect Xiu.

230
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,440
Was I really like that?

231
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,420
You're really not lying to me?

232
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,180
So you really swore?

233
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
Of course.

234
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,690
So, can you keep your promise?

235
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,900
You hesitated.

236
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:26,590
I didn't hesitate.

237
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,450
I knew you couldn't do it. Go away!

238
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,190
I...

239
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,690
What? I told you to leave, but you didn't leave.

240
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,150
You even said that you will do anything I say.

241
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,020
I'll leave.

242
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,750
Baichuan.

243
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,990
My Lord, your face...

244
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,640
Don't worry about such a trivial matter.

245
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,800
Why are you here?

246
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,410
Did you wait for me here all night?

247
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,030
Yes.

248
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,630
I have a question for you.

249
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,100
No need to ask. I've never loved you.

250
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,860
My Lord, be serious.

251
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,790
Okay.

252
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,300
When did you start to

253
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,630
suspect me?

254
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,200
Does it matter?

255
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,870
Yes.

256
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,970
During the trial in court?

257
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,170
When I assassinated Princess Ka Dan?

258
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,580
Did you really want to kill Ka Dan?

259
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,710
With Ka Dan's height,

260
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,540
you obviously wanted to hurt her shoulder by shooting the arrow.

261
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,000
During the trial in court,

262
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,990
if you had been determined to kill me,

263
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,020
you would have been exempted from flogging.

264
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,990
When on earth did you start to suspect me?

265
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,390
When we were in Yuanzhou.

266
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,910
Once when the imperial court sent out army provisions,

267
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,230
there was flood on the way.

268
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,090
Not a single grain was reaped.

269
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,670
But only Luo Bo and I

270
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,510
knew this news back then.

271
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,030
We were out of food for more than half a month.

272
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,390
Yes.

273
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,630
In order to stabilize the morale of the army, I blocked the news,

274
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,550
and proclaimed that the new army provisions had been sent out

275
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,670
and we would get them after waiting for a few days.

276
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,190
I see.

277
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,630
I was the only one who divided the army provisions into many portions.

278
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,670
I only ate the least amount of food every day.

279
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,480
After that, I secretly applied to send the military provisions to us.

280
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
But Commander Yang didn't approve.

281
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,820
He blocked the news for the same reason.

282
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,310
In other words,

283
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,270
the person who knew this thing

284
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,830
must be Yang Minghua's spy.

285
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,770
In order to let the spy escape unscathed, he disclosed the news deliberately.

286
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,150
So you've been laughing at me and treating me

287
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,480
as a contemptible rascal all the time?

288
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,470
No.

289
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,830
Baichuan, you're our friend.

290
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,910
I'm your friend?

291
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,810
In the end, when Luo Jie

292
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,040
was so hungry that he kept complaining,

293
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,090
you were the one who shared your food with them.

294
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,940
In my opinion,

295
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,190
being a spy is not suitable for you.

296
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,920
I'm not competent in my job.

297
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,370
No, you just made the right choice.

298
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,700
At this point,

299
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,230
this choice is not difficult anymore.

300
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,000
Although I've been under the command of the Ministry of War,

301
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,500
in the trial that day,

302
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,100
in order to kill you,

303
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,300
no one cared about the safety of my life.

304
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,870
I was just a pawn

305
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,800
that could be thrown away anytime.

306
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,190
Besides, after returning to the Imperial Capital,

307
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,670
I saw what he did.

308
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,350
It was not for Zichuan, but for himself.

309
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,050
It was really disappointing.

310
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
In that case, compared with him,

311
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,040
am I the person who has made you feel more touched?

312
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,910
No, you're more stupid and it's easier to control you.

313
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,340
I see.

314
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,650
My honesty touched you.

315
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,230
As long as you're happy, it'll be fine.

316
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,760
Since we've talked so much,

317
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,480
I have a question for you.

318
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,630
What is it?

319
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,260
If you're the spy by my side,

320
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,790
what is my code name?

321
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,300
My Pig.

322
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,380
Didn't the hearts of you guys ache

323
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,190
when you said these words that were against your conscience?

324
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,210
No. Only when I mentioned your code name

325
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,790
did I think that it was justifiable.

326
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,380
Forget it.

327
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,620
Anyway, you're just like me now.

328
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,580
But I'm a pig under the sun.

329
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,260
Have a seat.

330
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,070
How do you feel now?

331
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,190
I'm ignorant and happy.

332
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,270
A pawn can't be ignorant. Can you do it?

333
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,090
Not everyone is born to have the right to choose.

334
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,320
Yang Minghua probably doesn't even know who I am.

335
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,820
He selected some orphans from orphanages in various places

336
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,350
every year and raised them.

337
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,630
Then he picked some well-qualified kids and trained them secretly

338
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,510
for later use.

339
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
Let's stop talking about it.

340
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,390
Let bygones be bygones.

341
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,110
However,

342
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,510
can you give me that booklet where there are

343
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,370
records about my words and deeds?

344
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,160
I'm such an excellent young man.

345
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,430
I'll certainly write something like a memoir or a memo

346
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,230
in the future. I'll need that booklet by that time.

347
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,890
Then there might be a new crack between us.

348
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,690
What did you write?

349
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,360
Zichuan Xiu went to the toilet eight times today.

350
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,430
I suspect that there is something wrong with his kidneys.

351
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,390
Zichuan Xiu disappeared again before the battle started today.

352
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,450
Ming Yu told me that

353
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,760
he was so scared that he wetted his pants,

354
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,870
so he went to the mountain behind our barracks to change his clothes.

355
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,860
Due to Ming Yu's good moral character, what he said is quite credible.

356
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,390
Those are some examples of the things I wrote.

357
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,270
Now there is a chance to make up for this crack.

358
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,960
Do you want to seize the chance?

359
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,350
A chance?

360
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,980
To be exact, it's a mission.

361
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,160
I will do my best

362
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,900
to finish your task.

363
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,260
Please give me the order.

364
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:38,930
Okay.

365
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,560
Let's

366
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,190
go to the Chunfeng Garden.

367
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,600
Fill it up.

368
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,470
This way, please.

369
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,420
It's been a long time since you came here last time.

370
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,750
This way, please.

371
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,740
Mingyue, we have some distinguished guests.

372
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,940
Would you like to invite them to come up?

373
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,780
The real distinguished guest is over there.

374
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,560
Look. Although she's wearing leisure clothes,

375
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,170
those clothes are made of superior-quality material.

376
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,790
At first glance, she may look plain.

377
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,860
But after you look at her more carefully, there are various changes with the changing of light.

378
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,260
Such fabric is not only expensive,

379
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,230
but it's also exclusively offered to

380
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,600
those officials whose positions are higher than a certain level.

381
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,860
Besides, she came to the Chunfeng Garden

382
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,440
not for fun,

383
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,090
because she's a girl.

384
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,150
Sir.

385
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,130
What's more interesting is that

386
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,700
even though she's under the risk of exposing her own identity,

387
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,980
she still tries her best to keep that package safe first.

388
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,930
I think what's inside must be more interesting.

389
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,790
[Qi, Mingyue]

390
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,680
Or it's something more valuable.

391
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,490
Go invite that guest to come up.

392
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,390
I want to see her personally.

393
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,070
Sir, let me help you.

394
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,880
This is the strongest wine in the Chunfeng Garden.

395
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,020
Do you have the guts to drink several cups of it with me?

396
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,160
Only after drinking some wine can you let your guard down

397
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,260
and feel relaxed.

398
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,350
By that time, if you have any questions,

399
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,950
I'll tell you everything.

400
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,270
Let's go on drinking.

401
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,390
Sir.

402
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,510
It's the wax seal of the Chieftain's Mansion.

403
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,240
You want to know the content of the letter, right?

404
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,710
Who are you? How did you get in?

405
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,870
Read this secret letter if you want.

406
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,050
Let me help you.

407
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,460
Just open

408
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,640
this secret letter.

409
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,790
It's not a big deal.

410
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,020
It's empty. You fooled me.

411
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,630
Who on earth are you?

412
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,500
At a time like this now,

413
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,440
I should be the one asking you

414
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,170
why you stole the information.

415
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,470
I don't know what you're talking about.

416
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,280
I once came to the Chunfeng Garden before,

417
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,210
and I found that Linglong was secretly in touch

418
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,930
with a beggar.

419
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,890
I only had some concerns about it before,

420
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,630
and I was still unsure

421
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,590
whether you were delivering information.

422
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,120
That's why I specially set up this trap today.

423
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,830
A high-ranking military officer who tried to conceal something,

424
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,630
and a secret letter covered with the chieftain's wax seal.

425
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,630
It was quite attractive, wasn't it?

426
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,610
According to my judgment,

427
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,070
when the girls of the Chunfeng Garden

428
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,930
had fun with these officials and aristocrats,

429
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,270
they could get a lot of useful information.

430
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,770
Then you could gain profit by selling

431
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,220
the information to those who needed it.

432
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,430
This is what Miss Linglong did, right?

433
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,390
I'm interested in information.

434
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,310
So what?

435
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
You want to make me get into trouble?

436
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,100
You have to survive first! Qi!

437
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,930
Let me explain.

438
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,060
You were too cruel when you tried to hurt me.

439
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,110
That's not all that he can do.

440
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,650
As long as he's willing to do it,

441
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,110
after he cuts your tendons, he can reconnect them.

442
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,430
But you're not so lucky today.

443
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,400
Wait.

444
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,670
Baichuan, wake up.

445
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,160
Your boss is being bullied now.

446
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,060
Why don't you help me at once?

447
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,310
You're not drunk?

448
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Hit him hard. I've wanted to beat him up for a long time.

449
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,110
Just wait.

450
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,080
Miss Mingyue.

451
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,900
Can you ask this young man

452
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,970
to calm down a bit?

453
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,220
For the news that the Chunfeng Garden stole the information,

454
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,340
if you can't beat me to death today,

455
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,210
I'll definitely spread it out.

456
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,840
What on earth do you want?

457
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,750
I want to see the mastermind behind you.

458
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,950
I've never seen that superior, either.

459
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,420
I also don't know who it is.

460
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,670
But you definitely know how to contact him, don't you?

461
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,880
In our place,

462
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,120
information is for exchange.

463
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,820
Of course there is information.

464
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,650
Besides, it'll be far beyond your expectations.

465
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,320
To be honest,

466
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,830
I have a close relationship with the big shots in the family.

467
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,310
Today, Lord Chieftain will personally hold a banquet.

468
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,830
There will be a dish prepared with pufferfish at this banquet.

469
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,690
If you're really

470
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,910
so well-informed,

471
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,310
you can definitely

472
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,440
confirm such a trivial matter, right?

473
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,830
My Lord.

474
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,070
Are you still angry?

475
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,590
I'm not angry.

476
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,720
I'm just sad.

477
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,810
The Zichuan Family has treated him well.

478
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,780
I didn't expect that he would

479
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,790
really rebel.

480
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,530
My Lord, in this investigation,

481
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,670
though we found that he secretly set up a granary

482
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,930
and ran a private mine,

483
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,690
you can't be sure that he's going to rebel, right?

484
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,590
There are many high-ranking officials

485
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,100
who tries to gain profit through devious means.

486
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,950
Right.

487
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,000
Besides, this time, I blew up his mine

488
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,230
and distributed his food.

489
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,350
I even killed his trusted subordinate.

490
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,340
To some extent, it was like hurting his muscles and bones.

491
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,950
Yes.

492
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,910
You two did a great job this time.

493
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,870
Come on.

494
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,040
I don't dare to let you do this.

495
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,990
A toast to you.

496
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,510
I just did what I should do.

497
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,470
Sit down.

498
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,710
We're family. Cheers.

499
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,290
It was our duty.

500
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,030
My Lord.

501
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,660
Before Lord Ge left,

502
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,320
he already made the strategy with you.

503
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,400
We just followed the plan.

504
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,700
We didn't contribute much, right?

505
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,510
Good.

506
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,490
You're young and talented, but you're not greedy for taking credits or aggressive.

507
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,410
The Zichuan Family has a promising future.

508
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,700
Here's the pufferfish, right?

509
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,180
Yes.

510
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,550
Xiu.

511
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,140
This pufferfish is your favorite.

512
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Come on. Hurry up.

513
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,710
Okay.

514
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,270
Si Yilin.

515
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,390
Taste it, too.

516
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,920
However, I'm still a little worried.

517
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,790
My Lord, what are you worried about?

518
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,680
You made such a big scene.

519
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,190
With Yang Minghua's intelligence,

520
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,130
he must know that you're going against him secretly.

521
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,190
Will he do something desperate when the situation is so bad for him?

522
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,190
If he wanted to rebel before,

523
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,770
he would dispatch the troops hastily.

524
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,230
But with his current wealth and provisions,

525
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,470
he won't be able to hang in for so long.

526
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,330
If his conspiracy is really exposed,

527
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,660
Lord Ge will come from Yuanzhou to help us.

528
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,150
What Xiu and I need to do

529
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,510
is to protect you and Zichuan.

530
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,280
We're waiting for Lord Ge's troops to rescue the monarch.

531
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,239
If his purpose is not to rebel this time,

532
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,639
but for money,

533
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,010
then what we did was a warning to him.

534
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,429
We'd like to tell Lord Commander-in-Chief

535
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,750
not to go too far.

536
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,409
There are people like us

537
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,880
beside Lord Chieftain.

538
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,310
That's great.

539
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,300
But the Imperial Guards consist of many people.

540
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,330
Is our chance to win big enough?

541
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,980
Although the number of our Royal Escorts

542
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,480
is much smaller than that of the Imperial Guards,

543
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,810
you don't have to worry.

544
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,469
We Royal Escorts are loyal to you and are willing to sacrifice our lives

545
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,730
to ensure your safety.

546
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,590
Safety comes first. Zichuan's safety comes first.

547
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:45,929
My Lord,

548
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,570
I've expanded the number of Royal Escorts privately.

549
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,300
Now all of them have assembled.

550
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,580
I'm going to give them a lecture.

551
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,830
Okay. Come back soon.

552
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,430
Wait.

553
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,000
Now the weather is unpredictable.

554
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,260
The Royal Escorts are the bodyguards in the Chieftain's Mansion.

555
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,380
They're quite essential. I'm entrusting this troop to you.

556
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,350
Don't worry, My Lord.

557
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,290
Go now.

558
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,830
Xiu, don't go.

559
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,980
Eat more pufferfish.

560
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,710
From now on,

561
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,260
you and he

562
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,830
should often come to the Chieftain's Mansion

563
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,470
to visit me, who is old man.

564
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,950
My Lord, you are still young.

565
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,310
You're still strong and have high aspirations at your age, and you're rejuvenated.

566
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,310
How can you call yourself an old man?

567
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,910
I know that

568
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,370
I'm not as capable as my elder brother in all aspects.

569
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,970
Back then, if my brother hadn't died suddenly,

570
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,050
and Ning hadn't been so young,

571
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,630
I wouldn't have

572
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,210
become the chieftain so reluctantly.

573
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,950
Now Ning will be 18 years old soon.

574
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,620
After the overall situation stabilizes,

575
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,220
I'll give my position to her.

576
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,550
By that time, she'll still need

577
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,020
a loyal and reliable person to assist her.

578
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,380
In fact, the one without any disloyalty

579
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,550
is her family and lover.

580
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,930
Xiu, do you understand?

581
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,580
Of course.

582
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,030
As her family,

583
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,630
I'll protect Ning faithfully.

584
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,610
Actually,

585
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,680
as long as you treat Ning and Zichuan well,

586
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,320
those rules can be broken.

587
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,740
Xiu,

588
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,920
if I entrust Ning to you,

589
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,190
I can rest assured.

590
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,540
Because your surname is Zichuan after all.

591
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,550
We'll discuss all the official affairs tomorrow.

592
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,460
Please leave, my lords.

593
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,760
My Lord, have you made up your mind?

594
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,760
Aren't you going to help?

595
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,550
Yes.

596
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,390
Ming Hui and Fang Jing have long arrived, right?

597
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,210
Yes, they've arrived.

598
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,720
Di Lin has arrived in Yuanzhou too.

599
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,800
According to the latest report about the battle, he has fought with the North Clan.

600
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,080
Don't worry, My Lord.

601
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,200
Di Lin knows what to do.

602
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,090
You said there would be pufferfish. There was pufferfish indeed.

603
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,740
Alright. Let's talk about the transaction.

604
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,210
I think you know

605
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,890
the rules in this industry.

606
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,490
As for the map of the mechanisms in the Chieftain's Mansion,

607
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,870
the deployment plans of those visible and covert sentries,

608
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,760
and the travel time and routes

609
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,970
of the ministers in the family,

610
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,160
I dare to sell the information. Do you dare to buy it?

611
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,850
So you're really...

612
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,590
Don't say it if you've found out about my identity.

613
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,590
Come and hear the news in three days.

614
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,910
Okay.

615
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,270
Anyway, Zichuan Xiu

616
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,450
is so stupid.

617
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,060
I guess even till now, he still doesn't know

618
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,260
why I'm angry.

619
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,410
I think this is also his lovely trait and the reason

620
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,400
why you like him.

621
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,710
Let me tell you.

622
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,460
He is totally different from

623
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,890
those rich playboys in the Imperial Capital.

624
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,690
He's not as pretentious as them.

625
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,320
What is this?

626
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,970
This is a Sky Lantern.

627
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,180
After our closest family passed away,

628
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,780
we can light and release a Sky Lantern on his anniversary of death

629
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,560
so that our family can know that we miss him.

630
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,900
Your closest family?

631
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,690
My mother.

632
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,960
I'm sorry.

633
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,770
I didn't know that your mother was also...

634
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,390
It's all right.

635
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,560
My mother has been dead for many years.

636
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,880
Besides, I know that

637
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,430
she must be watching me from Heaven.

638
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,310
It's time for the defense shift.

639
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,950
Yes, My Lord.

640
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,200
Princess Ning, Princess Ka Dan.

641
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,240
Thanks for your hard work, My Lord.

642
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,830
Ladies, it's getting late.

643
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,510
Please go back and rest.

644
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,560
No, we need to release the Sky Lantern.

645
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,390
Ladies, unless there is a special situation,

646
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,510
it's forbidden to ignite and release this kind of thing inside the city.

647
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,070
But today is Princess Ka Dan's mother's...

648
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,930
It's all right.

649
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,870
You need to do the rituals to commemorate

650
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,200
your mother every year.

651
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,290
Isn't this a special situation?

652
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,360
Your Highness, as the heir to the chieftain,

653
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,800
please set an example.

654
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,380
Your Highness, it's okay.

655
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,090
Don't make things difficult for him.

656
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,210
How about this? I can't go as I need to set an example.

657
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,370
But you can go with her, right?

658
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,970
I order you

659
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,990
to take Princess Ka Dan to release the Sky Lantern now.

660
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,270
You can't refuse the order from the chieftain's heir.

661
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,220
Princess Ning was just angry and impulsive.

662
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,680
You don't have to take it seriously, My Lord.

663
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,800
Your Highness.

664
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,900
Is there anything else, My Lord?

665
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,500
Please condescend to go with me.

666
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,610
Your Highness, you can get off the carriage now.

667
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,590
This way.

668
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,440
Princess Ning is the future heir to the chieftain,

669
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,480
so she should be a role model.

670
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,080
Such inappropriate things

671
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,580
should be done by me.

672
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,620
If you want to say anything to your mother, just say it.

673
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,670
It's forbidden to release Sky Lanterns in the Imperial Capital.

674
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,060
Let's just burn it.

675
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,260
Your Highness, I accidentally released the Sky Lantern.

676
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,850
I'll go to the Ministry of War tomorrow to receive punishment.

677
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:49,710
My Lord.

678
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,890
Your Highness.

679
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,350
Life is full of uncertainties, and there are fewer reunions and more partings.

680
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,670
Please don't be sad.

681
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,700
There are fewer reunions and more partings.

682
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,350
I just wonder how many more partings

683
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,150
there will be in this world.

684
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,050
But sometimes, I just feel that

685
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,980
my mother is in Heaven,

686
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,340
and she has never been far away from me.
