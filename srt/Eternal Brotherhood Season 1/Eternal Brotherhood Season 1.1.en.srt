00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,990
Report!

5
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,950
The commander-in-chief of the North Clan, Ge Sha,

6
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,080
led 300,000 elite soldiers to attack.

7
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,410
300,000 soldiers?

8
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,720
And they sent Ge Sha?

9
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,230
He's the top warrior of the North Clan.

10
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,910
They are serious this time.

11
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,870
Do we have 30,000 soldiers?

12
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,670
Not that many.

13
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,250
General Ge Sha, the main troops are here.

14
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,510
Team One!

15
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,920
Heading north! Full speed ahead!

19
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,950
Shoot!

20
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,710
Shoot!

21
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,030
Team One!

22
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,150
Heading north! Full speed ahead!

23
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,200
Lord Xiu didn't order us to retreat!

24
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,950
Report! The pioneer troops of the North Clan

25
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,150
have crossed Mount Bayan.

26
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,740
Already?

27
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,810
Team Two. Heading south. Full speed ahead.

28
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,750
Shoot!

29
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,790

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,650
Heading south! Full speed ahead!

31
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,990
Isn't it 300,000 soldiers?

32
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,520
Why is there only this many?

33
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,030
Army to attack!

34
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,070
Shoot!

35
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,250
Retreat!

36
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,110
Retreat!

37
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,380
The army of the North Clan suddenly retreated.

38
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,040
Are we still going after them?

39
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,950
Don't move!

40
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,690
There are 300,000 people on their side.

41
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,750
Please let them go.

42
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,990
If it were 300,000 soldiers,

43
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,330
would they be chased and beaten by us?

44
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,790
What if there's an ambush?

45
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,320
We'd better ask Lord Xiu for his order.

46
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,910
[Luo Jie, Ming Yu, Baichuan]

47
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,920
Lord Xiu, the North Clan has retreated.

48
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,250
Should we go after them?

49
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,040
Gu Lei.

50
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,930
How dare you wear Lord Xiu's armor!

51
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,990
Don't!

52
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,740
Lord Baichuan, don't hit me.

53
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,310
Get down!

54
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,680
Where did Lord Xiu go?

55
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,640
He took a bath in the back mountain

56
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,750
[Gu Lei]

57
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,870
and had a barbecue.

58
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,570
He should be asleep now.

59
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,910
Lord Xiu, the hot water is ready.

60
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,550
Three, two...

61
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,990
No.

62
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,490
I'm awake.

63
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,810
I'm awake.

64
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,910
What's so important?

65
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,070
Did the soldiers rebel?

66
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,410
It's only a matter of time.

67
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm here to...

68
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,620
Luo Jie and Ming Yu dueled for you...

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,560
[Zichuan Xiu]

70
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,310
and they both died?

71
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,950
Unfortunately,

72
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,870
they are still living shamelessly.

73
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,590
But the North Clan...

74
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,690
Did the North Clan attack?

75
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,250
In fact, we won.

76
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,790
The North Clan is retreating.

77
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,549
Should we chase...

78
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,809
I can't believe we won!

79
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,179
This is amazing.

80
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,150
I'm going back to sleep.

81
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,120
You really forced me this time.

82
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,290
Chase them!

83
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,780
It's God's will.

84
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,320
This is too childish.

85
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,890
I have considered it carefully.

86
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,370
Luo Jie led the cavalry.

87
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,830
They are more flexible and much faster

88
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,950
than those big-bodied men from the North Clan.

89
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,880
If they can't win in battle, can they not outrun them?

90
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,450
I'm waiting to count my trophies.

91
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Behave yourself.

92
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,090
Don't move.

93
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,200
With only 5,000 soldiers,

94
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,510
we forced the 300,000 troops of the North Clan

95
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,800
to flee.

96
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,070
Wonderful.

97
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,470
Go.

98
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,890
What's in the North Clan's supplies?

99
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,860
Open it and let me see.

100
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,170
Don't move.

101
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,000
What makes you

102
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,350
so nervous?

103
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,370
Take them away.

104
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:09,930
Yes.

105
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,680
Sit tight.

106
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,770
Go.

107
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,810
[Ka Dan]

108
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,880
I am Ka Dan, the Princess of the North Clan.

109
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,640
Lord Xiu. Kill her and avenge our men!

110
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,880
Yes, kill her!

111
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,530
Kill her, My Lord.

112
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,730
Put your weapon down!

113
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,260
My Lord, kill her! Kill her!

114
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,090
Let's go to a safe place

115
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,050
and have a talk.

116
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,930
The taxes of Dakai Province this quarter

117
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,580
have increased by 20% compared to the last quarter.

118
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,930
Not bad. It's stable.

119
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,360
Report it to the Chieftain.

120
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,970
[Luo Minghai]

121
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,290
Lord Yang, you helped me five years ago.

122
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,490
I brought you a gift when I was transferred to the capital.

123
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,950
This is the specialty of our Diwei Province.

124
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,070
Not bad.

125
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,640
Did you prepare some for the Chieftain?

126
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,770
I will send it to the Chieftain’s Mansion later.

127
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,180
[Tongchui]

128
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,670
My Lord.

129
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,200
Be careful.

130
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:12,840
It broke from here last time.

131
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,900
[Tieshou]

132
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,210
Next.

133
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,670
[Yang Minghua]

134
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,790
The drainage channel reconstruction work in the Imperial Capital

135
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,130
has been completed ahead of schedule.

136
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,730
We have repaired 73 damaged drainage channels

137
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
and rebuilt 46.

138
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,840
After completion, we'll be able to cope with the flood season.

139
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,230
You may leave.

140
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,300
Governing the drainage channels

141
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,090
can prevent the people in the Imperial Capital

142
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,890
from suffering from the inundation of rainwater,

143
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,470
which is a good thing.

144
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,120
Report from Yuanzhou.

145
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,160
Victory at Hengchuan!

146
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,310
300,000 soldiers of the North Clan

147
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,510
attacked Hengchuan and were defeated.

148
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,650
How did they get to Hengchuan?

149
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,530
Give it to me.

150
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,660
Where is Ge Yingxing now?

151
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,880
Lord Yang. Lord Ge didn't lead the army in this battle.

152
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,350
Then who is the leader?

153
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,200
Zichuan Xiu.

154
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,760
Zichuan Xiu?

155
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,680
Seven years ago, Zichuan Xiu was exiled to Yuanzhou.

156
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,320
I remember now.

157
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,370
I sent him there.

158
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,640
Later, Lord Ge placed him in Hengchuan.

159
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,630
Lord Ge is really foresighted.

160
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,840
There are many doubts about the Hengchuan Battle.

161
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,590
It seems that we should ask Zichuan Xiu back

162
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,990
to the Imperial Capital to report

163
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,310
how he fought this battle.

164
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,860
Kneel!

165
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,610
How did your commander-in-chief die?

166
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,230
I don't know.

167
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,710
Who can take the head of the enemy general among thousands of soldiers?

168
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,950
There is such a master in Yuanzhou.

169
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,090
It's gold.

170
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,800
You must be rich.

171
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,020
We can be friends.

172
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,080
Lord Baichuan, you can't go in.

173
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,680
Shameless!

174
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,070
Lieutenant Baichuan.

175
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,770
You're too reckless.

176
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,430
Can't you see I'm interrogating the captive?

177
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,510
How can you interrogate her with her mouth shut?

178
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,440
-You were…
-What are you thinking?

179
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,150
Do you think your boss

180
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,540
is a pervert who would molest

181
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,550
innocent girls?

182
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,380
You are.

183
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,490
You should think that way.

184
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,640
This girl is Princess Ka Dan of the North Clan.

185
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,380
She was in shock.

186
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,990
That's why

187
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,710
your superior, Captain Zichuan Xiu, who is of noble character,

188
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,450
was comforting her without any selfish motive.

189
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,550
Yes, I was comforting her.

190
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,750
Princess Ka Dan, actually,

191
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,080
I just wanted to help...

192
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,870
Gu Lei.

193
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,190
Yes.

194
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,240
Guide Princess Ka Dan away.

195
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,250
I'll interrogate her later.

196
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,870
Princess, please.

197
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:33,890
I...

198
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,930
Lieutenant Baichuan, say it.

199
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,310
I heard that the North Clan's army was in chaos

200
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,100
because their commander-in-chief was assassinated secretly.

201
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,540
Did you know about it?

202
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,390
That's why you ordered us to chase them?

203
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,920
I ordered you to chase them?

204
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,950
Why didn't I know?

205
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,230
Alright.

206
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,070
Remember to write a good report.

207
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,190
Then the reward will be abundant.

208
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,880
What?

209
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,240
We'll gather and stop fighting?

210
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,950
Yes.

211
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,530
Look, why don't you understand?

212
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
What Lord Xiu did today is flawless.

213
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,970
If we take all the credit,

214
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,360
other troops

215
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,770
will think we don't know our place.

216
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,170
What should we do in the future?

217
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,760
On the way back to Wayun,

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,950
we will send a squad

219
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,680
to guard Princess Ka Dan alone.

220
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,630
Those soldiers in Yuanzhou hated the North Clan so much.

221
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,110
Now that a princess from the North Clan came,

222
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,990
they would want to eat her alive.

223
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,410
More importantly, we have to guard against Lord Xiu.

224
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,170
Be careful of his conspiracy.

225
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,270
You may have to guard against him.

226
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,070
Look.

227
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,920
Lord Xiu was making a scene by molesting Ka Dan today.

228
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,450
Everyone will think that he likes Ka Dan.

229
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,840
Then who would dare to harm Ka Dan?

230
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,220
50,000 against 300,000.

231
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,480
How dare he order us to chase them?

232
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,470
When everyone wants to take advantage of the victory and seize the credit,

233
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,390
he left.

234
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,560
Those soldiers disrespected the princess.

235
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,950
They behaved themselves after he pretended to be a hooligan.

236
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,109
Is our captain ridiculous

237
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,480
or extraordinary?

238
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,490
You've only been following Lord Xiu for half a year.

239
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,220
He has done more ridiculous things than you know.

240
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,210
Why do I feel less and less familiar with him?

241
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,240
One step, two steps.

242
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,360
Like flying ducks, like dew on a lotus.

243
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,670
Lady Ning, you're elegant.

244
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,790
[Zichuan Ning]

245
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,120
I dare not slack off for the glory of my family.

246
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,140
Lady Ning. Lord Xiu's gift has arrived.

247
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,360
[Mei]

248
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,560
Madam, I have some official matters to attend to.

249
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,220
Mei, let's go.

250
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,790
Hurry up.

251
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
Brother Xiu replied?

252
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,580
Lady Ning, open it.

253
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,110
This bastard.

254
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,070
He gives me

255
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,550
weird things every time.

256
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,750
What does he mean?

257
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,150
Lady Ning, I heard that

258
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,540
a scorpion can only have one partner in its life.

259
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,730
I think Lord Xiu wants to express

260
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,400
his exclusive love for you.

261
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,620
Fine, he's thoughtful.

262
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,550
We won the battle at Hengchuan.

263
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,550
As usual,

264
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,660
we need to prepare a generous gift

265
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,760
to pay tribute to the highest commander in Yuanzhou,

266
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,570
Lord Ge Yingxing.

267
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,080
This is good.

268
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,990
What kind of gift is this?

269
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,120
Our captain has been stationed in Hengchuan for seven years.

270
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,720
Every time he won,

271
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,530
he would prepare a box of garbage for Lord Ge.

272
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,740
Lord Ge. Victory at Hengchuan!

273
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,050
Lord Zichuan Xiu has escorted the prisoners to Wayun.

274
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,580
He also sent gifts as usual.

275
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,280
Garbage.

276
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,270
[Weiming]

277
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,350
Leather underwear?

278
00:19:59,230 --> 00:19:59,620
[Ge Yingxing]

279
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,930
He learned it from me.

280
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,460
Lord Yang.

281
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,290
Lord Yang.

282
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,610
Lord Canxing.

283
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,710
[Zichuan Canxing]

284
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,350
Hurry up.

285
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,260
I received desserts from Diwei Province.

286
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,480
This is...

287
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,390
This...

288
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,390
[Si Yilin]

289
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,790
Si Yilin just broke something.

290
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,550
He punished himself by standing in military posture for four hours.

291
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,070
I tried to persuade him, but he didn't listen.

292
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,000
Let him be.

293
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,130
A soldier should be like this.

294
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,790
When my brother was alive, he...

295
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,240
When my brother was alive,

296
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,040
he usually gathered us together

297
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,920
to eat these.

298
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,030
When it has arrived,

299
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,550
I thought of you immediately.

300
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,960
So I told you to come.

301
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,230
Let’s eat together.

302
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,830
Lord Yuanxing treated me like his brother.

303
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,010
Now that I think about it, it’s still like yesterday.

304
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,160
Of course.

305
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,700
You were the person my brother trusted the most.

306
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,400
Of course, he trusted Ge Yingxing, too.

307
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,260
Naturally, I treat you kindly.

308
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,660
So you asked me to guard the Imperial Capital

309
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
and asked Lord Ge to guard Yuanzhou.

310
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,220
We'll help you protect Zichuan.

311
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,180
I'm old.

312
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,670
I can only rely on

313
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,720
my brother's son and daughter.

314
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,230
But Zichuan Xiu is a step-son.

315
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,150
He's unstable and unreliable.

316
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,780
I can only spend my twilight years in peace

317
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
when Ning grows up.

318
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,580
But Lord Yuanxing had always treated Xiu as his own.

319
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,840
I heard that Xiu won a great battle in Hengchuan.

320
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,530
Did you ask Luo Minghai to transfer him back

321
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,070
to promote him?

322
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,120
The battle in Hengchuan may not be a great victory.

323
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,560
I called him back to know the situation.

324
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,010
There are many false reports of war achievements on the frontline.

325
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,540
If it's a great victory,

326
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,510
he must be rewarded.

327
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,310
I'm glad you're here. I have something important.

328
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,180
This really troubles me.

329
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,460
Look at this.

330
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,880
Still these things?

331
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,790
Yes.

332
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,190
It seems that you have solved several steps more than before.

333
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,870
Yes, I asked some young people for help.

334
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,870
Lord Yang, take a look.

335
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,970
I'm old. I'm done.

336
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,240
I can't solve it.

337
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,500
Commander Yang, that’s Chieftain's seat.

338
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,470
Please get up.

339
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,830
Don't move.

340
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,110
Don't move.

341
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,540
There's no one else.

342
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,910
It's just a chair.

343
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Is it really hard to solve?

344
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,290
Yes, it is.

345
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,430
My brain hurts.

346
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,240
Did you break it?

347
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,410
I was too careless.

348
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,320
It's okay.

349
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,340
It's just a gadget, not a big deal.

350
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,430
It's okay if it's broken.

351
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,630
Nothing.

352
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,270
But in this way,

353
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,560
it seems to be solved.

354
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,530
You are really a master with great wisdom.

355
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,370
You found another way.

356
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,200
Just kidding.

357
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,030
I'll buy you a new one next time.

358
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,640
Lord Canxing, I have work to do.

359
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,310
Please excuse me.

360
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,190
Lord Yang, thank you for your hard work.

361
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,130
It's just a gadget.

362
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,150
It's no big deal.

363
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,140
You don’t need to stand for so long.

364
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,390
Commander Yang, may I borrow your sword?

365
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,030
You broke the Chieftain's stuff.

366
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,350
You should be punished.

367
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,550
I'll stand for four hours as a punishment with your sword.

368
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,250
Can you take the punishment

369
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,610
for anything I do?

370
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,990
Remember to return my sword.

371
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,250
It's indeed solved.

372
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,540
[Memorial Tablet of Zichuan Yuanxing]

373
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,420
Lord Zichuan Xiu insisted on waiting for you in the study.

374
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,730
That's how he'll show his sincerity.

375
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,890
He tricked you.

376
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:14,950
Zichuan Xiu!

377
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,470
Long time no see.

378
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,320
Give it to me.

379
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,240
What?

380
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,360
[Luo Bo]

381
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,020
Cut the crap. Where is my wine?

382
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,150
Lord Luo. Is there wine in your office?

383
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,590
That's impossible.

384
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,830
You are disciplined and enforce the law strictly.

385
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:30,810
Alright.

386
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,030
Just leave my bottle of Liuyang Province's

387
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,590
20-year-old wine.

388
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,720
You have a bottle of 20-year-old wine?

389
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,340
You're so petty.

390
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,430
I just came back from the victory.

391
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,890
Shouldn't you give me a gift?

392
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,480
Do you want the gift from the Imperial Capital?

393
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,280
Yes.

394
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,880
Victory at Hengchuan.

395
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,390
The Ministry of War summoned Captain Zichuan Xiu

396
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,580
to return to the Imperial Capital immediately to report.

397
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,830
From Commander Yang Minghua.

398
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,590
Actually, I don't want you to go back.

399
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,170
I remember what happened seven years ago.

400
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,580
According to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs,

401
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,820
Zichuan Xiu mobilized the army without permission.

402
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,390
It's a serious crime.

403
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,630
He should be executed.

404
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,900
For the sake of his loyalty to the Chieftain

405
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,010
and his victory against the enemy,

406
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,760
I hereby pardon Zichuan Xiu to be banished to Yuanzhou

407
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,200
and serve the family.

408
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,600
I have a bad memory now.

409
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,380
Seven years ago, the Imperial Capital was attacked by the Liufeng family army.

410
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,940
Lord Yuanxing died.

411
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,290
When there was no leader,

412
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,340
you were the one who led 800 cavalries

413
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,640
and started a mutiny and obtained military power.

414
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,030
You did a great job.

415
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,440
Yet Yang Minghua listed several charges against you.

416
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,750
He wanted to kill you.

417
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,440
It's all thanks to Lord Ge and Lady Ning for speaking for you.

418
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,100
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been alive today.

419
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,410
After winning this battle,

420
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,580
you broke the balance between the Imperial Capital and Yuanzhou,

421
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,340
as well as the balance between Yang Minghua and Lord Ge.

422
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,400
Do you think Yang Minghua

423
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,670
will let you go like he did seven years ago?

424
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,730
This time, they pretended to offend.

425
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,720
Their real purpose

426
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,050
is to build their own pass in Hengchuan.

427
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,710
But people in the Imperial Capital don't know.

428
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,140
I transferred all the garrisons back.

429
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,740
Only you disobeyed my order.

430
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,500
Yang Minghua will make a big fuss about this.

431
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,400
So, if I go back,

432
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,320
they'll be targeting me.

433
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,400
If I don't go back,

434
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,900
they'll be targeting Lord Ge.

435
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,520
[Di Lin]

436
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,230
Lord Yang. I heard that there was a great victory at Hengchuan

437
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,560
and you want to transfer Zichuan Xiu back.

438
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,550
What do you think?

439
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,350
There are indeed many battles in history where the few defeated the many.

440
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,870
But 300,000 soldiers suddenly retreated.

441
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,420
It's not common.

442
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,380
That's why I want him to come back to undergo interrogation.

443
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,930
Okay, I'll bring him back.

444
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,030
You?

445
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,430
Lord Yang. You used the word "interrogate" just now.

446
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,090
So I have to share your burden.

447
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,990
I don't think it's a good idea.

448
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,790
The whole Imperial Capital knows that you hold a deep grudge against him.

449
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,230
If you go,

450
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,430
I'm afraid you'll kill him.

451
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,930
Please grant my wish.

452
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,640
I want him alive.

453
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,470
Promise me.

454
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,520
I'll keep him alive.

455
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,040
There's news from the post.

456
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,260
Zichuan Xiu will enter the Imperial Capital tomorrow morning.

457
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,960
He didn't bring many people with him.

458
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,160
It's a secret arrest.

459
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,430
Please keep a low profile.

460
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,960
I want him alive.

461
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
Boss.

462
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,200
Everything is ready.

463
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,240
Okay. Let everyone rest here.

464
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,520
We'll enter the Imperial Capital tomorrow morning.

465
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,400
Baichuan, come with me.

466
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,280
You have a special mission.

467
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,270
If you don't go,

468
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,000
I'll give your horse to Luo Jie.

469
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,310
Lord Xiu, why are we in the Imperial Capital early?

470
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,400
The Imperial Capital is too serious during the day. It's boring.

471
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,990
It's more fun to travel on a boat during the night.

472
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,120
I'm not here for fun.

473
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,140
What's my special mission?

474
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,380
As expected of Baichuan.

475
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,240
We entered the Imperial Capital in advance just to inquire about information.

476
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,300
What information?

477
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,340
Do you really think

478
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,490
we are here to receive the reward?

479
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,000
Lord Xiu, you're coming to such a place as soon as you're back?

480
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,420
Long time no see.

481
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,700
Long time no see.

482
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,480
Please come in.

483
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,200
Please.

484
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,200
Chunfeng Garden.

485
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,460
It's indeed the window of the Imperial Capital.

486
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,130
The officers of each army like to drink here.

487
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,790
Come here.

488
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,480
Look, those two people

489
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,330
must be the Palace Guards.

490
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,190
Stop staring at them.

491
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,650
The people sitting at that table are obviously from the Military Inspection Team.

492
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,750
And those with jade stamps on the boots

493
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,580
are from the Ministry of War.

494
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,280
My trip to the Imperial Capital

495
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,100
must be very dangerous.

496
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,280
So I came to check the situation first.

497
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,060
Let's go.

498
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,570
Outsiders. Leave now!

499
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,330
I'm an outsider. I have to leave.

500
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,989
I'm here to receive the reward. I'm a hero.

501
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,380
Zichuan Xiu!

502
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,520
Zichuan Xiu.

503
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,050
I'm under the order of Commander Yang Minghua to arrest you.

504
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,830
Surrender now!

505
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,040
Yang Minghua?

506
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,880
Why did he arrest me?

507
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,460
I did nothing wrong.

508
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,080
How dare you!

509
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,920
How is Xiujia?

510
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,000
How can you call her by her name?

511
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,530
She's your sister-in-law.

512
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,160
Surrender now.

513
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,030
You really...

514
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,590
My wife is good.

515
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,240
You think you can defeat me?

516
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,500
If Si Yilin and I

517
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,590
didn't lose to you in the die-casting game,

518
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,440
how can you call her your wife...

519
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,650
Aren't you ashamed?

520
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,130
She's destined to be my wife.

521
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:31,430
Fine, I'll kill you here today.

522
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,270
How is Ning?

523
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,030
Don't worry. They're all safe.

524
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,360
Stop eating. That's enough.

525
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,020
You live in the Imperial Capital. You have no idea

526
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,080
how terrible the food in Yuanzhou is.

527
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,780
Do you know how dangerous it is for you to come back this time?

528
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,040
I've thought about it.

529
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,920
The only crime they can accuse me of

530
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,980
is my bad behavior.

531
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,530
If I don't come back,

532
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,720
Lord Ge will be in danger.

533
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,780
Since you're back,

534
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,510
you have to listen to me.

535
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,510
What's your plan?

536
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,110
Take him away.

537
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,120
Get in.

538
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,480
Behave!

539
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,590
The secret tunnel.

540
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,150
The secret tunnel?

541
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,220
Is it so obvious?

542
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,370
It's been seven years.

543
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,510
I didn't expect this secret room to still exist.

544
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,590
In the past seven years, the Imperial Capital has been peaceful.

545
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,320
Who still uses a secret tunnel?

546
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,660
It's so comfortable.

547
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,190
Aren't you supposed to come to the capital tomorrow morning?

548
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,880
Why were you sneaking in at midnight?

549
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,540
If I hadn't come in early to inquire about the information,

550
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,870
I wouldn't even know how I'd die tomorrow.

551
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,740
If I hadn't caught you tonight, you'd be dead.

552
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,990
Would Yang Minghua be relieved when you came to capture me?

553
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,360
After all, I betrayed you seven years ago.

554
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,080
That's why I established a foothold in the Ministry of War.

555
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,880
That's why you went to Yuanzhou.

556
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,050
Our acting was so real.

557
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,820
He should believe it.

558
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,300
Who is it?

559
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,550
Who?

560
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
-Who is it?
-Second Brother.

561
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,060
Second Brother.

562
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,360
Let's get down to business.

563
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,760
I've asked Lord Canxing.

564
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,510
He went to Yang Minghua.

565
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,190
Yang said he won't let you go.

566
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,590
I knew it.

567
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,420
I'm going to die.

568
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,390
Why did you show off then?

569
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,310
If you retreat normally in the Battle of Hengchuan, there won't be much trouble.

570
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,370
I must fight the battle of Hengchuan.

571
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,790
I must also return to the Imperial Capital.

572
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,390
Didn't you tell me to follow your plan?

573
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,220
I'll go to Yang Minghua tomorrow morning

574
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,640
and tell him you came back in the middle of the night and got caught by me.

575
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,280
Tonight,

576
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,980
I will let everyone in the Imperial Capital know

577
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,050
the victory of Hengchuan and Zichuan Xiu is back in triumph.

578
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,810
Yang Minghua has to

579
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,740
let you go.

580
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,430
You asked your Royal Escorts to do this overnight?

581
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,090
The military report is full of great victory at Hengchuan.

582
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,620
It was done, but not by us.

583
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,130
It was done by Lady Ning.

584
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,690
So you have to go back and wait.

585
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,640
She might come to you after she's done.

586
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,760
Well, I...

587
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,340
I need to wash up.

588
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,520
Lord Yang, we've caught Zichuan Xiu.

589
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,280
But he is a scoundrel.

590
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,000
He won't easily reveal

591
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,050
what we want.

592
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,970
Just kill him. That's the easy way to deal with it.

593
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,110
You're the general of Zichuan,

594
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,040
not a murderer.

595
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,680
Lord Yang, I'm afraid we can't kill him.

596
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,840
Now the whole city knows

597
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,670
that this young general is back.

598
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,800
I'm afraid the people at the gate

599
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,740
are holding announcements and waiting for him.

600
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,080
They're trying to use public opinion to force us to release him.

601
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,340
Lord Di Lin arrested him last night.

602
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,970
This morning, it's known to the whole capital.

603
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,070
Zichuan Xiu has left the Imperial Capital for seven years.

604
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,190
Someone actually cares so much about him.

605
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,920
I'm afraid this chess piece...

606
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,280
Sit.

607
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,800
Thank you, Lord Yang.

608
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,530
What can save people

609
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,840
can also kill people.

610
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,870
The victory at Hengchuan is unusual.

611
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,700
The Ministry of War has long suspected it.

612
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,950
I beg to report this case to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs, and ask them to investigate this case

613
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,230
and hold a trial.

614
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,580
If the people find out that Zichuan Xiu's military achievement

615
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,860
is just a lie,

616
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,540
then the great joy will be turned into extreme anger.

617
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,240
Lord Luo,

618
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,550
you want to drag him to the public and kill him.

619
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,950
But the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

620
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,810
is not under our jurisdiction...

621
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,360
The Muhai Sea in the northwest is open.

622
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,280
This should be the first crab they caught.

623
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,940
He's back showing off his glory.

624
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,270
We'll have a fair trial.

625
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,870
Eat crabs.
