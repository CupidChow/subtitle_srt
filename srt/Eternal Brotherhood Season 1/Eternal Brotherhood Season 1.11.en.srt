[Episode 11]

4
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,460
Feeling ashamed is the beginning of progress.

5
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,660
Don't worry. I'll teach you carefully.

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,810
Let's begin.

7
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,030
It's wrong.

8
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:55,870
It's wrong.

9
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,150
My hands slipped.

10
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,330
It's wrong.

11
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,330
I'm a bit hungry.

12
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,730
Now I feel a little dizzy, and my hands are a little limp.

13
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,930
If you keep making excuses,

14
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,280
I'll really hit you.

15
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,080
Stop looking.

16
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,170
It's wrong again.

17
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,230
Why are you so fierce? I'm a princess.

18
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,630
All girls are cherished by their family like a princess.

19
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,079
I'm even a fairy.

20
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,800
Do it again.

21
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,160
I finally played the music right.

22
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,390
I've never wanted to cry so much

23
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,780
just because of a woman.

24
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,420
I didn't expect that I would

25
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,170
have a day like this in my life.

26
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,170
Taste it.

27
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,610
How does it taste?

28
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,220
My Lord, you can tell me directly.

29
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,290
My father often said that

30
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,720
we shouldn't make the food too delicious.

31
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,730
Otherwise, we'll forget the bitterness we've suffered.

32
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,730
But this is the taste of the North Clan.

33
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,560
When I was a kid, every few days,

34
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,970
my father would drive us into the mountain forest.

35
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,110
He was most afraid that we would stay in the Jushen Castle for so long

36
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,370
and forget that the Sairong Tribe originally came from the mountain forest.

37
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,710
Your Highness, if you want,

38
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,180
you can invite Princess Ning to take a walk

39
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,560
in the mountain forest tomorrow.

40
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,620
My Royal Escorts will escort you there and protect you.

41
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Horseshoes Smithy.

42
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
It's very famous.

43
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,650
Right.

44
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,770
I don't know what has happened in the past two days.

45
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,570
The horses are still here, but the people are gone.

46
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,050
I've heard that many high-ranking military officers

47
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,000
from the Palace Guards and the Royal Escorts

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
are regular customers here,

49
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,160
including Si Yilin.

50
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,260
Not only do we need solid evidence this time,

51
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,090
but we also need to make him speechless.

52
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,010
It's easy to get solid evidence.

53
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,120
It's even easier to make him speechless.

54
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,240
The exact time.

55
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,330
The exact time is very important.

56
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,730
It'll be enough to make him unable to escape from his doom.

57
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,590
Thank you for the news, Lord Xiao.

58
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,610
That's because you gave the right price.

59
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,650
You've always been praised for being fair.

60
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,170
But I think what makes you admirable

61
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,860
is that you're good at making choices.

62
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,570
Thanks! Thanks, My Lord.

63
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,800
The weather is going to change soon.

64
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,730
Lord Xiao, you need to make a plan soon.

65
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,010
I'm just a businessman.

66
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,050
Sometimes, business is the same as war.

67
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,650
Lord Si Yilin,

68
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,170
there is a murder case, and we want you to cooperate with the investigation.

69
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,870
Please come with us back to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

70
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,200
Do you know this person?

71
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,780
I think he's from the horseshoes shop.

72
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,420
Are you close to him?

73
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,810
Not really.

74
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,880
I go to him occasionally to nail two horseshoes.

75
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,910
This person is suspected of long-term smuggling of North Clan's supplies.

76
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,120
The quantity of goods and the amount of money are both huge.

77
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,200
The reason why he could be so unscrupulous

78
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,660
was that someone in the army provided him

79
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,440
with all kinds of convenience.

80
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,370
Your name is in the account book

81
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,350
for sharing the dirty money.

82
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,210
Your Royal Escorts' seals can be found in all the customs clearance documents

83
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,940
for imports and exports in the Imperial Capital.

84
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,610
This person was killed

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,530
between 9 p.m and 11 p.m. on the 7th in his shop.

86
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,530
Where were you at that time?

87
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,409
What were you doing?

88
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,210
I can't tell you.

89
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,050
Then don't blame us for being rude.

90
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,130
Tie him up.

91
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,950
Who are you?

92
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,690
The Ministry of Government Supervision is investigating a case. Step aside!

93
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,170
Yes.

94
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,130
You're still alive.

95
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,429
I'm not dead yet.

96
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
Among the three of us,

97
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,960
you're are the least suitable to go to jail.

98
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,890
What? So you two are suitable to go to jail?

99
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,410
If I had been framed,

100
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
I would have escaped at once.

101
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,820
If our Big Brother had been framed,

102
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,050
he would have killed the jailers and then escaped.

103
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,910
What about you?

104
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,470
Even if we had broken into the prison to rescue you,

105
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,270
I'm afraid you wouldn't escape.

106
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,170
They're targeting me this time.

107
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,970
They've even anticipated that I won't be able to

108
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,130
prove my innocence.

109
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,740
It looks like Xiao Long and Yang Minghua have colluded with each other.

110
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,050
So where were you when the incident happened?

111
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,300
What were you doing?

112
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,720
You can't even tell me?

113
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,520
How about we escape from here?

114
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,730
Brat, what are you thinking?

115
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,550
Now they're targeting me

116
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,170
so that it'll be more convenient for them

117
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,650
to control the Royal Escorts in the future.

118
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,280
If I escape,

119
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,800
their next target will be

120
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
Lord Canxing, won't it?

121
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,840
It's impossible that Si Yilin has killed that man.

122
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,490
Ning, come with me to the Chieftain's Mansion.

123
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,650
Let's beg Lord Canxing to give us the Chieftain's Token.

124
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,960
Then we can go to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

125
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,970
and ask to check the files about Si Yilin.

126
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,010
Maybe we can find a breakthrough.

127
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,460
Then we can prove his innocence.

128
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,770
Understand? Let's go.

129
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,860
Wait.

130
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,650
Just wait.

131
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,680
What's wrong?

132
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,460
It's useless for you to ask the chieftain for help.

133
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,820
You know where Si Yilin was?

134
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,490
Where was he?

135
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
I can't tell you.

136
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,310
Ning, you can't even tell me?

137
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,810
Why?

138
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,600
I...

139
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,330
I'll go tell them.

140
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,810
I know where he was at that time.

141
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,020
Between 9 p.m and 11 p.m. that day,

142
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,570
Lord Si Yilin was with me all the time.

143
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,760
Amazing.

144
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,280
How amazing.

145
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,600
It was the anniversary of my mother's death that day.

146
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,370
Lord Si Yilin took me to release the Sky Lantern

147
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,200
for the sake of my love and devotion to my mother.

148
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
It was all my fault.

149
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,370
If I had gone with them at that time,

150
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,240
these things wouldn't have happened.

151
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,370
It was my fault.

152
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,690
Lord Xiu, please take me to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

153
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,090
I want to testify for him.

154
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,970
I'll tell the people of the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs that

155
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,320
I threatened Lord Si Yilin

156
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,250
with my own life and even with the relationship between the two countries

157
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,380
and forced Lord Si Yilin to take me out.

158
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,940
Lord Si Yilin was kind and benevolent, and he tolerated it for his country.

159
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,530
I should be blamed for all that has happened.

160
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,400
Princess Ka Dan,

161
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,490
I'm quite touched by what you said just now.

162
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,150
Wait. I said it on behalf of Si Yilin,

163
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,590
not on behalf of myself.

164
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,580
But this is not okay.

165
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,810
If others know about this,

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,890
to put it mildly, Princess Ning didn't keep an eye on you properly.

167
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,140
To put it severely,

168
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,890
Si Yilin colluded with the North Clan.

169
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,880
It'll also be bad for you, who is a princess.

170
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,600
Besides, it will also affect

171
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,560
the relationship between Zichuan and the North Clan.

172
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,760
For these two things, which crime is more serious?

173
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,770
So, Si Yilin can't tell them.

174
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,370
You can't tell them, either.

175
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,080
Si Yilin has been with me for many years.

176
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,490
I know him and trust him.

177
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,970
He must have his reasons for not

178
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,130
telling them where he was that day.

179
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,250
My Lord, Si Yilin didn't kill that man that day.

180
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,990
He would never betray us, too.

181
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,760
Nor would he

182
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,730
do anything that was against Zichuan's interests.

183
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,770
I know. I'll go to see Yang Minghua now.

184
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,640
My Lord, you can't go.

185
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,530
I'm the chieftain. Even if I have to beg him,

186
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,320
I would beg Yang Minghua to release Si Yilin.

187
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,410
He framed Si Yilin this time.

188
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,050
There is no doubt that Yang Minghua has started a war against you.

189
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,930
Since he has set up this trap,

190
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,970
it won't be that easy to save Si Yilin out.

191
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,250
My Lord, I'll go check the files now

192
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,250
in order to find a way to solve this problem.

193
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,170
What other solutions can we have?

194
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,210
They just want to get Si Yilin's testimony.

195
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,000
How they wish they could hit him and cripple him

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,200
so that they can force him to put his fingerprint on the written confession.

197
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
They want to hit him and cripple him?

198
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,890
It'll be good if he becomes disabled.

199
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,090
Buddy.

200
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,050
Si Yilin is really stubborn.

201
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,360
Take a rest first. Eat and drink something.

202
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,770
Let me take over your work.

203
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,830
Are you a newcomer?

204
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:32,890
Yes.

205
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,860
If I prick him with this needle,

206
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,050
his tendons will be ruined.

207
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,650
Is this okay?

208
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,190
It's okay.

209
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,950
Lord Ge.

210
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,250
Even after we find Master Zuo Jiaming,

211
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,730
can we rush back to the Imperial Capital in time?

212
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,460
As long as he is willing to help,

213
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,480
no matter what the situation is, he'll be able to save it.

214
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,570
Let's hurry up.

215
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,180
There are pursuers.

216
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,250
I can hide my whereabouts this time.

217
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,580
They can still track me precisely in this situation.

218
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,040
I trained them well indeed.

219
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,850
It's the Yuanzhou Army.

220
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,200
Previously, I received a secret letter,

221
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,640
which said that Lei Hong had defected to Yang Minghua.

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,440
He came to kill me.

223
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,170
My Lord.

224
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,780
I've checked him carefully.

225
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,410
Both his arms and legs are broken.

226
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,470
I'm afraid it's impossible for him

227
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,600
to fully recover.

228
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,410
In this way, the Royal Escorts will have no leader,

229
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,020
and then they'll be in a state of disunity.

230
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,410
That's good.

231
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,730
Ge Yingxing disappeared ten days ago.

232
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,500
Lei Hong found out that he was on his way to the Lin Family.

233
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,650
He'll take action when the time is right.

234
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,540
The Lin Family?

235
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,089
The Lin Family.

236
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,849
Thank you, My Lord.

237
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,010
What about Di Lin?

238
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,890
Di Lin will arrive tomorrow.

239
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,490
Ask his men to guard the place outside the city.

240
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,890
Once Lei Hong fails,

241
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,230
no matter whom Ge Yingxing brings back,

242
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,600
or how many soldiers he has dispatched here,

243
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
just ask Di Lin to stop him even if he has to sacrifice his own life.

244
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,520
Don't worry, My Lord.

245
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,750
Besides, Lord Canxing wants you to go to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

246
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,690
Of course.

247
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,010
After what happened to Si Yilin,

248
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,070
he'll surely ask about it.

249
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,370
How come he's injured so seriously?

250
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,090
My Lord.

251
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,120
My Lord.

252
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,570
My Lord.

253
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,570
My...

254
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,050
My Lord.

255
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,500
Lord Canxing.

256
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,690
Fetch some water.

257
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,580
Here you are.

258
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,610
Minghua.

259
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,710
Si Yilin has made great contributions to our Zichuan Family,

260
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,290
and he's very loyal.

261
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,070
Minghua.

262
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,210
It's easy to gather a thousand soldiers, but it's hard to get a general.

263
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,730
For the sake of the Zichuan Family

264
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,600
and for my sake,

265
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,610
just end this case today.

266
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,900
Lord Canxing.

267
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,630
Let me help you up first.

268
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,290
This hurts so much. It feels like needles are pricking me.

269
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,020
Take him to the backyard first.

270
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,620
Just let him have a good rest.

271
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,090
You are my closest person.

272
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,910
Then what about Si Yilin?

273
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,970
What about Si Yilin?

274
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,860
Take it.

275
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,650
Stop going forward.

276
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,970
You guys get some rest here.

277
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,890
Don't act rashly without my orders.

278
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,200
I'll go back to the Imperial Capital first.

279
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,570
Yes.

280
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,470
Who are you, brat?

281
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,330
How dare you harass the wife of Di Lin, the General of Yuanzhou?

282
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,690
Then who are you, girl?

283
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,130
How dare you call the General of Yuanzhou

284
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,000
a brat?

285
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,050
Are you hurt?

286
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,580
Where are you hurt?

287
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,570
My whole body is yours.

288
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,230
Without your permission,

289
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,760
how would I dare to get hurt?

290
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,200
Xiu knew that you were coming back.

291
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,800
He came here this afternoon.

292
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,940
He told you not to worry about Si Yilin.

293
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,810
He will solve this problem properly.

294
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,810
What Yang Minghua did this time was just as I expected.

295
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,810
He asked me to come back this time.

296
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,490
It means something big will be happening.

297
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,690
Tomorrow is Princess Ning's birthday.

298
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,940
I just feel a little uneasy.

299
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,250
Now that the muffled thunder is grumbling in the sky,

300
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,850
it means the storm is coming.

301
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,800
Ning, happy birthday.

302
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,140
You have to be forced to grow up.

303
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,620
But I will always protect you.

304
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,650
My Lord.

305
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,180
Lord Luo. Enjoy yourself at the banquet.

306
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,360
We haven't seen each other for a long time, Xiu.

307
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,950
We haven't seen each other for a long time indeed. Who is this?

308
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,840
My son, Deke.

309
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,700
It's his first time seeing such a big event.

310
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,510
Please.

311
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,280
Your Highness.

312
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,590
Where is my uncle?

313
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,010
Ask someone to go rush Lord Chieftain.

314
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,290
My Lord, it's the auspicious time now. Let's start the ceremony.

315
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,410
Our chieftain is so unrestrained.

316
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,540
At such a critical moment,

317
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,500
he still hasn't shown up yet.

318
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,020
Let's all wait for a while more.

319
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,780
According to the ceremonial protocol of Zichuan,

320
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,210
7 p.m. is an auspicious time.

321
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,410
The ceremony of conferring the title should be completed at this time.

322
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,280
If we miss it,

323
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,450
I'm afraid it might affect the future prospects of Zichuan.

324
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,610
Then ask someone to rush him now.

325
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,240
Her Highness has been waiting for 18 years.

326
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,360
And this is the moment she has been waiting for, isn't it?

327
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,010
Since it's the auspicious time now,

328
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,050
I suggest that Chief Commander Yang should confer the title

329
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,450
on the princess in place of Lord Chieftain.

330
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,820
I'm sorry.

331
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,830
I'm really late.

332
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,870
I'm sorry. I'm really late.

333
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,720
My belly has been...

334
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,370
Uncle.

335
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,780
Ning, I'm sorry.

336
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,460
My belly is aching again now.

337
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,300
I need to go to the toilet at once.

338
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,900
You guys can continue.

339
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,480
I really can't stand it anymore.

340
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,230
Since our Lord Chieftain

341
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,840
has been feeling unwell,

342
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,270
I'll finish the ceremony in place of him.

343
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,850
Everyone,

344
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,010
I hereby announce that Princess Zichuan Ning's birthday party

345
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,010
begins now.

346
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,060
Lord Chief Commander!

347
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,810
Lord Chieftain should be the one conferring the title.

348
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,850
You've crossed the line.

349
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,130
Deke, are you crazy?

350
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,450
Apologize to Lord Chief Commander now!

351
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,350
I know exactly what I'm doing.

352
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,810
I hope that you won't disturb the ceremony of

353
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,010
conferring the title at Princess Ning's birthday party.

354
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,020
According to the rules,

355
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,590
this is an act of rebellion on the part of Lord Chief Commander.

356
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,600
Rebellion? You've used this word well.

357
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,270
All the officials are intimidated by your authority.

358
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,820
They dare not speak out on their resentment.

359
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,280
But if everyone is like this, Zichuan will definitely perish.

360
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,080
Di Lin!

361
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,070
Di Lin, you're so rude.

362
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,240
My Lord, you're loyal to Zichuan

363
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,280
and you've racked your brains for the country.

364
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,010
But someone framed you for being disrespectful.

365
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,970
The soldiers of Zichuan are fighting hard

366
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,970
in Yuanzhou to protect our country.

367
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,860
But someone in the family sowed discord among the members

368
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,220
and questioned Lord Yang's loyalty.

369
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,470
I will never tolerate

370
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,940
such despicable behavior.

371
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,970
Baichuan, get the horse ready.

372
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,940
Ning, come on.

373
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,900
I know what you want to say.

374
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,120
Seven years ago, when the Liufeng Family invaded the Imperial Capital,

375
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,620
my father said the same thing as what you're about to say.

376
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,350
He asked me to wait for him here.

377
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,800
But when he came back,

378
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,960
he was seriously injured.

379
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,920
Now do you also want to tell me that

380
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,530
nothing has happened,

381
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,310
and I don't need to worry about anything,

382
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,840
so I should just wait here for you to come back?

383
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,330
Ning, what I want to tell you is that

384
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,450
Yang Minghua is going to rebel.

385
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,210
However, we're all prepared for that,

386
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,290
and we're confident that we can win.

387
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,650
Everyone has his own task.

388
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,640
You have a task, too.

389
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,520
What's my task?

390
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:06,690
Ning,

391
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,010
your life concerns the future of Zichuan.

392
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,330
Ka Dan's life concerns the relationship between the two countries.

393
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:19,000
Therefore, your task is to protect yourself and her.

394
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,489
You're lying to me again.

395
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,510
Do you think as I'm a few years older now,

396
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,760
it's not that easy to deceive me,

397
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,620
so you want to use a different way?

398
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,010
Ning, it's true that you've grown up.

399
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,030
You can have your own choices.

400
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,020
You can choose to listen to me and complete the task.

401
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,150
You can also choose not to listen to me.

402
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,030
You can walk out

403
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,179
and stop Yang Minghua from rebelling by yourself.

404
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,370
I won't stop you.

405
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,630
You're really not lying to me?

406
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,110
You guys are really well-prepared

407
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,960
and will really come back, right?

408
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,440
Of course.

409
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,050
Besides,

410
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,090
I can also tell you a small secret.

411
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,480
A secret?

412
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,930
Actually, I hired those ten girls from the Chunfeng Garden

413
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,730
in order to make you angry deliberately.

414
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,040
My purpose was to force Yang Minghua to fight against me.

415
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,370
I can't believe that in order to investigate Yang Minghua,

416
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,130
you quarrelled with me deliberately

417
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,170
and went to the Chunfeng Garden on purpose.

418
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,920
You even hired ten girls purposely.

419
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,680
Ning, I'm telling you the truth.

420
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,850
Why did you hit me?

421
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,940
Because you hid the truth from me.

422
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:52,950
Alright. How about we play a song together?

423
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,490
Now?

424
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,170
Because today is a special day.

425
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,440
I don't want this birthday

426
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,330
to be unhappy.

427
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,090
I also don't want this day

428
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,290
to be a rebellion day.

429
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,330
I hope that today will be the anniversary

430
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,750
of our success in playing a song together. What do you think?

431
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,730
Just go.

432
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,030
I'll take good care of myself.

433
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,790
I'll also take good care of Ka Dan.

434
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,970
You should pay attention to your own safety, too.

435
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,410
Don't worry. I'm Zichuan Xiu.

436
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,850
-My Lord! -My Lord! My Lord!

437
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,530
What's wrong?

438
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,580
Here you are.

439
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,940
[Lord Ge's life is in danger. Lei Hong is Yang's spy.]

440
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,850
No matter what happens tonight,

441
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,960
you'll have only one task, that is, guarding this place.

442
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,530
Yes.

443
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,010
It's really Lei Hong.

444
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,210
My Lord.

445
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,570
All these three sides are surrounded.

446
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,720
If we go down the mountain,

447
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,290
we'll be surrounded by them.

448
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,550
Is there any other way?

449
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,160
My Lord, we've blocked the roads

450
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,490
on the three sides.

451
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,300
They only have two options now.

452
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,330
The first option is to enter our ambush area.

453
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,260
The terrains here are very favorable for us.

454
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,820
We've set up a trap to prevent them from escaping.

455
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,730
By that time, thousands of arrows will be shot at the same time.

456
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,450
[Du Ke]

457
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,370
They won't be able to escape from the doom.

458
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,170
What about their second option?

459
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,370
The second option is to jump off the cliff.

460
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,800
Then let's jump from here.

461
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,610
What?

462
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,200
I've never relaxed

463
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,210
the requirements for Yuanzhou Army's cliff training.

464
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,730
Hurry up and fetch the rope.

465
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,530
Lei Hong won't give us much time.

466
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,250
My Lord.

467
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,720
Just go.

468
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,350
I should go?

469
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,490
I've received an order to kill you.

470
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,800
But I really can't bear to kill you.

471
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,380
Eight years ago,

472
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,740
Lord Yuanxing ordered me to stay by your side.

473
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,210
If you want to rebel, I'll need to kill you on the spot.

474
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,770
If you don't rebel, I'll be your follower till my death.

475
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,380
My Lord, I've been with you for many years.

476
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,590
I know your temper and personality well.

477
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,620
You won't rebel.

478
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,120
You will never rebel.

479
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,760
I'm already on your side now.

480
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,660
I will never hurt you.

481
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,410
My Lord, please leave at once.

482
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,830
I know you are that person.

483
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,330
At that time, Yuanxing was attacked and badly injured.

484
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,490
He entrusted his adopted son to me when he was dying.

485
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,170
I once suggested that he should

486
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,330
arrange someone beside Yang Minghua and me respectively

487
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,530
in case of rebellion.

488
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,970
He did do that.

489
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,360
But I've never rebelled.

490
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,040
Nor will I rebel.

491
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,610
But you've received an order to kill me.

492
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,720
Right?

493
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,050
Yes.

494
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,630
After Yuanxing died,

495
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,760
Canxing is the only person who can give you and the other person this order.

496
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,650
Right?

497
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,740
Yes.

498
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,980
Once Yang Minghua rebels,

499
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,720
we can use this object to subdue him.

500
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,980
Since he can kill me,

501
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,020
it looks like he is quite confident that

502
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,620
he can kill Yang Minghua, right?

503
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:40,490
My Lord.

504
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,840
Without Yang Minghua,

505
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,530
I'll also be useless to him.

506
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,510
Not only that,

507
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,080
without Yang Minghua,

508
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,730
I'll be a threat to him instead.

509
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,420
He can't take away my military power.

510
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,080
Nor can he remove my prestige.

511
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,020
He can't even defeat me because I'm more capable than him.

512
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,290
Lord Ge, Zichuan is so lucky to have you.

513
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,170
I must die.
