[Episode 5]

4
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,310
Second Brother.

5
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,160
Second Brother.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,850
Why didn't you tell me in advance before you came?

7
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,430
What's the matter?

8
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,440
Is there any new face in the War Prisoner Camp?

9
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,960
I don't think so.

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
What's wrong?

11
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,990
Did something wrong happen?

12
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,470
Tomorrow, Princess Ka Dan

13
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,250
must arrive at the site for the peace talk. Otherwise, it'll be cancelled.

14
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,430
That means from tonight

15
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,650
to tomorrow morning,

16
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,910
Princess Ka Dan's safety will be very important.

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,920
By the way, I also met our eldest brother.

18
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,530
Use the body language.

19
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,829
At night?

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
It'll be dangerous at night?

21
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,910
A woman?

22
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,520
Ka Dan will be in danger?

23
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,190
He also said that...

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,060
Yang Minghua is going to take action.

25
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,480
There's a mole.

26
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,040
Be safe. It's good to be safe.

27
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,460
Second Brother, it was our eldest brother's idea just now.

28
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,540
It wasn't my idea. Let me help you massage it.

29
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,380
Alright.

30
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,050
After Baichuan finishes recording the names,

31
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,970
I will compare her records

32
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,910
with the initial records of the War Prisoner Camp.

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,100
I'll also strengthen the surveillance measures tonight.

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,030
Second Brother.

35
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,670
At such a critical moment,

36
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,360
you should protect the princess closely.

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,470
It's inappropriate for a man and a woman to stay in a room alone.

38
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,329
It's indeed inappropriate for a man and a woman to stay in a room alone.

39
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,300
But it's fine if two men stay in a room alone,

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,360
isn't it?

41
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,070
What two men...

42
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,550
I've escorted Princess Ka Dan back to her room.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,460
No!

44
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,980
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

45
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,350
I think it's more appropriate for you to say this.

46
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,680
I think it's more appropriate for Si Yilin to say this thing.

47
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,230
But why do I think that it's more appropriate for you to say it?

48
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,970
You were like this every time.

49
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,350
It's not fun at all.

50
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,950
Gentlemen.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,430
Princess Ka Dan.

52
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,870
Which of us do you think

53
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,950
is more

54
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,270
suitable to be your sister?

55
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,430
Your Highness, I'll pick you up tomorrow.

56
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,260
Rest early.

57
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,190
Dispatch more people here and ask more men to guard this place

58
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,050
in order to protect the princess.

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:14,990
Yes!

60
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,280
Let's go.

61
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,500
Who are you?

62
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,750
Chase him!

63
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,420
Chase him!

64
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,620
[Si's Mansion]

65
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,510
Normally, few people come into my mansion.

66
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,790
So, you can stay here without worrying.

67
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,550
I'll personally protect you outside this room.

68
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,530
This bell...

69
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,660
It's inappropriate for me to stay in the same room with you alone.

70
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,090
So, if you need anything,

71
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,800
or you're in danger,

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
ring the bell at any time.

73
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,860
I've asked some maids to take care of you.

74
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,280
They are all the trustworthy people in my mansion.

75
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,340
Tomorrow morning,

76
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,470
Xiu and I will escort you to the site for the peace talk.

77
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,150
Rest early.

78
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,630
Thank you.

79
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,940
You're welcome.

80
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,100
Your Highness, these are

81
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,570
some homemade pastries.

82
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,230
I hope you'll like them.

83
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,410
Your Highness,

84
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,750
if you need anything, just tell us.

85
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,490
Lord Si Yilin has told us

86
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,110
not to slight you.

87
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,390
Thank you.

88
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,690
I think one of my accessories is missing.

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,620
Maybe I lost it when I took off my cloak just now.

90
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,280
How does this accessory look?

91
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,510
Its color is gold.

92
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,590
Its color is gold?

93
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,520
Maybe... Is it at the entrance?

94
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,050
Okay, Your Highness. I'll help you look for it.

95
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,010
Are you okay, Princess Ka Dan?

96
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,590
Who are you?

97
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,860
I'm Baichuan, Captain of the Ministry of Government Supervision.

98
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,880
It's inappropriate for men like you to go inside.

99
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,140
I'll go inside and visit Princess Ka Dan.

100
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,320
Greetings, Princess Ka Dan.

101
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,800
Zichuan Xiu.

102
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,570
Why are you here?

103
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,820
Luckily, I'm here, so I can help you...

104
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,870
Go ahead.

105
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,430
Luckily, I'm here, so I can help you out.

106
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,070
Didn't you leave this afternoon?

107
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,050
Why are you back?

108
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,600
This afternoon, I heard the war prisoners complaining about...

109
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,890
Lower your voice.

110
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,870
This afternoon, I heard the war prisoners complaining about the food,

111
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,720
so I went to buy some pastries and brought them here.

112
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,240
This is for Princess Ka Dan.

113
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,920
You're quite thoughtful.

114
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,590
You also came at the right time.

115
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,180
Why are you looking at me?

116
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,480
Do you think I'm very beautiful now?

117
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,860
Miss Xiu, are you a pervert?

118
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,150
You're the pervert.

119
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,270
Since you are here,

120
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,670
you will be the one protecting the princess tonight.

121
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,800
How come you have the wind bell?

122
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,280
I... I don't know, My Lord.

123
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,170
Your Highness.

124
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
Lord Mu Qi is waiting for you at the embassy.

125
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,720
Please.

126
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,700
Nothing unusual happened in the War Prisoner Camp tonight.

127
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,870
Everything is fine.

128
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,160
The golden cicada has escaped.

129
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,340
Yes.

130
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,760
But you're really a man of wonderful forsight, My Lord.

131
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,430
There is indeed something unusual with the North Clan.

132
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,360
They went to Si Yilin's mansion to take someone away.

133
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,380
This person is Princess Ka Dan.

134
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,640
When the mantis was stalking the cicada, it didn't know the golden oriole was behind it.

135
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,260
The carriage used to take the princess away went towards the west city gate,

136
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,590
instead of the embassy.

137
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,710
It seems that the members of the North Clan

138
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,120
think differently about the peace talk.

139
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,590
The third party benefits from the tussle between the other two parties.

140
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,630
I'm very satisfied with the result of the Palace Guards'

141
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,780
military drill this time.

142
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,580
Lei Xun can take on the important responsibility.

143
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,550
The Palace Guards have been receiving training for many days. They're really tired.

144
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,670
Lord Lei requested that the Palace Guards should take half a day off by turns,

145
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,930
and the time of the curfew should be advanced so that they can go home and rest.

146
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,670
Tonight?

147
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,660
Yes, it's tonight.

148
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,050
It makes sense.

149
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,950
How is my father? How are my two brothers?

150
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,150
Please don't worry.

151
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,310
Everything is fine with the Divine Emperor and the two princes.

152
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,770
They are all looking forward to your return.

153
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,190
But why does Lord Mu Qi want to see me late at night?

154
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,120
Lord Mu Qi is worried that someone might sabotage the peace talk,

155
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,920
so he has made this arrangement.

156
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:56,790
My Lord.

157
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,090
Check every city gate at once.

158
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,710
Don't let any carriages leave the city.

159
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,110
Yes.

160
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,940
How long will it take to travel from here to the embassy?

161
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,540
Don't worry, Your Highness.

162
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,560
You will see Lord Mu Qi soon.

163
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,960
Close the city gate at once.

164
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,620
Commander Lei is merciful today,

165
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,590
and has advanced the time of the curfew.

166
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,110
Let's go for a drink.

167
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,250
-Let's go. -Let's go for a drink. Come on.

168
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,750
It's not easy to have a night off.

169
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,290
You single men go have a drink.

170
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,250
I'm not going.

171
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,220
I have to wait for Miss Xiang'er.

172
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,890
Let's go.

173
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,360
Look at you.

174
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,280
Let's go.

175
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,600
-Close the gate. -Let's go.

176
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,720
Wait.

177
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,750
Under the order of the superiors, the time of tonight's curfew was advanced.

178
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,690
No one is allowed to enter or go out of the city.

179
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,140
Who gave the order? And when did he give the order?

180
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,440
We're just following orders.

181
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,030
Please don't make things difficult for us, My Lord.

182
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,590
My Lord.

183
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,960
We've received a report from a buddy.

184
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,630
A carriage has left the city from the west city gate.

185
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,490
The west city gate?

186
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:05,850
Yes.

187
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,590
Did a carriage go out from here?

188
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,940
Yes, but the time of today's curfew has been advanced.

189
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,070
The city gate has been closed.

190
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,240
If you are in a hurry to leave the city,

191
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,860
you have to wait till the city gate is opened tomorrow morning,

192
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,650
and then you can come here.

193
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,690
Open the gate.

194
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,750
My Lord, according to the rules,

195
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,210
we are under the management of the Palace Guards.

196
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,480
If you are in a hurry to leave the city,

197
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,820
go ask Lord Lei Xun first.

198
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,260
I'm asking you to open the city gate now!

199
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,940
Okay.

200
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,610
Gentlemen, the peace talk is coming soon,

201
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,680
but I left without permission at midnight.

202
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,210
I'm afraid it won't be good for our North Clan.

203
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,150
I think I should go back to Si Yilin's Mansion now.

204
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,150
We've left for not a very long time.

205
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,370
If we go back now,

206
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,610
Zichuan's military officers might not have noticed it.

207
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,200
When you see Lord. Mu Qi,

208
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,000
you can discuss it with him.

209
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,700
You are not Lord Mu Qi's men.

210
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,950
I'm sorry to offend you, Your Highness.

211
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,170
Now you should make some sacrifices for the sake of the North Clan.

212
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,580
Are you under Prince Ka Dun's command?

213
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,110
My elder brother has never wanted to have a peace talk.

214
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,700
In order to achieve his goal,

215
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,580
even though he has to sacrifice my life,

216
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,890
he'll still try to realize his goal at all costs.

217
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,849
Your Highness, I'm sorry for my offence.

218
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,740
Wait.

219
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,790
Although the North Clan is blessed by God,

220
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,920
death will still be the ending for everyone eventually.

221
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,510
You don't need to kill me by yourselves.

222
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,640
If you still respect me as a princess,

223
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,040
please show me your last respect.

224
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,150
I'll do it myself.

225
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,940
Your Highness, it's me.

226
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,070
It's fine now.

227
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,460
It's fine now.

228
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,260
Lord Si.

229
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,690
Come with me.

230
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,290
He didn't come back home to sleep last night. He even dared to take a woman back here?

231
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,290
Where is she? Where did you hide her?

232
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,310
What? I'm alone here.

233
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,590
What's wrong?

234
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,870
Come out.

235
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,070
What are you doing?

236
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,310
Come out.

237
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,960
Where is she hiding?

238
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,190
I'm alone here.

239
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,080
It's impossible that you're alone here.

240
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,610
Come out.

241
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
Then what is this?

242
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,030
-This is...
-Let me see how you will explain it.

243
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,290
Are you going to say that

244
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,490
you don't like women?

245
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,140
Ning, let me explain! Ning!

246
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,640
Ning!

247
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,510
Ning, open the door!

248
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,590
Let me explain!

249
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,680
I won't listen!

250
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,640
Fine.

251
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,100
But to prove my innocence,

252
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,800
lend me some money first.

253
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,160
Why do you want the money?

254
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,490
I'll go to Chunfeng Garden to prove that I really like women.

255
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,290
Go away!

256
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,230
I...

257
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,390
I'll just go away.

258
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,210
You really went away just because I had asked you to go away?

259
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,550
Second Brother, what will we have for breakfast this morning?

260
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,640
Where is he?

261
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,730
Second Brother.

262
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,710
Lord Xiu.

263
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,740
I didn't see Lord Si Yilin this morning.

264
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,470
What about Princess Ka Dan?

265
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,870
I didn't see her, either.

266
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,010
Did Princess Ka Dan stay in this room last night?

267
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,550
Yes.

268
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,690
When the mantis was stalking the cicada, it didn't know the golden oriole was behind it.

269
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,390
This is a cave.

270
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,510
Let's hide here for the time being.

271
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,300
Lord Si, is your wound caused by the arrow all right?

272
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
It's not serious.

273
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,790
I'm fine.

274
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,390
The mountain road is rough here.

275
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,050
How about you take this sword?

276
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,300
Thank you.

277
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,310
Your Highness, I'm sorry for my offence.

278
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,940
We've drunk three pots of water.

279
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,630
Is Lord Ge trying to make us full by drinking water

280
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,760
so that he can save the money for a meal?

281
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,800
What about the man yesterday?

282
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,500
I'm here. I'm coming.

283
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,860
Lord Lu Di,

284
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,960
you must have missed me all night.

285
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,610
Why are you just standing there? Refill the cups with some hot tea.

286
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,450
It's hot. Hold the pot steadily.

287
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,800
Yes.

288
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,920
I just want to take you back to the North Clan so that I can miss you every night.

289
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,250
It depends on whether Lord Ge is willing to let you go with me.

290
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,760
Lord Ge, here's some hot tea.

291
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,590
It's hot!

292
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
You're so clumsy!

293
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,220
I'll send you back later so that you can learn the rules again.

294
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,710
Lord Ge.

295
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,070
How about this? I'll go back and help you get changed.

296
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,460
You can punish me by that time.

297
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,340
Okay. Let's go.

298
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,600
I'll take Lord Ge back to get changed.

299
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,930
We'll be back here soon.

300
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,330
I asked you to protect Ka Dan for a night,

301
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,690
but she's missing now.

302
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,680
Master, Ka Dan eloped with Si Yilin.

303
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,720
It has nothing to do with me.

304
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,770
Not only did you lose Ka Dan,

305
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,170
but you also made Si Yilin get into trouble.

306
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,330
The princess's sedan chair must show up at the scene today.

307
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,060
We must let them see the princess.

308
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,980
We must?

309
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,910
Master, is any princess okay?

310
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,940
What do you mean?

311
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,710
Don't worry. Leave it to me. I can solve this problem.

312
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,350
By the way,

313
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,440
I found this thing, too.

314
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,970
I found this thing in Si Yilin's mansion.

315
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,440
I think this is the reason why they eloped.

316
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,220
We need to work together to solve this problem.

317
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,630
Got it.

318
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,990
Where is Princess Ka Dan?

319
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,180
Calm down.

320
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,340
Princess Ka Dan will be here soon.

321
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,330
Lord Lu Di, as you know,

322
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,680
the roads in Zichuan

323
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,290
are too difficult to walk on.

324
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,260
They're not smooth at all.

325
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,840
There are so many people that it's difficult to walk through the crowded streets.

326
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,310
The princess's sedan chair is here!

327
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,120
Lord Mu Qi.

328
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,750
For the welcoming ceremony for the princess,

329
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,750
there are still some parts which I want to discuss with you.

330
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,600
Okay.

331
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,470
Okay. Come on. This way, please.

332
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,280
Your Highness.

333
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,950
Her Highness has been unaccustomed to the new environment, which has led to a sudden attack of rubella.

334
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,170
She can't see anyone face to face now.

335
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,830
She'll wait inside the sedan chair for the good news

336
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,550
about your successful peace talk.

337
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,590
Your Highness, there's no need to be afraid of rubella.

338
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,670
I have some specific medicine for this disease.

339
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,940
Lord Lu Di, just give the medicine to me.

340
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,680
Lord Lu Di.

341
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,470
Due to the weather in Zichuan,

342
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,930
even you had rubella once.

343
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,310
Now Her Highness has got this disease, too.

344
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,330
Since you once suffered the pain of rubella,

345
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,720
I think you know how bad it feels to have this disease.

346
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,420
In my opinion,

347
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,750
we shouldn't force Her Highness to see us.

348
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,910
Your Highness,

349
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,710
please let me see you.

350
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,500
Otherwise, I can't feel relieved.

351
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,510
Lord Lu Di, the princess has a noble status,

352
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,830
and she's sick now.

353
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,410
Don't be reckless and disturb the princess.

354
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,260
I used to be the princess's teacher.

355
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,040
Just let me greet the princess face to face.

356
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,750
It's about the national dignity.

357
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,010
Lord Mu Qi, please take a look carefully.

358
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,350
I'm Mu Qi. Greetings, Your Highness.

359
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,450
Sorry for my rudeness.

360
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,720
Please forgive me for greeting you late

361
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,370
and not taking good care of you.

362
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,300
Your rubella is still very severe.

363
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,390
Please go back and take a rest first.

364
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,750
We'll discuss the peace talk tomorrow.

365
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,110
The peace talk is urgent. The princess must be at the scene.

366
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,020
Lu Di! The princess is sick and looks quite pale.

367
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,300
But for the sake of the peace talk,

368
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
she still came here personally regardless of her sick body.

369
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,870
If the princess's condition gets worse,

370
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,840
can you afford the consequences?

371
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,530
Right. We should give priority to the princess's health.

372
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,870
Is it the person inside the sedan chair really our princess?

373
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,800
What do you mean?

374
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,010
I've served the princess for many years.

375
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,390
How could I be wrong?

376
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,970
Lord Ge, how about

377
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,830
changing the time for the peace talk to tomorrow?

378
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,930
Okay. The princess's health is more important.

379
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,830
When the princess's condition gets better tomorrow,

380
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,960
we'll continue to have the peace talk.

381
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,840
Go find out where the princess is now.

382
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,680
Your acting skills were so bad.

383
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,750
You already arranged everything anyway.

384
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,630
What did you say? The princess is missing?

385
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,760
Some people tried to assassinate the princess.

386
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,240
Si Yilin, Deputy Commander of the Royal Escorts, protected her and took her away.

387
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,900
But we don't know where they are now.

388
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,190
I'm telling you the truth,

389
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,410
because I hope that you can help me.

390
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,510
Now it's the critical moment of the peace talk.

391
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,750
If this news is spread out, the peace talk will definitely fail.

392
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,590
Thus, I'm so bold as to ask you

393
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,920
to hide the truth for me.

394
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,240
I will do my best

395
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,480
to find the princess as soon as possible.

396
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,600
Alright.

397
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,510
You keep saying that you've done everything for the peace talk,

398
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,460
but you can't even protect the princess well.

399
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,930
How can I trust you?

400
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,270
Calm down, My Lord.

401
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm afraid the one who is unwilling to have a peace talk now

402
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,990
and even wants to assassinate the princess

403
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,850
isn't from Zichuan.

404
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,160
We found this thing in the princess' residence.

405
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,890
I think you're quite clear about

406
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,550
what this feather stands for.

407
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,710
So, please help me get three days

408
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,850
so that I can find the princess and facilitate the peace talk.

409
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,250
You even want three days?

410
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,570
I'm afraid the princess will turn into ashes in three days.

411
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,110
I'll give you one day. Just one day.

412
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,430
If we can't see the princess at this hour tomorrow,

413
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,430
we'll see each other on the battlefield.

414
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,130
Remember. You only have one day.

415
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,190
Master, am I beautiful?

416
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,220
Go away.

417
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,190
Old fogey.

418
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,120
My Lord, in the princess's carriage,

419
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,410
we found the princess's belongings contaminated by blood.

420
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,470
Please have a look.

421
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,040
Whether she's alive or dead, I have to see her.

422
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,190
No.

423
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,500
I only want her corpse.

424
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
My Lord, we didn't find any corpses.

425
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,470
My Lord, there is blood here.

426
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,970
They were injured by poisonous arrows, and the poison will take effect soon.

427
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,150
Let's split up to search for them.

428
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,810
We must take their heads back.

429
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,910
Yes.

430
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,600
The princess didn't arrive at the site for the peace talk.

431
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,950
Of course.

432
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,410
They claimed that the princess suffered from rubella.

433
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,070
To prevent her condition from getting worse,

434
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,530
the peace talk will be postponed for one day.

435
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,350
One day? That's okay.

436
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,140
There's only one day. The search range is both inside and outside the Imperial Capital.

437
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,260
Lord Ge can't make it public, too.

438
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,830
There are many restrictions for him to look for the princess.

439
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,810
The North Clan has also sent many martial artists to look for her.

440
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,270
With Si Yilin's own power,

441
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,980
it's hard for him to protect the princess.

442
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,490
However, Zichuan Xiu is secretly searching for the princess.

443
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,590
If he helps and rescues them in time,

444
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,240
Lord Ge won't need to worry.

445
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,500
My Lord.

446
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,390
Zichuan Xiu

447
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,900
is really Lord Ge's right-hand man.

448
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,320
Boss.

449
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,530
Where have you been?

450
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,500
Everyone is looking for you.

451
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,630
Everyone?

452
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,350
Ming Yu is looking for you.

453
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,950
He said he wanted to ask for the money for the gifts yesterday.

454
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,130
He said it seemed to be an unfair trade for him.

455
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,580
Don't tell him I'm here.

456
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,910
Who else is looking for me?

457
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,250
Lady Ning is looking for you.

458
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,100
She said when she found you, she would kill you and then leave.

459
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,700
Then just tell her I'm dead.

460
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,940
Is there anything else that is worse?

461
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,810
Lord Yang Minghua is looking for you.

462
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,140
Yang Minghua?

463
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,350
Boss, you're in good luck in the official circles now.

464
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,750
Not only do you have Lord Ge's protection,

465
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,080
but Lord Yang has also invited you for tea.

466
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,110
When should I have tea with him?

467
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,350
Right now. At once.

468
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,700
He said you should go to see him immediately.

469
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,440
Okay, I'll go now.

470
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,280
By the way, Luo Jie...

471
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,630
Who told you to wait for me here?

472
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,100
Baichuan.

473
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,210
Baichuan?

474
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,540
Every word you said

475
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,420
makes me so eager to die now.

476
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,720
My Lord.

477
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,930
I'm Zichuan Xiu. Greetings, Lord Commander.

478
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,970
Xiu, you're here.

479
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,270
How shameless!

480
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,630
Loser!

481
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,889
You two shouldn't argue with each other when you meet every time.

482
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,949
This is the Ministry of War after all.

483
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,790
Xiu, you've been back for so long,

484
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,920
but why didn't you come to see me?

485
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,389
My Lord, you are right.

486
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,360
I've lived a free life in Yuanzhou for a long time.

487
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,770
I don't know the rules. It's my fault.

488
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,800
Please forgive me, My Lord.

489
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,570
If I wanted to blame you, I wouldn't have asked you to come.

490
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,630
Xiu, come here.

491
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,429
These are 13 weapons used by the generals

492
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,550
when the State of Zichuan was first founded.

493
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,630
According to the records in ancient books,

494
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,090
I've made these weapons one by one.

495
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,560
Although the first weapon, Thousand Turns Throat-Slitting Sword,

496
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,800
is made of pure iron,

497
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,860
it combines both softness and firmness together while hiding its true power.

498
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,790
It can take people's lives away in the blink of an eye.

499
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,310
The second one is called Dragaon and Snake Spear.

500
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,600
Its blade is like the moon. Its edge is as bright as the stars on a cold night.

501
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,230
It can stab people like a dragon claw and sweep around like a snake tail.

502
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,160
It's the best among all the spears.

503
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,990
The third weapon...

504
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,930
The third weapon is the Soul-hunting Swivel Hook.

505
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,400
My Lord, actually, I've heard of all these weapons.

506
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,090
But I didn't expect that you would make all these weapons.

507
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,460
I really admire you.

508
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,870
Xiu has led the army to fight in battles for many years,

509
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,530
and is indeed knowledgeable.

510
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,440
And I can sense that

511
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,570
you are very interested in weapons.

512
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,440
Tell me about the third weapon in detail.

513
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,800
My Lord.

514
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,790
My Lord, actually among all the weapons,

515
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,570
the most amazing one is called Curly-grass Double-moon Knife.

516
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,890
You don't have it here.

517
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,670
On the blade of this knife,

518
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,340
there are patterns of men-eating Curly Grass that can only be found in Yuanzhou.

519
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,140
That's great.

520
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,510
Coincidentally, I haven't made

521
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,830
this weapon yet.

522
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,680
I just lack the pattern of this grass.

523
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,310
Got it.

524
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,240
My Lord, I will find it for you now.

525
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,220
No need.

526
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,130
Just draw it for me.

527
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,980
My Lord, look at my hands.

528
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,950
They're used for holding weapons.

529
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,810
I don't know how to draw pictures.

530
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,930
It doesn't matter.

531
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,520
You just need to draw the pattern

532
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,070
according to your memory.

533
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,490
I will ask a painter to process and improve it.

534
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,320
My Lord, you are busy with work.

535
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,190
It's not convenient for me to stay here.

536
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,510
It will affect your work.

537
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,670
I'll leave now.

538
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,630
It doesn't matter.

539
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,350
The side hall is ready for you.

540
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,070
My Lord, you're so thoughtful.

541
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,000
Please.

542
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,670
Di Lin.

543
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,250
I've always told you to make peace with Xiu.

544
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,230
This is a good chance.

545
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,170
Draw the picture with him. Talk about the past

546
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,980
and recall the past with him.

547
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,810
Maybe the grudges between you two will be settled,

548
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,410
and then you two will make up with each other.

549
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,670
Don't bother, My Lord.

550
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,040
I won't associate with him anymore for the rest of my life.

551
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,110
I'm kind enough to him by not killing him.

552
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,040
It's impossible for me to be in the same room with him.

553
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,000
I still have an important task to do. I have to go.

554
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,860
Di Lin! Xiu is a young hero.

555
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,280
He's also a pillar of Zichuan.

556
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,220
If you don't get along well with him, is it good for Zichuan?

557
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,830
My Lord, you're far-sighted. I was thoughtless.

558
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,000
I'll go draw the picture with him now.

559
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,570
This is right.

560
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,090
He did this on purpose.

561
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,180
He must know that something wrong happened to Si Yilin and Ka Dan.

562
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,910
He doesn't let me look for them.

563
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,730
It seems that he doesn't trust you, either.

564
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,410
On one hand,

565
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,770
he's doing this for the sake of safety.

566
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,190
On the other hand, the purpose is to test me.

567
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,830
But every time Tieshou adds coal,

568
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,210
he'll pass by this room.

569
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,560
He's here to monitor us.

570
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,010
Therefore, only one of us can go out.

571
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,970
Can you do it alone?

572
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,160
Take off your clothes.

573
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,480
Your Highness, I have some medicine.

574
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,770
You can treat your injury by yourself.

575
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,900
No, thanks, Lord Si.

576
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,310
It's just a minor sprain.

577
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,600
I'll be fine after some rest.

578
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,340
But your injury

579
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,350
should be treated as soon as possible.

580
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,750
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

581
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,910
Please return the sword to me.

582
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,950
Have a good rest, Your Highness.

583
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,970
Your Highness, I'll wait here.

584
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,540
If you need anything, just tell me.

585
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,920
Please help yourself, Lord Si.

586
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,670
Lord Si, I know a little about medical skills.

587
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,500
I can help you treat your wounds.

588
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,890
It doesn't matter. Your Highness, you've worried too much.

589
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,230
Lord Si!

590
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,160
Lord Si!

591
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,950
Lord Si!

592
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,140
How are they?

593
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,370
Zichuan Xiu seemed to be drawing the picture quickly.

594
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,970
Di Lin watched him indifferently. They didn't communicate with each other at all.

595
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,200
It's good that they're both there.

596
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,400
Are they both there?

597
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,200
I'll go take a look again.
