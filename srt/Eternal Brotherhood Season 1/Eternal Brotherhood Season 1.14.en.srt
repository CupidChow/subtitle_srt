[Episode 14]

4
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,990
They didn't do anything to you, did they?

5
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,620
What could they do to me?

6
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,009
Why did Lord Ge have your man beside him?

7
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,130
That's what I do.

8
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,060
Not only Lord Ge,

9
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,400
I have moles beside every big shot in the Imperial Capital.

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,370
Although this

11
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,180
is repugnant to the law,

12
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,210
how can we avoid these

13
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,320
when doing the monitoring and intelligence work?

14
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,560
Both you and Luo Minghai contributed to the suppression of the rebellion.

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,290
Lord Canxing can't do anything

16
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,750
but let Luo Minghai investigate.

17
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,610
He's insisting

18
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,410
this is the solid evidence that you killed Lord Ge.

19
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,870
Do you have any idea?

20
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,670
My Lord, the time is up.

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,770
Can you take responsibility if I can't find out the truth?

22
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,079
Can you?

23
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,290
Si Yilin.

24
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,370
Forget it. He's just following orders.

25
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,380
We'll leave in half an hour.

26
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,050
My men found something.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,960
If you really want to help me,

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,530
find someone for me.

29
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,680
Okay.

30
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,470
We'll go now.

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,290
One more thing.

32
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,760
Can you go to my house?

33
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,560
I haven't been back all night.

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Xiujia must be worried sick.

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
I got some bonsai sent to our mansion

36
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,790
and promised I'd plant them with her.

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,570
But now it seems that

38
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,430
I won't be able to go back in a short time.

39
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,810
Tell her I have something to do

40
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,070
and I'll go back later.

41
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,200
Got it.

42
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,880
Si Yilin.

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,490
Xiu.

44
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,790
Thank you.

45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,650
He's been tortured?

46
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,670
Yes, and he's badly injured.

47
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,100
We don't have much time. We'd better hurry.

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,890
I've found out

49
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,540
Weiming may know the truth about Lord Ge's death.

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,600
In a straw hut in the northwest suburbs

51
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,570
of Qunian Town, Dake Province.

52
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,870
Use marching marks as the route sign.

53
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,500
I'll go find him.

54
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,820
Okay, leave the rest to me.

55
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,150
Don't worry about Xiu.

56
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,690
He's fine.

57
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,730
Later,

58
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,960
I'll go to the Jintai Hotel to see my sister-in-law.

59
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,890
I'm leaving.

60
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm going to the Jintai Hotel to see my sister-in-law.

61
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,640
I'll go to see Xiujia myself.

62
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,100
We're both girls. It's more convenient.

63
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,290
You have no idea.

64
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,220
Since you got hurt,

65
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,520
Ka Dan has been worried about you.

66
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,650
How can I let you, a princess, go…

67
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,320
Get decisive, will you?

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,730
Do you really want Ka Dan

69
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,490
to keep worrying about you?

70
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,570
Princess Ning, if you have something to do,

71
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,700
you can go back.

72
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,640
It's tedious work to dig holes and plant seedlings.

73
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,340
It's usually Di Lin

74
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,770
who would do this with me.

75
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,080
Now he told me not to wait for him.

76
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,990
He must have something more important to do.

77
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,800
The flowers are a bit wilted.

78
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,080
As long as they're watered sufficiently and taken care of,

79
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,740
they'll come back to life.

80
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,620
I believe Di Lin will be fine.

81
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,710
The three of them will be safe.

82
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,370
Freeze!

83
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,110
Who are you? Who sent you here?

84
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:22,890
Don't!

85
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,490
How are you?

86
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:32,940
Careful.

87
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
What happened?

88
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,220
What happened?

89
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,440
They gained the advantage, after all.

90
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,530
Stop talking now.

91
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,200
I'll carry you back. Let's talk later.

92
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,090
It'll be too late if I don't say it now.

93
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,850
How did Lord Ge die?

94
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,530
Lei Hong or Yang Minghua?

95
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,800
Neither.

96
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,100
Lord Ge walked to his death voluntarily.

97
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,680
No.

98
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,340
Lord Ge's last sentence

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
that he wanted me to tell you is…

100
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,850
"Zichuan is the most important."

101
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,390
If Zichuan Xiu comes to you in the future,

102
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,450
you must tell him, "Zichuan is the most important."

103
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,210
"Zichuan is the most important."

104
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,450
I know Zichuan is the most important.

105
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,780
What on earth happened?

106
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,409
I know.

107
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,650
Zichuan is the most important.

108
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,200
Zichuan is the most important.

109
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,490
I see.

110
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,250
It's him.

111
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,610
It's him!

112
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,410
Rascal?

113
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,830
Rascal!

114
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,970
It must be him.

115
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,880
He's the only one

116
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,970
who could make Lord Ge die without a choice.

117
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,120
Xiu,

118
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,060
why did you kneel the moment you arrived?

119
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,290
If you have something to say, just say it.

120
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,690
Get up and talk. What's wrong?

121
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,770
I'm here for Di Lin's case.

122
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,970
Now, Luo Minghai is in charge of Di Lin's case.

123
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,870
Lord Ge Shan is his assistant.

124
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,670
Yes.

125
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,500
They are both meritorious officials

126
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,290
who contributed to the suppression of Yang Minghua's rebellion.

127
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,620
Di Lin killed all of Luo Minghai's family.

128
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,970
Luo Minghai won't let Di Lin off easily this time.

129
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,990
Xiu, when it comes to the court,

130
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,860
we should all focus on the overall situation

131
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,460
and Zichuan.

132
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,090
In order to eliminate Lord Yang,

133
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,550
Luo Minghai has been lurking beside him.

134
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,780
He cast his life and safety aside for you.

135
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,760
Now his whole family is dead under false accusations,

136
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
so in order to be accountable to him,

137
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,410
you want to punish Di Lin severely.

138
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,530
I can understand that.

139
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,730
You're implying something.

140
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,090
My Lord, you are wise.

141
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,230
Luo Minghai and Di Lin are both meritorious officials.

142
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,190
I believe

143
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,010
you will protect both of them at the same time.

144
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,820
Of course.

145
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,140
They're both meritorious officials.

146
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,090
Both of them should be rewarded.

147
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,150
An innocent person shouldn't be wronged.

148
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,810
Xiu, have some faith in the power of Zichuan's law.

149
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,080
I won't let meritorious officials

150
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,850
be wrongly accused.

151
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,700
Of course, we still need to be more mature

152
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,900
and perform our duties while in the post.

153
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,300
You are right. I understand.

154
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,860
So, please release Di Lin immediately

155
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,010
and reward him according to his merits.

156
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,560
Of course I would reward people according to their merits.

157
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,760
And you are the first one to be rewarded.

158
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,560
Because you're not only meritorious

159
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,490
but also my brother's adopted son.

160
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,240
Moreover, you're a famous general in Yuanzhou,

161
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,670
Ning's lover,

162
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,170
and Lord Ge Yingxing's beloved disciple.

163
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,670
You're the future of Zichuan.

164
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,930
My Lord, I dare not take credit.

165
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,270
All I want is to go back to Yuanzhou and protect Zichuan.

166
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,310
Why would you go back to Yuanzhou?

167
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,280
I, Zichuan Xiu,

168
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,990
only want to carry on the unfinished work of Lord Ge.

169
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,470
Will it be good for your future

170
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,110
if you stay in Yuanzhou all the time?

171
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,730
What about Ning?

172
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,700
I know. It's hard for you

173
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,750
to accept Lord Ge Yingxing's death.

174
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,890
We're all the same.

175
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,010
I won't let the murderer go.

176
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,270
I will send someone to kill Lei Hong.

177
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,340
Lord Canxing,

178
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,170
Lord Ge told me

179
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,490
that Zichuan is the most important.

180
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,290
You and Ge Yingxing

181
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,310
have been fighting battles in Yuanzhou all year long.

182
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,350
That's what he always told you, right?

183
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,080
This is the last thing Lord Ge said before he died.

184
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,110
He told me…

185
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,430
Zichuan is the most important.

186
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,700
Those are Ge Yingxing's last words?

187
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,790
His personal guard, Weiming,

188
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,680
was assassinated.

189
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,170
I wanted to save him.

190
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,770
Unfortunately, I couldn't.

191
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,730
You met Weiming?

192
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,010
What else did he say to you?

193
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,210
Do you also care about

194
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,210
what he said, Lord Canxing?

195
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,690
Of course.

196
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,430
Because I attach great importance

197
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,030
to Ge Yingxing's last words.

198
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,450
Unfortunately,

199
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,510
he didn't say anything else besides that.

200
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,770
So why Lord Ge died

201
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,320
will always be a secret.

202
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,980
No. I must find out the truth.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
Otherwise, it'll be a regret.

204
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,390
Surely.

205
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,030
Surely, we'll find out.

206
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,770
Besides Di Lin's matter,

207
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,620
I have another request.

208
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,250
Please allow me to go back to Yuanzhou.

209
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,080
Go back to Yuanzhou?

210
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,250
Don't you want Ning anymore?

211
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,660
I've never deserved her.

212
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,880
Wherever you want to go,

213
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,460
the Ministry of War will assign you.

214
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,860
Soldiers should obey orders.

215
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,680
Of course.

216
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,730
My Lord.

217
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,370
Give out my order. Tell Luo Minghai

218
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,090
the investigation on Di Lin ends here.

219
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,340
Yes.

220
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,360
Brother.

221
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,210
This time, we eliminated the rebellious traitors and went through difficult times.

222
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,970
Zichuan has finally attained its due peace.

223
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,010
The construction of Zichuan

224
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,770
relies on every one of you.

225
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,420
Greetings, Lord Chieftain.

226
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,380
The former deputy commander of the Royal Escorts, Si Yilin,

227
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,480
will be in charge of the Palace Guards as a deputy.

228
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,079
Thank you, Lord Chieftain.

229
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,329
Luo Minghai will be the commander-in-chief

230
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,829
of the Ministry of War of the Zichuan family.

231
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,310
Greetings, Lord Chieftain.

232
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,910
Di Lin will be the Minister of Military and Legal Affairs.

233
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,970
Thank you, Lord Chieftain.

234
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,680
There are many more meritorious officials.

235
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,830
The awards list will be sent to all ministries.

236
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,160
They will all be rewarded according to their merits.

237
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,090
All the other people were promoted, but he was demoted.

238
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,240
I haven't had enough of the good life

239
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,640
in the Imperial Capital.

240
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,200
And yet we're leaving again.

241
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,420
I thought the Ministry of Government Supervision

242
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,830
was already the bottom of Lord Xiuchuan's life.

243
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,900
I didn't expect that we would have to go to Jiashan Fortress with him.

244
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,830
Moreover, it's a reserve service.

245
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,020
We can raise money

246
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,790
and find a connection for him.

247
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,110
Do you have money?

248
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,440
We need to find a box and pack everything we can.

249
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,050
The box needs to be an extra-large one.

250
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,310
My Lord, aren't you going back to Ning's Mansion to pack up?

251
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,780
I still have a lot of work to hand over.

252
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,930
There are also a lot of things that I need to deal with.

253
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,930
I don't have time to go back. See you.

254
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,210
My Lady,

255
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,720
I heard the reserve service at Jiashan Fortress

256
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,770
is a government office that has no outside income,

257
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,650
and work there is tedious and complicated.

258
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,650
There's no chance to get promoted from that position.

259
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,350
I'll ask Uncle for an explanation tomorrow.

260
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,220
My Lady,

261
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,100
maybe Lord Chieftain arranged this position

262
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,550
for Lord Xiu especially.

263
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,250
You have a point.

264
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,170
Lord Ge, who guarded Yuanzhou, passed away.

265
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,790
Many people from Yuanzhou at the border

266
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,450
must be ready to make trouble.

267
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,690
Then, the importance of the reserve service

268
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,920
emerges at this time.

269
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,850
Yes.

270
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,450
But Lord Ge had just passed away,

271
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,450
and Xiu was demoted,

272
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,970
so he must be in a bad mood.

273
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,120
Mei,

274
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,650
ask the chef to prepare

275
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,800
more of his favorite dishes tomorrow.

276
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,330
My Lady.

277
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,490
You're so considerate towards Lord Xiu.

278
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,760
But as soon as he got the commission,

279
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,810
he left.

280
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,470
He's left?

281
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,520
It seems that their mission this time

282
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,570
is really urgent.

283
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,560
Maybe the military expansion is coming.

284
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,020
The work of the reserve service

285
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,750
is about to start immediately.

286
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,900
Maybe...

287
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:10,960
Mei.

288
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
Am I making excuses for him?

289
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,890
No way.

290
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,980
That must be it.

291
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,640
This room has not been cleaned for hundreds of years, has it?

292
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,810
Back in Yuanzhou,

293
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,010
I thought we were down temporarily.

294
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,010
I didn't expect that we'd always be down with Lord Xiu.

295
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,030
Hey, you guys.

296
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,950
You can't always think about

297
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,640
getting out of the Imperial Capital.

298
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,700
You must remember who took you to the Imperial Capital.

299
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,870
In my opinion,

300
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,860
this room is big and spacious.

301
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,940
And I don't have to see Ge Shan's annoying face every day.

302
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,010
So, you should all be grateful to me.

303
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,450
Don't stop.

304
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,930
You've been cleaning for days.

305
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,190
It's too inefficient.

306
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,350
What have you been doing these days?

307
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,450
I...

308
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
Besides cleaning this room,

309
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,340
I still have the camp to clean.

310
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,350
Enough talking with you. I have to go there now.

311
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,500
Are you so busy

312
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,200
that you don't even have time to say hello to me?

313
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,050
Ning, I'm really busy.

314
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,950
First, I have to

315
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,450
hold the funeral for Lord Ge.

316
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,560
Second, I went on a long trip for Di Lin.

317
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,850
Third, I had just finished those things,

318
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,790
and I had to come to Jiashan Fortress immediately.

319
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,940
I'm too busy.

320
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,800
I'm here to take you back.

321
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,490
Either you come back with me today,

322
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,020
or you don't ever come back.

323
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,260
I can't disobey Lord Canxing's order.

324
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,910
Don't use my uncle as an excuse.

325
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,680
An ordinary soldier has a visiting leave,

326
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
not to mention the reserve service.

327
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,580
I'll count to three.

328
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,510
One, two.

329
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,450
Look, our place is dirty and messy.

330
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,680
They don't clean properly.

331
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,060
What are you looking at?

332
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,270
Hurry up and clean!

333
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,500
Ning, I was wrong this time.

334
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,770
I'm sorry.

335
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,400
Three!

336
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,050
Next time!

337
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,500
I'll definitely visit you next time!

338
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,210
No one would believe you!

339
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,710
If you come after me and apologize, I'll forgive you.

340
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll count to ten.

341
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,680
My Lady, the carriage is at the door.

342
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,810
Let's get in the carriage. Okay?

343
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,610
The wheels of the carriage seem loose.

344
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,400
Check them.

345
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,970
They are not loose.

346
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,160
They are. Check them.

347
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,910
I felt it on our way here.

348
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,050
How is that possible?

349
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,840
For your safety,

350
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,410
I've checked many times. They are not loose.

351
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,800
They are. Check them.

352
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,700
Yes.

353
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,000
Lin He,

354
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,020
you must know who you are.

355
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,920
The future of you and Ning…

356
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,690
Zichuan is the most important.

357
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,890
Zichuan is the most important.

358
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,140
What are you doing?

359
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,590
Can't you see it's dirty here?

360
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,750
I was wiping it.

361
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,090
I don't understand.

362
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,080
Why do you always refuse to tell Lady Ning

363
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,010
your inner thoughts and feelings?

364
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,880
If I said them out loud,

365
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,620
would they still be "inner" thoughts?

366
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,050
In Yuanzhou,

367
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,020
how many people are there

368
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,460
who rebelled like Lei Hong's army?

369
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
About a thousand.

370
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,640
So, the rebels of 25 regiments

371
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,350
are under control.

372
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,960
My Lord,

373
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,410
I think a solid dyke can be destroyed by an ant hole.

374
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,730
I'm afraid now that the little trouble has arrived,

375
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,190
a disaster will not be far.

376
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,300
According to the scouts at the front,

377
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,630
each tribe has started to act abnormally.

378
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,550
What do you think?

379
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,850
I think we should send the Yuanzhou Army to strengthen the defense

380
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,170
and then deploy forces from the Palace Guards

381
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,700
or Border Appeasement Army

382
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,010
to go to Yuanzhou for backup.

383
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,430
We need to

384
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,050
defeat Lei Hong's rebels in seven days with an overwhelming force.

385
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,090
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

386
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,790
Caution against creeping corruption is the only way to long-term peace.

387
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,830
But this matter

388
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,220
is still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of War.

389
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,380
Write a proposal

390
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,810
and hand it to the Ministry of War.

391
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,660
Lei Hong rebelled in Yuanzhou.

392
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,090
Di Lin went to see Lord Chieftain.

393
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,930
And the generals at the border are asked to return to the court for discussion.

394
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,040
Thank you for taking the trouble to come back.

395
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,680
Lei Hong only has 25 regiments.

396
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,920
Is it necessary to summon both of us back?

397
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,440
You treated your superior's casual marks as an order and made a big fuss about it.

398
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,890
It's not a small matter.

399
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,660
Di Lin is still too young.

400
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,540
Compared to the rebellion of Lei Hong,

401
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,090
we should pay more attention to that of all the tribes in Yuanzhou.

402
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,950
Lord Chieftain is newly in power.

403
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,430
Building his prestige is more important.

404
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,990
It's just a rebellion of some petty bandits at the border.

405
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,090
It's nothing compared with the rebellion of Yang Minghua, which just ended,

406
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,840
the 200,000 Liufeng Army at the city gate seven years ago,

407
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,640
and the rebellion of the whole Border Appeasement Army

408
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,900
fifty years ago.

409
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,410
Maybe wanting to be prepared for danger in times of safety,

410
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,160
he transferred all the troops to Yuanzhou.

411
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
Yuanzhou is safe,

412
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,820
but what about the Imperial Capital?

413
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,820
He's just a clown.

414
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,470
A small village in Shaluo Province in Yuanzhou

415
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,470
left Zichuan.

416
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,700
It just declared independence.

417
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,430
Right here.

418
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,720
Not only did they leave the Family,

419
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,550
but they also established a tribe alliance army.

420
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,190
They said they wanted to protect their territory and people.

421
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,360
A village with less than 100 people

422
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,270
shouldn't be a threat, right?

423
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,630
Do you know how much impact

424
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,240
these 100 people will have?

425
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,160
Do you also think the rebellion in Yuanzhou is serious?

426
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,250
Yes, very serious.

427
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,140
Once Yuanzhou is in chaos,

428
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,610
the price of the houses in this place

429
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,740
will surely plunge.

430
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,330
No.

431
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,030
I need to check other places

432
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,200
and see if I can find anywhere else to invest.

433
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,610
This small village, with less than 100 people,

434
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,860
announced independence.

435
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,390
How big the impact could be?

436
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,130
This small village

437
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,580
was under Zichuan's control for so many years

438
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,910
and didn't want to be independent before,

439
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,020
but they suddenly announced independence.

440
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,150
What does that mean?

441
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,360
Someone must be behind this.

442
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,090
Let me finish.

443
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,920
Look. If these dots

444
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,090
were connected,

445
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,670
it would be a disaster.

446
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,040
I must take this opportunity

447
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,950
to stop the loss, sell the estates,

448
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,570
and buy some estates elsewhere.

449
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,620
Since you have money to buy estates here,

450
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,390
then the money you owe us…

451
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,670
Luckily, I didn't buy any.

452
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,810
Otherwise, I'd lose too much.

453
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,610
Orcs,

454
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,430
the Snake Race,

455
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,610
and the Elves.

456
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,030
The Orcs are the strongest among them.

457
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,130
They are large in numbers

458
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,530
and easily manipulated.

459
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,010
Once they rebel, it'll be the biggest trouble.

460
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,760
Did Xiu tell you all this?

461
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,650
Yes.

462
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,730
Xiu has been in Yuanzhou for seven years.

463
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,210
He knows a lot about these tribes.

464
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,080
But he said

465
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,320
he was afraid that his house would fall in value.

466
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,530
In fact, he kept reminding us

467
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,350
where the real danger was.

468
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,540
Big Brother,

469
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,600
I don't know if I should say this.

470
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,100
If you have time,

471
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,620
can you talk to Xiu?

472
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,480
You see,

473
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,890
it's mainly because my Palace Guards

474
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,330
have to train every day.

475
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,570
It's tiring to pass messages for you two.

476
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
We are not kids bickering.

477
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,040
We're all grown up now.

478
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,250
It's just that we have different things to face.

479
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,960
But Xiu knows

480
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,080
you won't hurt us.

481
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,230
-He's just…
-I know.

482
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,180
Give him some time.

483
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,310
He'll figure it out.

484
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,510
But you should be prepared in advance.

485
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,750
Yes.

486
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,340
I must be the one to fix the problem in Yuanzhou.

487
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,520
Before that,

488
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,950
pass one more message for me.

489
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,050
After all, I'm under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of War,

490
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,390
so my position is kind of awkward.

491
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,590
So it's very likely that the Ministry of War orders

492
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,970
Lin Bing and Luo Bo to give up chasing Lei Hong

493
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,680
and to suppress the rebellions of the Orcs and the Snake Race instead?

494
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:16,730
Yes.

495
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,170
You mean

496
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,410
you want me to write to them in a private capacity

497
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,530
and let them prepare in advance?

498
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,680
Yes.

499
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,920
The most awkward person should be...

500
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,940
Di Lin.

501
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,070
I'm not going to pass the message, okay?

502
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,270
You two do it.

503
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,630
What are you doing?

504
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,020
You two know clearly it's the other person who said it,

505
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,280
but you pretend you don't know.

506
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,420
You two make me like a fool,

507
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,150
passing the message between you.

508
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,750
You two can do it yourselves.

509
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,110
Second Brother.

510
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,780
Alright, I'll write the letter.

511
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,710
But it's not because I listen to him.

512
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,990
I'm doing it for Lin Bing and Luo Bo.

513
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,060
You just never say uncle.

514
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,530
I'll write it.

515
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,770
How is it?

516
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,260
Three days ago,

517
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,920
Xiu sent this express letter.

518
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,360
He said the Ministry of War would order us

519
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,690
to stop chasing Lei Hong

520
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,120
and go to suppress the rebellions of the tribes in Yuanzhou.

521
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,130
This is the newly arrived document of the Ministry of War.

522
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,930
Any surprise?

523
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,680
Quanrong Province is just ahead.

524
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,870
Lei Hong is hiding right there.

525
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,640
The Ministry of War asked us to stop chasing

526
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,790
and turn back.

527
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,330
But this time,

528
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,850
thanks to Xiu,

529
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,980
we had time to transfer our troops gradually.

530
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,610
I didn't give him the good wine in vain.

531
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,980
If we turn back now,

532
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
our entire back will be exposed to Lei Hong.

533
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,400
Although the rebellions of the Yuanzhou tribes

534
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,080
seemed small-scale,

535
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,240
it was not a coincidence

536
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,330
that they rebelled at the same time as Lei Hong.

537
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:07,870
My Lord,

538
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,730
Luo Bo and Lin Bing have withdrawn.

539
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,590
Those people in the Ministry of War indeed crave greatness and success.

540
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,750
Seeing the rebellions in Yuanzhou,

541
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,290
they rushed forward,

542
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,970
like when bears smell honey.

543
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,610
Thanks to your intelligence.

544
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,740
You encouraged the Orcs, like the Snake Race, to revolt.

545
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,040
Although it's just a little bit of help,

546
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,970
it can solve our current problem.

547
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,160
I don't think so.

548
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,330
However,

549
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,780
I'll make this little stroke to make bigger success.

550
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,350
Since I can't be a general of Zichuan,

551
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,180
I can only be the king of Yuanzhou.

552
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,180
The traitor Lei Hong has joined forces with the rebels in Yuanzhou.

553
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,620
Their forces are beyond expectation.

554
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,170
Lin Bing and Deputy Commander Luo Bo

555
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,010
went to the Chishuitan to suppress the rebels.

556
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,750
Unexpectedly, they were attacked by Lei Hong from behind.

557
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,520
They suffered a crushing defeat in the end.

558
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,000
The Yuanzhou Army

559
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,730
lost 85,000 soldiers,

560
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,389
including 33 Captains

561
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,929
and 76 Lieutenants.

562
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,760
The Deputy Commander Luo Bo is seriously injured.

563
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,199
Now, he has led the remaining army

564
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,310
to retreat to Wayun Fortress.

565
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,650
This is a blood letter from the two lords.

566
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,889
Please have a look.

567
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,180
Since the establishment of the Yuanzhou Army,

568
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,980
they had never suffered such a great defeat

569
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,490
even if they were against the most elite army of the North Clan.

570
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,020
Twenty-one of the twenty-three provinces in Yuanzhou

571
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,530
have been occupied.

572
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,770
Lord Chieftain.

573
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,620
Wayun is an important barrier

574
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,370
between the Imperial Capital and Yuanzhou.

575
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,920
Our priority now

576
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,370
is to hold Wayun.

577
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,810
I failed to judge the situation in Yuanzhou correctly.

578
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,370
I didn't do my job well. Please punish me.

579
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,710
Get up.

580
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:30,930
Get up.

581
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,990
Thank you, My Lord.

582
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,010
Our priority

583
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,430
is to solve the crisis in Wayun Fortress and Yuanzhou.

584
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,660
What do you think?

585
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,860
We should send reinforcements as soon as possible.

586
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,800
However, Wayun is in dire danger.

587
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,770
Plus, the number of rebels is huge.

588
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,650
There must be a lot of reinforcements.

589
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,340
However, the Border Appeasement Army and the Black Banner Army

590
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,930
don't have enough people to be deployed

591
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,540
after the defense is guaranteed.

592
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,940
Di Lin, do you have any idea?

593
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,720
I don't think

594
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,000
everyone here would like my suggestion.

595
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,280
Just go ahead.

596
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,050
My Lord, at this point,

597
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,130
we can only negotiate with Lei Hong.

598
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,810
He started all the rebellions of all the tribes in Yuanzhou.

599
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,160
As long as Zichuan makes some compromises,

600
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,560
our loss won't be too big.

601
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,320
Di Lin.

602
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,130
Don't think

603
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,370
because you predicted some things before,

604
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,170
you'll understand everything.

605
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,650
My Lord, Lei Hong is a rebel who's on Yang Minghua's side

606
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
and the murderer who killed Lord Ge.

607
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,820
You want to negotiate with him? What's your agenda?

608
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,380
I have no other ideas, then.

609
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,450
You...

610
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,190
Alright, stop arguing.

611
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,880
Everyone, talk about your opinions.

612
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,940
My Lord,

613
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,530
we can't let the rebels enter Wayun.

614
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,760
The Imperial Capital will be in danger if Wayun falls.

615
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,820
The Border Appeasement Army requests to be sent to war.

616
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,920
I request that I return immediately and assemble the Black Banner Army.

617
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,670
We will protect Wayun to the death!

618
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,600
Lord Chieftain.

619
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,410
The two generals are still on the duty of defense.

620
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,040
The Palace Guards have already assembled.

621
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,810
I'm willing to lead 150,000 Palace Guards

622
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,290
to Wayun Fortress.

623
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,490
Approved.

624
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,850
Si Yilin,

625
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,590
lead the Palace Guards

626
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,250
to reinforce the Wayun Fortress first.

627
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,230
Yes.

628
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,890
Fortunately, the northwest and the southwest borders

629
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,150
are safe for now.

630
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,640
Ming Hui.

631
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,480
Yes.

632
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,430
After the defense is arranged,

633
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,570
you lead the Border Appeasement Army to assist them.

634
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,690
Yes.

635
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:48,650
Fang Jing.

636
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,400
Yes.

637
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,240
When the southwest is safe,

638
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,550
you lead the Black Banner Army to Yuanzhou.

639
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,540
Protect the Moon Bay

640
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,510
at the border between Yuanzhou and the North Clan

641
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,760
to prevent the North Clan from taking any mean actions there.

642
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,580
Yes.

643
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,370
Lord Luo.

644
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:07,760
Yes.

645
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Announce to the public immediately

646
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,020
that the Family is in a state of emergency

647
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,180
and that all officers of the reserve service

648
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,700
return to active service.

649
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,920
Yes.

650
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,560
Everyone, the war is about to begin.

651
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,330
At this moment,

652
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,810
I want to compose a poem.

653
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,250
Why do you have to do that?

654
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,580
The Family has issued the order to assemble the reserve service.

655
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,450
Captain Luo Jie.

656
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,940
Yes!

657
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,430
Captain Baichuan.

658
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:50,900
Yes.

659
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,270
Captain Ming Yu.

660
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:52,670
Yes.

661
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,900
Set out and issue the assembly order.

662
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,360
Yes.

663
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:46,010
Actually, I want to tell you

664
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,720
I'm going to war in Yuanzhou tomorrow.

665
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,130
But not with the North Clan.

666
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,130
It's our family's internal strife.

667
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,950
I might not be able to come back.

668
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,070
It's not that.

669
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,260
I will come back.

670
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,130
I will.

671
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,960
I just don't want you to worry.

672
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,190
So I'm here today

673
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,760
because I want to see you again before I leave.

674
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,480
That's all.

675
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,780
By the way, recently,

676
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,020
the temperatures between day and night have fluctuated violently in the Imperial Capital.

677
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,200
Wrap up warm. Don't catch a cold.

678
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,590
I found a chef from the North Clan.

679
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,850
If you want to eat something,

680
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,630
just tell him.

681
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,880
He will cook for you.

682
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,860
By the way, we may have to push back

683
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,300
the thing that you go back to the North.

684
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,220
It's been chaotic in Yuanzhou recently.

685
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,060
But don't worry.

686
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,390
I will send you back.

687
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,200
If you need anything,

688
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,370
you can tell Xiu.

689
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,740
He can help you, too.

690
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:21,830
I'm done talking.

691
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,270
Mr. Si.

692
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,110
The battlefield is dangerous.

693
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,820
Please do take care.

694
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,110
Actually, I'm not in a hurry to go back.

695
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,870
What did you bring?

696
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,740
Nothing.

697
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,250
What are you holding?

698
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,910
A box.

699
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,490
I'm asking you what's in the box.

700
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,860
It's…

701
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,100
forget-me-not.
