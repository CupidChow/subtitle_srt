[Episode 20]

4
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,070
You two did a great job in this corruption case.

5
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,390
But I invited you here today

6
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,229
not to celebrate.

7
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,570
Between the two of you,

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,680
one commands the Ministry of War

9
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,230
and the other is in charge of the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

10
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,870
You're both my best men, my right-hand men.

11
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,110
More importantly,

12
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,370
you two have made each other greater and helped one another.

13
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,150
You should thank each other.

14
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,010
Thank you, My Lord.

15
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,630
Di Lin.

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,790
You must thank Luo Minghai.

17
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,390
You were instrumental to the clearance of the Imperial Capital

18
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,000
and you're responsible for the deaths of Lord Luo's family.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,860
But for the sake of the overall situation of Zichuan,

20
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,990
he endured the pain and served with you in the same court.

21
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,420
This is the kind of broad-mindedness that only a treasure of the state can have.

22
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,880
You should thank him and follow in his footsteps.

23
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,970
Thank you, My Lord.

24
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,230
Lord Luo,

25
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,870
I don't know if I should say this.

26
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,640
My Lord, please go ahead.

27
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,150
The crime of Gu Lan

28
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,230
will be punished soon

29
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,490
and the consequences will be far-reaching.

30
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,829
You should know that.

31
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,579
Even though Di Lin was ruthless,

32
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,750
he protected your integrity

33
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,460
and the Luo family tradition of  incorruptibility.

34
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,910
He protected your legacy, you know?

35
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,020
I will remember your teachings, My Lord.

36
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,230
Eat your food, drink your wine.

37
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,150
Here.

38
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,670
Here.

39
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,230
My Lord.

40
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,470
There's one more thing I have to report.

41
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,390
Go ahead.

42
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,790
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs is investigating the corruption case.

43
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,630
25 other officials

44
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,150
are being taken back to the Imperial Capital.

45
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,150
According to the rules, it's a capital offense.

46
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,830
25 people? That's a lot of people.

47
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,800
But of course, I support you.

48
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,850
This also shows

49
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,710
my determination to clean up the bureaucracy.

50
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,630
Lord Luo.

51
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,320
What do you think?

52
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,430
If they are corrupt, perverting the law,

53
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,780
practicing favoritism and cheating others,

54
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,180
they should definitely be killed quickly.

55
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,900
However, Lord Di Lin, please investigate thoroughly

56
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,950
so that no one will use the situation for personal gain.

57
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,730
The evidence is solid.

58
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,190
Rest assured, Lord Luo.

59
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,790
Look at you, one of you is meticulous

60
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,640
and the other is decisive.

61
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,070
You've covered all the bases.

62
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,550
I, Lord Canxing, am so lucky to have you two,

63
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,480
and so is the Tiger of Zichuan.

64
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,120
Here.

65
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,810
Please raise your glasses again.

66
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,710
In this investigation,

67
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,400
some people in the Three Central Offices were implicated

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,930
and suffered great losses.

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,100
They had never been supportive of the war in Yuanzhou,

70
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,510
so they suggested an emergency meeting

71
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,710
to make a decision on the defeat of Zichuan.

72
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,990
I hope you two can work together.

73
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,080
Don't underestimate them.

74
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,820
Yes.

75
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,480
My Lord, I have one more thing to report.

76
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,260
Go ahead.

77
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,120
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs found

78
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,030
Princess Ning doing well in Yuanzhou.

79
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,230
My Lord, don't worry.

80
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,720
As Si Yilin is in Yuanzhou,

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,870
I asked Si Yilin to escort Princess Ning back.

82
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
What do you think?

83
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,970
That's great. You're so thoughtful.

84
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,030
Well,

85
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,130
you'd better get on with that.

86
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,690
I'll take my leave.

87
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,620
Lord Luo.

88
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,980
My Lord, I'm still a little worried.

89
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,790
About what?

90
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,670
I'm worried about Di Lin.

91
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,710
Di Lin?

92
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,450
Although he's a little resolute,

93
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,110
he's devoted to Zichuan.

94
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,630
He won't take the chance to eliminate dissidents.

95
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,550
He won't do that.

96
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,620
I overstepped the line.

97
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,480
Of course,

98
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,630
if you think you have to investigate,

99
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,910
then go ahead.

100
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,870
If you find anything,

101
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,770
I'll support you.

102
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,670
Lord Luo.

103
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,710
You are the closest person to me in Zichuan,

104
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,710
and the person I trust the most.

105
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,900
Well, and maybe him, too.

106
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,770
I will work hard

107
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,270
and live up to your expectations.

108
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,070
Please get up.

109
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,740
How much is this?

110
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,360
Two silver coins, very cheap.

111
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,790
Do you want it?

112
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,180
No.

113
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,640
One silver coin.

114
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,120
How much is this?

115
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,820
One silver coin.

116
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,150
Book of Wisdom, don't lose in life.

117
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,980
Whether you're leading soldiers to war

118
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,950
or making friends or dating...

119
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,150
Brother, good business.

120
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,590
It'll teach you how to live a good life.

121
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,960
Everyone...

122
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,820
Try this again.

123
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,270
Don't rush. Don't push.

124
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,390
Give me a copy of that.

125
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:38,909
Yes.

126
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,390
Okay.

127
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,080
Shaozi, collect the money.

128
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,470
Thank you.

129
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,500
Take it.

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,670
This is too expensive.

131
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,670
It's not expensive. It's very cheap.

132
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,530
Pick one first.

133
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,310
Brother,

134
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,370
you look confused.

135
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,350
It smells so good.

136
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,290
This book is great. Aren't you going to buy one?

137
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,680
What?

138
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,040
What are you doing?

139
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,110
Guys!

140
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,580
Ze, tell Lord Xiu.

141
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,550
What are you doing? Let's go! Get them!

142
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,110
Get them!

143
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,750
This way.

144
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,390
Come on.

145
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,320
Look at this.

146
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,990
This is nice.

147
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,050
This is cheap.

148
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,820
Lord Xiu.

149
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,590
They're all top quality.

150
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,510
Give me one.

151
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:33,960
Here.

152
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,610
Take it.

153
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,660
Ning.

154
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,070
Brother Xiu.

155
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,540
This is my first time making it. Try it.

156
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,770
Your first time?

157
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,030
Not bad.

158
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,300
It's really not bad.

159
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,930
Bad news, boss.

160
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,930
Maocai and the others were robbed by the Snake Race.

161
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,980
Why are you telling me this?

162
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,430
What?

163
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,820
To ask you to help us get our stuff back.

164
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,590
Ze, let me tell you.

165
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,960
The stuff in the stall belongs to the stall owner,

166
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,990
not me, Zichuan Xiu.

167
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,660
Go back and tell everyone

168
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,120
if the goods in the stalls got stolen

169
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
and they can't get the money,

170
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,460
that means they can't get the money at the end of the year.

171
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,380
What are you waiting for? Go!

172
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,710
Make way.

173
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,160
Are you really not in a hurry? Aren't you going to take a look?

174
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,630
Actually, for the Xiu Battalion,

175
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,310
this is a rare opportunity.

176
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,870
Now, everyone thinks

177
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,590
the Xiu Battalion is full of loose cannons and won't make it.

178
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,390
But under certain conditions...

179
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,430
The premise of these conditions

180
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,880
is that they can truly understand

181
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
what they really want.

182
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,460
Now, this opportunity is finally here.

183
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,700
Is this an opportunity

184
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,320
or a coincidence?

185
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,990
Stop!

186
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,460
Stop!

187
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,830
Don't run!

188
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,470
Come on!

189
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,870
Stop!

190
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,070
Come on!

191
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,070
Stop right there!

192
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,110
What are you waiting for?

193
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,030
Beat them up!

194
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,710
I'll beat you to death!

195
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,860
Wait.

196
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,910
You're all not fighting?

197
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,440
Maocai.

198
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,780
Boss said

199
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,790
we should take full responsibility of the items in our own stalls.

200
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,920
If we don't account for the lost items,

201
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,430
we won't get a single silver coin at the end of the year.

202
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,300
So serious?

203
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,410
The art of war is to be cunning.

204
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,390
Brothers!

205
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,630
Ho-ho-ha!

206
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,790
Ho-ho-ha!

207
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,200
Ho-ho-ha!

208
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,320
Kill!

209
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,730
Wait. Watch out for traps.

210
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,940
Well,

211
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,150
military boxing is kinda great.

212
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,150
All is fair in war.

213
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,630
Good acting

214
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,440
but you lacked some facial expressions.

215
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,790
I think you don't have the motivation

216
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,100
because you think the pay is too low.

217
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,050
Why don't the Snake Race

218
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,360
join our Wealth Building Hall too?

219
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
We'll split the profit 30/70.

220
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,420
It'll be a lot more than these peanuts.

221
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,870
Okay, I'll give you another one.

222
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,020
Boss.

223
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,830
Go.

224
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,510
Boss!

225
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,440
Here.

226
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,030
Boss.

227
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,510
We took back all the stolen items.

228
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,120
Really? Did you all work together?

229
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,990
Of course.

230
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,360
That's our money.

231
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,510
Come on.

232
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,390
Cheers.

233
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,470
Cheers.

234
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,550
Not bad.

235
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,570
Have some meat.

236
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,990
I'll fill it up for you.

237
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,630
Well,

238
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,750
the Imperial Capital will hold a Three Central Offices meeting soon.

239
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,610
A Three Central Offices meeting?

240
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,230
Sit down and talk.

241
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,210
Miss Baichuan, have a seat.

242
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,200
Did it say

243
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,320
why they're having this meeting?

244
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,160
It seems to be related to the war in Yuanzhou and the financial situation.

245
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,430
Oh no.

246
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,840
What's wrong? Are the Three Central Offices so scary?

247
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,650
Let me tell you, these Three Central Offices...

248
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,900
Ning knows our family history better.

249
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,290
So, let her tell us about it.

250
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,700
It all started

251
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,390
a long, long time ago.

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,130
A hero of his generation, Zichuan Yun,

253
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,270
spent half his life on the battlefield

254
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,920
and established the foundation of the Zichuan clan.

255
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,800
But in his later years,

256
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,590
his mental and physical health

257
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,190
got worse and worse.

258
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,710
Gradually,

259
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,190
he could no longer serve

260
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,790
as Zichuan's ruler.

261
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,200
His personality also became temperamental

262
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,550
and domineering.

263
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,590
Come in.

264
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,430
General Ming Lan was a great warrior.

265
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,990
On the day he returned victorious,

266
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,990
he didn't expect that...

267
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,630
Lord Chieftain, I’m back.

268
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,090
You dirtied my carpet.

269
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,270
Drag him out and behead him.

270
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,640
Lord Chieftain, I didn’t mean it.

271
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,710
How cruel!

272
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,190
The general who stepped on the carpet

273
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,680
just won the battle the day before

274
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,390
and was beheaded just like that when he returned.

275
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,090
He was beheaded?

276
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,830
He was beheaded just like that?

277
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,630
Who would have thought that

278
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,920
his last words to his son before he passed away

279
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,870
would be...

280
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,510
What?

281
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,330
Remember to...

282
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,800
Remember to clean your shoes.

283
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,420
Shoes?

284
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,840
What's more bizarre is that the next day...

285
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,990
Why hasn't Ming Lan come to see me yet?

286
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,390
I've been waiting for him.

287
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,350
Is he disrespecting me

288
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,690
because he has great military achievements now?

289
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,620
Lord Chieftain,

290
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,750
do you remember what happened yesterday?

291
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,670
Yesterday?

292
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,750
Zichuan Yun.

293
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,910
His amnesia

294
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,510
was getting worse and worse.

295
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,440
Everyone in the family, whether they were officials or nobles,

296
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,550
were all afraid of receiving his orders.

297
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,830
Long time no see.

298
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,730
Come in and play chess with me.

299
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,220
Assassin! You entered without announcing your presence.

300
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,150
Are you trying to assassinate me?

301
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,980
No, Lord Chieftain.

302
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,430
You asked me to come!

303
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,580
Guards! Kill the assassin!

304
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,580
Under Zichuan Yun's authority,

305
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,070
all the officials and nobles in this family

306
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,650
lived in fear, trembling.

307
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,480
In everyone's heart,

308
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,650
was a wish

309
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,670
that they couldn't speak about.

310
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,790
Could it be...

311
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,110
When power is too concentrated

312
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,350
on one person

313
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,250
and no one can control him,

314
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,350
it's scary, isn't it?

315
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,430
That's right.

316
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,690
You see, I'm not so bad at this.

317
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,950
Should I tell the story then?

318
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,630
Sure.

319
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,950
So, after the new Chieftain Zichuan Heng

320
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,850
inherited the position,

321
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,960
he joined forces with the nobles,

322
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,350
changed Zichuan's political system

323
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,010
and established the Three Central Offices.

324
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:04,890
This...

325
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,510
Is that so?

326
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,630
The Three Central Offices is made up of

327
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,990
centers of nobles from all the provinces.

328
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,829
It has the right to supervise the family administration.

329
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,869
With regards to the Chieftain's decisions,

330
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,190
if they have any objections,

331
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,950
they can propose amendments.

332
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,160
When necessary,

333
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,670
they can impeach the Chieftain and replace him.

334
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,270
Of course,

335
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,710
in order to preserve the bloodline of Zichuan,

336
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,210
Zichuan Yun added another clause

337
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,410
stating that no matter who you change the Chieftain to,

338
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,190
this position must be filled

339
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,940
by the descendants of Zichuan.

340
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,950
Sounds like a good thing to me.

341
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,320
Why are you guys

342
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,050
acting like they're the enemy?

343
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,610
That's a good question.

344
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,810
Let me tell you.

345
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,430
There are many things

346
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,920
that start out with good intentions.

347
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,790
But as time passes,

348
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,510
they will take the wrong path.

349
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,630
For example, the Three Central Offices we mentioned.

350
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,590
Initially, it was a wise decision.

351
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,870
But now?

352
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,230
My Lord, there are so many people from the Three Central Offices.

353
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,380
Each meeting

354
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,960
requires four fifth of the advisors to be present

355
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,290
so we can hold a meeting.

356
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,120
Every meeting decision

357
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,460
can only pass if approved by more than half of the people.

358
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,730
I don't understand.

359
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,760
Their suggestions

360
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,990
don't advance or help things in any way.

361
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,700
Why do we need them?

362
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,030
Those grand suggestions

363
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,790
are just for

364
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,670
the personal interests of those nobles.

365
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,530
They never represent the people.

366
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,390
Today, the Three Central Offices

367
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,070
has become a bloated system.

368
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,310
They are preventing

369
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,040
the development of our family.

370
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,210
Sir, three urgent documents.

371
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,070
Three?

372
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,220
This is a letter from the Ministry of War.

373
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,580
That's a load of crap. There's a war going on

374
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,290
and they want us to return now.

375
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,610
This is ridiculous.

376
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,620
Maybe the Ministry of War has some long-term considerations.

377
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,150
What long-term considerations?

378
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,550
This decision of theirs is short-sighted.

379
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,290
This is a document from the Imperial Capital.

380
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,260
I see.

381
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,820
Looks like we have to return to the Imperial Capital.

382
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,660
Can we delay the return

383
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,390
on the grounds that we're holding the line?

384
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,730
Will Three Central Offices be delayed because of me?

385
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,120
Why are we having

386
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,350
a Three Central Offices meeting in the middle of the war?

387
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,350
These advisors were all nobles.

388
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,560
They have lucrative businesses in Yuanzhou.

389
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,280
Now, with all the fighting,

390
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,800
their financial resources will continue to be depleted.

391
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,080
They finally intervened.

392
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,010
That's a letter from Big Brother, right?

393
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,460
I hope you have good news, Big Brother.

394
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,860
Gather the army to pick Princess Ning up.

395
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,670
After I'm done with Deyun Province's affairs,

396
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,510
I'll meet you.

397
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,550
Yes.

398
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,400
If you want to leave, go by yourself. I'm not leaving.

399
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,550
But Wen He is already here.

400
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,130
Your Highness.

401
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,230
I've been ordered by Lord Chieftain to escort the Princess.

402
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,750
Now...

403
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,790
Stop. I know what you want to say.

404
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,990
But if you say it,

405
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,120
I won't have any time left.

406
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,730
One day? I only need one day.

407
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,230
Okay, one day.

408
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,770
One day.

409
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,180
I understand. The war is not over and Lei Hong is not dead

410
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,290
so you won't return to the Imperial Capital.

411
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,280
I'll stay until you've quelled the rebellion

412
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,440
and killed Lei Hong,

413
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,320
then we'll go back together, okay?

414
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,830
Brother Xiu, as long as I can be with you,

415
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,550
I can stay in Yuanzhou

416
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,880
for another year or two.

417
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,390
A year or two.

418
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,830
What about 20 or 30 years?

419
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,950
Ning, this land, Yuanzhou,

420
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,390
a place that countless people depend on for their livelihood.

421
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,190
We have to be responsible for it.

422
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,820
When necessary,

423
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,390
we have to give it our everything.

424
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,260
Everything?

425
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,950
Everything.

426
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,320
Ning.

427
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,860
I'm just kidding.

428
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,030
If I have to stay in Yuanzhou for another year or two years,

429
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,820
I won't be able to stand it.

430
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,350
There are so many bugs here.

431
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,810
There are so many things in the family now.

432
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,710
The Imperial Capital is going to have the Three Central Offices meeting soon.

433
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,970
And you have to suppress the rebels here.

434
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm just causing you trouble by staying here.

435
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,430
I... I'll return.

436
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,090
Ning.

437
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,380
I'm not finished.

438
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,250
But if I want to go back,

439
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,320
you have to pick a good horse for me personally.

440
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,890
And you'll help me

441
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,950
pack all my luggage.

442
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,870
I've suffered a lot along the way.

443
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,770
I must be comfortable on the road.

444
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,390
Okay, everything you want me to do,

445
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,520
I'll listen to you.

446
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,590
That's more like it.

447
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,340
Ning.

448
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,150
I'm willing to leave, even with a smile on my face.

449
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,460
I hope you can come back with a smile too.

450
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,650
I won't say I'm waiting for you anymore.

451
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,720
But I hope you can come back.

452
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,860
My dear Brother Xiu, this is not a farewell.

453
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,300
This is our beginning.

454
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,170
Lord Si Yilin will meet us later.

455
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,680
Your Highness, we can't tell anyone about this trip.

456
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,230
You'll have to suffer a little

457
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,960
and pretend to be an attendant.

458
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,130
If you didn't want her to leave,

459
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,060
why didn't you say a proper goodbye?

460
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,550
So what? Nothing will change.

461
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,930
What are you talking about?

462
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm looking for the way to Bulu Village.

463
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,380
We're leaving for Bulu Village tomorrow.

464
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,580
Go back and get ready.

465
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,500
De Lun, you're back.

466
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,600
You silly boy. You're so tall now.

467
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,830
Go, tell them.

468
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,590
De Lun is back!

469
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,070
De Lun is back!

470
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:32,590
De Lun is back!

471
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,870
Folks,

472
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,020
we're home!

473
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,020
Really?

474
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,870
You're back.

475
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,190
You're back.

476
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,270
Good.

477
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,060
Great.

478
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,190
You're back.

479
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,350
You're back.

480
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,230
You're back.

481
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,480
You're back.

482
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,480
Let me see.

483
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,440
You've lost weight.

484
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,410
You're back.

485
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,150
You're back!

486
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,850
Xiu, thank you for sending us home.

487
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,390
Thank you.

488
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,350
Thank you, Xiu!

489
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,750
Congratulations on returning to your hometown. Cheers!

490
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,910
Cheers!

491
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,130
Thank you.

492
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,490
Here.

493
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,990
Fill it up.

494
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,070
Give it to me.

495
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,350
Fill it up.

496
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,750
Fill it up.

497
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,080
Here.

498
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,410
Xiu, there are wars going on outside.

499
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,770
Why don't you stay here for a while

500
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,640
and lay low?

501
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,470
Bulu Village is not only our hometown,

502
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,290
but it's also at the foot of the sacred temple.

503
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,150
It's protected by the temple.

504
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,680
The terrain is remote and the roads are difficult to navigate.

505
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,570
It should be very safe.

506
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
De Lun, there are so many people in the Xiu Battalion

507
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,090
and they're so ostentatious.

508
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,890
What if the enemy finds out?

509
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,710
My Lord!

510
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,430
It's almost done.

511
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,870
Yes.

512
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,070
A businessman from Wealth Building Hall got a clue

513
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,070
and finally found Lei Hong's trail.

514
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,040
Here.

515
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,140
Stop drinking.

516
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,260
We found Lei Hong.

517
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,020
I didn't expect that Wealth Building Hall

518
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,950
could really help us find Lei Hong.

519
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,240
Opening Wealth Building Hall,

520
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,550
information on supplies all over Yuanzhou

521
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,680
is in our hands.

522
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,740
Recently, there was news that

523
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,010
someone's been secretly buying leather weapon pouches.

524
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,740
The Zichuan family uses leather to wrap weapons,

525
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,830
so the person who bought these

526
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,290
must not be from Yuanzhou.

527
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,010
The Palace Guards, Yuanzhou Army

528
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,220
and Ming Hui

529
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,220
have already been prepared since the beginning of the deployment.

530
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,560
Why would they need to buy something else?

531
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,360
It was Lei Hong who bought those.

532
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,890
That's why Lord Xiu sent Shaozi

533
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,110
to follow this clue

534
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,350
and expose the other threads.

535
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,130
The final buyer was indeed him.

536
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,690
My Lord.

537
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,430
We'll be closer to the North Clan after this hill.

538
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,670
You're so thoughtful.

539
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,980
Let Du Ke lead his troops to surrender to the North Clan.

540
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,240
Then, we can also use that to get rid of the family pursuers.

541
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,770
It's hard to hear when it's so noisy.

542
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,350
Now, my ears are finally quiet.

543
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,470
They just won't disappear. Stop them!

544
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,550
You still won't give up.

545
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,030
North Clan.

546
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,450
My Lord.

547
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,150
Lei Hongsheng is missing.

548
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,680
Because someone saved him.

549
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,630
The person who saved him just now

550
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,520
is probably one of the top masters of the North Clan.

551
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,670
But why would the North Clan

552
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,870
save a traitor from the Zichuan family?

553
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,100
Because Lei Hong

554
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,990
has a lot of family information.

555
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,470
If Lei Hong betrays it to the North Clan

556
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,940
to start a dispute between the North Clan and us,

557
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,460
for the North Clan,

558
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,150
he's still got a lot of value.

559
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,720
You mean he's leaning on the North Clan

560
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,390
and inciting the North Clan to attack the Zichuan family?

561
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,750
This is just my guess.

562
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,590
I'm afraid

563
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
we have to be prepared for the worst.

564
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,450
What should we do now? Are we still searching?

565
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,470
Yes.

566
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,170
It's just that we have to search secretly.

567
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,840
If I'm wrong,

568
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,370
we'll be able to find Lei Hong's hideout soon.

569
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,710
I'm just afraid that I'm right.

570
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,159
Our priority now

571
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,040
is to consolidate the Zichuan family troops'

572
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,989
deployment in Yuanzhou.

573
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,280
My Lord.

574
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,110
My Lord, you are awake.

575
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,650
What is this place?

576
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,310
My Lord, as soon as I met the North Clan,

577
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,550
I was arrested

578
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,679
before I could even surrender.

579
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,630
My Lord.

580
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,650
Will they kill us next?

581
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,500
No, they need me now.

582
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,460
What?

583
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:31,890
You...

584
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,660
What are you doing?

585
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,180
Don't.

586
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,870
You...

587
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,510
What are you doing?

588
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,500
They are clean now.

589
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,090
Help them clean up.

590
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,990
Yes.

591
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,630
My Lord, we're done for.

592
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,960
Not only are we not done for,

593
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,390
we're also completely alive.

594
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,790
Lei Hong is just a ministerialis of Zichuan.

595
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,170
His subordinates are just a bunch of losers.

596
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,900
Why didn't they just kill him?

597
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,590
They actually locked him up

598
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,290
and did the captive ceremony.

599
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,260
This Lei Hong kid...

600
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,510
[Ka Dun, Ka Lan]

601
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,480
is not just a captive.

602
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,720
Second brother,

603
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,290
you've always understood Father's intentions best.

604
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,630
What's your opinion?

605
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,620
Brother, you've always been a great warrior, and you're well-versed in military affairs.

606
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,110
This is a military matter.

607
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,160
I think you know it better than I do.

608
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,560
My Lord.

609
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,400
Why are you here?

610
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,780
Today, the Three Central Offices is threatening to intervene in the war in Yuanzhou.

611
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,580
I woud like to come in and listen.

612
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,590
It's against the rules for you to sit in.

613
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,220
All the advisors are here today.

614
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,850
An elder from the Zuoyi Clan was invited too.

615
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,770
Looks like the battle in Yuanzhou

616
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,350
is going to stop.

617
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,630
This is a good thing.

618
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:54,940
My Lord.

619
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,400
Just wait here.

620
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,150
[Xiao Ping]

621
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,060
[Ma Qin]

622
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,090
[Wang Ge]

623
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,140
[Ma Wei]

624
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,240
Lord Chieftain.

625
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,700
This is the former chief of Zuoyi Clan,

626
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,650
Elder Bunong.

627
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,640
He's also the uncle of the current chief, Budan.

628
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:37,670
He has a high status and is popular.

629
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,570
[Bunong]

630
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,710
As we all know,

631
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,910
Zuoyi Clan has the most prestige among all tribes in Yuanzhou.

632
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,070
He came here

633
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,980
to represent the Yuanzhou people

634
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,060
to negotiate with the Zichuan family

635
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,090
and sign the peace treaty

636
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
to restore peace and prosperity.

637
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,590
Advisor Ma Wei.

638
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,590
You've worked so hard to negotiate this peace.

639
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,070
The war is endless.

640
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,190
It has exhausted our family too much.

641
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,870
As a junior of the Three Central Offices,

642
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,280
I'm willing to help my family

643
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,690
resolve its problems.

644
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,300
Good.

645
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,010
Yes, this battle is long.

646
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,910
I don't think the various clans in Yuanzhou

647
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,670
are doing well.

648
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,440
Lord Chieftain is wise and insightful.

649
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,250
When a battle is fought, who wins?

650
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,510
It's just that the tribes in Yuanzhou are reckless and aggressive.

651
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,080
If not for the war,

652
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,050
they would've caused a lot of troubles for themselves anyway.

653
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,550
It's really hard to control them.

654
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,300
It's a big headache.

655
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,830
No matter how hard it is to control them, you have to control them.

656
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,030
But this battle

657
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,550
did teach us a lesson.

658
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,790
Yes.

659
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,830
Lord Chieftain, you are right.

660
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,470
I'm incompetent.

661
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
I'd like to share your worries.

662
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,570
The war has come to an end.

663
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,040
Yuanzhou is a barren land.

664
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,940
If Lord Chieftain allows me to manage it,

665
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,380
you will always come first in all matters.

666
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,430
I can guarantee that

667
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,060
from now on,

668
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,290
all tribes in Yuanzhou will

669
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,310
will respect Zichuan and keep the peace forever.

670
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,190
Elder, I understand what you mean.

671
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,020
You want me to give up Yuanzhou?

672
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,390
Of course not. I'm just managing it.

673
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,150
After all, there's chaos in Yuanzhou.

674
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,950
If it's managed by foreigners again,

675
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,190
another war in the future is inevitable.
