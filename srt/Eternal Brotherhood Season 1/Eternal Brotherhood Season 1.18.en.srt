00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,420
Don't come near me!

5
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,500
Don't come near me!

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,740
Don't come over!

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,700
There's noise over there! Go after them!

8
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,850
Don't come over!

9
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,370
I'm relieved

10
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,350
seeing you so good at fighting.

11
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,380
What took you so long?

12
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,580
In order to find you, Zhui...

13
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,180
It's okay now.

14
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,540
Xiu?

15
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,329
Weirdo.

16
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,550
This information should be right.

17
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,140
Why haven't we seen

18
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,870
any person from the North Clan?

19
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,079
And our leader.

20
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,670
Now he disappears.

21
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,820
This is ridiculous.

22
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,360
Observe the surroundings. There can be danger at any time.

23
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,820
There're enemies! Get ready to fight!

24
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,640
Chuan, what should we do?

25
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,900
It just occurred to me that

26
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,760
before Lord Xiu left,

27
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
he left an important mission to you.

28
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,810
Me?

29
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,960
Why me?

30
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,020
Lord Xiu said

31
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,570
you are a hero who is not afraid of death.

32
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,660
It's perfect for you to persuade the rebels.

33
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,610
But we are the ones being surrounded.

34
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,450
That's right.

35
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,940
We have to surround them with the momentum.

36
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,890
Lei Hong.

37
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,180
You're surrounded.

38
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,940
You have nowhere to go.

39
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,850
Come out and surrender.

40
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,700
They don't seem to understand.

41
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,640
They can't hear you. Go further. Louder.

42
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,120
Surrender, then we won't kill you.

43
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,030
So many people are here.

44
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,970
I think I failed.

45
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,310
You won't kill us if we surrender?

46
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,700
There's no such thing in our Zuoyi Clan.

47
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,909
Then I won't surrender.

48
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,530
Then I'm relieved.

49
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,740
Fight!

50
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
There's a hidden weapon.

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,570
It's really you.

57
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm so happy.

58
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,440
De Lun, you're so old.

59
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,900
Yet you still want to rebel and fight?

60
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,830
What...

61
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,450
Don't ask.

62
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,020
You don't know. After you left,

63
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,060
another garrison commander came.

64
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,140
We had suffered from disasters.

65
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,850
But he still asked us to pay so much taxes.

66
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,840
If we didn't pay it, he would beat us.

67
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,770
We had no choice.

68
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,210
We came all the way here to survive.

69
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,980
By the way, is everyone okay?

70
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,220
Yes. Look, everyone is fine.

71
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,860
That's good.

How are you?

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,700
Yes.

78
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,260
Sha, you are here too.

79
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,900
Long time no see.

80
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,030
So they know Lord Xiu.

81
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,720
How are you?

82
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,540
I'm fine.

88
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,250
when you were ordered to leave,

89
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,650
everyone was very sad.

90
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,470
I know, when I left,

91
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,770
your eyes were full of tears.

92
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,530
You sent me a dozen miles away.

93
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,100
I'll keep that in mind.

94
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,890
I've always wanted to see you again.

95
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,490
I didn't expect to see you again on the battlefield.

96
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,510
Yes.

97
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,140
I'm so happy, Xiu.

98
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,020
Be gentle. You're too strong.

99
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,620
Today is a good day.

Yes.

104
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,490
First of all, let's raise our glasses

105
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,100
to welcome our old friend Xiu.

106
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,930
Xiu.

107
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,210
Enough.

108
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm so touched.

109
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,340
I'll drink up first.

110
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,180
Cheers.

111
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,130
Bottoms up.

112
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,140
Here.

113
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:22,970
Good wine.

114
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,900
Sit down and eat.

115
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,490
Sit.

116
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,060
Okay.

117
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,140
Come on.

118
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,050
Let's continue drinking.

119
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,890
Let me pour it for you.

120
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,460
Fill it up.

121
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,340
Here, fill it up.

122
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:33,980
Of course.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,880
Xiu,

124
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,870
these kids may not have seen you,

125
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,260
but your story

126
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,809
is very impressive to them.

127
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,860
Sister, you smell so good.

128
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,690
Don't scare Xiu's friend.

129
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,860
Don't be naughty.

130
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,440
Go play.

131
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,700
It's okay.

132
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,280
By the way, I forgot to introduce

133
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,810
my best friend, Zichuan...

134
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,500
Zi as in Zichuan. Zi Ning.

135
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,160
Zi Ning.

136
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,610
Yes.

137
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,140
Miss Zi Ning.

138
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,310
Xiu and I are old friends.

139
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,730
Xiu's friend

140
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,570
is my friend.

141
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,420
My friend

142
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,300
is a friend of the Zuoyi Clan.

143
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,630
Yes, have some meat.

144
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,910
Don't be afraid. His name is Weirdo.

145
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,140
Haven't you seen him?

146
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,020
Why am I not afraid?

147
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,930
If you hadn't shown up in time,

148
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,590
I would have been eaten by him.

149
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,900
Let me tell you.

150
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,280
He said I look like pork belly today.

151
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,900
I think he'll eat me anyway.

152
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,590
This is the unique way

153
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,290
for the Zuoyi Clan to praise someone.

154
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,730
If you don't believe me, you can ask Old De Lun.

155
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,850
If someone says his skin looks like pork belly,

156
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,980
what does that mean?

157
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,490
-He meant that you have good skin.
-Right.

158
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,580
If your men said that his brain looks like a pig brain,

159
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,380
what does that mean?

160
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,500
It means you're smart.

161
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,930
Yes.

162
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
You're smart too.

163
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,820
Your brain looks like a pig brain, too.

164
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,210
The kid said you smell good.

165
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,060
That means you really smell good.

166
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,620
Don't talk nonsense.

167
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
How can you praise people like that?

168
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,860
Let me tell you.

169
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,860
Zuoyi people are born to like eating.

170
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,370
So in their lives,

171
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,660
good things are compared to good food.

172
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,670
You'll understand it later.

173
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,250
Weirdo.

174
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,290
Let me introduce you to each other.

175
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,670
This is Zi Ning.

176
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,190
Xiu.

177
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,860
I told you not to be afraid. They are very enthusiastic.

178
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,610
It's okay.

179
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,100
You sprained your ankle.

180
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,740
So you need to fix it with a board.

181
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,060
Oh, right. Apply more of this. It'll help you recover.

182
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,780
Black grass extract?

183
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,080
It's a treasure. Thank you.

184
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,100
Keep it.

185
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,940
-Thank you.
-Everyone.

186
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,450
We have wine and meat.

187
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,910
More importantly, we have friends.

188
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,700
I'm really happy today.

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,820
Anyway,

190
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,570
let's drink until we get drunk tonight.

191
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,650
Let's get drunk! Cheers!

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,590
It's been a few years.

193
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,770
Did you get promoted again?

194
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,000
You must be doing well with your skills.

195
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,120
I was exiled to this remote place.

196
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,030
Am I still doing well?

197
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,660
I've known you since you were

198
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,570
at the martial arts school in Yuanzhou.

199
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,700
How would I not know?

200
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,740
If it were in the past,

201
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,020
you would have tried to avoid this kind of tough task.

202
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,620
What's the reason this time?

203
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,300
Old De Lun, I can't hide anything from you.

204
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,440
Come on, cheers.

205
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,200
Come on.

206
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,870
Actually, I'm here

207
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,570
looking for someone.

208
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,340
Who is it?

209
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,730
Lei Hong is a traitor from the Zichuan family.

210
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
I've heard of him.

211
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,980
I heard that

212
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,340
he was in Sunset Valley.

213
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,090
So...

214
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,130
He did come here.

215
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,440
What about now?

216
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,480
He once persuaded me

217
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,900
to rebel with him.

218
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,420
But you know that our Zuoyi Clan

219
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,390
has never been interested in power.

220
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,990
So I rejected him.

221
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,980
However,

222
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,300
some other clansmen in Yuanzhou

223
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,230
were different.

224
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,030
Those leaders who were more influential

225
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,330
chose to cooperate with Lei Hong.

226
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,740
It would be bad if Lei Hong

227
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
took root in Yuanzhou.

228
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Don't worry.

229
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,550
I always thought

230
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,030
you were born to belong to Yuanzhou.

231
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,320
Although Yuanzhou is big,

232
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,900
there's nothing you can't do.

233
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,500
Your men are so brave.

234
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,370
As expected of your soldiers.

235
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,300
I know what they are like.

236
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,750
They look like a bunch of thugs,

237
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,870
but actually,

238
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,940
they are indeed a bunch of thugs.

239
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,960
To me,

240
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,800
they are more useful than

241
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,960
those pretentious regular soldiers.

242
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,690
Look at them.

243
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,340
They were so scared of your men.

244
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,900
But now,

245
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,380
they've become friends with them.

246
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,580
But your friend Zi Ning

247
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,120
is weak.

248
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,460
I'm afraid she can't bear the hardships in Yuanzhou.

249
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,740
Take good care of her.

250
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,210
Come on. Cheers.

251
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,340
Come on.

252
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:26,850
Okay.

253
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,000
Come on.

254
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,860
Does it hurt?

255
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,220
Hang in there.

256
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,270
Try the water temperature.

257
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,610
It's okay.

258
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,750
This is called Black Grass Extract.

259
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,900
It's effective for your injury.

260
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,300
When you recover,

261
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,750
I'll send someone to send you back to the Imperial Capital.

262
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,430
I'm not going back.

263
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
This is Yuanzhou.

264
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,020
You know how dangerous it is.

265
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,120
I'll go back if you go back.

266
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,640
If you don't go back, I'll stay here with you.

267
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,900
Ning, you know it's impossible.

268
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,450
Why not?

269
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,820
I'm the heir of Zichuan.

270
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,630
You have no right to order me around.

271
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,760
I've made up my mind.

272
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,820
I won't allow you to let me go back.

273
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,640
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

274
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,310
You can go.

275
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,160
Ning, a letter from Big Brother.

276
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,970
You left the Imperial Capital without permission.

277
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,700
Lord Chieftain has noticed it.

278
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,320
He will send someone to find you in a few days.

279
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,230
What will you say then?

280
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,820
You used to skip classes

281
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,380
and go out to play every day.

282
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,170
When did you get Uncle's permission?

283
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,910
Why didn't you consider

284
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,240
how to explain to my uncle?

285
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,350
Ning, I...

286
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,470
We just reunited.

287
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,760
It's not even a day yet.

288
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,690
Yet you want to send me back.

289
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,020
Ning, we're not kids anymore.

290
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,190
As you can see,

291
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,630
you've only been in Yuanzhou for a few days.

292
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,359
How many villains have you met?

293
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,089
Aren't you scared?

294
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,790
Then you're here now.

295
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,750
You'll protect me, won't you?

296
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,000
Life in the barracks is tough.

297
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,089
Can you handle it?

298
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,339
I can.

299
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,030
It's getting late.

300
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,280
Go to bed early.

301
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,300
Forget it. Soak your feet for a bit longer.

302
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,970
Xiu, are you still there?

303
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,450
Xiu, are you really leaving?

304
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm here.

305
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,360
Go to sleep.

306
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,780
I'll stay outside and guard you.

307
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,150
I remember you used to

308
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,370
keep watch for me like this.

309
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,820
Are you slacking off?

310
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,260
I dare not, Your Highness.

311
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,440
Good.

312
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,120
Don't sneak away.

313
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,360
I will come here every hour to check.

314
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,480
Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,970
Are you there?

316
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,440
Yes.

317
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,610
Are you still there?

318
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,430
Yes, I'm always here.

319
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,740
Xiu, are you still there?

320
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,530
Yes.

321
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,930
Are you still there?

322
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,420
Yes.

323
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,770
Are you still there?

324
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,460
Don't worry. I'm always here.

325
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,780
But we're in different worlds.

326
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,660
Hang in there. It hurts.

327
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,620
This isn't gauze, is it?

328
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,260
You're right. This is a cleaned tattered military uniform.

329
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,900
He was hurt by a blunt iron.

330
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,870
You should apply ointment.

331
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,940
Can this herb work?

332
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,820
My Lord, if we still have ointment,

333
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,940
who would want to use such herbs

334
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,740
to reduce the pain and swelling?

335
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,980
Our medical supplies

336
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,170
had already run out a month ago.

337
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,450
Si Yilin.

338
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,820
I've heard that you're risking your life in war.

339
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,420
I didn't expect your men

340
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,930
to be as desperate as you.

341
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,440
I made them suffer.

342
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,810
Wake our men up.

343
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,310
Take all the medical kits with you

344
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,860
and hand them over to the Palace Guards.

345
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,300
Yes.

346
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,820
We are all soldiers from the Zichuan family.

347
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,880
Your Palace Guards suffer like this.

348
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,980
My Border Appeasement Army are not cowards.

349
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,980
I apologize for my previous attitude.

350
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,050
You Palace Guards

351
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,770
are all tough men.

352
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,890
I really admire you.

353
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,860
Don't worry.

354
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,150
Tomorrow, I will arrange for the two armies to swap positions.

355
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,630
No matter what, I'll let you

356
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,960
have enough food to eat.

357
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,550
Lord Ming Hui, you are a righteous man.

358
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,140
My men and I thank you.

359
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,910
You're finally awake.

360
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,940
You scared me to death.

361
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,650
Don't you care about my feet?

362
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,190
You've recovered?

363
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,080
I knew that medicine is effective.

364
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,240
Weirdo wouldn't have bad intentions.

365
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,860
Since you've recovered,

366
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,050
can we set off now?

367
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,320
Where are we going?

368
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,010
It's them, right?

369
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,290
Don't kill him.

370
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,810
Kill me instead.

371
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,390
No need to rush.

372
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,100
Everyone here will get a share of this.

373
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,500
You killed my lady's horse, right?

374
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:47,750
No.

375
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,130
I did it.

376
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,650
Kill me if you want to

377
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,050
cool this lady down.

378
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,200
I've lived enough anyway.

379
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,280
I've had enough of

380
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,240
this kind of miserable life.

381
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,360
Sir, please make it quick.

382
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,390
Okay.

383
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,540
Ning, do you want to avenge Zhui?

384
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,260
Forget it.

385
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,100
No, we can't.

386
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,130
Why did you kill my lady's horse?

387
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,950
Why?

388
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,990
We were hungry.

389
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,180
Xiu, let's go.

390
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,530
Miss.

391
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,430
I'll give this back to you.

392
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,980
We were so hungry then.

393
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,730
Miss.

394
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,860
Xiu.

395
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,620
You didn't intend to hurt them.

396
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,350
Why do you say that?

397
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,570
They scared the heir of the Zichuan family

398
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,310
like this.

399
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,670
I wouldn't even leave their corpses whole after killing them.

400
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,470
The war made them homeless.

401
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,790
They just want to try their best

402
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,610
to live.

403
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,310
What can I say?

404
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
In the Imperial Capital,

405
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,300
I've never seen

406
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,050
such people and things before.

407
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,650
Yuanzhou might be the real Zichuan.

408
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,590
I know. You let me see these

409
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,170
because you want me to go back to the Imperial Capital.

410
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,580
But... But I won't leave.

411
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,560
As you can see,

412
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,260
those refugees can do anything

413
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,290
for food.

414
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,100
I can only kill everyone I see.

415
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,780
Besides...

416
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,530
I can't kill them all.

417
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,750
Well, Lei Hong should be in charge of these.

418
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,770
In Yuanzhou, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

419
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,470
Lei Hong left this to me.

420
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,050
You shouldn't have come to such a place.

421
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,240
As the heir of Zichuan,

422
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,900
I live in the Imperial Capital and stay away from the war.

423
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,360
But I know nothing about the situation here.

424
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,670
It's indeed ridiculous.

425
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,020
Xiu, I did come for you.

426
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,720
But

427
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,420
I really want to stay here now.

428
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,490
I want to see this world

429
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,160
that I've never seen before.

430
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,070
Don't worry.

431
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,870
I'll explain to Uncle

432
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,680
in the future.

433
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,650
All right, you can stay for a few more days.

434
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,210
But

435
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,400
don't act rashly.

436
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,480
Stay with me all the time.

437
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,780
I'll go with you wherever you go.

438
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,880
The Palace Guards have already been orderly stationed

439
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,010
in Deyun.

440
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,240
Even if there is a new war on the northwest highway,

441
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,330
Si Yilin's Palace Guards

442
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,330
can still go to help them.

443
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,550
No matter how powerful the Tiger of Zichuan is,

444
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,570
he still needs time to rest.

445
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,230
It's rare that Ming Hui

446
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,680
volunteered this time.

447
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,570
Si Yilin can finally take a rest.

448
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,520
Now the crisis in Yuanzhou is suspended.

449
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,590
My Lord. You don't have to worry.

450
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,380
Lord Luo, with you here,

451
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,850
I feel much relieved.

452
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,710
But what I need to worry about

453
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,930
is not just about Yuanzhou.

454
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,030
Lord Chieftain.

455
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,950
Please take a seat.

456
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,420
If you need anything, just ask me to go to the Chieftain's Mansion.

457
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,220
Why did you come all the way here?

458
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,420
Di Lin.

459
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,450
Do you know where Ning is now?

460
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,670
Isn't Ning at home?

461
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,300
Ning is not in her mansion now.

462
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,610
And I suspect she has left the Imperial Capital.

463
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,330
How is that possible?

464
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
You know that.

465
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,460
If anything happens to Ning,

466
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,610
no one can afford it.

467
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,380
Where do you think

468
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,250
Ning went?

469
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,740
I suspect Ning has gone to Yuanzhou

470
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,730
to visit Zichuan Xiu.

471
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,620
Di Lin.

472
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,030
If you've found out that Ning has gone to Yuanzhou,

473
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,050
inform Zichuan Xiu immediately

474
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,050
to send someone

475
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,860
to send Ning back safely.

476
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,260
This is the highest level of mission.

477
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,640
No mistake is allowed.

478
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,710
Lord Chieftain. Don’t worry. I’ll send someone to do it.

479
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,140
Lord Si Yilin led the Palace Guards here,

480
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,670
which is our Deyun Province's highest honor.

481
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,200
Let's have a drink.

482
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,840
You've mobilized so many people.

483
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,650
I'm flattered.

484
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,510
You're welcome.

485
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,090
[Gu Lan]

486
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,060
Let's start.

487
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,960
Lord Si Yilin.

488
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,460
There's not enough food in Deyun Province.

489
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,410
There's really nothing good

490
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,820
to entertain you.

491
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,240
Please forgive me.

492
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,420
I'm fine.

493
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,900
My Lord. What brings you here?

494
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,230
We're stationed in Deyun Province

495
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,380
to rectify the army

496
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,310
and to raise grain.

497
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,940
We have left the Imperial Capital for months.

498
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,550
But we don't have enough supplies.

499
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,670
So please raise the grain for us.

500
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,790
Lord Si Yilin, as you can see,

501
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,730
life in Deyun Province is not easy.

502
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,610
But since you said so,

503
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,330
I will do my best.

504
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,540
How much grain do you need?

505
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
50 tons.

506
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,340
I know

507
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,160
the Palace Guards work very hard

508
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
on the front line.

509
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,260
But 50 tons

510
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,160
is really difficult for me to get.

511
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,200
How about this?

512
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,070
15 thousand kilos.

513
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,300
15 thousand kilos is the limit

514
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,450
we can bear now.

515
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,540
Thank you for your effort.

516
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,060
You're welcome. It's my duty.

517
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,570
My Lord, 15 thousand kilos

518
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,290
may cost Deyun's life.

519
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,940
Lord Si Yilin.

520
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,840
We're not disrespecting you.

521
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,850
It's just that we're using grain everywhere.

522
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,600
The people are on the edge of starving.

523
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,210
Governor.

524
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,830
I think we should be more careful about this.

525
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,810
Enough. Stop talking.

526
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,360
We're part of the Zichuan family.

527
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,230
The interests of the country, though small, are still significant.

528
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,590
Everyone is responsible for the survival of the country.

529
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,390
At this moment of life and death,

530
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,340
Lord Si Yilin's Palace Guards

531
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,850
are the lifeline of our Deyun

532
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,590
as well as the whole Zichuan.

533
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,460
Even if I starve to death,

534
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,460
I must feed the Palace Guards.

535
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,140
Don't worry, Lord Si Yilin.

536
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,150
I will give you

537
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,100
15 thousand kilos of grain no matter what.

538
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,250
I'll remember

539
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,140
your kindness.

540
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,300
What are you laughing at?

541
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,340
I'm sorry. I was impolite.

542
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,910
[Zhuo Lin]

543
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
Pour me some wine.

544
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,380
Continue.

545
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,730
Sorry, My Lord.

546
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,410
Zhuo Lin, what are you doing?

547
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,940
Lord Si Yilin, please forgive him.

548
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,830
It doesn't matter, Governor.

549
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,270
I'll just get changed.

550
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,570
My Lord,

551
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,190
I'll take Lord Si Yilin to get changed.

552
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,650
This way, please.

553
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,900
As Lord Gu Lan's subordinate,

554
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,980
how can you laugh at the banquet?

555
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,210
You always lead troops to war.

556
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,160
But you didn't understand

557
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,210
the good shows in today's banquet.

558
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,540
Are there good shows at the banquet? Tell me.

559
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,080
The dish is potato and cabbage.

560
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,340
But the wine has been brewed for 30 years.

561
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,850
They have grain to make wine, but none to treat guests.

562
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,130
Isn't it interesting?

563
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,340
The first one to propose a toast to you was Lord Qi De.

564
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,560
The pair of bracelets on his wrists

565
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,020
can support half of a battalion's soldiers.

566
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,150
He is a governor

567
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,730
from the border province who fled here for refuge.

568
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,340
It's said his army has 80,000 soldiers.

569
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,420
In fact, it has less than 30,000.

570
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,170
Where does the military pay for over fifty thousand people

571
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:35,969
go each year?

572
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,900
You are different from the others.

573
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,489
Lord Si Yilin. I implore you

574
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:53,389
to investigate the disappearance of Lord Zha Xi.

575
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,880
Captain Zha Xi used to be my commander.

576
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,060
After the rebellion in Yuanzhou started,

577
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,490
he asked Gu Lan for troops

578
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,320
and rebelled against the public and formed a team to suppress the rebels.

579
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,980
That's why Deyun was prevented from being trampled by the rebels.

580
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,980
However, after the war,

581
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,380
Gu Lan refused to pay

582
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,280
the medical fees of the wounded soldiers.

583
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,800
Lord Zha Xi decided to go and collect it.

584
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,940
Since then, he has been gone forever.

585
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,380
I beg you to find out the truth.

586
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,710
Since you are a civil official,

587
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,020
don't kneel.

588
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,400
Don't worry. If the evidence is solid,

589
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,660
I won't let go of it.

590
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,130
My Lord, I'll go back to the banquet first.

591
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,460
I'll leave the ledger

592
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,540
to you.

593
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,780
I didn't expect

594
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,210
that while things seem peaceful and prosperous on the surface here,

595
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,220
there are such hidden worms.

596
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,380
Just based on these items in the accounts,

597
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,890
it's enough to kill him several times over.

598
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,020
My Lord.

599
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,140
Gu Lan and Lord Luo Minghai are very close.

600
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,600
Zhuo Lin must have made a big decision

601
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,900
to hand over the ledger to us.

602
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,450
So we must be careful.

603
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,190
I'll write a letter to Big Brother

604
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,500
and ask the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs to interfere.

605
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,260
Ning!

606
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,380
Ning!

607
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,050
Ning.

608
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,260
Xiu.

609
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,390
You scared me.

610
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,100
Why do you keep this tent?

611
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,370
This is my little palace.

612
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,280
I made it with the fabric you bought.

613
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,780
How is it? Is it beautiful?

614
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,340
You have such a big house to live in.

615
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,870
Why insist on living in this small tent?

616
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,110
Little palace? Are you comfortable? Come out.

617
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,150
You don't understand.

618
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,700
This little palace belongs to me alone.

619
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,570
There's something else in this house.

620
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,330
It turns out that you're preventing these insects.

621
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,620
I'll ask Baichuan

622
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,900
to bring you some insect-proof herbs.

623
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,730
I'm fine. I'm not afraid.

624
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,220
Really?

625
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,670
Take a look.

626
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,210
Do you think I don't know?

627
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,180
Since you were young,

628
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,510
you were scared of these insects the most.

629
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,220
I threw it out. It's fine.

630
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,670
That was when I was young.

631
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,100
I was scared when I was young, but not anymore.

632
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,660
Those scary insects

633
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,100
and the Orcs who snore

634
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,620
are my good friends now.

635
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,180
Even if your small palace can guard against insects,

636
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,330
can it guard against

637
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,000
the loud snoring of the Orcs?

638
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,190
How about this?

639
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,740
From tonight onwards,

640
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,250
I'll ask Baichuan to move in with you.

641
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,980
Let me tell you another secret.

642
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,590
In the past,

643
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,110
she blocked

644
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,330
a snoring Orc's nose

645
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,530
and almost suffocated that Orc.

646
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,140
Fine.

647
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,980
Please thank Baichuan for me.

648
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,470
Ning, thank you for staying here.

649
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,410
I'll get going then.

650
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,030
Xiu, do your work. Don't worry about me.

651
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,750
Okay.

652
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,220
Come back as soon as you see the letter.

653
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,330
[Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs]

654
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,340
Ge Qing.

655
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,100
Yes.

656
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,020
Prepare an anonymous letter for me,

657
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,650
writing that the governor of Deyun Province, Gu Lan,

658
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,050
is accused of embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and misappropriation of relief funds,

659
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,240
resulting in the suffering of soldiers

660
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
and civilians.

661
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,900
We request the Imperial Capital to thoroughly investigate.

662
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,620
Yes, I'll do it myself.

663
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,440
Wait.

664
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,640
Prepare not one, but ten.

665
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,620
You mean

666
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,970
to send a letter to all departments?

667
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,730
If it's only proposed by the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs,

668
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,190
I'm afraid it may attract enough attention.

669
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,570
So I need to know

670
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,560
how Lord Chieftain will treat corruption investigation.

671
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,380
Lord Si Yilin.

672
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,120
I have sent someone to prepare 15 thousand kilos of grains

673
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,550
and send them to your camp.

674
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,830
Thank you, Lord Gu Lan.

675
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,640
It must be hard to get 15 thousand kilos of grains.

676
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,990
It's my duty to work hard

677
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,060
for the soldiers of our family.

678
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,010
I believe so.

679
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,230
Deyun Provine has been well managed.

680
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,710
You also contributed a lot.

681
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,900
Lord Si Yilin, you must be tired from marching.

682
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,110
This is a little something from me.

683
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,310
It's for your health.

684
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,590
Please accept it.

685
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,290
You've worked hard to prepare grains.

686
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,010
You don't have to spend money on me anymore.

687
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,570
Come to the army another day.

688
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,790
How about we drink and have a good time?

689
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,470
Okay, it's my honor.

690
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,250
Okay.

691
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,100
He actually dares to come and openly bribe.

692
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,160
He truly knows no bounds, walking right into the trap.

693
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,700
Big Brother has replied.

694
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,080
He said he would report to Lord Chieftain

695
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,900
and thoroughly investigate this matter.

696
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,540
So what we need to do now

697
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,220
is to control the situation

698
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,300
and control Gu Lan.

699
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,030
Let's search for evidence.

700
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,740
We'll take him back for trial

701
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,120
after the Imperial Palace issues the final ultimatum.
