[Episode 19]

4
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,160
Any other government affairs for me to deal with?

5
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,250
My Lord.

6
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,310
I received an anonymous letter recently,

7
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,470
saying that Gu Lan, the governor of Deyun Province,

8
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,310
is suspected of dereliction of duty and the people are suffering.

9
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,910
Recently,

10
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,750
he is also suspected of murdering a family general.

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,669
It requests a thorough investigation by the Imperial Capital.

12
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,200
My Lord. Please have a look.

13
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,630
The other officials and I

14
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,230
received the same letter.

15
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,870
Let me see.

16
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,850
The directory of corrupt practices has been included.

17
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,579
Please have a look, Lord Luo.

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,650
These are a few lines of incomplete accounts.

19
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,550
You didn't fabricate them on purpose, did you?

20
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,230
What do you think, Di Lin?

21
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,330
My Lord, I think we should pay attention to this matter.

22
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,350
The Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs will investigate it thoroughly.

23
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,230
Someone must be playing tricks.

24
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,560
Each word in these numerous anonymous letters carries significant weight.

25
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,880
Can these unrelated accounts

26
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,560
be used as evidence?

27
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,110
Evidence can only be obtained through thorough investigation.

28
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,770
Lord Luo, you tried to stop us.

29
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,500
Do you not want to investigate

30
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,329
or dare not?

31
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,890
Of course, we should investigate it.

32
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,150
We must find out

33
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,630
who is slandering the family's officials.

34
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,680
We must investigate it.

35
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,130
Over the years,

36
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,300
there have been many wars.

37
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,870
The treasury is empty,

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,960
In particular, the local finances are frequently running deficits.

39
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,350
To stabilize public sentiment,

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,350
prevent unrest,

41
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,190
and because the incident of Deyun is by no means an isolated case,

42
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,390
this time

43
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,270
we must make an example to deter others.

44
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,630
You two

45
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,510
are the pillars upon which I rely.

46
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,240
I implore you to temporarily set aside past grievances

47
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,769
and work together to eliminate the hidden dangers within our family.

48
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,790
My Lord, the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs bears the sole responsibility,

49
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,720
and is willing to serve the family.

50
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,780
The Ministry of War accepts the command.

51
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,990
Let's adjourn.

52
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,210
Lord Luo, please stay.

53
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,270
Let me ask you, is this true?

54
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,110
My Lord, it must be Di Lin's doing.

55
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,080
My brother-in-law

56
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,500
is mediocre and greedy for pleasure,

57
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,950
but I believe he wouldn't dare to commit such bold acts

58
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,470
of embezzlement, corruption, and murder.

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,000
Corruption must not be tolerated.

60
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,350
Agreed.

61
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,750
This time, I am using this opportunity

62
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,870
to clean up the internal affairs of the family.

63
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,870
Of course,

64
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,590
I believe you're an upright

65
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,830
and impartial official who does not favoritism.

66
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,560
That's why I asked you to work together with Di Lin

67
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,270
to clean up the family affairs.

68
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,390
I'd rather have you

69
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,570
investigate than someone else.

70
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,820
Do you understand?

71
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,470
Yes.

72
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,909
Very well, go ahead.

73
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,740
Thank you, My Lord.

74
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,510
Here.

75
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,040
Have a taste.

76
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,670
I'm just a humble official.

77
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,550
How could I understand the nuances of these fine wines?

78
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,590
To me,

79
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,350
all wines taste the same.

80
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,420
How did I hear

81
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,910
that you've been scouring the land for rare treasures

82
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,030
to make wine?

83
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,460
I know there have been rumors circulating lately,

84
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,010
reaching your ears.

85
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,510
They're all nonsense.

86
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,710
There are endless wars in Yuanzhou.

87
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,409
It's inevitable that we resort

88
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,740
to borrowing and lending among ourselves to make ends meet.

89
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,470
I'm not involved in financial matters.

90
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,470
Let the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs investigate.

91
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,190
My Lord.

92
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,200
Why trouble

93
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,360
the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs with such trivial matters?

94
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,990
[Governor's Mansion]

95
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,570
How about this?

96
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,950
I'll donate another 50 tons of grain

97
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,350
to the Palace Guards.

98
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,920
This time in my own name.

99
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,240
My Lord, there's no need for you to keep accounts

100
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
or repay.

101
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,290
As for the military expenditure,

102
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,380
let's settle it privately.

103
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,670
Are you openly bribing me?

104
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,550
This is the personal bodyguard of that corrupt official.

105
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,460
He must know the whereabouts of Lord Zha Xi.

106
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,420
Tell me, where is Lord Zha Xi now?

107
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,909
Tell me!

108
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,150
Say it.

109
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,430
Si Yilin.

110
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,159
You're being disrespectful.

111
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,890
Luo Minghai, the president of the Ministry of War is my brother-in-law.

112
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,310
Even if your position is high, can it surpass his?

113
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,010
My position is not as high as his.

114
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,810
But Lord Chieftain personally inquired about it.

115
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,570
You want to arrest me. Where is the evidence?

116
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,950
Bring him here.

117
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,010
My Lord, the evidence is here.

118
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,470
It's you, you bastard! Do you want to die?

119
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,810
The whereabouts of Lord Zha Xi are now clear.

120
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,000
Tell me.

121
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,840
Lord Zha Xi has been murdered by Gu Lan.

122
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,940
His body has been eaten by their dogs.

123
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,350
Nonsense!

124
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,110
How dare you be so arrogant!

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,010
Lord Gu Lan, what else do you want to say?

126
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,350
Lord Si Yilin.

127
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,940
You and I are both nobles from Zichuan.

128
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,890
For the sake of my brother-in-law Luo Minghai,

129
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,419
there's still room for negotiation...

130
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,659
There's still...

131
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,420
You've committed corruption and bribery.

132
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,940
Let me tell you, even if Luo Minghai were here,

133
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,740
the outcome would be the same.

134
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,510
You want to negotiate?

135
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,430
Come.

136
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,990
Negotiate with the ghost of Lord Zha Xi.

137
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,660
Let's see if he'll spare you.

138
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,870
Take him away.

139
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,270
Yes.

140
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,150
Go.

141
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,510
Go!

142
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,170
Let go of me!

143
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,590
Let go of me! I want to see my brother-in-law, Luo Minghai.

144
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,270
-My Lord!
-Let go of me!

145
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,510
This corrupt official made Deyun a mess.

146
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,390
On behalf of Lord Zha Xi, his subordinates,

147
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,590
and the people of Deyun,

148
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,120
I express gratitude to you.

149
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,190
These are the things I should do.

150
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,750
Lastly, I entrust you to escort him back to the Imperial Capital.

151
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,070
Then, publish all matters

152
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,720
concerning Lord Zha Xi in the official newspaper

153
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,050
to prove his innocence.

154
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,550
That girl is strong.

155
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,810
I'll go dance with her.

156
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,000
Enough. You're always trying to flirt with any girl you see.

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,930
Let's eat first.

158
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,600
Boss, it's odd today.

159
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,430
Usually, it's the Orcs

160
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,830
pulling Luo Jie to dance and drink together.

161
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,870
Why don't they sing, dance

162
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,730
or drink today?

163
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,600
It's because today is their fasting day.

164
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,970
Every year at this time

165
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,350
in Bulu Village,

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,430
they abstain from alcohol and food

167
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,370
to pray for the blessings of the gods,

168
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,200
for good weather

169
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,220
and safety.

170
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,110
Let's eat.

171
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,670
Let's eat.

172
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,830
Come on, let's eat.

173
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,690
Princess Ning, time to eat.

174
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,440
I'm on a diet. You guys eat.

175
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,530
Okay.

176
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,720
I never expected that even after leaving their hometown for so long,

177
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,790
they would still remember to pray for their hometown.

178
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,180
I wonder how Bulu Village is doing now.

179
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,450
They haven't been back for a long time.

180
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,050
Ever since Second Brother's army

181
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,030
went to Yuanzhou to eliminate the rebels,

182
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,350
there have been soldiers from the Zichuan family all along the way.

183
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,230
And there are many Orcs among the rebels.

184
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,630
Their appearance is such

185
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,110
that they dare not show up

186
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,870
where soldiers of Zichuan pass by.

187
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,890
They must be homesick.

188
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,670
Of course, that's why I've decided

189
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,880
to have our Xiu Battalion escort them home.

190
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,310
My Lord, have you forgotten our plan?

191
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,150
Of course not.

192
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,740
To kill Lei Hong and eliminate the rebels.

193
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,390
But you promised to send De Lun and the others home.

194
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,910
With all this to and fro,

195
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,590
how do you intend to explain to the family?

196
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,720
They are my friends.

197
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,870
When we were short of provisions,

198
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,350
they treated us with good food and drink.

199
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,980
Similarly, when friends can't return home,

200
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,620
we must not stand idly by.

201
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,390
Also, I have a big plan.

202
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,710
Before we set off,

203
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm preparing to raise a large sum of money.

204
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,640
Enough, stop talking about big plans.

205
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,470
Princess Ning looks pale.

206
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,020
If you have time,

207
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,910
you should check on her.

208
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,240
The weather in Yuanzhou is so nice.

209
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,690
It seems like ever since I came here,

210
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,220
I've been seeing these sunshowers every day.

211
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,370
It's really beautiful.

212
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,840
Actually, you don't have to pretend

213
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,120
to be happy every day.

214
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,790
I'm not.

215
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,750
Ning.

216
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,920
I know you don't like the life here.

217
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,290
But you like this place.

218
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,400
You don't belong to the Imperial Capital or me.

219
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,050
Actually, I've always been puzzled.

220
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,820
Why can you

221
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,910
get along so well with the Orcs?

222
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,450
Because I'm truly friends with them.

223
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,100
Do you know? I once fell into misfortune.

224
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,170
It was Old De Lun who saved my life.

225
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,830
I truly lived on this land

226
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,020
in Yuanzhou.

227
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,470
My love for this land

228
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,240
is just like yours for the Imperial Capital.

229
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,830
But we also grew up together before.

230
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,750
Have you forgotten the days

231
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,790
in the Imperial Capital?

232
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,390
Weren't you happy back then?

233
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,670
It was different.

234
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,510
Yuanzhou, this land, remote and barren,

235
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,350
is considered the dependent territory of the Zichuan family,

236
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,080
incomparable to the bustling Imperial Capital.

237
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,110
Just like me.

238
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,390
Although I bear the surname of the Zichuan family...

239
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,710
Xiu, don't say that.

240
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,280
I've never seen you as an outsider.

241
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,910
When the task in Yuanzhou is completed,

242
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,690
let's return to the Imperial Capital together.

243
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,890
Then we'll tell Uncle

244
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,950
that we'll stay in the Imperial Capital forever, okay?

245
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,100
Ning, at least I have to stay here now.

246
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,110
Princess Ning, are you feeling unwell?

247
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,350
No.

248
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,050
Then what's on your mind, Your Highness?

249
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,950
After I came to Yuanzhou,

250
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,050
I realized everything here

251
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,230
is so important to Xiu.

252
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,930
Compared to that,

253
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,980
whatever reason I had

254
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,650
for coming to Yuanzhou,

255
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,730
it all seems trivial now.

256
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,390
I'm feeling a bit lost.

257
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,990
I don't know what I should do next

258
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,290
and what I should be doing.

259
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,660
Do you know why De Lun and the others

260
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,720
have such a deep bond with Lord Xiu?

261
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,070
It's because Lord Xiu brought light and hope

262
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,510
to the entire village.

263
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,470
They treated us sincerely,

264
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,970
without any pretense,

265
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,460
so we're willing to reciprocate with sincerity.

266
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,130
After so many years of hard work in Yuanzhou,

267
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,310
it has become his second home.

268
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,980
But there are many elites in the family.

269
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,120
As long as Xiu talks to Uncle,

270
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,990
Uncle will surely consider

271
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,320
my friendship with him

272
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,560
and take good care of Yuanzhou.

273
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,100
Yes.

274
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,430
But everyone thinks

275
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,960
Yuanzhou is a barren place.

276
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,040
Who else can treat Yuanzhou

277
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,150
as their own hometown like him?

278
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,240
He knows that very well,

279
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,400
so he can't entrust this matter

280
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,520
to anyone else.

281
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,550
I am the heir of Zichuan.

282
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,590
People and things in Yuanzhou

283
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,070
are equally important to me.

284
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,750
A bug.

285
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,470
A bug.

286
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,960
Go away!

287
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,350
Is it gone?

288
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:23,990
Yes.

289
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,460
Come in here.

290
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,700
Are the investigation results all true?

291
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,390
Yes.

292
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,930
Are the amounts of embezzlement and the evidence of framing

293
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,950
and killing military officers

294
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,510
all solid?

295
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,440
The official newspaper in Yuanzhou has already published this matter,

296
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,030
clearing the name of Lord Zha Xi.

297
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,710
And Lord Gu Lan

298
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,710
has also been arrested by the Palace Guards

299
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,109
and brought to the Imperial Capital today.

300
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,530
Bring him here.

301
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,150
Yes.

302
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,510
Lord Luo Minghai of the Ministry of War

303
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,670
has specially tasked me with taking over the Governor of Deyun.

304
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,870
The notice I received

305
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,940
instructs me to escort him to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

306
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,800
This case is being handled jointly by the Ministry of War

307
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,870
and the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

308
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,630
Besides,

309
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,620
it is not permitted for foreign stationed troops

310
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,550
to carry any weapons upon entering the Imperial Capital.

311
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,110
To avoid any complications during the escort,

312
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,370
it's best to hand him over directly to me.

313
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,510
Since it's a joint investigation by both bureaus,

314
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,630
I would appreciate your cooperation, My Lord,

315
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,240
to prevent any further complications on the way back.

316
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,360
Just you wait.

317
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,710
My Lord, Gu Lan is here.

318
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,990
You may leave.

319
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,780
Yes.

320
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,450
Brother-in-law, luckily, your men arrived in time.

321
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,710
Otherwise, I would be tortured to death.

322
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,910
I've reviewed Zha Xi's records.

323
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,320
He has been awarded three military honors.

324
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,950
You're saying he was arrogant and disobedient

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,440
in Deyun, is that right?

326
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,990
He always flaunted his military achievements,

327
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,030
acting high and mighty,

328
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,360
meddling in everything

329
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,490
as if he were the Governor himself.

330
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,150
I endured,

331
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,480
but killing him became my last resort.

332
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,470
We can't keep him alive, Brother-in-law.

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,890
Siyi Lin sent some evidence.

334
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,600
It's troublesome.

335
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,320
Those are all rumors.

336
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
If they want to frame me, they'll find a way.

337
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,230
In my opinion,

338
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,970
he's targeting me is fake, but targeting you is real.

339
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,220
After giving it a lot of thought,

340
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,380
there seem to be two sensible options.

341
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,940
One, destroy the evidence and completely reverse the case.

342
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,800
Two, you take some of the blame,

343
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,000
give up your position in Yuanzhou,

344
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,690
and return to my side.

345
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,290
Which one do you choose?

346
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,470
The first way, of course.

347
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,830
Brother-in-law, in the shadows where the sunlight doesn't reach,

348
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,030
everyone is the same.

349
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,990
After reversing the case,

350
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,590
we can take this opportunity to accuse them of false accusations

351
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,320
and eliminate dissent.

352
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,010
You are in the Imperial Capital and I am in Yuanzhou.

353
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,330
Zichuan will be ours in the future, Brother-in-law.

354
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,020
Shuzhen, did you hear that?

355
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,310
Brother-in-law. Brother...

356
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,430
So,

357
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,990
the crimes they accused of you are true.

358
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,380
Brother-in-law,

359
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,340
this is not about right or wrong.

360
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,620
Kneel!

361
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,990
You've committed embezzlement, plotted against loyal officials,

362
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,630
and now you harbor rebellious intentions.

363
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,200
How can you justify the trust that Zichuan has placed in you?

364
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,580
How can you justify the painstaking efforts

365
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,150
of your sister?

366
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,800
You deserve to be sentenced to death.

367
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,350
Brother-in-law, it's not that serious.

368
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,310
Brother-in-law.

369
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,350
Brother-in-law, I was wrong. I plead guilty.

370
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,200
I will resign.

371
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,270
I'll come back to you.

372
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,350
I'll listen to you.

373
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,470
For the sake of my sister,

374
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,610
please save my life, Brother-in-law.

375
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,150
I'm your last family.

376
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,280
To save you?

377
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,390
To save you would mean destroying Zichuan.

378
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,250
My sister is watching.

379
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,510
My sister is watching.

380
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,790
I'm your last family.

381
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,430
Brother-in-law.

382
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,860
Guards, take him back to the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

383
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,910
Brother-in-law.

384
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,950
Di Lin.

385
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,750
I won't engage in favoritism or corruption,

386
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,540
nor do I condone it.

387
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,510
But today, I plead with you to spare his life.

388
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,690
I'm willing to negotiate with any conditions.

389
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,210
Lord Luo,

390
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,350
I truly appreciate your immense favor.

391
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,200
However, this matter is under the supervision of Lord Chieftain

392
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,780
and the oversight of the Bureau of Punishments.

393
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,620
I can only act according to official procedures.

394
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,410
As long as you spare his life,

395
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,710
I am willing to go to Lord Chieftain

396
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,060
to resign from my position now and never return to the court.

397
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,960
The guilty will be prosecuted, and the innocent will be acquitted.

398
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,110
My Lord,

399
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,310
earlier you asked me to investigate

400
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,590
the accounts of the governors of various provinces. I have the results now.

401
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,540
If we submit these documents,

402
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,250
it might cause a huge shock.

403
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,250
Previously, all the impoverished governors reported

404
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,670
by the Logistics Ministry and the Ministry of War

405
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,270
have engaged in misconduct.

406
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,930
They are the same as Gu Lan.

407
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,550
They all have varying degrees of involvement

408
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,750
with officials in the Imperial Capital

409
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,430
and even implicate officials from the Three Central Offices.

410
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,310
So what?

411
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,390
The reason why the people of Yuanzhou are so easily incited

412
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,390
is precisely because those governors

413
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,920
are of the same ilk as Gu Lan.

414
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,320
Do you know

415
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,710
that Gu Lan is the only younger brother

416
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,860
of my beloved wife, Shuzhen,

417
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,290
and also the last close relative I have left

418
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,210
in this world?

419
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,670
If you were in my shoes today,

420
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,080
would you turn your back on your family and kill him?

421
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,670
If the final line of defense of the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

422
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,410
still hesitates to act decisively,

423
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,470
then Zichuan is truly beyond saving.

424
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,190
Di Lin, you're so heartless.

425
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,670
Today, Gu Lan has brought this upon himself.

426
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,590
Now, give him

427
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,390
a fair and just outcome.

428
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,260
But let me tell you, Di Lin,

429
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,920
I hope that one day

430
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,610
you will experience the same pain.

431
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,010
Retribution will not be delayed.

432
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,570
Integrity and honesty are the foundation of governing.

433
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,720
Even if pierced by a thousand arrows, I will not falter.

434
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,230
Di Lin.

435
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,340
You are trying to cut off

436
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,460
my last relative.

437
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,720
I declare that from today onwards,

438
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,470
our Xiu Battalion will establish

439
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,910
a Wealth Building Hall.

440
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,460
Boss, what is Wealth Building Hall?

441
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,990
Why are we establishing it?

442
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,150
Is it related to our food problem?

443
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,790
Right now, the food reserves in our camp

444
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,250
are only enough to sustain us for three days.

445
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,760
Three days?

446
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,830
Sit down.

447
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,850
What should we do?

448
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,540
Stop!

449
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,390
Are we in a hurry to collect grain?

450
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,770
Yes.

451
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,750
Should we use the money to buy grain?

452
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,830
Right.

453
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,890
Like hell you know.

454
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,200
We have no money.

455
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,920
That's right.

456
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,800
So we need to make money.

457
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,500
Let me put it simply.

458
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,190
Everyone knows how to distribute pork, right?

459
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,150
[Wealth Building Hall]

460
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,850
There really is a pig.

461
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,280
This is a pig called Wealth Building Hall.

462
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,950
The pig's head and neck belong to me.

463
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,640
You are the captains.

464
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,510
You can divide the scapular meat and the large tenderloin

465
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,570
among yourselves.

466
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,800
The remaining parts go to the lieutenant captains.

467
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,640
They'll get the small tenderloin,

468
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,910
front

469
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,530
and hind legs.

470
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,470
Okay.

471
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,280
The remaining four pig trotters go to the sergeants.

472
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,250
Okay.

473
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,630
As for the rest of the pork belly,

474
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,360
we'll divide it evenly among the other

475
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,380
remaining members.

476
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,240
Think about it.

477
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,850
There're so many of us,

478
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,400
yet we can't raise a pig well?

479
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,670
The better we raise it,

480
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,100
the more pork everyone will have by the end of the year.

481
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,770
Let me ask you.

482
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,220
If you were the one who raised the pig,

483
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,870
would you raise this pig well for your share?

484
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,000
Absolutely. As long as it makes money,

485
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,270
I'll make sure it becomes the fattest pig

486
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,820
in the entire Xichuan continent.

487
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,080
That settles it, then?

488
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,070
Good.

489
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,210
Good, good.

490
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,160
Alright.

491
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,100
When the meeting is over,

492
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,030
you guys can explain my genius idea

493
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,290
to everyone in detail.

494
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,070
And find some landlords

495
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,730
to raise this fat pig with us.

496
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,650
Okay.

497
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,640
The idea is good,

498
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,960
but where will you

499
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,860
find landlords in these remote areas?

500
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,390
You can only find refugees.

501
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,190
Baichuan.

502
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,060
You saw those people outside.

503
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,830
Those businessmen?

504
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,830
Yes, indeed, we'll rely on them to fatten up

505
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,700
Wealth Building Hall.

506
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,100
My Lord, what exactly is this big business?

507
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,360
The civil war in Yuanzhou has been going on for so long.

508
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,950
So, the supplies are very scarce now.

509
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,170
If we engage in trading at this time,

510
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,140
not only will I easily repay you

511
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,570
the debt I owe,

512
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,030
but you'll also continuously prosper in the future.

513
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,230
But the Xiu Battalion

514
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
doesn't seem very reliable.

515
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,190
The Xiu Battalion has a long history

516
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,230
and is also a royal elite force.

517
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,510
You must know these two individuals, right?

518
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,260
Entrust your wealth to such a renowned general

519
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
who stands on par with

520
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,310
Lord Si Yilin and Lord Di Lin,

521
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,780
and he will safeguard your assets.

522
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,030
Okay.

523
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,180
I see.

524
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,910
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

525
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,250
I was worried that you couldn't pay back the money you borrowed from them.

526
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,310
We don't need to borrow money anymore.

527
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:09,990
Never.

528
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,830
Because our Wealth Building Hall

529
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,030
is a one-and-done money-making model.

530
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,410
Money begets money, capital doubles, and profits roll in.

531
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:17,840
Excellent.

532
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,550
Stop. Yuanzhou is poor.

533
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,050
So where would you find so many tycoons to do business with?

534
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,450
There may be few tycoons in Yuanzhou, but there are many people,

535
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,510
and each place has its own specialties.

536
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,310
Take Bulu Village as an example;

537
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,030
they have their own specialty, Black Grass Extract.

538
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,620
Now, during the chaos of war,

539
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,380
who wouldn't want to stock up

540
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,800
on some healing ointment?

541
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,280
That's right.

542
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,610
We'll spread the news

543
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,880
about Wealth Building Hall,

544
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,270
and people will definitely come knocking on our doors.

545
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,780
Truly, the efforts of our predecessors

546
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,600
paved the way for the success of Lord Xiu.

547
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,130
Why do you speak so harshly?

548
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,270
Don't only care about money, okay?

549
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,860
In fact, Wealth Building Hall

550
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,300
has a bigger effect.

551
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,960
The merchants of Wealth Building Hall

552
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,090
travel far and wide,

553
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,480
covering a much broader range

554
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,630
than our marching and fighting.

555
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,670
So, I've given them all

556
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
a task,

557
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,380
which is to gather information about Lei Hong.

558
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,530
Brilliant.

559
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,770
Now, we need to

560
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,320
cast this wide net.

561
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,850
Do you think

562
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,870
we should get involved in Lord Xiu's

563
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,170
Wealth Building Hall business

564
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,080
and sell something too?

565
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,110
I'll sell novels and magazines, of course.

566
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,560
If they don't sell, at least we can read them ourselves.

567
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,620
It won't be wasted.

568
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,680
Then I'll open a military bookstore

569
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,030
and educate the people of Yuanzhou in culture.

570
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,410
Educate culture? So funny.

571
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,550
What about you?

572
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,150
What's the easiest money to make in this world?

573
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,660
Women's money is the easiest to make.

574
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,630
You can make a lot of money just by using

575
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,160
the flowers and grasses outside.

576
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,270
Where's Zichuan Xiu? Come out!

577
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,180
Here.

578
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,510
What's this Wealth Building Hall? We quit.

579
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,630
Yes, we quit.

580
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,670
Gentlemen, calm down.

581
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,270
How can you refuse such an opportunity

582
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,290
to become wealthy?

583
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,420
What good business?

584
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,310
I think your Xiu Battalion

585
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,640
is just a bunch of ragtag soldiers.

586
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,630
What are you talking about?

587
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,160
What are you talking about?

588
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,850
You promised to protect our business transactions.

589
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,510
Are you relying on these incompetent soldiers?

590
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,650
The Xiu Battalion

591
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,450
is not a group of ragtag soldiers

592
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,270
They have undergone professional military training.

593
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,320
Their martial arts...

594
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,450
Ho! Ho! Ha!

595
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,230
I've heard this slogan a hundred times.

596
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,960
No matter how loudly you chant your slogans,

597
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,920
what's the use of just these few soldiers?

598
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,030
You...

599
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,410
What you see now

600
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,530
is only a small part of our forces.

601
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,340
Put it down.

602
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,150
Actually, our forces

603
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,980
are distributed throughout Yuanzhou,

604
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,500
and even infiltrated into the territory of the North Clan.

605
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,060
You don't need to worry about the issue of military strength.

606
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,170
We didn't see the army with our own eyes.

607
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,710
So we still find it difficult to believe in your promise.

608
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,640
Are you worried that our Zichuan family's army

609
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,840
is not strong enough?

610
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:00,960
Princess Ning.

611
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,160
I've been to the Imperial Capital.

612
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,290
This is really Princess Zichuan Ning.

613
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Your Highness,

614
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,690
I can guarantee on behalf of our family

615
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,690
that all your deals in Yuanzhou

616
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,780
will always be protected by the army.

617
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,270
Does that reassure all of you?

618
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,190
Yes.

619
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,310
Yes.

620
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,370
Then please

621
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,680
accompany us to see our army camp.

622
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,790
Please.

623
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,430
Okay, goodbye.

624
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,020
Goodbye.

625
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,700
Let's go.

626
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,280
Ning, thank you for helping me out.

627
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,970
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

628
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,440
You...

629
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,440
You didn't expect that I would help you

630
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,300
establish yourself in Yuanzhou?

631
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,690
Let's split up

632
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,990
and go to different tribal cities

633
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,320
to persuade the merchants to join our Wealth Building Hall.

634
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,910
You must have been out for a long time.

635
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,050
Do you miss

636
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,830
the food and wine in your hometown?

637
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,010
Do you feel uncomfortable

638
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,310
and frustrated living here?

639
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,070
Welcome to the Xiu Battalion's Wealth Building Hall.

640
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,150
Welcome.

641
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,980
I'll take the wine.

642
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,300
Okay, pay me.

643
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,200
I want this one.

644
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,790
What's the rush?

645
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,310
OK.

646
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,780
We have plenty.

647
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,850
Everyone, let me introduce

648
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,860
the next product, Snake Race's Secret Recipe Sausage.

649
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,670
Three, two, one. Put it up.

650
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,060
I want it.

651
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,620
Don't grab.

652
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,540
I want it too.

653
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,550
We have all kinds of delicious food and wine.

654
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,880
If you want anything else,

655
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,950
we can pre-sell it.

656
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,030
Tell Captain Luo Jie

657
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,590
what you want,

658
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,100
and he will record it all.

659
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,710
Also,

660
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,950
in a couple of days, it will be payday,

661
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,760
and I will hold a gathering here.

662
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,030
Remember to bring your friends along,

663
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,450
and there will be discounts for you.

664
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,510
Okay.

665
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,920
Here.

666
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,810
This dish

667
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,340
is my beloved wife Shuzhen's specialty.

668
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,800
She knew I liked it.

669
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,910
She often cooked it for me.

670
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,030
Now,

671
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,350
my beloved wife is gone.

672
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,310
I...

673
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,540
I can't taste her cooking anymore.

674
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,219
I know you are an upright official.

675
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,300
The graveyard you bought for your deceased wife was too simple.

676
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,260
The cemetery I bought

677
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,550
for your late wife is of noble standard.

678
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,180
My Lord, I'm ashamed.

679
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,220
Corruption among the bureaucrats of Yuanzhou

680
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,650
is a deep-rooted problem.

681
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,290
It will eventually require strong measures.

682
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,790
However,

683
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:42,410
Gu Lan is my last remaining relative.

684
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,900
But precisely because he is my relative,

685
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,000
he must die.

686
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,040
Only then can it be made clear

687
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,140
that our family is determined to cleanse our ranks.

688
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,500
Be a true man.

689
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,790
Eat. This is your last meal.

690
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,960
Brother-in-law.

691
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,640
I will resign from my office.

692
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,910
I will live in seclusion.

693
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,690
I will no longer cause trouble for you.

694
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,690
Brother-in-law.

695
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,500
For the sake of my sister,

696
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,400
please spare my life.

697
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,560
Luo Minghai, you betrayed my sister.

698
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,050
You betrayed my family.

699
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,800
You didn't even save your own people.

700
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,320
You have no conscience.

701
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,010
My sister and I will never...

702
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,730
Di Lin.

703
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,150
Are you satisfied now?

704
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,070
On the night when the people of Yuanzhou

705
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,730
bled in the Imperial Capital,

706
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,130
my entire family,

707
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,890
including the present Gu Lan,

708
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,040
your hands are probably stained with blood that can never be washed away.

709
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,790
So, please, in the future, when the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Government Supervision

710
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,590
inspect local finances,

711
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,540
be more careful.

712
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,810
Don't be like this time,

713
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,430
which led to the Lord Chieftain ordering punishment

714
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,030
and left me covered in blood.

715
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,070
Kill!

716
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,290
You're back.

717
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,270
Is it nice?

718
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,590
Yes.

719
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,180
I've been feeling like he's moving lately.

720
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,190
What's wrong?

721
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,180
I'm going to wash my hands.

722
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,630
Your hands are probably stained

723
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,270
with blood that can never be washed away.

724
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,350
I hope that one day

725
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,860
you will experience the same pain.

726
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,380
Retribution will not be delayed.

727
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,450
Ever since I felt it move,

728
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,350
I've been wondering

729
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,030
if this child will be like you or like me.

730
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,720
He can't be like me, my eyes are too small.

731
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,240
He has to be like you.

732
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,270
I'd rather he be like you.

733
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,990
I only know how to cook, I don't know anything else.

734
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,040
That's not true.

735
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,230
In my eyes, being able to cook and take care of the family

736
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,090
is a real skill.

737
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,810
Everyone is pursuing

738
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,730
fame and fortune.

739
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,090
But in my opinion,

740
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,670
those are just fleeting dreams.

741
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,050
Who knows when they'll wake up

742
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,510
and nothing will exist anymore?

743
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,920
Why are you suddenly so emotional today?

744
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,550
Did something happen?

745
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,830
Nothing. I want to tell you

746
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:14,270
that in this world, only love and hatred are real.

747
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,760
Being able to give warmth and beauty to another person

748
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,020
is the greatest skill.

749
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,010
And you gave me a home.

750
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,100
So in my eyes,

751
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,980
you're better than all the officials and generals.

752
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:28,630
Besides,

753
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,770
no one is more precious to me than you.

754
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,930
If it were someone else,

755
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,530
he would have been overcautious.

756
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,860
Only Big Brother can be so decisive.

757
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,920
Even if he makes enemies everywhere,

758
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,350
and not understood by the world...
