[Episode 13]

4
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:50,630
Can you... feel at ease?

5
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,540
You kept talking, and you shouted at the sky.

6
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,610
Lord Luo, clean up the site.

7
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,830
Clean up the site.

8
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:14,990
Yes.

9
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,230
Wait.

10
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,390
Anyway,

11
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,630
Lord Yang was my loyal official.

12
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,970
Carry him away.

13
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,230
Yes.

14
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,090
Guards!

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,910
Yes.

16
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,690
Carry him away.

17
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,340
Yes.

18
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,840
The rain stopped?

19
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,870
What time is it now?

20
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,890
It's 3 a.m.

21
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,220
Zichuan has finally welcomed a new day.

22
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,590
The Yuanzhou Army in the east of the city has rushed in.

23
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,120
Those men

24
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,990
stationed in the east of the city...

25
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,390
It's the rebels that should be eliminated.

26
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,620
As long as you stay here tonight,

27
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,670
you will be safe.

28
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,710
Lord Xiu, can you guarantee that?

29
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,079
Yes, I can.

30
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,340
Lord Xiao.

31
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,630
The Yuanzhou Army fought very bravely.

32
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,150
Lord Di Lin led his men to defend Lord Chieftain.

33
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you.

34
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,360
What is this?

35
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,670
Yang Minghua's crimes are written on this.

36
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,120
When you pacify the rebels, I'll submit it to the chieftain.

37
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,640
Since you know his crimes,

38
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,790
why didn't you report him before?

39
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,550
Lord Xiao, whose side are you on?

40
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,100
Whose side...

41
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,140
am I on?

42
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,640
According to the list,

43
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,970
kill all of Yang Minghua's accomplices.

44
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,470
Yes.

45
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,300
My Lord, the rebels in the east of the city have all been eliminated.

46
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,410
Good. Follow me to the South Camp.

47
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,040
Boss, the Yuanzhou Army is arresting the rebels.

48
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,310
They have captured the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

49
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,780
Even Lord Xiao of the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs

50
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,770
was dragged on the ground behind a horse.

51
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,260
Di Lin deserves his reputation of being cruel.

52
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,120
How can you guarantee our safety?

53
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,100
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

54
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,290
You had a fierce battle tonight.

55
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,820
Big Brother, thank you.

56
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,110
Now I can finally

57
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,940
call you Big Brother in front of everyone.

58
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,580
Xiu.

59
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
Ask your men to leave.

60
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,350
It's okay now. Our men can leave.

61
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,590
The three of you, wait for me at the door.

62
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,120
Let's go.

63
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,770
What's wrong?

64
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,570
Kill them all!

65
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,840
Why?

66
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,630
Wait.

67
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,840
Big Brother,

68
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,370
this is not what we planned before.

69
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,330
This is what Lord Chieftain wants.

70
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,650
Next, Lord Di Lin is going to tell you Lord Chieftain's order.

71
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,390
According to Lord Chieftain's order,

72
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,120
everyone of the Palace Guards,

73
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,530
you are in high positions and well paid.

74
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,620
You should have been loyal to the state and served the state.

75
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,950
But now, you've colluded with people including Yang Minghua and Lei Xun to start a rebellion.

76
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,190
You have betrayed the chieftain and framed the loyal.

77
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,780
I hereby order Di Lin, Acting Minister of Military and Legal Affairs,

78
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,780
to rectify the military discipline

79
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,160
and eliminate the remaining rebels.

80
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,630
Anyone who participated in the rebellion shall be executed immediately.

81
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,230
Zichuan Xiu!

82
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,950
Zichuan Xiu!

83
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,260
You bastard! How dare you lie to us!

84
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,909
There must be a misunderstanding.

85
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,350
There must be a misunderstanding.

86
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,409
Don't worry. Di Lin is my big brother.

87
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,380
I'll talk to him.

88
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,940
Big Brother, come here.

89
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,030
Big Brother, the situation has changed.

90
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,190
If we report it to Lord Chieftain, I'm sure he will forgive them.

91
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,790
If we regard them as traitors

92
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,860
and kill them indiscriminately,

93
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,710
we would kill the innocent wrongly.

94
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,040
In the court competition, might is right.

95
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,470
There are no wrongful killings, only escaped criminals.

96
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,070
They've been here all night.

97
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,350
I've been with them.

98
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,300
I can testify for them.

99
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,960
Their mistake is they didn't do anything today.

100
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,780
There are 150,000 Palace Guards.

101
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,020
But they just sat by and watched it happen.

102
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,680
No matter who wins tonight, he won't let them go.

103
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,810
Think about it.

104
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,070
If it were Lord Chieftain who was killed tonight,

105
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,790
do you think Yang Minghua would let go of the grudges

106
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,390
and become friends with you?

107
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,990
Big Brother,

108
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,770
no matter what happens today,

109
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,090
I won't let them die.

110
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,640
Because this is my promise to them.

111
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,730
Now you should know

112
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,340
you shouldn't make a promise so easily.

113
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,290
Don't waste time. Kill them all.

114
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,490
Wait.

115
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,950
Big Brother.

116
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,670
Step aside!

117
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,020
Give me an hour.

118
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,020
I'll go beg Lord Chieftain.

119
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,470
Lord Chieftain doesn't like people pleading for traitors.

120
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,070
You'll ruin your own future.

121
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,870
Big Brother,

122
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,150
if I can't even protect

123
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,480
these innocent people,

124
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,520
what's the use of having a bright future?

125
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,790
I only need an hour.

126
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,730
Okay. I'll give you an hour.

127
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,770
But if you can't persuade Chieftain

128
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,800
within an hour,

129
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,580
there will be no need for you to come back.

130
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,910
After all, this won't be a pleasant scene.

131
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,800
Lord Chieftain, I'm Zichuan Xiu. I'm here to see you.

132
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,160
Lord Chieftain,

133
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,670
I'm Zichuan Xiu. I want to see you.

134
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,150
It's Xiu.

135
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,950
Why did you come at this hour?

136
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,850
You are quite diligent.

137
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,790
What's the matter?

138
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,470
Come.

139
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,030
My Lord,

140
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,290
I'm here for the Palace Guards.

141
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,710
Di Lin has passed my order, right?

142
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,070
Is there still any doubt?

143
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,700
All of the Palace Guards

144
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,420
have been staying in the South Camp tonight.

145
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,590
They didn't participate in the rebellion.

146
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,870
My Lord, please spare them.

147
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,920
You are openly disobeying my order.

148
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,350
My Lord, please think twice.

149
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,790
It's a well thought-out plan.

150
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,910
But it's different now.

151
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,210
My Lord, please withdraw your order.

152
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,110
Then the soldiers won't have to die in vain.

153
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,670
Xiu,

154
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,990
you're pleading for the remaining rebels.

155
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,630
Lord Chieftain,

156
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,220
all of the Palace Guards

157
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,730
have been staying in the South Camp tonight.

158
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,420
When they knew Yang Minghua was going to start a rebellion,

159
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,150
they didn't participate in it.

160
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,970
They were... were...

161
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,870
Previously, they were indeed incited by Yang Minghua.

162
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,400
But at the critical moment,

163
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,060
they made the right choice

164
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,820
that Zichuan's soldiers should make.

165
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,940
My Lord, please be benevolent and withdraw your order.

166
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,470
Be benevolent?

167
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,550
Do you know what you just said?

168
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,230
Every word you just said could make you a suspect of treason.

169
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,790
Didn't you think about your own future

170
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,700
before you said this?

171
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,350
If I can't even

172
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,680
save the Palace Guards,

173
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,380
what's the use of having a bright future?

174
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,580
Are you willing to sacrifice the future

175
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,270
between you and Ning for these people?

176
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,900
I want it.

177
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,300
But my future is not important.

178
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,630
Zichuan's future is more important.

179
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,740
You should know your place, Lin He.

180
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,750
You are acting rashly.

181
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,470
Are you arrogant because of the achievements you've made?

182
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,410
Who do you think you are to dictate Zichuan's future?

183
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,160
Zichuan's future

184
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,390
should be built on fairness and justice,

185
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,990
instead of blood and hatred.

186
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,030
If you can spare

187
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,380
those Palace Guards,

188
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,540
they will be grateful to you

189
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,860
and be loyal to Zichuan.

190
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,210
Your insignificant achievements and benevolence

191
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,310
can't win the Palace Guards' loyalty.

192
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,560
You're right. My achievements

193
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,560
are insignificant.

194
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,670
But today... too many people died.

195
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,060
Too many died.

196
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,290
My Lord, please withdraw your order.

197
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,790
My Lord, please withdraw your order.

198
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,300
My Lord, please withdraw your order.

199
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,370
My Lord, please withdraw your order.

200
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,370
My Lord, please withdraw your order.

201
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,600
On behalf of the Palace Guards,

202
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,290
I thank you for your mercy.

203
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,660
This is Lord Chieftain's token.

204
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,780
Di Lin, let them go.

205
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,030
This is Lord Chieftain's token.

206
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,880
Di Lin, let...

207
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,580
Why?

208
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,670
Why did you do this?

209
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,570
It's almost dawn in Zichuan.

210
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,580
The three of us can finally

211
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,850
stand under the sun aboveboard.

212
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,010
Do you remember?

213
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,530
I told you

214
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,540
I don't care about anyone,

215
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,870
except the three of you.

216
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,200
Xiujia,

217
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,070
Si Yilin,

218
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,190
and you.

219
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,180
Where are you going?

220
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,720
Home. I'm going home.

221
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,119
Xiu.

222
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,780
My Lord.

223
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,720
Let's go home.

224
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,310
Go home.

225
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,550
Let's go home.

226
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,650
Leave everything behind.

227
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,780
Xiu!

228
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,430
Lord Xiu, you're finally back.

229
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,800
Everything is fine in the mansion.

230
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,110
My Lady has been waiting for you.

231
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,510
I'm going to tell her now.

232
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,130
Congratulations, My Lord. The situation has been set.

233
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,900
Yang Minghua's accomplices have all been eliminated.

234
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,560
Di Lin is counting the number.

235
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
The Yuanzhou Army has returned to the camp.

236
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,750
Ming Hui and Fang Jing submitted a letter of repentance

237
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,120
to ask for punishment.

238
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,090
Yang Minghua is dead.

239
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,970
We made an example of him.

240
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,660
At the critical moment, the remaining two actually stayed put.

241
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,670
I should reward them.

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,510
Okay.

243
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,930
Lord Ge Yingxing's coffin

244
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,230
is on the way back to Imperial Capital.

245
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,590
You should go back and rest now.

246
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,770
Comfort your family members.

247
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,730
They must have been frightened too.

248
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,610
Thank you, My Lord.

249
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,190
Ancestors,

250
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,310
everything I did

251
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,440
is for the Zichuan family.

252
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,540
My Lord,

253
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,740
now you are Yuanzhou's commander-in-chief.

254
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,940
I used my mentor's life as a stepping stone to my success.

255
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,340
I feel guilty.

256
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,390
But as the saying goes, human beings die in pursuit of wealth, and birds die in pursuit of food.

257
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,900
My Lord,

258
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,030
you will understand me in heaven.

259
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,420
Report!

260
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,070
My Lord, Di Lin betrayed us.

261
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,590
Commander Yang failed in the uprising.

262
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,310
Lin Bing and Luo Bo

263
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,510
are coming at us with the Yuanzhou Army.

264
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,920
Retreat.

265
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,310
Yes.

266
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,750
Shuzhen.

267
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,780
Xiaohu.

268
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,610
Xiao'er.

269
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,490
Shuzhen!

270
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,190
Xiaohu!

271
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,080
Xiao'er!

272
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,100
Xiaohu.

273
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,120
Shuzhen.

274
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,910
Xiao'er.

275
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,880
I asked the men in the kitchen to prepare some food for you.

276
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,050
There are Lotus Leaf Chicken, glutinous rice balls,

277
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,030
and Golden Silk Pancakes.

278
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,510
They are all your favorites.

279
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,090
It's okay if you don't want to eat.

280
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,290
If you feel sleepy,

281
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,920
you can get some sleep first.

282
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,380
If you feel hungry after you wake up,

283
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,260
I'll ask them to make another portion for you.

284
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,300
I'll eat.

285
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,600
Lord Ge... passed away.

286
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,430
Lord Ge was killed by Lei Hong.

287
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,410
His coffin is on its way to Imperial Capital.

288
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,910
Brother Xiu.

289
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,760
My Lord.

290
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,270
My Lord.

291
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,810
Who is it?

292
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,830
Lord Luo.

293
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,830
Lord Luo, what happened?

294
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:26,890
All of my 37 family members were killed.

295
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,630
None of them has a complete body.

296
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,070
Who did it?

297
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,590
Di Lin!

298
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,500
How could it be Di Lin?

299
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,280
I think it was Yang Minghua's personal guards.

300
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,690
Maybe they took revenge amid the chaos.

301
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,310
Impossible.

302
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,850
Why?

303
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,540
All of Yang Minghua's accomplices have been eliminated.

304
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,530
Many people stood against Yang Minghua.

305
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,470
Why me?

306
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,010
My pond has been dyed red by blood.

307
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:02,600
They used blood to write "the ending of rebels" on the wall of the yard.

308
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,460
In the name of eliminating rebels,

309
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,180
the Yuanzhou Army burned houses, killed people, and looted. They caused a bloodbath in Imperial Capital.

310
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,480
Di Lin wants to spread his reputation of being cruel

311
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,290
from Yuanzhou to Imperial Capital.

312
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,390
I must take revenge.

313
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,200
My Lord, please arrest Di Lin

314
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,150
and seek justice for me.

315
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,770
This is all my fault.

316
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,050
You are the person I trust the most.

317
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,610
I'm the only one who knows your identity.

318
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,110
I've never told Di Lin.

319
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,620
That's why this happened today.

320
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,920
My Lord,

321
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Di Lin is domineering and has killed numerous people.

322
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,070
If we let him live,

323
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,630
he will become like Yang Minghua one day.

324
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,780
No. Both you and Di Lin

325
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,990
are my right-hand men.

326
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,970
Luo Minghai,

327
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,890
I just...

328
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,550
I just lost Lord Ge.

329
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,940
If my officials have conflicts

330
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,550
because of personal grudges,

331
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,930
it won't just be my loss.

332
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,360
Zichuan will suffer huge losses.

333
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,380
The consequences will be unimaginable.

334
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,750
In that case,

335
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,300
My Lord, please kill me,

336
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,590
so that I can reunite with my family members as soon as possible.

337
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,210
You can't die.

338
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,330
What should I do if you die?

339
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,750
What about Zichuan?

340
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,590
Think carefully.

341
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,170
You... You are my loyal official.

342
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,400
I will give you an explanation

343
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,490
after the funeral of Lord Ge.

344
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,370
Lord Luo, in order to deal with Yang Minghua,

345
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,780
we've been fighting side by side for many years.

346
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,070
You should trust me.

347
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,190
I promise you in the name of Zichuan.

348
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,800
Please... trust me.

349
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,280
Thank you, My Lord.

350
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,880
Thank you, My Lord.

351
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,790
For Zichuan.

352
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,270
For Zichuan.

353
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,250
Boss. Give me a bowl of noodles.

354
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,380
Okay, wait a minute.

355
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,880
Boss, give me a bowl of noodles.

356
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,360
Okay, wait a minute.

357
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,380
To save you,

358
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,430
I mobilized the Yuanzhou Army.

359
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,750
Now it's time for me to leave.

360
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,210
But you just treat me to this bowl of noodles.

361
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,400
Alright, Master. I get it.

362
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,460
Boss.

363
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,130
Give me a portion of meat.

364
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,330
Sorry, the meat has been sold out today.

365
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,150
Master, it's not that I don't want to spend money.

366
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,270
You are not lucky.

367
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,700
What's the use of making you my disciple?

368
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,900
Looks like

369
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,460
another important officer in Yuanzhou died.

370
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,800
Boss, give me a portion of meat.

371
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,040
Okay, right away.

372
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,060
Give one portion to him too.

373
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,430
Okay.

374
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,730
Bro, I bought you a portion of meat.

375
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,010
You should finish it.

376
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,970
I'm going to eat too.

377
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,740
Master, when you come back,

378
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,470
I'll buy you a portion of meat.

379
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,070
And you should buy me a house.

380
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,070
Deal.

381
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,500
General Ge Yingxing was powerful.

382
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,090
He was a commander of the Zichuan family. It's a pity that he died.

383
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,000
General Yingxing is the eldest son of the Ge family.

384
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,800
They have made contributions to the Zichuan family for three generations.

385
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,940
Commander Ge joined the army when he was seven years old.

386
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,590
When he was 10 years old, he made military achievements.

387
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,790
Everyone in the army and the court admired him.

388
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,400
His political and military achievements are unparalleled.

389
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,880
His character and moral quality make us envious.

390
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,850
He was the pillar of the Zichuan family

391
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,870
and the role model of Zichuan's soldiers.

392
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,000
Unfortunately, this talented man died young.

393
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,000
But his spirit lives on.

394
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,530
He left the mortal world and went to heaven,

395
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,510
making everyone in grief.

396
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,640
There will no longer be

397
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,140
Ge Yingxing in this world.

398
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,410
My Lord.

399
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,750
-My Lord.
-My Lord, the dead can't be brought back to life.

400
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,170
My condolences.

401
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,710
From now on,

402
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't have Ge Yingxing anymore.

403
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,630
Lord Chieftain,

404
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,640
Zichuan is still counting on you to rebuild the family's prestige.

405
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,840
Yuanzhou still needs your protection.

406
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,090
I can't protect Yuanzhou

407
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,210
on my own.

408
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:21,680
Today, we are not just mourning Commander Ge.

409
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,190
We are also mourning thousands of soldiers

410
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,110
who bled in war,

411
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,370
heroes

412
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,580
who risked their lives

413
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,590
for the Zichuan family over the past 1,000 years,

414
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,750
and warriors who sacrificed their lives

415
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,820
to make Zichuan prosperous.

416
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,060
Imperial Capital's prosperity

417
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,550
is thanks to their sacrifices.

418
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,500
Everyone in the Holy Spirit Hall,

419
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:15,130
you will be remembered forever and your heroic spirit lives forever.

420
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,040
Bow.

421
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,550
You will be remembered forever and your heroic spirit lives forever.

422
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,910
Commander Ge.

423
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,000
Zichuan won't forget your achievements.

424
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,190
I, Luo Minghai, will never forget you, my friend.

425
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,490
Lord Ge,

426
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,710
your sacrifice will be etched in history.

427
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,160
The truth will be revealed today.

428
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,020
I've found the murderer who killed Lord Ge.

429
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,800
Lord Luo.

430
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,980
The murderer is

431
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,070
Di Lin!

432
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,350
Lord Luo, this is a funeral. Respect the dead.

433
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,980
If no one knows who killed Lord Ge,

434
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,110
how can we console his soul?

435
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,660
Lord Luo, we all know

436
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,120
Lord Ge was killed by Lei Hong.

437
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,080
That's not true.

438
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,810
On the surface,

439
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,690
Lord Ge indeed fell into Lei Hong's trap.

440
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,070
But have you ever thought

441
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,930
who revealed Lord Ge's whereabouts?

442
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,770
Di Lin, both you and I work for Lord Canxing.

443
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,060
But you revealed Lord Ge's whereabouts

444
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,170
to Lei Hong.

445
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,520
Why did you do that?

446
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,000
I've been open and aboveboard in my life.

447
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,180
I didn't cause Lord Ge's death.

448
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,990
I've never revealed his whereabouts either.

449
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,870
Lord Luo Minghai, if you want to testify against me,

450
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,600
please show us solid evidence.

451
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,720
Don't worry. I've got the evidence.

452
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,480
Di Lin planted a spy around Lord Ge.

453
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,110
I've arrested him.

454
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,400
How are you going to defend yourself?

455
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,600
He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick.

456
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,710
He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick.

457
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,490
Then let's seek justice today.

458
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,600
I thought it is Lord Ge's funeral today.

459
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,530
I didn't expect that Lord Luo

460
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,380
also wants to give me a funeral.

461
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,940
Thank you, My Lord.

462
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,020
In terms of Lord Luo's accusation,

463
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,290
I can accept an investigation now.

464
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,420
But everyone, please don't let your mourning for Lord Ge

465
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,340
get interrupted because of me.

466
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,670
The truth will come to light eventually.

467
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,900
Take him away.

468
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,230
No need for that.

469
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,970
I'm going there to accept an investigation myself.

470
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,060
It's time.

471
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,840
We should bury Commander Ge.

472
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,710
He's gone.

473
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,880
He always complained

474
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,900
I delivered trash to him after winning a battle.

475
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,820
I want to tell him

476
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,240
I still have a lot of trash that hasn't been delivered to him.

477
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,420
Once, he asked me to guard a pass alone.

478
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,840
I was almost beaten to death.

479
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,820
This is the lucky suit I was wearing.

480
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,310
I'll burn it for you.

481
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,960
It's not for keeping you safe, but for keeping you warm.

482
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,670
And this book

483
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,450
was confiscated by him during our training.

484
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,320
I think you really want to read it.

485
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,860
I'll also burn it for you

486
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,540
to relieve your fatigue.

487
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,170
During the seven years in Yuanzhou, the army was short of food.

488
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,490
You wouldn't waste any food.

489
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,050
You said people like you

490
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,050
would suffer losses wherever they are.

491
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,900
Keep this bag of rice well.

492
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,710
Remember to eat when you're hungry.

493
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,500
Now that I've finished the affairs of the dead,

494
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,230
it's time to deal with the living.

495
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,330
Let's go to prison.
