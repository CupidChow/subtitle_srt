[Episode 3]

4
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,840
Could you please tell me what you are doing?

5
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,060
Nothing. Just go on cutting his head.

6
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
I have to really cut his head?

7
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

8
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,540
Go!

9
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,600
Commander Yang, you came at the wrong time.

10
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,320
Lord Canxing is not feeling well after he came back.

11
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,850
I'm afraid he can't see you for the time being.

12
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,320
After all, they were once a family.

13
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,730
I understand that Lord Canxing feels sad.

14
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,440
My Lord.

15
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,840
He's dead?

16
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,340
Some people broke into the execution ground and saved him.

17
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,940
Who?

18
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,200
A whole army.

19
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,340
It's you, Lord Ge.

20
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,200
Commander Yang.

21
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,310
Lord Canxing is sad.

22
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,820
I thought it was because of Zichuan Xiu.

23
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,800
It turns out that it's for the purpose of letting us see each other.

24
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,870
We haven't seen each other for many years.

25
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,470
I've specially brought a gift for you.

26
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,030
Since Yuanxing lived in seclusion and I was stationed in Yuanzhou,

27
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,030
this vintage wine

28
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,070
has been kept in a wooden bucket under the city wall of Wayun.

29
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,130
Although it's only been seven years,

30
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,740
it's been through
wind and frost and brewed with men's efforts.

31
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,380
The wine is very fragrant.

32
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,890
Drinking wine is prohibited during working hours in the Ministry of War.

33
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,150
Besides, the tea in the cup is still warm.

34
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,810
I can't accept your wine.

35
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,140
Alright. I'll tell you my purpose of coming here directly.

36
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,320
Hengchuan may be

37
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,930
a barren place for you.

38
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,530
But for the North Clan,

39
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,440
it's a newly built military stronghold.

40
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,440
Their massive invasion this time

41
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,420
seemed to be conducted for Payi.

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,030
Actually, they did it for Hengchuan.

43
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,150
If Zichuan Xiu hadn't led the army to guard this place determinedly,

44
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,750
I'm afraid Hengchuan would have been occupied by the North Clan.

45
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,590
Zichuan Xiu won a great victory in Hengchuan,

46
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,900
and defended Yuanzhou's line of defense successfully.

47
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,680
He even defended Zichuan's line of defense successfully.

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,790
Why is such a great merit considered as a big mistake?

49
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,580
Lord Ge,

50
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,170
Zichuan Xiu has colluded with people of the North Clan.

51
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,320
The defense deployment map of the North Clan can't be trusted, right?

52
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,320
If we absolve Zichuan Xiu of all blame because of that,

53
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,240
I'm afraid it won't be okay.

54
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,020
No matter when or where it is,

55
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,120
he must be stationed in Hengchuan and mustn't leave there without my secret orders.

56
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
That was an order I gave to Zichuan Xiu seven years ago.

57
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,750
All his actions were arranged by me.

58
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,310
Does it mean that I'm a spy of the North Clan?

59
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,050
Lord Ge, you can't say that.

60
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,310
Zichuan Xiu is your apprentice.

61
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,680
If I had such an apprentice,

62
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,340
in order to save him,

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,530
I would also take out a secret order like this.

64
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,800
But as he's your apprentice,

65
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,990
[No matter when and where it is, you must be stationed in Hengchuan, and mustn't leave there without my orders.]

66
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,070
even if this secret order is real,

67
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,070
it'll still be considered as a fake one.

68
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,420
No one will believe it.

69
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,700
This is not an acceptable reason.

70
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,150
The secret order can be forged,

71
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,210
but this person can't be fake, right?

72
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,940
Now I've taken the daughter of the Divine Emperor of Sairong,

73
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,040
namely, Princess Ka Dan of the North Clan, to the Imperial Capital.

74
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
You can interrogate her carefully.

75
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,910
If you think he has really betrayed his country,

76
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,220
what you think is not true, unless Ka Dan in my barracks is fake!

77
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,430
If Ka Dan is really coming,

78
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,460
the situation will be more serious.

79
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,700
As we all know, Flower of Yuanzhou is a talented and unconventional man.

80
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,920
If these two people collude with each other in the Imperial Capital

81
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,430
and probe into our military affairs,

82
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,030
people of the North Clan will achieve their purpose, won't they?

83
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,960
That's not an acceptable reason, either.

84
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,690
Then let me put it this way.

85
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,070
Right now, there are 300,000 Yuanzhou soldiers

86
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,400
stationed outside the Imperial Capital.

87
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,510
Is this an acceptable reason?

88
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,630
If you use this as a reason,

89
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,320
what a perfect reason it is.

90
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,630
You think so highly of Zichuan Xiu.

91
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,760
He must be a brave and intelligent man.

92
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,490
Was he really the one who killed Ge Sha?

93
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,070
If he had really been able to

94
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,670
kill Ge Sha among 300,000 soldiers,

95
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,560
would he have been tied up and taken to the execution ground by you?

96
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,880
In that case, someone else killed Ge Sha?

97
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,220
Master Zuo Jiaming.

98
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,140
Master Zuo Jiaming?

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Master Zuo Jiaming is just a figure in a legend.

100
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,240
When the whole continent was still ruled by the Lin Family,

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,990
Master Zuo Jiaming could use his own power

102
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,850
to block the attack of millions of strong soldiers of the North Clan.

103
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,800
When all factions tried to seize the power,

104
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,270
he was able to successfully defend the richest land Heqiu for the Lin Family.

105
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,840
It's been 300 years.

106
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,430
He hasn't got old or died.

107
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,210
No one in the world has seen him again.

108
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,550
Even if this Guardian Angel really exists,

109
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,440
he's still an old minister of the Lin Family.

110
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,670
Why did he help Zichuan guard the border

111
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,430
instead of enjoying his happy life in the Lin Family?

112
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,690
Currently, the Lin Family has declined.

113
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,910
The land he protected back then

114
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,810
was Yuanzhou, which belongs to Zichuan now.

115
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,510
Zichuan is a defense line

116
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,590
between the Lin Family and the North Clan.

117
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,500
If Zichuan is occupied by the enemy, the Lin Family will be eliminated.

118
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,600
Besides, if it wasn't Master Zuo Jiaming,

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,110
who would be able to behead the chief general

120
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,510
among 300,000 soldiers?

121
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,870
You're lucky to have seen the swordsmanship of Master Zuo Jiaming.

122
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,710
In that case,

123
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,390
you and Zichuan Xiu knew that Master Zuo Jiaming would kill Ge Sha?

124
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,620
We didn't know that at all.

125
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,700
Only after I saw Ge Sha's tattoo

126
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,970
did I find out that the person who helped us secretly was Master Zuo Jiaming.

127
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,620
Master Ming was willing to help our Yuanzhou Army fight against foreign enemies.

128
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,100
What? Commander Yang.

129
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,370
Is there anything wrong with that?

130
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,780
There's nothing wrong. It's a good thing.

131
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,740
Have you really brought Princess Ka Dan here?

132
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,070
Yes.

133
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,530
The envoy of the North Clan has sent a letter here

134
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,030
to mention the peace talk between the two states again

135
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,830
in exchange for Ka Dan's safety.

136
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,560
Such a happy event

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,800
is worth a drink.

138
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,240
Luckily, Lord Ge arrived in time today.

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,190
Otherwise, we would have been in danger.

140
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,010
You were not on the execution ground.

141
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,610
Where was the danger for you?

142
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,370
You're wrong.

143
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,980
If you and my boss had both died today,

144
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,230
Luo Jie and I would have been executed right on the spot.

145
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,590
Shut up, you two!

146
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,480
Lord Xiu.

147
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,910
Baichuan got hurt because of you.

148
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,870
You should at least carry her on your back for a while to thank her.

149
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,730
Actually, I...

150
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,200
I've just got out of danger after experiencing the risk of death.

151
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,720
How could I carry her on my back?

152
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,530
How shameless!

153
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,820
What a rascal.

154
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,230
Let's go. You're so heavy.

155
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,180
Lord Ge treats us so well.

156
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,700
Even the maids he sent here are so pretty.

157
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
She's not a maid.

158
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,930
Let me introduce her to you.

159
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,540
This is

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,590
the only daughter of the former chieftain, Lord Zichuan Yuanxing.

161
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,470
She's the niece of the current chieftain, Lord Zichuan Canxing.

162
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,830
She is also the first successor to the throne in her family now.

163
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,230
She's Lady Zichuan Ning.

164
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,750
Bow to her now!

165
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,540
-Lady Ning. -Lady Ning.

166
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,660
You must be Luo Jie.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,110
You like drinking.

168
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,630
You can't walk when you see a beauty.

169
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,600
You're Ming Yu.

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,520
You like reading military books, right?

171
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,630
Yes, yes, yes.

172
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,550
You are Baichuan?

173
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,490
You are the dream lover of the warriors in Yuanzhou.

174
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,460
I didn't expect that Lady Ning would know us so well.

175
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,380
Her Highness memorized the information about you guys all night yesterday.

176
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,750
Even I know the dates of your birth as well as

177
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,410
your hobbies and habits well.

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,120
Xiu.

179
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,990
Lord Ge

180
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,530
has helped you clear your names successfully.

181
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,550
I'm here to bring you back to the mansion.

182
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,550
I also want to go back to the mansion.

183
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,050
Luo Jie, let me carry her on my back.

184
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,950
But look.

185
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,480
My good buddy Baichuan is seriously injured now.

186
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,940
I have to take her back to the military camps now.

187
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,020
I can't waste any time.

188
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,410
Otherwise, she'll be paralyzed.

189
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,410
You're seriously injured.

190
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,950
You have to receive treatment at once.

191
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,910
Otherwise, you'll get a scar.

192
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,080
I have the best doctor in my mansion.

193
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,280
There are also personal maids to take care of her.

194
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,020
Let's go.

195
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,790
After I go back tonight,

196
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,940
I'll open two bottles of 15-year-old osmanthus vintage wine for you.

197
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,610
Luo Jie.

198
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,380
Got it!

199
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,620
I'll also give you all my collective-edition military books.

200
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,750
Ming Yu.

201
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,750
Okay.

202
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,720
Let me show you the way.

203
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,570
Let's go.

204
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,710
We agreed to share weal and woe together and show consideration for our superiors.

205
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,950
There's nothing now.

206
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,080
Look.

207
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,220
For the nest which the swallow built when you left back then,

208
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,580
it's full of its descendants now.

209
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,880
I've been away from here for seven years.

210
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
It's still that swallow?

211
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,760
Of course.

212
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,020
A swallow knows to go home. What about you?

213
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,200
I'm back now, right?

214
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,590
Since I

215
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,510
knew that you were coming back to the Imperial Capital,

216
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,770
I've asked the kitchen

217
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,670
to prepare some delicious food every day.

218
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,840
Besides, I've also prepared

219
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,740
the most popular clothes in the Imperial Capital for you.

220
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,770
You can wear them when you are not on duty.

221
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,150
You can wear this set of clothes to walk around

222
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,060
the Imperial Capital with me by that time.

223
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,390
By the way, your room...

224
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,200
I should have followed this bastard closely.

225
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,190
Master. Look at you.

226
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,440
Since you had received my leather underwear,

227
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,200
if you wanted to save me,

228
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,610
why did you have to wait until the last moment?

229
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,770
Weiming just...

230
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,150
I'll stop talking about it.

231
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,390
Only after young people

232
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,390
go through risks of death will they know what's important.

233
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,360
Master,

234
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,230
I've experienced many risks of death in Yuanzhou, haven't I?

235
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,750
I think they're far from enough.

236
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,830
Otherwise, why did you come back to face the danger of death

237
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,270
after you had left?

238
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,910
Because I trust you, right?

239
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,320
Pack your things and go back to Yuanzhou tomorrow.

240
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,070
Are you going back as well?

241
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,810
No.

242
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,830
Then why should I go back?

243
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,850
I have something important to do.

244
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,890
What is it?

245
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,370
The peace talk.

246
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,890
Is it a peace talk with the North Clan?

247
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,200
Then I can't go back.

248
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,810
Yang Minghua wanted to kill me,

249
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,750
but he failed.

250
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,370
You came with such an important mission.

251
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,150
You're just risking your life like me, aren't you?

252
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,610
You started from zero in Yuanzhou seven years ago.

253
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,590
But if you stay in the Imperial Capital now...

254
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,570
What? You want to start from zero again?

255
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,450
I just don't have an official position, status, or connections, do I?

256
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,390
What's there to be afraid of?

257
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,660
You also have no money.

258
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,860
My Lord, bye.

259
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,350
I've thought about it carefully.

260
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,390
Actually,

261
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,940
you can use some of your private money

262
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,220
to help me.

263
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,560
I won't mind.

264
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,690
I don't have private money.

265
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,510
But the Yuanzhou Army which consists of 300,000 soldiers...

266
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,900
Stop. Stop.

267
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,670
You win, Master.

268
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,810
Are you really not leaving?

269
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,320
The peace talk is such an important thing.

270
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,520
Master, you can't work on it without me.

271
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,540
In that case, you'll pay for this meal.

272
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,100
My Lady, it's been seven years.

273
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,540
Every time you're angry with Lord Xiu,

274
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,230
you always want to burn his books.

275
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,560
It's good to burn all these obscene books.

276
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,010
But you have never really burned his books.

277
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,870
That's because he has never really made me so angry.

278
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,770
He had already reached the door, but he suddenly walked away.

279
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,630
Did he know how to respect others?

280
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,660
Maybe he had his reasons.

281
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,030
Don't make excuses for him.

282
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,030
This time,

283
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,630
I won't talk to him even after he comes back.

284
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,870
I'll even make him starve for a week.

285
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,130
I'll also tell my uncle about his bad behavior.

286
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,340
I'll ask him to go back to Yuanzhou and not to come back again.

287
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,650
Lord Xiu, you're back.

288
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,430
Lord Xiu is back.

289
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,609
Why are you looking at me?

290
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,460
Your books are mouldy.

291
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,450
I've taken them out to dry them under the sunshine for you.

292
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,470
Well, have you read these books?

293
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,710
No.

294
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,230
Aren't these all military books?

295
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,110
Yes, they're military books.

296
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,240
Girls can't understand them.

297
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,370
I'll put them away.

298
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,070
Lord Xiu, you had already reached the door.

299
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,460
Why did you walk away?

300
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,520
Mei, Xiu may have his reasons.

301
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,360
Why do you have so many questions?

302
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,190
Go bring Xiu's favorite lamb legs

303
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,960
here now.

304
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,990
My Lady, didn't you just say that you would...

305
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,790
I said...

306
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,640
Go bring the lamb chops for Xiu at once.

307
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,020
Yes.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,750
Then I...

309
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,180
Xiu, you won't leave after you came back this time, right?

310
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,230
Within a short time...

311
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,960
I knew you wouldn't leave.

312
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,470
Take a look at your room.

313
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,870
I...

314
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,590
Come with me.

315
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,070
I...

316
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,470
I hate this pen very much.

317
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,460
He hit me with it when I was a kid.

318
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,660
I didn't expect it to still be here.

319
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,230
I've never allowed others

320
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,570
to come into your room.

321
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,870
Every week,

322
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,550
I cleaned this room by myself.

323
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,110
Then I put these things

324
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,870
back to their original places.

325
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:23,990
I...

326
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,110
I'll go take a look at my unique cloth shoes.

327
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,450
Stop mentioning your stinky shoes. They're here.

328
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,420
They're here.

329
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,690
Every time I put them back there,

330
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,070
even though I washed my hands seven or eight times,

331
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,400
I couldn't get rid of the stink of my hands.

332
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,000
You have a stomachache?

333
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,350
It's been so many years.

334
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,280
Can you change this stupid excuse?

335
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,860
It's not a stomachache. It's a headache.

336
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,680
I must have got sick because of the wind in prison.

337
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,450
I...

338
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,750
Stop pretending.

339
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,360
Come with me.

340
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,530
Where are we going?

341
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,130
Now you are back.

342
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,790
You have to fulfill your promise for the things you've owed to me.

343
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,480
Where are the letters you've owed to me?

344
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,550
I only remember owing others money.

345
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,240
How could I do such a cultural thing

346
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,830
as owing others letters?

347
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,190
You've been in Yuanzhou for seven years.

348
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,710
We agreed to keep in touch by writing letters to each other.

349
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,620
I sent you ten letters, but you only replied with one letter.

350
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,820
I didn't write you many letters indeed.

351
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,070
But I still replied to you, didn't I?

352
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,150
I wrote you some letters.

353
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,430
But when you replied to my letters,

354
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,360
you sent me all those weird things.

355
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,970
A wisp of horse tail hair, some Setaria Viridis

356
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,040
and a feather.

357
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,800
It was even a red feather.

358
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,440
I know that

359
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,970
you just wanted to deceive the enemies with those things.

360
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,630
You were afraid of being discovered by the spies,

361
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,090
so you left those secret signals on purpose.

362
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,380
It was good that you left those signals.

363
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,680
I took those things

364
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,740
and consulted all the experts in the Imperial Capital.

365
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,270
None of them could figure out their meanings.

366
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,260
Tell me. What does it mean?

367
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,380
Only four?

368
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,870
Luo Jie.

369
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,030
You're just feeding me with the food

370
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,320
for domestic animals?

371
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,470
Is it edible?

372
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,330
According to the taxonomy of herbology,

373
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,110
this thing

374
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,090
can remove liver-fire, improve vision, eliminate heat and act as a diuretic.

375
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,030
It suits you the best.

376
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,950
Boss, can you survive or not?

377
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,450
We've been out of food for seven days.

378
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,310
We might starve to death before we lose the war.

379
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,310
It's so unfair.

380
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,330
Xiu.

381
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
This one?

382
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,230
When we were in Yuanzhou,

383
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,640
we were tired of eating roasted lamb and drinking wine.

384
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,890
We used this thing to make pickled vegetables.

385
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,530
It was very delicious.

386
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,480
I was trying to share my life experience with you.

387
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,100
What about this? What does it mean?

388
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,680
My good buddy.

389
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,280
Don't be a war horse in your next life.

390
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,100
Just be a horse for pulling carriages.

391
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,700
Although it's tiring to transport goods every day,

392
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,550
it's better than being a war horse.

393
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,840
Don't you think its hair is very smooth,

394
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,850
and you can use it to make a duster?

395
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,030
When you're free,

396
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,610
you can use it to clean my room.

397
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,170
You still didn't forget to order me around when you were in Yuanzhou.

398
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,100
I owe that to you?

399
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,970
Then what is this?

400
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,990
Its color is very special. I like it very much.

401
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,310
This one?

402
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,520
The girls in Yuanzhou were too enthusiastic.

403
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,190
I was overwhelmed by their enthusiasm.

404
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,660
They would put this feather

405
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,740
on the head of the boy they liked.

406
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,770
You mean that

407
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,450
there were girls who chased you even in Yuanzhou?

408
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,450
I'm known as the Flower of Yuanzhou.

409
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,050
I'm popular among the people.

410
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,820
Wait.

411
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,160
I got it.

412
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,120
You mean that

413
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,180
someone confessed her love to you with this feather.

414
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,900
But you gave it to me.

415
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,230
Xiu, I've told you that

416
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,580
you're such a shy boy who always says things implicitly.

417
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,980
I almost didn't understand what you meant.

418
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,190
Where are you going?

419
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,190
I need to go to see Baichuan.

420
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,120
Someone sent her many feathers.

421
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,560
I need to send them to her.

422
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,170
Don't worry.

423
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,580
I've asked the best doctor

424
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,660
in the Imperial Capital

425
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,080
to take care of Baichuan.

426
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,560
We still have an important thing to do.

427
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,290
I'll start now.

428
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,200
Wait!

429
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,880
It's such an important matter.

430
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,120
Why don't we choose a good day

431
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,520
to play the duet again?

432
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,870
I really have to go to see Baichuan now.

433
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,980
That makes sense. We should choose a good day.

434
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,830
There were too many people yesterday.

435
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,390
I didn't have time to say hello to you.

436
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,200
I'll kowtow to you now.

437
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,230
I miss you.

438
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,310
I'm back.

439
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,400
Lord Canxing.

440
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,100
The North Clan and Zichuan have been at war for many years.

441
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,560
It has wasted both manpower and money, and people have lived a miserable life.

442
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,850
The peace talk can help Zichuan recover.

443
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,360
It'll benefit both the country and the people.

444
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,890
Lord Ge's contribution this time will be beneficial for our future generations.

445
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,320
You have just been transferred to the Imperial Capital, right?

446
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,720
Thank you for your concern.

447
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,650
I've just been transferred from Diwei Province to the Ministry of War.

448
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,670
It seems that you also brought some pastries for Lord Canxing and me.

449
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,330
Do you remember that?

450
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,110
Yes, I remember that.

451
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,180
We all like eating them.

452
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,460
You have a bright future.

453
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,280
As for the peace talk...

454
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,310
I object to it!

455
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,180
The 170,000 Palace Guards

456
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,200
had a military drill for 23 days.

457
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,340
They worked so hard on it day and night without taking a rest.

458
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,370
The soldiers drew bows tens of thousands of times every day

459
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,990
and travelled dozens of kilometers to cross rivers and climb mountains.

460
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,450
Gentlemen, may I ask you what the purpose is?

461
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,330
The purpose is to

462
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,390
expel the North Clan and fight against the Liufeng Family one day

463
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,620
so that our Zichuan Family can quell the turbulence caused by wars in Xichuan.

464
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,300
Have you all forgotten

465
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Lord Yuanxing's great aspiration?

466
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,780
We won the battle in Hengchuan and caught the princess.

467
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,560
These things can't be considered as victories.

468
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,760
In my opinion, the victory of this battle is about momentum.

469
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,030
The soldiers of our Zichuan Family will definitely conquer Sairong City directly

470
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,360
with their strong momentum at one stroke.

471
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,920
On behalf of the 170,000 Palace Guards,

472
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,210
I object to the peace talk.

473
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,140
When the Zichuan Family first started the great cause,

474
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,500
we were at war with the Liufeng Family from the west

475
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,100
for many years, and it was a deadlock at that time.

476
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,180
This situation remained unchanged until Lord Zichuan Yun

477
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,730
saw the value of Yuanzhou

478
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,410
and went deep into Yuanzhou.

479
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,150
Though this land seemed to be barren, it was actually quite vast.

480
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,840
The North Clan is good at fighting in battles.

481
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,000
The Zichuan Family devoted all its members' power

482
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,490
to the great cause for many years, which led to today's situations.

483
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,640
Now Yuanzhou's area

484
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,540
accounts for one third of the entire territory of our family.

485
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,180
But as for the number of our family's people in Yuanzhou,

486
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,360
compared with the local residents,

487
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,930
the Zuoyi Clan, the Orcs,

488
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,030
the Snake Race, the Dragon Race,

489
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,190
the Elves and the Gnomes,

490
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,590
the ratio is only about three to seven.

491
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,690
The reason why

492
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,760
our Zichuan Family could establish a firm foundation in Yuanzhou

493
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,070
was that with the help of our family,

494
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,800
the local people didn't need to

495
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,000
be the slaves of the North Clan anymore.

496
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,600
However, being at war for many years

497
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,170
has made the local people suffer a lot.

498
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,350
If this goes on,

499
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,950
one third of our foundation

500
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,440
will be taken away by the North Clan in the end.

501
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,190
By that time,

502
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,470
Zichuan will lose one third of the area in Yuanzhou.

503
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,890
The Liufeng Family will be unscrupulous and enter Yuanzhou directly.

504
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,990
The North Clan will launch a counterattack at the front side.

505
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,320
Could you please tell me how long your 170,000 Palace Guards can hang in there?

506
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,020
We can't lose any inch of land in Yuanzhou.

507
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,830
Even with all the power in its territory, Zichuan may not be able to defeat the North Clan.

508
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,560
But if all the people in Yuanzhou unite together,

509
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,590
we'll be several times stronger than the North Clan.

510
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,280
I have a stomachache.

511
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,750
Good!

512
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,250
What Lord Ge said is right.

513
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,850
A long time ago, Lord Yuanxing once said that

514
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,240
the foundation of Zichuan's development was in Yuanzhou.

515
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,140
The so-called development

516
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,240
does not only mean occupying its territory,

517
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,920
but it also means making it become a stable and rich place

518
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,180
so that people can live a good life there.

519
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,760
Lord Ge, Lei Xun is just so eager to win.

520
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,090
Please forgive him.

521
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,190
I'm grateful that Lord Lei is devoted to protecting Zichuan.

522
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,670
My attitude towards the peace talk is quite firm.

523
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,700
We must support it.

524
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,750
I also hope that all of you here

525
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,460
can have the same goal and work togehter

526
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,550
to support Lord Ge's peace talk.

527
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,390
Lord Ge.

528
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,170
The future of Zichuan and Yuanzhou

529
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,070
is on your shoulders now.

530
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,160
I won't let you down.

531
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,600
Gentlemen, I have some concerns.

532
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,710
I don't dare to talk about them arbitrarily.

533
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,380
Go ahead.

534
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,130
It's quite difficult to have a peace talk.

535
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,240
The next decades' foundations

536
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,120
will be dependent on this small piece of paper.

537
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,250
A tiny mistake or difference might lead to great losses.

538
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,670
I suggest that

539
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,080
we should set a standard.

540
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,730
What do you think, Lord Ge?

541
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,750
That's what we should do.

542
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,330
How do we set the standard?

543
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,880
What do you suggest, Lord Luo?

544
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,290
We won't let our members marry into their family. They'll have to pay tributes to us every year.

545
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,090
We won't give any city to them. Yuanzhou will only belong to Zichuan.

546
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,350
Okay.

547
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,720
Just do as you said.

548
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,300
Lord Ge.

549
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,030
I'll help you remove all your worries.

550
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,870
I'll make some good arrangements for your student Zichuan Xiu.

551
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,540
Boss.

552
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,239
There's an order from the Chieftain's Mansion.

553
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,360
Okay. Read it.

554
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,040
Aren't you going to stand up and listen?

555
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,540
We're friends. No need to stand on ceremony like that.

556
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,800
Just read it directly.

557
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,120
Just skip the nonsense on it.

558
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,310
In the victory at Hengchuan,

559
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,659
Zichuan Xiu made a contribution by fighting against the North Clan.

560
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,889
Now, according to merits, he and his subordinates will be rewarded.

561
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,690
Lord Xiu is going to be promoted.

562
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,520
Come on. Go on.

563
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,449
Zichuan Xiu is promoted to Deputy Commander of the Ministry of Government Supervision.

564
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,760
The Ministry of Government Supervision? The logistics department?

565
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,680
Boss, you'll have to do chores.

566
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,880
Congratulations, My Lord.

567
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,910
You've changed from a captain in Yuanzhou

568
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,480
to an official doing chores

569
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,480
in the Imperial Capital.

570
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,900
By the way, will my salary be increased?

571
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,550
It's not mentioned here.

572
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,380
Boss, I'm not trying to cause trouble,

573
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,990
but this is like stabbing the flesh with a blunt knife.

574
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,120
He doesn't want you to live a good life.

575
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,570
I think I've recovered.

576
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,660
I can go back to Hengchuan today.

577
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,060
I'll continue to read it.

578
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,070
Baichuan, Luo Jie, and Ming Yu.

579
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,790
These three lieutenants made a contribution by repelling the enemies.

580
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,520
They are promoted to captains.

581
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,940
They'll work in the Ministry of Government Supervision,

582
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,940
and continue to assist Deputy Commander Zichuan Xiu.

583
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,260
You guys...

584
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,270
Why are you leaving?

585
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,250
It's great to be in the Imperial Capital.

586
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,050
We need to go on carrying forward

587
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,740
our friendship as comrades-in-arms in the Imperial Capital.

588
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,250
Boss, the salary is so low.

589
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,360
It was fine in Yuanzhou as we didn't spend much money there.

590
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,830
But this is the Imperial Capital.

591
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,990
We can't survive with such low salaries.

592
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,510
Wait.

593
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,180
Wait.

594
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,770
Listen to me.

595
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,940
We're living in Lady Ning's mansion now.

596
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,630
We don't need to pay for the food and the drinks.

597
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,750
If we save up the money,

598
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,690
maybe we can go back to Yuanzhou to buy a house in a few years.

599
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,500
As for the costs for our recreations in the Imperial Capital...

600
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,760
I'll pay for the costs.

601
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,290
Baichuan.

602
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
I love you.

603
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,100
I have no money.

604
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,780
How is that possible?

605
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,090
You're injured so seriously.

606
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,770
I'm sure you have got a lot of pension for your injury.

607
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,460
I'm sorry.

608
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,640
Ming Yu.

609
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,440
I have money.

610
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,170
Xiu, I have money.

611
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,730
Just say that you love me.

612
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
I remember it now.

613
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,260
Someone in the Imperial Capital owes me money.

614
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,460
I'm going to ask him to return the money.

615
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,620
Lady Ning, I love you.

616
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
My Lord, why did you support Lord Ge?

617
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,020
We won't let our members marry into their family. They'll have to pay tributes to us every year.

618
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,580
We won't give any city to them. Yuanzhou will only belong to Zichuan.

619
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,180
If Lord Ge can achieve these goals,

620
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,710
it will be a good thing for the stability of our Zichuan's foundations

621
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,450
which have lasted for a hundred years.

622
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,820
But if the peace talk is successful,

623
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,080
it'll be Ge Yingxing's credit after all.

624
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,340
It doesn't matter.

625
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,320
It's not easy to have a peace talk.

626
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,320
But destroying the peace talk

627
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,880
can be quite easy.

628
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,420
My elder brother often says that

629
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,630
when he comes home, the most comfortable thing is

630
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,500
to drink a pot of wine and eat two small dishes.

631
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,820
Lord Ge, you've been away

632
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,100
from home for a long time.

633
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,610
Come on, warm your intestines and stomach with hot wine and hot food.

634
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,430
Did you feel unwell

635
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,550
in the imperial court just now?

636
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,170
I'm fine.

637
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,060
It's just that when I saw the two of them refuse to give in to each other,

638
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,170
my heart was beating fast and I felt quite unwell.

639
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,480
But fortunately,

640
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,480
we finally solved the problem well.

641
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,920
Come on.

642
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,570
Have you helped the princess of the North Clan settle down?

643
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,320
Si Yilin worked quite efficiently.

644
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,850
All the prisoners of war have been handed over

645
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,930
to the Royal Escorts for detention.

646
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,140
Our Zichuan Family and the North Clan have been at war for many years.

647
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,970
It's not easy for us to have the chance

648
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,340
of a peace talk today.

649
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,710
It's all due to your mediation.

650
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,990
Not only did you fight against the enemies,

651
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:44,250
but you also needed to overcome many difficulties after you returned to the Imperial Capital.

652
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,720
It was really hard for you.

653
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,010
Lord Yang's support for the peace talk is really out of expectation.

654
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,420
But don't worry, My Lord.

655
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,030
I will take this opportunity to facilitate the peace talk

656
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,290
so that the War Hawks will be speechless.

657
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,500
With you here, I'm relieved.

658
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,240
You are the person my brother trusts the most.

659
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,620
And Yang Minghua, too.

660
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,850
He's a pillar of our country.

661
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,870
It seems that Lord Yang

662
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,620
has handled the political affairs well all these years.

663
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,850
He has been handling all the trivial and important matters.

664
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,910
Let's take this pastry as an example.

665
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,420
He specially asked my servants

666
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,110
to tell me that I could eat only one piece a day.

667
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,560
Because if I eat too much sweet food, I'll feel unwell.

668
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,200
He even interfered in your diet?

669
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,810
I don't think he's just meticulous.

670
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,600
My Lord, as long as the peace talk with the North Clan goes well,

671
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,920
and the situation in Yuanzhou gets stable,

672
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,330
I can go back to the Imperial Capital to stay by your side.

673
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,550
By that time, you don't have to be careful with

674
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,150
and be wary of of everything.

675
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,320
Cheers.

676
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,740
I hope this day will come soon.

677
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,710
Cheers.
