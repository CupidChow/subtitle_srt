00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:42,729
[Episode 4]

4
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,370
According to our agreement,

5
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,910
we'll use a hand-drawn flag as a signal.

6
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,330
We only use the whistle when it's urgent.

7
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,320
You called me here in such a hurry

8
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,630
to ask me to pay back the money?

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,850
Because Si Yilin and I agree

10
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,410
that you won't have a bright future. If you don't pay back the money now,

11
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,350
we won't be able to get the money back in this life.

12
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,790
How is that possible? I just returned to the Imperial Capital.

13
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,120
And now I'm promoted to Deputy Commander.

14
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,079
Of course, I'll have a bright future.

15
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,910
Because you just got transferred back,

16
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,870
you don't know the Imperial Capital

17
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,410
or Yang Minghua.

18
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,190
He's got his hands full in the Imperial Capital.

19
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,870
You're lucky

20
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,100
to survive under him.

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,280
So you spent all your good luck in your life.

22
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,340
Only bad luck is left.

23
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,500
I suggest you to pay us back now.

24
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,610
You poisoned the tea?

25
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,930
Stop pretending.

26
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,460
You haven't sipped the tea.

27
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,530
If you can pretend to be unconscious

28
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,329
until the day Yang Minghua rebels,

29
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,570
when he comes to kill you,

30
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,970
your good luck will come.

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,079
Big Brother, you've been following Yang Minghua for years.

32
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,230
Will he really rebel?

33
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,310
I don't think he will rebel for the time being.

34
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,370
Even if he has 170,000 Palace Guards,

35
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,030
as long as he rebels,

36
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,230
Lord Ge will be able to

37
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,010
crusade against the rebels.

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,950
By then, the Yuanzhou Army will march only for 15 days

39
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,590
to surround the Imperial Capital.

40
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,110
By then, the Imperial Capital will be a lonely city.

41
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,310
He doesn't dare to take the risk.

42
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,910
But Fang Jin's Black Banner Army

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,320
and Ming Hui's Border Appeasement Army are the most changeable.

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,890
If Yang Minghua bribe them,

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,770
when they work together to fight against Lord Ge,

46
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,100
Yang Minghua will have a 70% chance of winning.

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,710
Isn't the peace talk going well?

48
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,240
Commander Yang has agreed.

49
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,910
It's just a superficial agreement.

50
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,829
He blamed everything on Lord Ge.

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,000
If anything goes wrong,

52
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,470
Lord Ge will suffer.

53
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,570
Yang Minghua will try his best

54
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,900
to stop the peace talks.

55
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,680
You're transferred to the Ministry of Government Supervision

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,510
because he wants Lord Ge to be helpless

57
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,570
and to make things difficult for him.

58
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,590
But that I can't do anything

59
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,990
also means I can do anything.

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,240
I'm ready to run amok.

61
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,350
Second Brother.

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,870
I have to take care of the Chieftain.

63
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,710
Big Brother.

64
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,790
Don't forget that I work for Yang Minghua.

65
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,450
Let me do it.

66
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,930
Lady Ning, I don't deserve you

67
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,230
to apply the medicine for me.

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,650
Brother Xiu and you risked your life for Zichuan.

69
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,810
It's nothing that I'm doing.

70
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,720
It's okay. You're welcome.

71
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,030
Miss Baichuan.

72
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,760
What... What do you usually do

73
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,050
when you are together?

74
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,780
Don't worry.

75
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,840
I have nothing to do with your Brother Xiu.

76
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,270
You love Lord Xiu.

77
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,190
Everyone with eyes can see that.

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Brother Xiu is smart, skillful, and elegant.

79
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,670
Those with eyes will fall in love with him.

80
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,330
I can understand that a girl wants to cover it up.

81
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,150
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,790
Lady Ning, you think too much.

83
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,480
Zichuan Xiu

84
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,360
slept during the war.

85
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,270
When the North Clan attacked, he ran away the fastest.

86
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,860
He usually traded cattle and goats

87
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,790
from Yuanzhou with merchants of the North Clan for wine money.

88
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,150
He appreciated plants, caught birds, and enjoyed cricket fighting.

89
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,990
I've been working with him for half a year.

90
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,190
I haven't seen him do anything serious.

91
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,070
I'm not interested in such kind of person.

92
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,400
Has Brother Xiu ever lost a war?

93
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,800
They say that life in Yuanzhou is hard.

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,250
But you can still drink wine in Yuanzhou.

95
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,980
It's all thanks to Brother Xiu.

96
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,830
That's who he is.

97
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,090
Obviously, he is very smart.

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,330
He always pretends

99
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,390
that he doesn't care about anything.

100
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,340
He thinks that others don't know anything.

101
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,210
Actually, I can see

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,660
all his efforts.

103
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,500
Lady Ning. What makes you think Lord Xiu has spent efforts?

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,310
He sent me a lot of things.

105
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,960
Horse mane, dog tail grass, scorpion,

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,250
and feathers.

107
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,110
Anyway,

108
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,820
I know he carefully selected these.

109
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,220
Chestnut horse mane?

110
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,790
It seems Lord Xiu has indeed put in a lot of effort.

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,409
You know this story?

112
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,600
Nothing.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,480
It's just a dead war horse.

114
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,510
Are you okay?

115
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,150
You're going to report to the Ministry of Government Supervision tomorrow.

116
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,010
How about I send you back?

117
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,070
I'm not going back.

118
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,890
I finally came back from the shabby place in Yuanzhou.

119
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,950
Let's go to another place to have fun.

120
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,650
You just don't want to go back to Ning's Mansion.

121
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,030
Ning's Mansion is great.

122
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,110
It's free to eat and sleep. I can take carriages to go everywhere.

123
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,170
You don't know how comfortable it is.

124
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,390
What's wrong?

125
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,400
What do you actually think?

126
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,470
What do you mean?

127
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,340
You know what I'm asking.

128
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,470
Let me put it this way.

129
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,430
Let me tell you a story.

130
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,870
A jerk who is poor and unlucky

131
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,170
falls in love with a rich girl.

132
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:45,510
This jerk thought he had no future.

133
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,070
He wanted this rich girl to give up.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,280
So he gave her

135
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,970
a meaningless dog tail grass.

136
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,900
But this rich girl didn't care at all.

137
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,710
She said the dog tail grass

138
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,880
represents silent contribution

139
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,550
and silent love.

140
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
But this rich girl

141
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,790
isn't someone who dislikes the poor and loves the rich.

142
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,190
Dog tail grass is always dog tail grass.

143
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,870
Even if it's planted in a pot, it won't bloom.

144
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,480
But have you ever thought about it?

145
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,430
Even if the jerk gives up,

146
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,580
will the rich girl give up?

147
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,030
But this rich girl

148
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,419
is not an ordinary rich girl.

149
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,950
She is Zichuan Ning,

150
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,510
the future heir of the Zichuan family.

151
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,710
But what about me?

152
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,180
I've been severely punished.

153
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,550
Besides, I just escaped a disaster.

154
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,470
I don't know what will happen in the future.

155
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,990
Fine.

156
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,530
At least you both love each other.

157
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,150
Look at me.

158
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,790
You?

159
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,440
You

160
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,710
are like a lonely dog.

161
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,540
If you didn't tell the truth,

162
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,600
I would beat you up.

163
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,590
Second Brother, we've said so much.

164
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,510
Why don't we continue drinking?

165
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,960
What wine to drink? Where to drink?

166
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,580
Of course, there is wine.

167
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,870
You stole our sister-in-law's wine again.

168
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,530
You should be glad that I didn't steal her money.

169
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,790
[Ge Shan]

170
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,350
It's a full 0.5 millimeters

171
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,990
shorter than my intended size.

172
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,480
It's not perfect.

173
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,600
Zichuan Xiu is here to report.

174
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,550
You must be Lord Ge Shan, Commander of the Ministry of Government Supervision.

175
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,720
Today...

176
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,230
Stop. Just stand there.

177
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,250
No problem. Today,

178
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,350
I want to discuss with you

179
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,070
about the advance payment of my salary.

180
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,330
Take off your clothes.

181
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,410
Do I need to take off my clothes as soon as we meet?

182
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,310
Take it off.

183
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,670
Although this is our first meeting,

184
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,350
I've long heard that

185
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,000
you are very efficient.

186
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,310
I didn't expect you to be so efficient.

187
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,990
Go on.

188
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,290
Take it off.

189
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,990
Swordswoman, I'll take it off.

190
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,870
You reek of alcohol.

191
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,360
Working in the Ministry of Government Supervision,

192
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,670
you have to be meticulous.

193
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,110
Your image represents

194
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,860
the image of the Zichuan family.

195
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,770
Get out now.

196
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,470
Take a shower and brush your teeth.

197
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,730
Come back to work after getting changed.

198
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,750
You're late today. Your salary will be deducted by half.

199
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,220
Well.

200
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,460
My Lord, I haven't received my salary yet.

201
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,150
Why don't you wait until I get it?

202
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,880
I'll buy you a drink someday...

203
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,450
The envoys of the North Clan will arrive at the Imperial Capital soon.

204
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,910
You will be in charge of all related matters.

205
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,430
Why are you still here?

206
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,300
I'll deduct your...

207
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,430
I'll get lost.

208
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,410
Wait.

209
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,990
Don't drink too much next time. It's bad for your health.

210
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,320
I'll be sad if I don't drink.

211
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,670
Please find a military doctor.

212
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,380
Many of them are seriously injured.

213
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,580
They will die if we don't treat them now.

214
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,650
Please find a military doctor

215
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,760
or ask your superior to see me.

216
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,010
You used to be a princess of the North Clan.

217
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,960
Now,

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,590
you are just a captive of Zichuan.

219
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,270
The North Clan killed thousands of people in Zichuan.

220
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,010
If I find a military doctor for you,

221
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,800
wouldn't that be a betrayal to Zichuan?

222
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,430
On the battlefield, life and death are not in one's hands.

223
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,340
But now we are in the military camp.

224
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,270
The captives have the right to be treated.

225
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,800
Three years ago, my brother

226
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,200
was killed by your North Clan.

227
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,260
Didn't he have the right to live?

228
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,390
I think about revenge every day.

229
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,900
I only hope that the injured soldiers of your North Clan

230
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,960
die earlier.

231
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,710
War is ruthless. Many people have died.

232
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,310
Everyone who died had parents and siblings.

233
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,900
What can change this is to stop killing,

234
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,610
instead of endless revenge.

235
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,100
Princess, I'm fine. Don't beg them.

236
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,710
The wound must be treated.

237
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,750
If the infection continues,

238
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,150
you might lose your life.

239
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,450
If you can't find a military doctor,

240
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,020
at least lend me your sword.

241
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,590
You're a captive.

242
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,700
How could I give you the sword?

243
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,140
For you to kill me?

244
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,440
I swear in the name of the royal family.

245
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,120
I will only use your sword to save people.

246
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,750
No way.

247
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,150
With my position,

248
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,850
even if I am captured,

249
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,260
in your lords' eyes,

250
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,660
I still have some value.

251
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,130
Guess, if I die here,

252
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,670
what responsibility will you bear?

253
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,700
Lend me your sword. I'll only use it to save people.

254
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,010
Guards, take him away.

255
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,550
We just treated the wounds.

256
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,880
Please move them later.

257
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,720
You have too many requests.

258
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,310
Guards!

259
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,090
What are you doing?

260
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,450
How dare you disrespect our princess!

261
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,650
-Do you want to die?
-What are you doing?

262
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,890
What are you doing?

263
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,270
If they had weapons,

264
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,670
I wouldn't blame you.

265
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,830
But they are unarmed captives.

266
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,670
What kind of warrior are you?

267
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,600
Your courage and fearlessness

268
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,560
should be used on the battlefield,

269
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,660
instead of on unarmed captives.

270
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,630
Treat all wounded immediately!

271
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,590
Yes.

272
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,570
Princess Ka Dan, please go back to your room.

273
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,820
I don't need special care.

274
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,850
Please let me eat and live with my people.

275
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,560
Excuse me.

276
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,950
Princess Ka Dan. You may not know

277
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,360
that the envoys of the North Clan have arrived in Zichuan.

278
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,890
The two parties are going to have a peace talk.

279
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,240
So I don't need to tell you the importance

280
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,420
of you and these captives, do I?

281
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,630
Princess Ka Dan, please mind the overall situation.

282
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,280
Okay.

283
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,990
I'll go back.

284
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,310
That's impossible.

285
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,670
Lord Ge.

286
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,130
We've been discussing peace talks in Yuanzhou

287
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,510
[Mu Qi]

288
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,150
for a long time.

289
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,390
We've discussed repeatedly

290
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,310
all the conditions.

291
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,270
Now that I'm in the Imperial Capital,

292
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,579
you suddenly brought up

293
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,440
such an unreasonable condition.

294
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,500
Where is the sincerity of Zichuan?

295
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,740
You know that

296
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,230
Prince Ka Lan has been proactive in this matter

297
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,880
because he knows

298
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,370
the meaning of the peace talk to the North Clan and Zichuan.

299
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,920
But you proposed such a condition.

300
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,340
How would Prince Ka Lan

301
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,790
face the Divine Emperor?

302
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,350
The North Clan occupies three provinces of Yuanzhou.

303
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,030
We made a deal in Yuanzhou

304
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,280
for you to return these three places.

305
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,270
Before you came to the Imperial Capital,

306
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,130
the North Clan instigated the local Orcs to revolt.

307
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,030
You were trying to make us compromise

308
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,750
during the peace talk.

309
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,750
Then you will continue

310
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,430
to occupy these three provinces.

311
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,500
Is that true?

312
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,510
To be honest, I never wanted to bring it up.

313
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,520
To me, I just need to recover them by war.

314
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,470
But now, there is

315
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,240
such a troublesome condition.

316
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,900
I can only put it another way.

317
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,280
We can disregard

318
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,400
the uprising.

319
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
But besides these three provinces,

320
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,650
all the cities of Yuanzhou you occupied

321
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,530
should be returned to Zichuan.

322
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,920
It's just three provinces.

323
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,570
You want to

324
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,600
request for all cities.

325
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,990
Are you refusing to talk?

326
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,150
Try it. The tea production is in Yuanzhou.

327
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,150
Due to the weather,

328
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,510
the processing must be in Zichuan.

329
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,790
The cost has increased a lot.

330
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,870
It should be worth a lot in the North Clan.

331
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,560
We all know that the North Clan is located in the east.

332
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,690
It's always cold and poor in supplies.

333
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,750
The black market in Yuanzhou has been doing this business for a long time.

334
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,550
If the cities of Yuanzhou are returned to Zichuan,

335
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,670
I promise to open up the market of five provinces.

336
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,410
The money it brings to the Divine Emperor

337
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,310
will be much more than the amount of tribute.

338
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,220
Lord Mu Qi, it’s easy to calculate.

339
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,480
Lord Ge, in this peace talk,

340
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,130
Prince Ka Dun also sent an envoy.

341
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,390
All the terms must be discussed

342
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,790
between the two of us

343
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,970
before I can report back to the Divine Emperor.

344
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,340
I know Lu Di is here.

345
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,110
He has been in Yuanzhou for many years.

346
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,800
I've dealt with him before.

347
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,680
If he's willing to talk,

348
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,230
I can persuade him.

349
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,860
Lord Lu Di didn't

350
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,200
refuse to participate in the peace talk.

351
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,100
He's new to the Imperial Capital. He's not used to the new environment.

352
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,860
He has rashes and needs to rest for a few days.

353
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,360
Fine. Let's wait for him for a few days.

354
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,840
I want to work.

355
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,500
Boss, what are you thinking?

356
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,120
He just doesn't want to stay at home

357
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,730
to be served by Lady Ning.

358
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,690
Brother Xiu! Xiu...

359
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,440
Brother Xiu.

360
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,350
What are you going to do today?

361
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,990
I've prepared

362
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,280
horse riding, archery, market tours,

363
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,530
shadow puppets, and storytelling.

364
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,840
If you need,

365
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,300
I can do it by myself.

366
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,950
But I want to work.

367
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,900
I... I have a lot of work at my mansion.

368
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,640
You can accompany to ride a horse, shoot arrows,

369
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,710
go to the market,

370
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,700
watch shadow puppets and listen to stories.

371
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,770
As for the salary,

372
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,930
how about I will pay you according to the standard of the Deputy Commander?

373
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,750
No, I will preserve my ambitions although destitute.

374
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,650
I can't make money by selling myself out.

375
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,300
No, I'd better go back to the Ministry of Government Supervision to do errands.

376
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,770
The Ministry of Government Supervision?

377
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,030
It's not impossible.

378
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,630
Mei.

379
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,530
Go find two people

380
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,700
to change my room

381
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,340
into the Ministry of Government Supervision.

382
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,890
That way, Brother Xiu

383
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,230
can do whatever

384
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,300
he wants there.

385
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,090
No. Don't.

386
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,540
Boss, the Ministry of Government Supervision's order is here.

387
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,340
Do they want me to work tomorrow?

388
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,770
Tell me the good news.

389
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,280
The North Clan's envoy, Lu Di's rash has recovered.

390
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,990
He can participate in the peace talk tomorrow.

391
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,780
He never showed up.

392
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,720
Now that he's recovered suddenly.

393
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,550
What is he up to?

394
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,490
Brother Xiu, if you don't want to go...

395
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,080
I do.

396
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,270
Hurry.

397
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,830
I'm moving to the Ministry of Government Supervision tonight

398
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,960
to prepare for tomorrow's peace talk.

399
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,040
Lord Ge has

400
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,550
a special order for you.

401
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,590
You must supervise all matters

402
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,630
in the peace talk tomorrow,

403
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,720
including serving tea

404
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,350
and hot water.

405
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,670
Which Lord Ge has gone too far?

406
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,830
Two lords surnamed Ge.

407
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,450
It seems that both of them think highly of me.

408
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,630
Yes.

409
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,650
Goods in our store are all tailor-made

410
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,890
and finely tailored.

411
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,510
Slow down.

412
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
I want to see the streets of Zichuan.

413
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,470
It can leave fragrance in your mouth.

414
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,470
Don't miss

415
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,300
our snacks.

416
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Come and have a look.

417
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,990
These are all craftsmanship from the Lin family.

418
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,830
Sir, please enjoy the tea before you go.

419
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,510
Come in, please.

420
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,230
I'm thirsty. Stop at the tea shop.

421
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,380
Lord Lu Di will be here today.

422
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,790
Please wait a little longer. He should be here soon.

423
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,630
No hurry.

424
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,020
Lord Lu Di is here.

425
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,060
You're finally here. Have a seat.

426
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,150
The roads in Zichuan are rough,

427
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,870
not smooth at all.

428
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,030
There were so many people, causing a serious traffic jam.

429
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,480
[Lu Di]

430
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,240
The weather in Zichuan

431
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,550
caused rashes.

432
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,220
How can I drink tea with rashes?

433
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,270
Lord Ge.

434
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,560
I didn't expect you and I

435
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,510
to have the chance to sit and talk like this today.

436
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,440
Today, we sit opposite to each other for peace talks,

437
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,050
not for chatting.

438
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,390
That's true.

439
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,880
But when I met you before,

440
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,070
we alway fought each other.

441
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,790
The situation today

442
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,430
is really unfamiliar.

443
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,510
What?

444
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,810
Do you want me to put on my armor first?

445
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,950
No need.

446
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,540
But I feel that everything goes wrong

447
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,640
without a competition with you.

448
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,990
Lord Ge.

449
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,120
Both of us were in Yuanzhou.

450
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,570
Would you like to compete with me on the Yuanzhou-style drum beat?

451
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,210
Lu Di, we are here for peace talks.

452
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,350
Lord Lu Di is a general.

453
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,150
Lord Ge. Don't mind.

454
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,470
It's okay. I'm a general too.

455
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,900
I understand Lord Lu Di's request.

456
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,320
On the battlefield,

457
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,320
we won't yield when it comes to the land of Zichuan.

458
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,150
It's the same here.

459
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,800
Lord Lu Di, please.

460
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,390
Lord Lu Di.

461
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,180
Please.

462
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:34,720
Please.

463
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,520
You haven't shown up for a long time and have rashes.

464
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,980
Why do you want to fight as soon as you show up?

465
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,030
Ge Yingxing has great achievements

466
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,750
and is famous in Yuanchao.

467
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,520
But for today's peace talk,

468
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,640
I must destroy his prestige first

469
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,030
to take the initiative.

470
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,290
The physical pain today can be exchanged

471
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,900
for tomorrow's peace.

472
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,680
Lord Ge. You're devoting yourself to Zichuan

473
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,810
and doing your utmost until your de...

474
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,500
How could you die?

475
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,220
Lord Ge, please.

476
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,790
What did you say? Nonsense!

477
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,950
You're just a logistics staff.

478
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,810
How can you compete with Lord Lu Di of the North Clan?

479
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,150
I...

480
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,950
Why are you looking at me?

481
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,670
Even if you kneel down for a long time, it's not allowed.

482
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,550
Lord Ge, you are the supreme commander of Yuanzhou.

483
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,930
You are a mastermind.

484
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,730
How can you participate in

485
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,660
such a low-level competition?

486
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,450
If you don’t allow me to participate,

487
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,840
I will...

488
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,880
I'll kill myself.

489
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,470
Wait.

490
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,750
Lord Lu Di.

491
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,170
This young man

492
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,920
is just doing something to serve people.

493
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,150
He doesn't deserve to fight you.

494
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,910
But he was eager to fight.

495
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,070
I couldn't refuse him.

496
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,280
How about...

497
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,070
Nonsense!

498
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,480
I am the general of the 11th army of the kingdom...

499
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,470
General Lu Di

500
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,030
won't be afraid of a man who serves tea.

501
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,790
We absolutely believe that.

502
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,820
Lord Lu Di.

503
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,020
Are you afraid of me?

504
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,290
Since Lord Ge doesn't want to fight in person,

505
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,020
I don't have to show any mercy.

506
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,930
I'll beat you to death.

507
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,810
Lord Ge, I will always respect you.

508
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,920
I'll respect you until the day I die.

509
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,270
Come on. Relax your muscles.

510
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,690
Keep pace.

511
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,560
Don't be nervous. Don't rush.

512
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,290
Don't confront him directly. Safety goes first.

513
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,930
Kid.

514
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,470
This is a game in Yuanzhou.

515
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,770
Let me make it clear.

516
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,330
As long as you can hit my drum,

517
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,070
you win.

518
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
Time starts.

519
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,010
Lu Di

520
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,490
is brave and skilled in battle, and his punches are deadly.

521
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,790
This young man will suffer.

522
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,600
It's okay. He's a tough guy.

523
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
Don't hit my face.

524
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,930
I need it to make money.

525
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,680
You can't even hit my stomach.

526
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,000
I need it to make money.

527
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,570
Lu Di is born strong.

528
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,630
I'm afraid the kid can't withstand his punch.

529
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,520
It's fine. He can dodge.

530
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,240
You can't hit my ribs, either.

531
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,300
I need them to make money.

532
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,510
Brat. You make money from every one of your body parts.

533
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,510
Are you selling out yourself?

534
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,510
You're right.

535
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,630
And the price is low and there's no compensation.

536
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,260
Don't move. Am I miserable?

537
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,940
Let me cry quietly for a while.

538
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,200
Lord Lu Di is good at attacking.

539
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,690
His speed is one of the best in the North Clan.

540
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,030
This young man

541
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,000
shouldn't have angered the tiger.

542
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,230
He is also one of the best

543
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,550
in terms of escaping.

544
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,270
As expected.

545
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,020
Wait.

546
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,910
Lord Lu, did you ring the drum yourself?

547
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,360
Lord Ge, Lord Lu is magnanimous.

548
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,470
He let me win.

549
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,040
Lord Lu is sincere in his desire for peace talks.

550
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,030
I am very grateful.

551
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,500
Why don't we start now?

552
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,760
Thank you.

553
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,230
Thank you.

554
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:38,990
Thank you.

555
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,530
What's wrong with you?

556
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,840
What's wrong with you?

557
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,140
The specific details of returning the Yuanzhou provinces

558
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,940
are included in the attachment.

559
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,490
If the peace talks can be reached,

560
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,080
we'll stop the war for half a year and discuss more matters.

561
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,620
Lord Mu Qi.

562
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,230
I don't think the terms are sincere.

563
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,700
All the terms are still under discussion.

564
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,290
If you think it's inappropriate,

565
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,460
you can tell me.

566
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,190
Let's discuss it together.

567
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,290
I don't care about anything else.

568
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,620
There's only one thing.

569
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,860
They should return the princess before the peace talk.

570
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,560
Lord Lu Di, there is an agreement in the treaty.

571
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,700
When the treaty is being signed,

572
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,440
Zichuan and the North Clan will return all the captives.

573
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,940
Her Highness is different from other captives.

574
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,830
Since our delegation has arrived in the Imperial Capital,

575
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,870
Zichuan should return the princess immediately.

576
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,510
I will protect her.

577
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,330
If we return the princess,

578
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,310
and you break the agreement,

579
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,120
what should I do?

580
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,100
Although we're taking care of the princess,

581
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,740
she's a hostage. If we return her easily,

582
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,210
it's like we cut off my own limbs,

583
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,350
which will make peace talks more difficult.

584
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,210
The Divine Emperor loves his youngest daughter.

585
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,810
If you don't return her soon,

586
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,950
I'm afraid the Divine Emperor will be furious.

587
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,750
The peace talk will turn into a declaration of war.

588
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,030
I've fought with you in Yuanzhou for decades.

589
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,010
Am I still afraid of war?

590
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,780
You are the ones who are defeated.

591
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,190
You lost the princess.

592
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,800
It was you who came to the Imperial Capital.

593
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,670
Whether you want to talk or not, please think about it.

594
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,320
Guys,

595
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,750
please calm down.

596
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,530
The timing of returning the princess is also important.

597
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,510
Lord Ge. Please understand.

598
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,510
Although we are devoted,

599
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,340
we are indeed worried about the princess.

600
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,040
Lord Lu Di.

601
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,820
Lord Ge didn't mean to make things difficult for us.

602
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,110
He just wants the peace talk to go smoothly.

603
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,150
How about this?

604
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,390
Let's set the terms for the peace talk today.

605
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,820
Let's invite Princess Ka Dan to come to the scene tomorrow

606
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,680
to witness the beginning of diplomatic relations. What do you think?

607
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,790
When the peace agreement is signed, we will return the captives and the princess.

608
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,400
That's how it should be.

609
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,180
Lord Lu Di.

610
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,530
If they can return the princess tomorrow,

611
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,470
I won't have any objections.

612
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,200
Okay.

613
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,030
Lord Ge, let's discuss the terms.

614
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:11,719
Okay.

615
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,000
I still need

616
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,690
three more types of weapons

617
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,590
to complete my set.

618
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:24,350
Most of this set of weapons have been lost.

619
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,150
You forge a whole set.

620
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,500
It's a great achievement.

621
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,780
It's just my hobby. They're just small toys.

622
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,800
Lord Ge's peace talks

623
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,350
are a great achievements for future generations.

624
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,960
Lord Ge suggested to open mutual trade.

625
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,139
As for the return of the provinces of Yuanzhou,

626
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,670
the North Clan also agreed.

627
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,400
It seems that the peace talk is guaranteed.

628
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,070
A great deal. Lord Ge is farsighted.

629
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,600
But the process is very difficult.

630
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,910
The Envoy of the North Clan, Lu Di, refused to show up.

631
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,040
They finally sat down for peace talks,

632
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,280
but Lu Di always made things difficult and provoked us.

633
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,360
Peace talks are not easy.

634
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,980
I've arranged men

635
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,790
to keep an eye on the envoys of the North Clan

636
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,380
in case something unexpected happens at a critical moment.

637
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,630
Something unexpected?

638
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,000
That should be the case.

639
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,800
Today,

640
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,110
they argued about the return

641
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,010
of the Princess of the North Clan.

642
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,470
Time's up.

643
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,760
In that case,

644
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,990
you should

645
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,790
be extra careful of the safety of the princess.

646
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,870
Yes.

647
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Comfortable.

648
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,730
Here.

649
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,750
Master.

650
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,370
Come on.

651
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,160
The physical pain today can be exchanged

652
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,000
for tomorrow's peace.

653
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,580
Xiu, you did your utmost for Zichuan until your de...

654
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,940
I'm not dead yet.

655
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,760
Of course, you can't die.

656
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,280
I have a small task for you.

657
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,670
You just need to protect Princess Ka Dan tonight.

658
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,940
Get up.

659
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,750
Just?

660
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,200
If Princess Ka Dan

661
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,830
arrives at the negotiation site tomorrow,

662
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,520
the peace talk will be a success, right?

663
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,270
If someone wants to ruin it,

664
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,080
they'll definitely take action tonight.

665
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,520
Lord Ge, it's just a small task.

666
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,940
Master.

667
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,780
My salary

668
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,310
is not worth me risking my life.

669
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,170
If it's done, I'll apply for a salary promotion for you.

670
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,040
You'll think about it after it's done?

671
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,730
And you still need to apply for it?

672
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,110
Lord Ge, you're so stingy.

673
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,870
Yang Minghua found many excuses

674
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,070
to stop the peace talks. I didn't agree.

675
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,770
Although the War Prisoner Camp is guarded by Si Yilin,

676
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,680
the hidden arrow is hard to defend against.

677
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,940
Go to War Prisoner Camp

678
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,210
to cooperate with Si Yilin.

679
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,840
Got it.

680
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,790
Master. If you are willing to offer some condolences,

681
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,350
I think...

682
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,950
Okay.

683
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,630
Thank you.

684
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,530
You're welcome, Master.

685
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,720
Thank you.

686
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:03,830
Money.

687
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,020
Thank you.

688
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,190
I want money.

689
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,820
Listen.

690
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,410
Remember your duty.

691
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,590
You can only receive one gift.

692
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,880
Take the rest back.

693
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,470
Lord Ge finally gave me money.

694
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,770
I have to save it.

695
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,650
This is really childish.

696
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,070
I know.

697
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,210
But our boss can't lose his face.

698
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,670
But he is really stupid.

699
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,770
Stop it.

700
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,940
Si Yilin can't wait.

701
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,070
Let's go!

702
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,710
That way.

703
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,710
Thank you.

704
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,780
Thank you.

705
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,510
Thank you.

706
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,260
Thank you.

707
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,470
Thank you, Bro.

708
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,840
Thank you.

709
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,330
Hello, everyone.

710
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,360
What are you doing here, Xiu?

711
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,530
Here's the thing.

712
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,950
The Ministry of Government Supervision

713
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,780
is holding an event to console the captives.

714
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,060
We brought you some gifts.

715
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,620
It must be someone's birthday today.

716
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,840
It's your birthday then.

717
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,870
Today is not my birth...

718
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,070
Shut up. Do you want a gift?

719
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,070
Yes.

720
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,740
That's it!

721
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,350
Luo Jie.

722
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,320
Here you are.

723
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,900
Look.

724
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,020
To celebrate your birthday,

725
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,720
everyone here will have a share.

726
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,670
Go to Miss Baichuan

727
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,950
to report your name,

728
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,050
then you can get a delicate gift.

729
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,760
Everyone, go to Baichuan to register.

730
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,670
Come.

731
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,220
Go.

732
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,710
This way.

733
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,390
One by one.

734
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,080
Take it.

735
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,670
Here.

736
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,320
Thank you.

737
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,720
Thank you.

738
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,470
All of you will have one.

739
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,380
Okay, what's your name?

740
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,860
Mine.

741
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,750
Mine.

742
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,430
Happy birthday.

743
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,030
Thank you.

744
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,290
Princess Ka Dan.

745
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,610
Don't you dare offend Her Highness again!

746
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,840
Calm down.

747
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,650
Calm down.

748
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,790
Princess Ka Dan.

749
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,350
Actually, I've turned over a new leaf.

750
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,560
No. I shouldn't have put it this way.

751
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,430
I've never been that kind of person.

752
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm not that kind of person.

753
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,830
Everyone has a share.

754
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,090
Here, yours.

755
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,060
Here.

756
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,120
I understand what you meant that day.

757
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,130
Princess Ka Dan, I'm glad you understand.

758
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,920
Actually,

759
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,550
I have many strengths.

760
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,370
Who...

761
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,300
Princess.

762
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,060
I'll talk to you later.

763
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,570
Second Brother.

764
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,170
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

765
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,250
What is it?

766
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,270
Are there any newcomers in the War Prisoner Camp?
