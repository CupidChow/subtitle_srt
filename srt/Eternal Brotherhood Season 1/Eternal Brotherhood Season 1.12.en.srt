[Episode 12]

4
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,050
I'll be useless to him.

5
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,870
And that's not all.

6
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,060
Without Yang Minghua,

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,970
I would become a threat to him.

8
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,610
He can't take away my military power

9
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,250
or ruin my prestige.

10
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,880
He is not as capable as me either.

11
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,430
Lord Ge, Zichuan is lucky to have you.

12
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,979
I...

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,160
have to die.

14
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,480
My Lord, please leave now.

15
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,700
My Lord, please leave now.

16
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,290
Get up. Come on.

17
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,470
Let's leave together.

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,090
The terrain down the mountain is complicated.

19
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,610
We need to help each other to get out of here.

20
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,280
After you go down the mountain,

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,940
I'll give you a personal item.

22
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,140
You go back to report.

23
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,660
I'll travel around the world.

24
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,520
My Lord, are you serious?

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm old.

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,870
I should rest.

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,810
After you report to him,

28
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,650
come to me if you want.

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,490
The rope is not long enough.

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,600
I'll secure one end. You go down first.

31
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
After you go down,

32
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,930
find the next location to secure the rope.

33
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,460
And I'll go down to meet you.

34
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,050
In this way, Lei Hong

35
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,760
would think I've vanished into thin air.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,530
Go.

37
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,500
After I secure the rope,

38
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
I will pull the rope three times.

39
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,500
My Lord, please come down quickly.

40
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:31,930
Go.

41
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,980
My Lord.

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,460
If Zichuan Xiu comes to you in the future,

43
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,570
you must tell him

44
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,440
Zichuan is the most important.

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,820
My Lord!

46
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,720
Stay alive.

47
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,800
You must tell him this.

48
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,960
Zichuan is the most important.

49
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,240
Protect Imperial Capital.

50
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,140
Sorry to have startled you.

51
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,990
It was an emergency.

52
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,650
Please put up with it.

53
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,760
I brought you some food.

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,680
Well...

55
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,750
What food?

56
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,260
Everyone, please enjoy.

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,340
Take them away.

58
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,630
My Lord, this is the liquor you asked for.

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,140
The Palace Guards have entered the city in batches.

60
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,690
The curfew will be imposed in advance tonight.

61
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,350
I've also informed Zichuan Xiu of what happened to Lord Ge.

62
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,670
I'm sure he's in a mess right now.

63
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,010
They delivered a message to me at this time.

64
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,050
Maybe the message is not true.

65
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,580
But in order to send me away,

66
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,290
it could be true.

67
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,250
The message is true.

68
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,570
But don't worry.

69
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,600
When I was in Yuanzhou,

70
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,060
I already figured out a way to inform Lord Ge.

71
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,560
Maybe he can't tell if it's true for now,

72
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,290
but at least he can be prepared.

73
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,650
Ge Yingxing and Yuanzhou's soldiers

74
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,440
have been together for years.

75
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,860
Everyone around him

76
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,630
is loyal to him.

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,760
He is also sincere to them.

78
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,470
This news

79
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,270
indeed is a blow to him.

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,220
I've experienced

81
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,250
this kind of feeling.

82
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,210
Lei Hong is self-important and doesn't want to be an ordinary person.

83
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,270
His weakness is power.

84
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,910
Lord Ge treats his men like family members.

85
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,290
His weakness

86
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,220
is that he trusts people around him too much.

87
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,640
I also trusted the people around me.

88
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,790
But luckily, I woke up to the reality before it was too late.

89
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,850
Trust can help you win people's hearts. It can also make you lose everything.

90
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,780
Now, the surname of Zichuan

91
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,830
has become the weakness of Zichuan.

92
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,960
When Imperial Capital is under curfew

93
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
and Lei Xun and the Palace Guards assemble,

94
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,130
we can take action.

95
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,130
Once Yang Minghua succeeds in the rebellion,

96
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,890
the Three Central Offices will definitely

97
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,210
make perfect excuses for him to replace Chieftain.

98
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,850
I think Fang Jing of the Black Banner Army

99
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,330
and Ming Hui of the Border Appeasement Army

100
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,930
have been controlled by him.

101
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,840
Once the riot starts in Imperial Capital,

102
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,170
Lei Xun's Palace Guards

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,510
can enter the city armed openly.

104
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,580
In fact, they are here to deal with the Royal Escorts.

105
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,400
My mission is to wait for Lord Ge outside the city.

106
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,740
Lord Ge's Yuanzhou Army

107
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,720
is now dealing with North Clan.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
So Yang Minghua knew

109
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,540
Lord Ge would come back without soldiers.

110
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,170
He is Lord Ge.

111
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,210
Of course he has other plans.

112
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,560
That's why Yang Minghua asked Lei Hong to stay with Lord Ge

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,480
and asked me to wait for Lord Ge outside the city,

114
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,890
just to prevent Lord Ge from carrying out other plans.

115
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,880
He's so wicked.

116
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,370
Big Brother.

117
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,900
But I have another mission.

118
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,380
Once I confirm Lord Ge is dead,

119
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,890
I should blow the horn immediately.

120
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,200
The horn you blow

121
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,150
is the signal for his next move.

122
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,440
That's right. Then they'll have nothing to worry about.

123
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,680
If Lord Ge brings soldiers back,

124
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,440
they'll accuse you of guiding him into the city

125
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,220
to fight against the Palace Guards.

126
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,320
But there is also Xiao Long's Military Inspection Team.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,900
Then the Palace Guards...

128
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,740
How about...

129
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,310
Making a bet?

130
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,760
Do you have enough stakes?

131
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,410
Of course.

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,810
Here comes my stake.

133
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,130
Big Brother, Third Brother.

134
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,120
Can you really cure him?

135
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,160
Don't worry, Third Master.

136
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,440
This is what I'm good at.

137
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,810
Big Brother, you said when Yang Minghua winked at you,

138
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,160
you pretended that you couldn't understand.

139
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,170
You could have just poked him

140
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,950
on his butt or thigh.

141
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,130
Why did you have to...

142
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,030
I

143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,680
just can't stand people saying Big Brother is cold-blooded.

144
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,580
I don't care.

145
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,210
I don't care about anyone,

146
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,130
except you two and Xiujia.

147
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,930
Under the order of the Ministry of War,

148
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,610
the city will be under curfew from 9 p.m. tonight.

149
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,140
Anyone who disobeys the order will be killed.

150
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,640
The Palace Guards are going to close the city gate.

151
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,370
We'll take action at that time.

152
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,160
Looks like Imperial Capital

153
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,050
will have a bloody night today.

154
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,410
The righteous army will definitely win.

155
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,410
Then whose blood

156
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,830
will dye Imperial Capital's roads red?

157
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,080
It won't be mine.

158
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,650
How's the personnel deployment?

159
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,110
Ge Xin's army has assembled.

160
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,370
Mi Haiyi's army has assembled.

161
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,030
An Ning's army has assembled.

162
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,760
Tell all the officials above the lieutenant

163
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,290
to gather at the South Camp.

164
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,280
When they are ready in Imperial Capital,

165
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,850
I will give the final order.

166
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:03,730
Okay.

167
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,840
Okay.

168
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,470
My Lord, you must be tired

169
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,590
from the long journey these days.

170
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,190
You've worked hard for me for many years.

171
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,610
Thank you so much.

172
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,270
It was my duty.

173
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,490
My Lord, I want to ask you a question.

174
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,960
When did you know

175
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,040
that I've become Yang Minghua's man?

176
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,010
I know,

177
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,160
but I don't want to believe it.

178
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,440
We have different perspectives.

179
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,040
My Lord, I had no choice.

180
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,450
I understand.

181
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,610
Thank you for your forgiveness.

182
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:20,970
My Lord,

183
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,890
I'm here to take your life.

184
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,620
Do you have any last words?

185
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,490
You can't kill me.

186
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,890
You are not the one taking my life.

187
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,150
I don't understand what you mean.

188
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,270
Do you have another way out?

189
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,190
Of course.

190
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,440
But...

191
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,830
there's no point for me to live.

192
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,690
I understand.

193
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,460
He doesn't need me anymore.

194
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,140
Zichuan doesn't need me anymore either.

195
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,420
Since you're here to kill me,

196
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,930
execute the military order!

197
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,250
I've fought with you in Yuanzhou for decades.

198
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,040
Am I afraid of wars?

199
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,140
As for the negotiation, everyone, think twice.

200
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,260
We should never lose a single inch

201
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,750
of Yuanzhou's land.

202
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,710
Help Big Brother protect the state.

203
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,140
With you here, of course I'm relieved.

204
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,230
Lord Ge, take care.

205
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm leaving.

206
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,890
Master, when you come back,

207
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,640
I'll buy a serving of meat for you.

208
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,040
You should buy me a house.

209
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,320
It's a beautiful state.

210
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,230
Zichuan,

211
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,490
goodbye!

212
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,970
Release!

213
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,330
My Lord, the medicine is ready.

214
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,970
Pour it away.

215
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,490
Okay.

216
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,330
Lord Lei.

217
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,850
Di Lin,

218
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,350
what time is it now?

219
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,750
You should get back to your business.

220
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,240
After tonight,

221
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,890
you will be the commander-in-chief.

222
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,970
So today, I'm here

223
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,300
to apologize to you and congratulate you.

224
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,820
It's still too early to say this.

225
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,110
I'm here today with great sincerity.

226
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,400
I even brought the items I obtained in Yuanzhou

227
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
during the battle with North Clan.

228
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,130
I'm giving them to you.

229
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,550
Di Lin, let me make this clear.

230
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,620
I really can't accept things

231
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,530
like gold or silver.

232
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,750
My Lord, even if I have no taste,

233
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,300
I can't make things difficult for you, right?

234
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,790
You... This...

235
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,339
Zichuan Xiu.

236
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,349
Si Yilin.

237
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,119
You guys...

238
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
It went well.

239
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,330
The city is going to be under curfew now.

240
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,840
I'll protect Lord Chieftain and Princess Ning.

241
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,570
I'm going to leave the city now.

242
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,090
Big Brother, when I take control of the Palace Guards,

243
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,350
I'll give you a signal.

244
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,850
When you see

245
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,490
three beams of white light on the city tower,

246
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,770
enter the city with your soldiers to arrest the rebels.

247
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,630
I'll ask someone to blow the horn.

248
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
Yang Minghua will think that it's done.

249
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,100
Then he'll let his guard down.

250
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,630
The curfew started a while ago.

251
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,610
Why hasn't the commander given the order yet?

252
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,140
It's been almost two hours.

253
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,810
Good evening, guys.

254
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,570
Hurry up.

255
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,170
I brought you

256
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:41,770
the most delicious food in Imperial Capital.

257
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,930
Zichuan Xiu, what are you doing?

258
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,750
I'm here to reward the soldiers.

259
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,990
I brought these to comfort you.

260
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,210
What do you want?

261
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,750
How did you get in? Where are the guards?

262
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,630
Me?

263
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
See for yourself.

264
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,010
Why do you have the commander's tally?

265
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,180
Is it authentic?

266
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,650
It should be authentic.

267
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,950
Impossible.

268
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,680
Let's sort it out.

269
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,260
There was a riot at the princess's birthday party today.

270
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,720
Lord Lei asked us to send troops into the city to quell the disturbances.

271
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,050
Lord Lei asked the Palace Guards

272
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,320
to be armed and stand by.

273
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,210
Who knows what will happen tonight?

274
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,170
But...

275
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,150
But what?

276
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,130
Quelling disturbances and starting a rebellion are two different things.

277
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,060
What do you mean?

278
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,140
You should understand us.

279
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,170
We've been waiting

280
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,690
almost two hours here.

281
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,920
Commander Lei still hasn't shown up.

282
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,110
Instead, Zichuan Xiu came.

283
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,490
This is not normal.

284
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,550
Here, drink it and warm ourselves up.

285
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:06,830
Bottoms up.

286
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,860
Who allowed you to drink wine?

287
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,810
Commander Lei is not here.

288
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,210
I have the final say here.

289
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,840
Deputy Commander Ge,

290
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,410
don't I have a say even though you're here?

291
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,140
I think you and I have the same rank.

292
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,690
Both of us are deputy commanders.

293
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,920
I think I'm more qualified.

294
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:26,570
You...

295
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,630
Lord Ge Xin,

296
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,160
are you going to ignore the commander's tally?

297
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,130
Why don't we... wait and see?

298
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:46,860
Nonsense!

299
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,030
This is a great opportunity.

300
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,230
Do you want to miss it?

301
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,040
The situation is unclear.

302
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,060
Acting rashly is like suicide.

303
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,860
In that case, fine.

304
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,000
I have nearly 50,000 men.

305
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,990
I can still control the overall situation.

306
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,620
Goodbye.

307
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,450
Lord Ge Xin,

308
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,360
it's raining heavily. Where are you going in such a hurry?

309
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,330
Lord Xiu, you came to the territory of the Palace Guards to cause trouble.

310
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,530
But you only brought one man. Don't you think it's too few?

311
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,350
This is the base camp of the Palace Guards.

312
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,720
As long as we start fighting,

313
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,240
the troops outside will break in.

314
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,430
I guarantee

315
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,730
none of you can get out alive.

316
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,970
Line up!

317
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,360
Hurry! Line up!

318
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,160
Hurry!

319
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,210
Fall in!

320
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,660
Wait!

321
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Such being the case, I'm going to announce it.

322
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,990
Yang Minghua plotted a rebellion and committed treason.

323
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,530
He was killed on the spot.

324
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,260
Lei Xun colluded with him. It's unforgivable.

325
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,390
He was also killed on the spot.

326
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,130
Lord Ge Yingxing has led 400,000 soldiers from Yuanzhou

327
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,660
to support Lord Chieftain.

328
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,250
They have arrived in Imperial Capital.

329
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,800
Everyone, it's up to you now.

330
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,230
Nonsense! Kill him!

331
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,700
Nonsense?

332
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,930
See for yourselves.

333
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,380
The commander's seal.

334
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,350
Lord Xiu, what exactly do you want us to do?

335
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,370
You called me Lord. I'm flattered.

336
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,390
I just want everyone here

337
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,410
to stay here until tomorrow morning.

338
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,260
This condition is acceptable.

339
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,410
My Lord, thank you

340
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,850
for not letting us confront Commander Yang Minghua.

341
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,470
Lord Xiu,

342
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,770
do you know the current situation outside?

343
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,850
Lords, I know

344
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,050
what you mean.

345
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,690
As long as you and the Palace Guards

346
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,090
can stay here tonight,

347
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,650
I swear on my life

348
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,060
your careers and lives

349
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,590
will not be affected.

350
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,010
Lord Xiu, I hope you can keep your promise.

351
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,250
My men, let's go.

352
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,050
I accept Lord Xiu's condition. Let's go.

353
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,640
Lord Ge Xin, please.

354
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,920
Go!

355
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,620
Lord Ge Xin, a person who can recognize current trends is an outstanding talent.

356
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,060
I'm still offering you my promise.

357
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,110
The mistake hasn't been made yet.

358
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,910
It's not too late to stop now.

359
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,440
Lord Xiu, thank you for your generosity. Let's go.

360
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,610
Everyone.

361
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,480
My Lord.

362
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,640
It's time.

363
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,900
Why hasn't Lei Xun taken action yet?

364
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,740
I'm going to take a look now.

365
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,090
If anything happens,

366
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,000
I'll take over the Palace Guards directly.

367
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,010
Go.

368
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,180
A long delay may cause trouble.

369
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,170
My Lord.

370
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,250
Tell Lord Xiao

371
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,260
his men can take action now.

372
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,170
Okay.

373
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,750
The Royal Escorts delivered a message

374
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,550
that the Military Inspection Team has launched an attack on the Chieftain's Mansion.

375
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,700
My Lord, Lord Xiu asked me to deliver a message.

376
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Set up the formation!

377
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Yes!

378
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,070
Please give this to Xiao Long.

379
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,080
Xiao Long?

380
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,470
Try this.

381
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,770
This is very delicious.

382
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,610
And this.

383
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,420
These are all my favorites.

384
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,850
Are you okay?

385
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,380
I'm just too hungry.

386
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,450
I didn't eat much outside just now.

387
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,940
Today is my birthday.

388
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,040
They must be celebrating outside.

389
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,290
So annoying.

390
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,250
Where's Zichuan Xiu?

391
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,650
He has a mission.

392
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,220
He's not the only one who has a mission.

393
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,760
You also have a mission.

394
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,630
Your mission

395
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,470
is to wish me a happy birthday.

396
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,490
Wish us safety.

397
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,580
My Lady, the noodles are ready.

398
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,660
Who wants noodles?

399
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,260
Can't you see I'm chatting with Princess Ka Dan?

400
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,440
Take them out!

401
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,490
If Zichuan Xiu comes back now

402
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,400
and sees you with this pale look,

403
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,850
he would be scared away.

404
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,690
Come. Have a seat.

405
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,460
Will they... be in danger?

406
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
He's Zichuan Xiu.

407
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,500
He said he would come back.

408
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,390
Then he will come back.

409
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,710
I will also keep my promise

410
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,690
of protecting myself and you.

411
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,250
I trust you.

412
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,590
Si Yilin.

413
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,800
Greetings, Lord Xiao.

414
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,500
Young man, you're really something.

415
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,450
I'm flattered.

416
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,260
Lord Si Yilin, you managed to find me here.

417
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,820
I guess it must be Zichuan Xiu's arrangement.

418
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,610
Lord Xiao, it's dark now.

419
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,090
Be careful when you walk at night.

420
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,810
Xiu asked me to give you this.

421
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,810
He said it's a reward.

422
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,320
[Di Lin is a spy of the Chieftain's Mansion]

423
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,600
Lord Si Yilin, please go back.

424
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,090
I have something important to deal with.

425
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,370
My Lord.

426
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,050
The Military Inspection Team has retreated, right?

427
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,960
Yes, My Lord.

428
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,210
My Lord, the city gate is open.

429
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,850
There are three beams of white light.

430
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,910
I guess Lord Xiu has taken control of the Palace Guards.

431
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,430
My Lord, there's a flare!

432
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,710
My Lord, Lord Ge Yingxing...

433
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,130
Blow the horn.

434
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,610
Big Brother is so cautious.

435
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,830
He takes into consideration every aspect.

436
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,480
Why hasn't Lord Luo delivered a message?

437
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,290
My Lord,

438
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,909
Lord Xiao Long's Military Inspection Team...

439
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,970
has retreated.

440
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,620
Who is it?

441
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,070
Lord Luo, what brings you here?

442
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,330
Yang Minghua formed a clique for selfish purposes and committed treason.

443
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,390
He started a rebellion openly. He should be executed.

444
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,290
Soldiers!

445
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,250
Yes!

446
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,930
Enter the city with me

447
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,210
to kill the rebels and eliminate Yang Minghua's accomplices.

448
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,430
Kill them!

449
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,470
Who are you?

450
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,850
How dare you break into the Chieftain's Mansion?

451
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,640
My personal guards!

452
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,610
Armed riots have occurred everywhere in Imperial Capital.

453
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,840
We're here to protect Lord Chieftain.

454
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
If you don't step aside,

455
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,550
don't blame me for being rude.

456
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,540
I'm responsible for protecting Lord Chieftain.

457
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,720
Commander Yang, please go back.

458
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,950
If you don't,

459
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,490
don't blame me for being rude.

460
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,380
Si Yilin, let's be honest with each other.

461
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,140
How can your 20,000 people

462
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,510
defeat my 170,000 Palace Guards?

463
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,130
Don't make a vain attempt to stop me.

464
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,530
You know

465
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,800
I like talented men.

466
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,660
If you surrender to me,

467
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,530
I will treat you well.

468
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,650
Do you really think you have 170,000 soldiers?

469
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,110
I know Zichuan Xiu played tricks.

470
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,680
But you know

471
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,300
I always have a backup plan.

472
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,090
My Lord, Lei Xun was tricked and killed by Zichuan Xiu.

473
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,900
So they took control of the Palace Guards.

474
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,050
It's fine. Have you taken control?

475
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,810
Yes.

476
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:20,810
Good.

477
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,990
Ask the Palace Guards to assemble here

478
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,190
to eliminate the Royal Escorts

479
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,390
and take over the Chieftain's Mansion.

480
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,610
Everyone, prepare to fight.

481
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,300
Yes!

482
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,640
Lord Luo?

483
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,170
I'm sorry. I can't obey your order.

484
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,260
Why?

485
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,690
Lord Chieftain.

486
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,930
Make way.

487
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,920
Let me tell you.

488
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,770
Lord Luo Minghai

489
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,360
belongs to the real Zichuan.

490
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,680
For the interests of the family,

491
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,470
the holder of this document, Luo Minghai,

492
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,140
will do what he should do

493
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,880
according to my orders.

494
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,380
All the officials in the family

495
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,840
must cooperate with him.

496
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,620
Zichuan Canxing, Year 773 of the imperial calendar.

497
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,240
In Year 773,

498
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,340
Lord Zichuan Canxing

499
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,610
was not the chieftain.

500
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,000
You already went to Yang Minghua at that time?

501
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,240
I went to him three years earlier than Di Lin.

502
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,570
Lord Chieftain, I've taken control of the Palace Guards.

503
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,730
I've told Di Lin to eliminate Yang Minghua's accomplices.

504
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,640
Di Lin?

505
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,560
You killed Tieshou and forced me to execute Tongchui.

506
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,570
Now you've bribed Luo Minghai and Di Lin.

507
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,150
I really underestimated you.

508
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,890
Di Lin and Luo Minghai have always been my men.

509
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,850
There is no need to bribe them.

510
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,100
Let me tell you more.

511
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,210
My brother, Zichuan Yuanxing,

512
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,090
planted someone around you.

513
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,840
His name is Tongchui.

514
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,230
He planted another person

515
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,770
around Ge Yingxing.

516
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,200
His name is Weiming.

517
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
You only know part of it.

518
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,220
The point is it's not that he didn't trust you.

519
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,610
It's you didn't trust him.

520
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,440
I swore I would help Yuanxing protect the world

521
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,600
and Zichuan.

522
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,630
They only support those with swords in their hands.

523
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,490
See?

524
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,520
This thing is nothing important.

525
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,980
Lord Canxing, you are really something.

526
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,480
You've endured humiliation and hardships for seven years.

527
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,930
You have put me to shame.

528
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,360
The winner makes the rules, and the loser lives by them.

529
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,990
I have nothing to say.

530
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,780
Yuanxing, my brother!

531
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,800
Unfortunately, he still doesn't know

532
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,650
he would fail in the end.

533
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,890
Do you feel happy or sad

534
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,800
that you have such a younger brother?

535
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,770
Zichuan is in the hands of such a scheming person.

536
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm sure it will be short of talents in the future.

537
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,840
Everyone will feel they are in danger, and the state and families will no longer exist.

538
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,210
Considering how you gained the power to rule the world, can you feel at ease?
