[Episode 24]

4
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,210
Your Highness.

5
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,880
General Yun's being attacked has nothing to do with me.

6
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,750
Pingjing Duke, no need to say more.

7
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,120
I know someone framed you

8
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,870
and wanted to sow discord between you and the Divine Emperor.

9
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,460
But now, there's solid evidence.

10
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,910
It's hard for you to escape the blame and defend yourself.

11
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,870
Please save me, Your Highness!

12
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,400
I have already interceded for you with my father.

13
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,350
I've tried many ways

14
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,630
and got you a chance to prove yourself.

15
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,340
Thank you for saving my life.

16
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,500
I will never forget that.

17
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,590
You are the pride of heaven.

18
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,350
You will inherit the throne of the North Clan.

19
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,950
You will surely be able to unify the world and benefit the people.

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,520
Pingjing Duke, please get up.

21
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,190
It is my duty to discover and appoint talents.

22
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,510
You're too modest.

23
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,940
But I don't know

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,640
how I can prove myself.

25
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,150
Now,

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
only by killing Si Yilin

27
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,450
can you gain the trust of the Divine Emperor.

28
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,450
Me killing Si Yilin?

29
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,750
Si Yilin is the Tiger of Zichuan

30
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,270
and Payi is as as firm as a rock. I'm afraid...

31
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,630
I know it's hard for you.

32
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,150
But now it's the only way

33
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,400
to keep you safe.

34
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,940
Besides, in order to protect you,

35
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm already deeply entangled in trouble.

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,650
So now you can only go forward, not back down.

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,380
Understand?

38
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,500
Yes, I understand.

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,430
I'll make a three-day military pledge for you.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,990
Can you make it?

41
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,430
Three days?

42
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,360
You have followed Lord Ge for several years

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,010
in Yuanzhou.

44
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,160
I believe you can prove yourself.

45
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
I thought if I joined the North Clan,

46
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,400
we would have fulfilled our ambitions and survived.

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,110
I didn't expect it to be a dead game.

48
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,329
This Ka Dun

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,940
wants me to fight against Si Yilin,

50
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,880
then he can take advantage of it

51
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,920
without sending a single soldier.

52
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,190
We need to save our strength.

53
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,110
This is our capital.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,350
Without it,

55
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,230
we are worthless.

56
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,740
We have to find an unexpected way

57
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,329
to win in one strike.

58
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,560
Hurry!

59
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,750
Hurry!

60
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,230
Hurry!

61
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,300
Hurry up.

62
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,470
Hurry up.

63
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,630
Hurry up.

64
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,030
Harder.

65
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,730
Don't retreat.

66
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,470
Three miles forward.

67
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,409
Three miles ahead.

68
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,590
Hurry!

69
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,580
Hurry up.

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,270
Hurry up.

71
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,680
Push harder.

72
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,070
Push!

73
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,430
Hurry.

74
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,590
Hurry up.

75
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,480
Look at that commander.

76
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,440
An old friend.

77
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,750
Who?

78
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,570
I don't know what his current name is.

79
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,190
But his former name was Lei Hong.

80
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,820
I can recognize him even if he turns into ashes.

81
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,420
He used to be the Deputy Commander of Yuanzhou.

82
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,820
Hurry!

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,980
At this rate,

84
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,480
our city will be in danger.

85
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,400
We can't let them get any closer.

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
My Lord, please give the order to shoot the arrows.

87
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,690
If we order to shoot,

88
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,080
the captives at the front will be dead.

89
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,150
What should we do?

90
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,159
We can't hurt the captives.

91
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,590
Everyone, without my order,

92
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,610
you mustn't shoot.

93
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:56,510
Yes.

94
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,640
Second Brother.

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,890
Look at those captives.

96
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,580
Which unit were they originally from?

97
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,110
They were from Ming Hui's and Fang Jin's armies.

98
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,510
There are injured soldiers and some commoners.

99
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,570
If that's the case,

100
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,200
they were all soldiers of Zichuan.

101
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,590
That's right.

102
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,550
Guys, come with me.

103
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,050
Baichuan, stay here.

104
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,460
Your Highness.

105
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,830
Pingjing Duke only brought a group of rebels to attack this time.

106
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,560
Will it work?

107
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,409
If he wins,

108
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,330
we can seize the chance to chase the enemies.

109
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,300
If he loses,

110
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,590
we can also consume

111
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
some of Si Yilin's troops.

112
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,270
We can also find out what's going on in Payi.

113
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,640
Besides,

114
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,870
it's not our soldiers who will die.

115
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,690
They're just dogs biting each other.

116
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,040
I admire your move, Your Highness.

117
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,670
But Pingjing Duke

118
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
is so mean.

119
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,840
How could he come up with such a dirty trick to use the captives to attack the city?

120
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,340
Lei Hong is less than ten miles away

121
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,330
from Payi.

122
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,900
If Si Yilin couldn't bear to kill the captives,

123
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,460
the rebels in Yuanzhou

124
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,470
could easily approach Payi.

125
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,250
Si Yilin

126
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,040
is always hiding like a coward.

127
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,140
If Pingjing Duke can make him take the initiative to attack

128
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,090
and open the gate himself,

129
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,909
by then,

130
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,940
we can easily take down Payi.

131
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,430
Hurry up.

132
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,670
Who allowed you to shoot arrows?

133
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,710
My Lord, we can't wait any longer.

134
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,840
Xiu is dealing with it, you know?

135
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,910
We don't even know where Lord Xiu is now.

136
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,430
According to his usual style,

137
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,820
would he run away

138
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,350
at this critical moment?

139
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,790
I trust my brother.

140
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,350
Don't shoot without my order.

141
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,470
Yes.

142
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,000
I have a way to save those captives.

143
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,280
It's a good chance to break the spirit of Lei Hong.

144
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,710
But we need the cooperation

145
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,310
of all the residents in Payi.

146
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,630
Follow my and the Xiu Battalion's arrangement

147
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,690
and cooperate.

148
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,150
From now on,

149
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,110
all of you will obey Lord Xiu

150
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,770
and the Xiu Battalion.

151
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,990
If there is any disobedience, it will be dealt with according to military law.

152
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,630
This way.

153
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,400
Lime powder and chili powder. Come on.

154
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,430
Your turn.

155
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,190
Come on.

156
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,030
Hurry.

157
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,320
This way.

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,280
Hurry up.

159
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,020
It's choking.

160
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,930
Come on. One more here.

161
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,000
Hurry.

162
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,790
Hurry!

163
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,020
Hurry up.

164
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,070
Hurry up.

165
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,790
You're right.

166
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,290
Si Yilin still couldn't bear to kill the captives.

167
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,080
At this rate,

168
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,310
we can get close to the city gate soon.

169
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,910
All people have weaknesses.

170
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,580
Although Si Yilin is a general,

171
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,880
he is too soft-hearted and not decisive enough.

172
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,010
He's not as cruel as Di Lin.

173
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,950
Pass my order. Keep moving.

174
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,560
Yes!

175
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,910
Full speed ahead!

176
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:06,990
Hurry!

177
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,160
Hurry up.

178
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,700
Hurry up. Go ahead.

179
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,660
Walk on your own.

180
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,740
Hurry up.

181
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,050
What's going on?

182
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,390
Send the messenger to the front to investigate.

183
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:05,710
Yes.

184
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,820
Firstly, when Lei Hong's vanguard troops

185
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,920
approach within less than two miles of the city,

186
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,340
we will use catapults to launch a large number of smoke bombs

187
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,520
into the area between the vanguard troops

188
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,980
and Lei Hong's main force,

189
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,630
disrupting the enemy's vision

190
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,760
and cutting off their communication.

191
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,330
Since they used to be soldiers of the Zichuan family,

192
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,240
they must be very sensitive to semaphores

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,070
and horn sounds.

194
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,870
I can read the semaphores.

195
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,110
The gates on both sides are open.

196
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,310
Run to both sides!

197
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,020
Guys, fight them!

198
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,960
Don't run!

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,670
Don't run!

200
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,010
At this moment,

201
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,360
they will quickly meet at the side gates.

202
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,640
Second Brother.

203
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,630
You need to lead the Armored Cavalry

204
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,940
to break out of the main city gate

205
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,830
to attract the attention of the rebels in Yuanzhou

206
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,190
and buy more time for the captives.

207
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,910
Kill!

208
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,310
Come back!

209
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,150
Stop! Stop!

210
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,390
Stop!

211
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,710
Stop!

212
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,880
At the same time, we must kill

213
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,310
the enemy's messenger immediately

214
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,040
to cut off the intelligence transmission of this army of ten thousand

215
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,880
and make Lei Hong blind.

216
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,170
I will ask the Xiu Battalion

217
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,670
to open the side city gates

218
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,340
and rescue the captives as soon as possible.

219
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,870
Hurry!

220
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,590
Hurry!

221
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,480
Hurry up. Let's go into the city.

222
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,670
Keep up!

223
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,200
Stop! Come back!

224
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,400
Hurry!

225
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,150
Stop!

226
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,530
Hurry!

227
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,350
Hurry!

228
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,120
After the captives are saved,

229
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,180
you only have 30 minutes to withdraw.

230
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,790
After that, I will order to close the main city gate

231
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,850
to prevent the rebels from entering.

232
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,570
Second Brother, you just need to kill the enemy on the front line.

233
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,960
Leave the rest to me.

234
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,560
Where are the messengers?

235
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,180
Where the hell are the messengers?

236
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,330
There's smoke ahead.

237
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,470
The war is in chaos.

238
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,530
All I know is

239
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,030
the Armored Cavalry of Zichuan took the initiative to fight.

240
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,630
No news about their strength

241
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,830
or tactics.

242
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,930
I also don't know the specific situation.

243
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,730
Do you want to wait until Si Yilin

244
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,520
to stand in front of you?

245
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,950
Got it. I'll send someone right away.

246
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,070
My Lord, the captives have been mostly rescued back into the city.

247
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,290
But the rebels from Yuanzhou chased through the city gates on the sides

248
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,350
and they were fast.

249
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,890
The smoke is going to disperse. The time is right.

250
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,810
Isn't it too risky

251
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,660
to continue to let the rebels enter the city?

252
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,920
Tell them to come at me.

253
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,390
I will kill them all

254
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,750
and wipe out all the rebels in Yuanzhou.

255
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,800
Attention.

256
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,880
Split into two teams.

257
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,740
The art of war lies in changes.

258
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,660
The enemy is here. Are we going to fight?

259
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,520
What's the rush? Let's eat the pig after it gets fat.

260
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,310
Isn't it about time?

261
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,910
Wait.

262
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,190
Close the gate.

263
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:15,830
Pour.

264
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,600
Tell Second Brother to withdraw.

265
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,800
Second Brother.

266
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,250
You have to come back in 30 minutes.

267
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,910
If you can't come back,

268
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,450
I won't wait for you.

269
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,950
Of course, you will come back.

270
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,630
I trust you.

271
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,940
Rest assured with me.

272
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,440
All the Palace Guards, return to the city.

273
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,300
My Lord, the city gate is still open.

274
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,310
Send my order. Fight at full force.

275
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,190
If anyone can take the head of Si Yilin,

276
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll reward him as a commander.

277
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,470
Boss.

278
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,250
The enemies lured in

279
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,550
were trapped in the moat city.

280
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,880
They were beaten badly.

281
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,910
Okay, get ready to close the main city gate.

282
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,720
You go ahead with our men and I'll cover.

283
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,150
Okay.

284
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,030
Boss, Lord Si Yilin

285
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,430
seems to be trapped by the rebels in Yuanzhou.

286
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,830
Should we go rescue them?

287
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,670
Don't be distracted.

288
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,690
Second Brother will come back on time.

289
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Go back to your position.

290
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,550
Yes.

291
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,150
Boss, if we don't close the main city gate,

292
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,630
the rebels from Yuanzhou will attack.

293
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,240
♫Watching the flames burning in the sky♫

294
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,480

295

♫Go forward for freedom♫

301
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,510
Our boss is not bad.

♫Like flames burning brightly♫

303
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,460

♫We remain silent♫

308

Retreat!

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,020
Retreat!

314
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,430
What's going on?

315
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,310
How come you ended up like this?

316
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,370
Please forgive me.

317
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,550
I didn't expect Si Yilin

318
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,280
to use such a despicable trick.

319
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,580
Our army suffered heavy casualties.

320
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,080
Many people were trapped in the city

321
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,870
and couldn't come out.

322
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,690
Didn't you have captives?

323
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,500
The captives... The captives were saved by them.

324
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,140
Pingjing Duke, tell me

325
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,610
how Si Yilin fought with you

326
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,190
while saving so many people

327
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,650
in front of you.

328
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,550
Prince Ka Dun.

329
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,530
The Divine Emperor has ordered you to go back and report immediately.

330
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,090
Is my father going to punish me?

331
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,290
Yun Qing.

332
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,280
Your Highness.

333
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,720
Here.

334
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,990
Are you feeling better?

335
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,950
I've rested for a few days. Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

336
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,990
Prince Ka Dun's attack plan failed.

337
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,920
Pingjing Duke's Yuanzhou Army

338
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,910
also suffered heavy casualties.

339
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,030
Yes, Ka Dun was eager to attack the city.

340
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,440
He only sent Pingjing Duke to battle.

341
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,130
What a joke.

342
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,610
But Father has removed his military power

343
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,610
and confined him.

344
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,580
I'm afraid he won't be able to show off again.

345
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,030
But the Tiger of Zichuan can't be underestimated.

346
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,630
Are you sure you can defeat him?

347
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,460
If it's just Si Yilin being trapped,

348
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,240
of course, I can win him.

349
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,270
But I suspect

350
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,430
there are other masters.

351
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,860
Who are they?

352
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,160
They're even better than Si Yilin?

353
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,020
As far as I know,

354
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,020
this unconventional tactic from Si Yilin this time

355
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,710
doesn't seem to resemble the orthodox strategies

356
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,750
of the Palace Guards of the Zichuan Army.

357
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,790
It's definitely not

358
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,310
Si Yilin's style.

359
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,010
Besides, he has led the Armored Cavalry personally.

360
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,220
Someone else must be in charge in the city.

361
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,240
Come on, drink.

362
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,950
Come on.

363
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,480
Drink.

364
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,350
Drink!

365
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,430
Drink!

366
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,580
Pour me more.

367
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,210
Cheers.

368
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,180
That was close.

369
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,910
Yes.

370
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,650
Thanks to you.

371
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,740
Don't mention it; we're brothers.

372
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,760
In this battle, our victory is not just about winning or losing.

373
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,280
The momentum

374
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,840
is all demonstrated by you, the commander-in-chief of the Palace Guards.

375
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,600
You led a team of cavalry to enter the enemy's formation.

376
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,230
You were chic, domineering, and cool.

377
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,680
But we also need tactics, don't we?

378
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,540
Can it work without your tactics?

379
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,780
Look at my men.

380
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,790
They are all from the martial arts school.

381
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,510
Although they are brave and good at fighting,

382
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,260
their method is not flexible enough.

383
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,720
But your Xiu Battalion...

384
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,350
What?

385
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,720
Are you trying to learn rogue tactics from us

386
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,920
in the Xiu Battalion?

387
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,880
I saw my men

388
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,800
asking your men

389
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,760
about the lime powder and...

390
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,200
That's far from enough.

391
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,760
We also have

392
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,720
the banana peel tactic, digging holes in the pits tactic,

393
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,440
and cross-fighting tactic.

394
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,750
A bracelet? Let me see it.

395
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,590
Second Brother, who gave you this bracelet?

396
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,480
Don't meddle in adults' business.

397
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,140
Your arms look quite slender.

398
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,270
Let me see it.

399
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,440
What are you doing?

400
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,170
Let me see it.

401
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,950
No.

402
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,350
I'll beat you.

403
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,400
Lord Chieftain gave this bracelet

404
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,520
to me and Ka Dan.

405
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,760
Lord Chieftain has agreed?

406
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,960
He said

407
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,400
if one day

408
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,840
Zichuan unites the North Clan,

409
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,120
or,

410
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,550
the Xichuan continent becomes a united country,

411
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,900
he would agree.

412
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,470
In other words,

413
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,820
either Zichuan unifies the North Clan,

414
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,950
or the North Clan unifies the Zichuan.

415
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,460
Can't we coexist peacefully?

416
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,650
Peacefully?

417
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,280
Second Brother, why don't you give me this bracelet?

418
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,970
I can sell it at a good price.

419
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,240
I want to pacify the rebellion.

420
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,620
I also want to marry Ka Dan.

421
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,880
Aren't you usually full of tricks?

422
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,730
Why aren't you talking?

423
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,760
Second Brother, you're awesome.

424
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,610
I'll finish it.

425
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,450
Counsellor, I’m incompetent.

426
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,870
Even if you are seriously injured,

427
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,220
[Black Veil]

428
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,630
your power and reaction are not weak.

429
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,120
It shows that the person who hurt you is a rare master.

430
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,540
We actually didn't know

431
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,920
that there was such a master among them.

432
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,720
I will do my best to find out the truth.

433
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,360
Sit.

434
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,590
Now all the generals are accusing Pingjing Duke.

435
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,680
Someone said he was a coward and ran away,

436
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,760
causing the entire army to collapse.

437
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,840
Some said he was in a panic and his command was inadequate.

438
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
What do you think?

439
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,790
Although he has an inescapable responsibility,

440
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,390
it's not entirely his fault.

441
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,820
The opponent's tactic this time

442
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,610
was indeed hard to handle.

443
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,190
To be honest, if it were me,

444
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,210
I couldn't guarantee that I would be safe.

445
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,320
Yes.

446
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,240
They severed your arm, plundered our supplies,

447
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,440
rescued captives, and severely crippled Lei Hong.

448
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,320
It seems like we only lost a battle,

449
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,640
even without serious casualties,

450
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,120
but in reality, it was a major defeat.

451
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,360
Si Yilin's troops are all elites,

452
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,640
inherently powerful.

453
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,360
Now they have nowhere to escape

454
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,790
and will fight like cornered beasts.

455
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,670
This battle won't be easy.

456
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,550
Prince Ka Dun, eager to impress His Majesty,

457
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,280
rushed into the enemy

458
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,340
and suffered a major setback.

459
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,040
From now on, you will be the commander-in-chief.

460
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,360
I hope you won't disappoint His Majesty.

461
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,760
I will follow your advice.

462
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,900
There is one more thing

463
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,350
I must remind you of.

464
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,390
In this battle,

465
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,280
there was a highly skilled commander

466
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,200
hidden among the enemies.

467
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,080
This person was hiding in the dark.

468
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,090
He was very precise in controlling the whole situation.

469
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,290
He keenly observed our weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

470
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,760
He didn't play by the rules.

471
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,400
Maybe he is the one who broke your arm.

472
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,900
No matter what,

473
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,150
you must be careful.

474
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,800
I understand.

475
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
But their moves

476
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,960
can't be used twice.

477
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,920
I will crush them one by one.

478
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,580
There are more and more soldiers from the North Clan.

479
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,840
In less than two days,

480
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,370
the main force of the North Clan started to fight back.

481
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,469
This vast swarm is like locusts.

482
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,770
It's like they're going to devour us.

483
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,719
The previous fierce battle

484
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,380
has used up all our resources.

485
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,090
Now arrows, chili powder,

486
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,330
lime, smoke bombs, and defense tools

487
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,360
are almost used up.

488
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,120
The entire army is exhausted.

489
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,040
Besides, we have taken in

490
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,699
so many captives and wounded.

491
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,050
What should we do next?

492
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,460
Our army has arrived at the gate of Payi City.

493
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,949
Why can't we attack without hesitation?

494
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,320
The Palace Guards of the Zichuan family have always been strong.

495
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,250
Once engaged in a desperate fight,

496
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,690
their combat power

497
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,320
could be terrifying.

498
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,270
Although we have control over tens of thousands of troops,

499
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,510
a direct assault

500
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,680
would only result in a Pyrrhic victory.

501
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,810
Even if we win, it won't be satisfying.

502
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,370
So, Yun Qing, what do you suggest?

503
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,040
Our main force

504
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,170
should focus on countering Si Yilin's armored cavalry.

505
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,460
We'll build fortifications outside the city, set up ambushes,

506
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,390
and distract the cavalry attempting to leave the city

507
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,800
while continuing to besiege the city

508
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,870
and prevent the enemies in the city from escaping.

509
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,470
First, we must ensure our army stands unbeaten.

510
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,680
Then what? Just wait?

511
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,750
That's right.

512
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,270
We need to besiege them.

513
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,520
Once their supplies are depleted,

514
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
in just a few days,

515
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,570
we can take them down without bloodshed.

516
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,650
My Lord.

517
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,020
Nearly 300,000 Northern soldiers

518
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,350
have set up camps and fortifications

519
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,920
less than a few miles away from us,

520
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,450
laying out tight ambushes.

521
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,620
As you ordered,

522
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,510
I've dispatched small squads from each gate

523
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,710
to attempt breakout,

524
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,940
but they all encountered attacks.

525
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,990
Initially, they wanted to force us out,

526
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,250
but it seems now they want to trap us here.

527
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,920
Pass my order.

528
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,230
Tell everyone

529
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,040
not to step out of the city gate.

530
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,580
Yes.

531
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,730
Second Brother, fighting against the North Clan,

532
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,040
we're not afraid of them bringing arms,

533
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,230
but brains.

534
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Compared to before, when they were chaotic,

535
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,390
they're now organized,

536
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,350
with clear divisions of labor

537
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,550
and high efficiency.

538
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,560
Looks like the new general

539
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,600
is not only capable

540
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,330
but also very foresighted.

541
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,910
And he is very confident

542
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,150
to trap us to death in this city.

543
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,240
Because he knows

544
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,270
they can make us surrender

545
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,620
without expending any troops,

546
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,520
as we will never

547
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,620
let the people in the city starve.

548
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,030
This opponent is interesting.

549
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,840
He can trap us

550
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,610
without any effort.

551
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,160
Only he could achieve that.

552
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,490
He's determined despite his injuries.

553
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,090
I didn't expect that he would come back so soon.

554
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,400
Back then,

555
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,040
when he was trapped in Gelama City by Big Brother,

556
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,730
the two armies were evenly matched.

557
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,040
I didn't expect us to be the ones besieged now.

558
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,660
Plus, your severing of his arm adds to his grudge against us.

559
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,520
Next, we will proceed with difficulty step by step.

560
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,470
I shouldn't have cut off his right arm.

561
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,640
I should have broken his right leg.

562
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,440
Then he would truly be struggling with every step.

563
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,010
Yun Qing.

564
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,680
Your Highness.

565
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,000
What a good plan.

566
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
I bet Si Yilin, the Tiger of Zichuan,

567
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,060
is now as frantic as an ant on a hot pan.

568
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,800
Look at these past few days,

569
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,080
when have the Palace Guards

570
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,610
ever suffered such losses?

571
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,620
Do you think they might rush out

572
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,540
in anger

573
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,440
and catch us off guard?

574
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,180
They won't, and they dare not.

575
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,280
This time,

576
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,710
we not only need to deter the Palace Guards inside the city

577
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,370
from easily deploying troops

578
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,060
but more importantly,

579
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,070
we need to instill fear in them.

580
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,500
Once the people inside the city are in chaos,

581
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,630
his reputation as the Tiger of Zichuan

582
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,420
won't feed people

583
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,770
or turn into a million-strong army.

584
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,510
The struggle of a cornered beast may not last long.

585
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,340
My Lord, according to your request,

586
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,940
I have tallied all the food and supplies in the city.

587
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,000
But the situation is not optimistic.

588
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,470
The residents have donated some food to us,

589
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,810
but most households

590
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,390
have little left.

591
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,840
Moreover, we've taken in a large number of captives of war,

592
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,100
even more than before.

593
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,320
How many more days can we hold out?

594
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,360
All added up, not more than ten days.

595
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,980
Without backup supplies,

596
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,920
I'm afraid Payi may fall on its own.

597
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,590
Rather than being slaughtered by the North Clan after the city falls,

598
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,240
it's better to make a desperate attempt

599
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,870
to break out while we still have the strength.

600
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,520
If we go out now, we'll die.

601
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,470
Yun Qianxue

602
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,280
is waiting for us to break out.

603
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,320
We have deployed more manpower to the severely damaged walls

604
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,520
of the Wayun Fortress

605
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,400
to speed up the repair process.

606
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,000
At this rate, repairing them on schedule should not be a problem.

607
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,950
Are those noble officers

608
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,950
still lazy to work

609
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,200
and make things difficult for you again?

610
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,720
After you disciplined them last time,

611
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,380
they dare not slack off at all.

612
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,800
Some officers have even started doing manual labor.

613
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,630
They dare not complain anymore.

614
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,870
In addition, the soldiers who retreated from the front line

615
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,990
have gradually reorganized and joined the formations again.

616
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,390
The soldiers who have recovered from their injuries

617
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,850
have also begun training.

618
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,750
But

619
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,210
there is still no news of Si Yilin.

620
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,270
Since he issued the challenge to the Divine Emperor,

621
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,180
there has been no trace of him.

622
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,270
I know where he is.

623
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,080
He's in Payi.

624
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,780
But the wounded soldiers who came back said

625
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,840
Payi had been lost.

626
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,300
Payi is our second most important barrier

627
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,230
in Yuanzhou, second only to Wayun.

628
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,640
Giving up Payi is giving up his mission.

629
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,840
He will never do that.

630
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,110
And we haven't heard

631
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,840
any news of the Divine Emperor's army

632
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,360
engaging the Palace Guards either.

633
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,160
It seems that

634
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,200
issuing the challenge was just a diversion by Si Yilin.

635
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,600
He will definitely take back Payi

636
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,200
and hold back the North Clan.

637
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,600
I see.

638
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,280
Why hasn't the North Clan army

639
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,740
attacked for so many days?

640
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,080
Why can the wounded soldiers from Yuanzhou

641
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,210
return to Wayun without obstruction?

642
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,400
Si Yilin, with just one army,

643
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,850
has erected another barrier for rebuilding the Imperial Capital,

644
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,780
exchanging the most precious time

645
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,690
for Wayun Fortress's defense works

646
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,920
and thus saving millions of civilians.

647
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,190
Lord Si Yilin truly lives up to being a hero.

648
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,950
What hero?

649
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,070
He's an idiot.

650
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,320
He held back the main force of the North Clan,

651
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,800
saved the entire Wayun Fortress,

652
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,860
and consequently saved the entire Zichuan family.

653
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,660
That's why I called him an idiot.

654
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,560
He's led himself

655
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,000
and the family's finest troops

656
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,200
into a deadly trap. Extremely foolish.

657
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,340
Who does he think he is?

658
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,660
The ultimate hero?

659
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,450
And that idiot, Zichuan Xiu.

660
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,690
I bet they must be together.

661
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,920
Now, a great hero is accompanied by a young hero,

662
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,970
perhaps engaging in foolish antics.

663
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,070
We probably need to request support from the Imperial Capital.

664
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,870
It's too late.

665
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,020
Ge Qing.

666
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,500
Yes.

667
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,790
Gather all the men and horses, and pack enough supplies.

668
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,960
Take as much as you can.

669
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,560
Are you...

670
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,690
What are you doing?

671
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,790
I'm going to find those two idiots.

672
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,450
Now everything in Wayun is on track.

673
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,550
I'll leave the rest to you.

674
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,780
But the North Clan's forces are all over there.

675
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,490
How can you rescue them

676
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,950
with so few men and horses?

677
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,010
You're walking into a trap.

678
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,570
Didn't you just say

679
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,570
their behaviors were very foolish?

680
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,040
Yes.

681
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,410
Those two are idiots.

682
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,610
Then why did you...

683
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,310
I'm the third idiot.
