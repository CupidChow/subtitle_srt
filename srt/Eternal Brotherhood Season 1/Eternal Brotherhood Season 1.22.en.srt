00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,820
[Episode 22]

4
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,420
Is it Ka Dan from the North Clan?

5
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,030
It is.

6
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,680
Looks like I'm getting old.

7
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,210
I didn't expect

8
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,630
you would make me worry too.

9
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,150
Though I hold the highest position as Lord Chieftain,

10
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,190
and everyone believes my life is without regrets,

11
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,590
they don't know

12
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:27,190
that I still have things I love,

13
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,950
fear,

14
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,270
dread,

15
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,660
and miss.

16
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,520
I've never slept in peace.

17
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,230
Ning is too young and naive.

18
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,750
She needs to grow gradually.

19
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,960
The road to establish prestige is long.

20
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,020
I'm worried

21
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,840
that when she inherits my position,

22
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,710
she can't make the ministers submit.

23
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,260
Get up and talk.

24
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,550
Lord Chieftain, you worry too much.

25
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,530
The ministers will assist Princess Ning

26
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,730
like they assist you.

27
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,880
Back then, when my brother was alive,

28
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,390
the rebel, Yang Minghua

29
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,230
also appeared very loyal.

30
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,110
Lord Chieftain, you mean...

31
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,110
Ning indeed needs

32
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,770
a loyal and steadfast general

33
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,880
to assist her in controlling the regency authority.

34
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,150
She also needs

35
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,670
a clear-minded female official

36
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,270
to assist her in governmental affairs.

37
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,180
If you and Qing become husband and wife,

38
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,170
and really guard Ning,

39
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,820
I can rest in peace

40
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,900
after my death.

41
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,690
But I only know how to lead troops to war.

42
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,360
There must be other candidates to assist Princess Ning.

43
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,190
I know who you're talking about.

44
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,550
Di Lin is talented.

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,850
But he killed too many people and made too many enemies.

46
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,270
Zichuan Xiu is too young.

47
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,430
He has an unstable temperament and doesn't convince the public.

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,149
I have witnessed

49
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,750
your character and loyalty.

50
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,450
Your achievements are remarkable and you're upright.

51
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,350
You are supported by the court and embraced by the people

52
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,390
By then,

53
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,590
you will be the commander-in-chief and the commander of the Palace Guards.

54
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,990
With a proficient force under your command stationed in the Imperial Capital,

55
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,720
who would dare to foment internal rebellion or external chaos?

56
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,950
Si Yilin.

57
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,390
In matters concerning the advancement of our family

58
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,320
and securing a prosperous future for yourself,

59
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:58,070
Qing can support and assist you.

60
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,770
Looks matter less in finding a partner.

61
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,790
What's essential is her kindness and sincerity.

62
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,300
I'll serve the family tirelessly, until death.

63
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,850
But I have made up my mind.

64
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,060
Please grant my wish.

65
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,740
You are an important official of Zichuan.

66
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,900
Who is she?

67
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,230
She is the princess of the North Clan.

68
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,550
How can you be married?

69
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,660
After I pacify the rebellion

70
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,810
and repel the North Clan,

71
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,520
I will resign

72
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,360
and marry Ka Dan as a commoner.

73
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,320
If I can't marry her,

74
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,580
I will never get married.

75
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,670
Si Yilin, you've been with me for years.

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,220
You are loyal to me.

77
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,950
I also treat you as my own child.

78
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,870
If you really have someone you love,

79
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,610
of course, I hope you can fulfill your wish.

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,650
But let me ask you.

81
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,230
Even if I agree to you being with Ka Dan,

82
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,330
can you really marry her?

83
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,500
Currently, Zichuan and the North Clan

84
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,930
are in constant conflict.

85
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,240
To truly achieve your desires,

86
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,850
it would require either completely defeating them

87
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,620
and ensuring their submission to Zichuan

88
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,440
or

89
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,120
altering the course of hostility

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,480
that has persisted for over two centuries,

91
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,950
fostering everlasting peace between the two sides.

92
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,990
Both tasks are incredibly daunting.

93
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,610
Lord Chieftain.

94
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,110
Ever since my days at the Martial Arts Academy in Yuanzhou,

95
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,010
I've decided to

96
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,580
devote myself entirely

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
to Zichuan.

98
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,310
I will not engage in any actions

99
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,550
that would betray you or Zichuan.

100
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
But I've made up my mind.

101
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,510
I will not let Ka Dan down.

102
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,430
No matter how hard the road ahead is,

103
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,720
I will keep going.

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,730
When I go to Yuanzhou,

105
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,770
I will suppress the rebellion and repel the North Clan.

106
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,150
Even if I can't do it now,

107
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,990
I'll do it in 10, 20, 30 years.

108
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,670
I will...

109
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,110
Fine.

110
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,790
Let's put the engagement aside for now.

111
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,670
As to Qing,

112
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,310
I'll talk to her.

113
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,490
Just now, I mentioned those two matters.

114
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,890
If you manage to accomplish either one,

115
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,080
I won't stand in your way.

116
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,030
But there's a condition.

117
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,190
You must fight the battle

118
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,620
in Yuanzhou well.

119
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,350
You need to win

120
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,660
and return safely.

121
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,250
I won't let you down.

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,090
Alright.

123
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,560
Remember what

124
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,600
I promised you.

125
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,580
Consider this as evidence.

126
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,500
It's for you and Ka Dan.

127
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,230
This is too precious.

128
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,360
I dare not accept it.

129
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,530
You are a person of integrity.

130
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,910
She's a princess of the North Clan.

131
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,540
You must have something decent to offer as a token of affection.

132
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,120
Otherwise, people will say

133
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,010
that the Tiger of Zichuan suffers from the family's harsh treatment.

134
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,030
The path you chose is too difficult.

135
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,070
Consider this as an old man's blessing

136
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,080
for you, my child.

137
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,890
Thank you, Lord Chieftain.

138
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,890
Today, let's consider this my farewell to you.

139
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:41,100
Let's toast to victory, peace, and our ideals.

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,680
Ka Dan, I have something to tell you.

141
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,750
You are engaged now.

142
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,340
We shouldn't say much more between us.

143
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,550
I have already refused Lord Chieftain's arranged marriage.

144
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,560
And I told him

145
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,540
you are the person I love the most in my life.

146
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,610
I will only marry you in this life.

147
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,420
I understand your feelings.

148
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,830
But you can't do that.

149
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,380
Your Lord Chieftain's arranged marriage

150
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,830
poses no harm to you.

151
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,650
You mustn't act on impulse.

152
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,830
And I am unwilling to sacrifice your future

153
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,360
for my own selfish desires.

154
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,790
Let's end it here.

155
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,350
After meeting you,

156
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,490
I have no regrets in this lifetime.

157
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,190
Ka Dan.

158
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,770
Ka Dan.

159
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,390
-It’s impossible between us.
-Who's that?

160
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,870
Go check over there.

161
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,190
Yes.

162
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,590
Any woman in the world,

163
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,680
even if she has humble origins and modest means,

164
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,860
can share glory with you

165
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,150
and bring you simple happiness.

166
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,870
Only I

167
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,520
will make you lose everything you care about.

168
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,390
It's not like that.

169
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,440
I...

170
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,270
It's really not like that.

171
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,890
You are the most precious thing to me.

172
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,270
Trust me.

173
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,880
I will do my best

174
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,190
to make the impossible possible, okay?

175
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,380
No!

176
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,000
This is a token of affection

177
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,050
that Lord Chieftain has given to both of us.

178
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,710
Do you know? Lord Chieftain said

179
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,970
if one day the North Clan and Zichuan

180
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,150
could coexist peacefully,

181
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,550
then we could be together.

182
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,260
Mr. Si, no matter what the result is,

183
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,870
remember,

184
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,880
I never regret meeting you.

185
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,020
Peace will come.

186
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,080
Will peace come?

187
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,690
Mr. Si.

188
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,890
I just want you to be safe

189
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,690
and I don't want anything else.

190
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,859
[Bulu Village]

191
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,910
When Lei Hong was trapped in the Savage Valley,

192
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,710
we thought he was dead.

193
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,870
After we saved him, we found out

194
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,990
that he survived

195
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,900
by picking lice off the savages every day.

196
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,030
Now that he's in dire straits, it's not surprising

197
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,640
that he sought refuge with the North Clan.

198
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,710
Di Lin, the Minister of Military and Legal Affairs, said in his latest letter

199
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,630
that Commander Si Yilin has already rushed to Payi overnight.

200
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,030
Should we go support him?

201
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,430
Second Brother's Palace Guards

202
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,590
are all elites,

203
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,620
and their weapons

204
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,600
are the best in all of Zichuan.

205
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,700
Now look at our Xiu Battalion, a bunch of misfits.

206
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,860
We won't even throw away a broken spear.

207
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,300
We turn it into a short spear instead.

208
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,780
If we go to help,

209
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,510
the most we can do is cheer for Second Brother.

210
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,870
Cheering might work, I guess.

211
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,070
Ming Yu will definitely cheer the loudest.

212
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,510
Boss.

213
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,130
Shall we make some special banners?

214
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,260
Like "Lord Si Yilin, I love you"

215
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,090
or "Dear Palace Guards, I miss you"?

216
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,900
If we're going to cheer,

217
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,360
let's do it to the extreme.

218
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,860
Let's cheer day and night.

219
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,530
Nonsense!

220
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,590
My Lord, sitting idly by contradicts a soldier's duty.

221
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,840
Lei Hong joining the North Clan

222
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,310
means we can't avoid

223
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,410
a battle with them.

224
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,340
When did I say we're going to sit idly by?

225
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,270
Baichuan.

226
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,270
I found that you always maliciously speculate about me.

227
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,200
Not fighting doesn't mean we won't help.

228
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,040
We can do

229
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,210
some things within our capabilities.

230
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,390
For example?

231
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,210
Luo Jie, you lead a few small squads

232
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,320
to camp at several fortresses

233
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,920
and observe their every move.

234
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,050
Report immediately

235
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,110
to the Palace Guards if there's any activity.

236
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,630
Yes.

237
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,730
Baichuan.

238
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,670
You and Shaozi will go undercover to scout ahead.

239
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,800
Find out how many troops the North Clan has sent this time

240
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,190
who the leaders are,

241
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,250
and any distinguishing features they have.

242
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:08,860
Yes.

243
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,980
Ming Yu.

244
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,510
Your mission is the hardest.

245
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,890
Alright. Am I making banners?

246
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,390
No, you're doing the accounting.

247
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,630
Calculate how much income

248
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,750
the Wealth Building Hall has made recently.

249
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,700
In case the North Clan really attack,

250
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,710
will this money be enough for us to flee?

251
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,350
My Lord.

252
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,070
My Lord.

253
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,520
Payi failed to defend.

254
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,710
Payi was impregnable. It must be Lei Hong's doing.

255
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,260
Yes. Lei Hong's old troops were inside Payi.

256
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,030
He ordered someone to open the city gate at night.

257
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,750
Lei Hong sent Moon Bay and Payi

258
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,810
to the North Clan,

259
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,580
whetting their appetite.

260
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,500
Zichuan is in danger.

261
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,470
How is Ming Hui?

262
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,090
General Ming Hui escaped.

263
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,440
But...

264
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,890
Payi is impregnable.

265
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,750
Payi has become a river of blood.

266
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,270
Lord Ming Hui thought Payi was impregnable.

267
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,640
But during our sleep, it was taken down by the North Clan.

268
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,650
Most of the soldiers in the city...

269
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,740
Lord Ming Hui pretended to be dead and escaped.

270
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,730
He crawled out of the crowd of bodies.

271
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,700
We were ordered to guard the Yuanzhou highway.

272
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,860
We went to rescue as soon as we got the news.

273
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,980
When we found him, he was...

274
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,310
He was already like this.

275
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,310
General Ming Hui.

276
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,100
General.

277
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,440
Don't move.

278
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,920
Payi is impregnable.

279
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,920
-I’m Si Yilin.
-Silence.

280
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,030
Si Yilin.

281
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,990
Don't let them find you.

282
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,600
They will kill you.

283
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,180
Payi has become a river of blood.

284
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,050
You can't die. You can't die.

285
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,270
You can't die.

286
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,890
Payi is impregnable.

287
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,500
Before the reinforcements arrived...

288
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,220
Payi is impregnable.

289
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,870
Payi is impregnable.

290
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,880
Payi has become a river of blood.

291
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,750
My Lord.

292
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,480
Send it to the Chieftain's Mansion.

293
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,040
Yes.

294
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,940
Wait.

295
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,100
Let me think about it.

296
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,260
My Lord.

297
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,620
This is the proposal to transfer Di Lin to guard Wayun.

298
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,730
The North Clan is advancing fiercely

299
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,060
and has already captured two major towns.

300
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,860
Wayun is in danger.

301
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,710
But we can't lose it.

302
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,790
So we must send elite troops and capable generals to guard it

303
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,670
in order to alleviate the crisis and boost morale.

304
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,700
Lord Di Lin's beloved wife is pregnant

305
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,920
and he commands the Ministry of Military and Legal Affairs.

306
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,350
On both public and personal levels, it seems that he doesn't need to get involved.

307
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,020
But Fang Jin is dead and Ming Hui has lost his senses.

308
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,630
Si Yilin went to Payi.

309
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,300
We have no available commanders.

310
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,150
There is a longstanding rivalry between you and Lord Di Lin.

311
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,870
And this battle is perilous.

312
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,520
If you ask him to go to Wayun,

313
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,390
it may inevitably arouse suspicion.

314
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,150
It's not a problem for me.

315
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,480
The problem is with Lord Chieftain.

316
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,690
It depends on whether Lord Chieftain

317
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,290
dares to let him lead troops.

318
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,800
My Lord.

319
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,090
My Lord, please don't.

320
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,580
Don't worry about it.

321
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,030
I have a favour to ask.

322
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,250
I hope you can promise me.

323
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,450
My Lord, just tell me what you need.

324
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,800
Now that Wayun is in danger,

325
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,250
if you think I'm qualified to be your support,

326
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,330
I will do my best.

327
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,160
I know you will risk your life

328
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,570
for the Zichuan family.

329
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,080
But your beloved wife is pregnant.

330
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,120
She needs someone to take care of her.

331
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,340
We both know that

332
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,770
it's not easy

333
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,430
to win this battle.

334
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,270
You can put your life aside,

335
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,940
but you have a family.

336
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,740
If I were you,

337
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,700
I would have hesitated.

338
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,400
My Lord, since I was a child, I knew

339
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,800
that without a country, there is no home.

340
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,470
I will never prioritize my personal matters

341
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,000
over the safety and well-being of the nation.

342
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:26,780
Di Lin, it's my family that has forced you to juggle between your family and the country.

343
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,560
It's my incompetence that has caused this.

344
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,400
It's not true.

345
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,580
If I go to battle,

346
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,910
I will spare no effort,

347
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,860
for Zichuan and for my family, giving my all.

348
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,670
Since you didn't let me down,

349
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,980
I will not let you down.

350
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,690
I've made up my mind.

351
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,550
During your expedition,

352
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,380
I'll invite your wife to the Chieftain's Mansion.

353
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,160
I will treat her with the highest honors

354
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,810
according to the Zichuan family's tradition,

355
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,770
relieving your concerns.

356
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,130
Thank you, My Lord.

357
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,780
I'm counting on you.

358
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,150
Di Lin's rush to Wanyun is meritorious to the court.

359
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,930
Lady Lin Xiujia, the wife of Di Lin, is bestowed the title of Lady Fuyuan,

360
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,060
and relocated to the Chieftain's Mansion for recuperation.

361
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,490
She will be treated with the utmost respect by the Zichuan family,

362
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,250
and given the treatment befitting a princess.

363
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,640
How can I

364
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,070
be as capable as Lord Chieftain?

365
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,000
A simple reward

366
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,820
can solve all the worries.

367
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,330
What worries does Lord Chieftain have?

368
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,130
Di Lin is the Executioner on the Battlefield.

369
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,460
He is deeply cunning

370
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,740
and his ambitions are inscrutable.

371
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,190
This time, rushing to Wayun requires him to take command of the troops, a heavy responsibility.

372
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,790
But once in control,

373
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,930
who would willingly relinquish such power?

374
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,750
It's a good way to solve it.

375
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,460
These are all your personal belongings.

376
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,960
I've tidied them up for you, one by one.

377
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,270
I'll only be gone for a few days

378
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,730
and will return promptly.

379
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,750
They say the crisis in Yuanzhou is fierce.

380
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,320
Do you truly have the confidence to return triumphantly?

381
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,680
My wife is alone at home.

382
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,210
If I can't overcome all the difficulties and come back soon,

383
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,650
how can I be your husband?

384
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,430
Your intentions are known

385
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,870
to you,

386
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,150
to me, and certainly to Lord Chieftain.

387
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,450
But after all, he is Lord Chieftain.

388
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,240
Don't be troubled or distracted.

389
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,350
Perhaps I am too naive.

390
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,630
You always see through me.

391
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,110
You've done well.

392
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,730
It's just that I know you too well.

393
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,130
I'm a soldier of Zichuan.

394
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,370
It's my duty to fight for Zichuan.

395
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,950
It's just that Lord Chieftain has concerns as a ruler,

396
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,480
and as his subjects, I should understand him.

397
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,720
It's just it'll be hard for you and our child.

398
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,350
Why would it be hard for me?

399
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,860
You know I have a big appetite.

400
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,160
Now,

401
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,910
I can enjoy the cuisine

402
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,150
in the Chieftain's Mansion.

403
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,530
I'm very happy.

404
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,900
I've noticed your taste has changed lately.

405
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,950
If you want to eat anything,

406
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,010
you must tell them.

407
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,900
Don't inconvenience yourself.

408
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
I won't.

409
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,680
I used to dislike some dishes,

410
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,050
but now I like them.

411
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,860
I guess your son likes it.

412
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,820
How do you know it's a son?

413
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,810
I think it's a daughter.

414
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,890
Then why did you make some wooden swords secretly?

415
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,780
Do you want our daughter

416
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,810
to go to the battlefield like you?

417
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,160
I can't hide anything from you.

418
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,530
But not only did I make wooden swords,

419
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,480
but also hairpins.

420
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
But I'm not good at needlework.

421
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,320
It's a little ugly.

422
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,910
Is this a hairpin?

423
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,350
You're making fun of me again.

424
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,560
This trip is dangerous.

425
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,430
Do you still remember what I said?

426
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,160
Of course.

427
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,040
I remember every word you said.

428
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,090
Then recite it to me.

429
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,710
In times of peace, never skip meals or neglect meat.

430
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,450
When I can rest, undress myself.

431
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,700
When I'm injured, I shouldn't delay treatment

432
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,630
or refuse medicine.

433
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,780
It's good to miss you, but don't miss you too much.

434
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:06,900
I'm leaving.

435
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,890
Be careful.

436
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,590
Go.

437
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,450
Divine Emperor, I have the freshest prey to present.

438
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,160
This is the corpse of Fang Jin,

439
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,620
the commanding officer of Zichuan's elite Black Banner Army.

440
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,190
We successfully captured

441
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,650
both Moon Bay and Payi, two important towns.

442
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,870
I want to ask for a reward for my army.

443
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:08,940
What about his head?

444
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,080
[Divine Emperor of Sairong]

445
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
I cut it off myself.

446
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,200
Perhaps my men were too excited, and it got lost.

447
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,650
Each soldier who captured Moon Bay and Payi

448
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,510
will be rewarded with five lambs

449
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,190
and ten mammoth deer.

450
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,910
Thank you, Divine Emperor. Long live the Divine Emperor.

451
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,110
Divine Emperor, I want a reward too.

452
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,510
Fang Jin ended up in a desperate situation

453
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,380
because I knew the terrain of Moon Bay.

454
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,460
The successful capture of Payi

455
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,630
was also because

456
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,720
I knew its structure and the distribution of Zichuan troops.

457
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,880
And, it was me who opened the door

458
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,420
to victory for the North Clan soldiers.

459
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,490
I heard you killed Ge Yingxing.

460
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,410
I fought him twice.

461
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,510
One win and one loss.

462
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,950
You could beat him?

463
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,700
Lord Ge committed suicide.

464
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,830
Traitors will always be traitors.

465
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,150
That's right.

466
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,160
Now he betrayed Zichuan

467
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,510
and killed Ge Yingxing;

468
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,960
he will betray the North Clan one day.

469
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,920
Divine Emperor.

470
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,170
It's okay. I'm not afraid of his betrayal.

471
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,890
Give him the knife.

472
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,240
Once you eat the prey,

473
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,080
you will be a great general of the North Clan.

474
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,270
My Lord.

475
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,150
I've long heard that

476
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,440
human meat is the delicacy of the world.

477
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,790
Today,

478
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,210
I finally got what I wanted.

479
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,250
Human flesh stinks.

480
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,880
Never mind.

481
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:02,610
Order to bestow the title of Pingjing Duke upon Lei Hong.

482
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

483
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,340
I'll definitely be loyal to you.

484
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,380
What should we do next?

485
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,880
Let's go west to cross the Chishuitan.

486
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,880
Then gather our forces and head straight for Wayun.

487
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,280
Once Wayun falls,

488
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,650
we can easily take down Zichuan.

489
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,750
Did you hear that?

490
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,330
Lead the troops to the front line immediately.

491
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,200
I'll wait for your good news in Maple Forest.

492
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,960
Let's go.

494
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,280
Divine Emperor.

495
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,760
The soldiers of Zichuan

496
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,310
rely on their commanders.

497
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,430
There are three people in Zichuan who need our special attention.

498
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,270
The Tiger of Zichuan, Si Yilin.

499
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,510
The Executioner on the Battlefield, Di Lin.

500
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,550
And there's one more, the Flower of Yuanzhou, Zichuan Xiu.

501
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,179
What flower?

502
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,030
This is a nickname for Zichuan Xiu in Yuanzhou.

503
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,350
Don't be fooled by his appearance of being absent-minded all day.

504
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,880
In fact, he harbors deep schemes in his heart.

505
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,030
He's a genius at devising strategies from behind the scenes

506
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,830
and winning victories from afar.

507
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,040
Just based on his nickname,

508
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,000
I'll remember him.

509
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,230
Did you come alone?

510
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,190
I came by myself.

511
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,489
But I brought you something.

512
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,909
I also brought you a message.

513
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,219
Tell me. What is it?

514
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,630
The North Clan

515
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,510
has really gone all out this time.

516
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,390
According to the preliminary assessment,

517
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,870
the number of their soldiers is 100,000.

518
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,050
Fine.

519
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,970
Their two main generals are even more interesting.

520
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,380
Ka Dun and Ka Lan

521
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,410
have both sent out their most capable lieutenants,

522
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,100
Yun Qianxue and Lu Di.

523
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,870
Lu Di is our old friend.

524
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,670
I remember. He's a simple military commander,

525
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,030
born in poverty,

526
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,040
who earned a title through his own martial prowess.

527
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,410
As for Yun Qianxue,

528
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,690
one word, handsome.

529
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,740
He comes from a noble family

530
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,070
and good at strategies.

531
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,960
But these can't cover his defining trait,

532
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,950
his good looks. He's the only one I feel

533
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,840
could threaten

534
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,100
my position as "the Flower in Yuanzhou".

535
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,710
Now that I think about it,

536
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,990
I feel so stressed.

537
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,800
What about the Divine Emperor of Sairong?

538
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
Has he made any moves?

539
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,070
You finally hit the nail on the head.

540
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,210
The Divine Emperor is currently

541
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,030
heading towards the Maple Forest

542
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,560
on the North Clan's border in Dusha Province.

543
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,140
Maple Forest?

544
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,080
The Divine Emperor of Sairong has long wanted to wage war against us in Zichuan.

545
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,430
His determination has been set.

546
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,260
He was just waiting for the right time.

547
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,450
Now the Divine Emperor is old.

548
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,100
The question of who will inherit the throne

549
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,430
depends on which prince

550
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,160
performs better this time.

551
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,310
Look, Lu Di and Yun Qianxue

552
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,470
have already received orders

553
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,310
to march westward from the Chishuitan

554
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,480
straight towards Wayun.

555
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,390
This rebellion

556
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,270
has cost us too much.

557
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,720
It seems we can't afford to face the enemy head-on.

558
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,600
There are only two options now.

559
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:41,930
That's right.

560
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,620
But

561
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,490
neither defending Wayun

562
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,010
nor attacking Payi

563
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,310
appeals to me.

564
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,440
Big Brother knows you so well.

565
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,200
He knew you wouldn't like them.

566
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
so you must have come up with a third option.

567
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,310
So he sent me to help you.

568
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,480
This is a risky move.

569
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,100
Have you thought it through?

570
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,900
Yes.

571
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,350
I'll go straight to the Maple Forest.

572
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,990
Okay, let's rock-paper-scissors.

573
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,560
The winner will attack Maple Forest.

574
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,390
The loser will take Payi.

575
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,700
No need.

576
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,130
You'll handle the feint attack.

577
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,270
You're good at putting on a show.

578
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,770
Don’t worry, Second Brother.

579
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,970
Don't you know me?

580
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,620
Running away after taking a bite

581
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,750
is what I excel at.

582
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,690
It's not fun.

583
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,230
The walls of Wayun Fortress are severely damaged.

584
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,390
I'm not sure if they can withstand

585
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,590
the North Clan's attack.

586
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,090
If the North Clan's main forces arrive soon

587
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,490
and launch a full-scale assault on the city,

588
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,930
Wayun Fortress may be difficult to defend.

589
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,540
It will require extensive repairs to the city walls.

590
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Why so few people?

591
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,110
We're short-handed.

592
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,960
Apart from a few defenders,

593
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,580
there are only noble officers and injured soldiers from the family.

594
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,640
Those nobles are reluctant to leave,

595
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,310
fearing they'll lose their mining rights in Yuanzhou.

596
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,570
They've been staying at Wayun Fortress.

597
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,380
I'm just a low-ranking officer,

598
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,170
so I can't force them to move.

599
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,450
Then please inform them

600
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,800
that if they don't come to repair the city walls,

601
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,130
I, Di Lin, will personally go and ask them.

602
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,100
Have a seat.

603
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,760
How's the calculation going?

604
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,920
Boss, we've made a fortune this time.

605
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,120
Good.

606
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,660
Then take some men and spend all the money

607
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,900
buying provisions in nearby prosperous towns.

608
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,560
No problem.

609
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,570
I'll buy more wine and meat.

610
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,900
No. Spend all the money on provisions.

611
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,320
How much can you buy with this?

612
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,830
If we only buy provisions,

613
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
it'll be enough for us and the Palace Guards for a year.

614
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,960
Then let's prepare some fake ones as well.

615
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,880
We need to make it look real.

616
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,830
We need to prepare at least the amount for three years.

617
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,280
Okay.

618
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,240
When I came to your camp,

619
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,020
I heard that you

620
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,290
erupted in fury.

621
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,180
I came to you

622
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,790
because the Divine Emperor ordered me to do so.

623
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,950
Bear it no matter how unhappy you are.

624
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,470
Why would I be unhappy about you coming?

625
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,040
I'm angry about those subordinates of mine.

626
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,380
Do you know how embarrassed I was when I met the Divine Emperor this time?

627
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,620
No matter how chaotic the battlefield was,

628
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,050
did they really need to lose the head

629
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,250
of the enemy general?

630
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,790
Your soldiers were just focused on bravely killing enemies.

631
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,010
Mistakes are bound to happen.

632
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:05,930
You can ask the surrender general, Lei Hong, for help.

633
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,070
[Yun Qianxue]

634
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,260
As long as he says he is Fang Jin,

635
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,320
everything will be fine.

636
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,450
He's a despicable person,

637
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,170
climbing to power by betraying his brothers.

638
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,770
I disdain associating with such individuals.

639
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,000
What's even more infuriating

640
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,610
is that he actually received a title,

641
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,970
being named the Pingjing Duke.

642
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,870
If it were you,

643
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,440
would you ask him for help?

644
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,070
Si Yilin has already passed Chishuitan.

645
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,670
But all the spies and scouts

646
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,780
have lost track of his whereabouts.

647
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,760
He must be lying low somewhere.

648
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,460
I will find him.

649
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,430
Report!

650
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,510
We've found Si Yilin.

651
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,030
Tell me.

652
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,530
Si Yilin diverted from the Yuntai Grand Road

653
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,590
and made a night raid,

654
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,030
heading towards Er City.

655
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,790
Where is he going?

656
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,640
Is Si Yilin trying to “save Zhao by besieging Wei”?

657
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,430
Report!

658
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,580
Si Yilin has issued a challenge,

659
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,320
aiming directly for Maple Forest.

660
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,970
Bastard!

661
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,980
As expected.

662
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,040
Si Yilin's military provisions have all been identified.

663
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,800
Show me.

664
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,220
Yes.

665
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,350
Gather the troops

666
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,730
and set out for Maple Forest immediately.

667
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,290
Lord Lu Di.

668
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,550
I don't think it's that simple.

669
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,210
Of course, I know it's not that simple.

670
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,710
If it were an ordinary general, they would surely think,

671
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,970
why make such a big fuss

672
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,800
about attacking Maple Forest?

673
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,560
If they gave up the attack,

674
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,850
at least it would divert the troops.

675
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,390
But I'm not that kind of brainless brute.

676
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,220
Look how much food he has prepared.

677
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,190
This is not just about dividing the troops

678
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,650
to break the siege of Payi.

679
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,500
He really intends to attack Maple Forest.

680
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,280
Even if our powerful Emperor is not hindered by Si Yilin,

681
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,240
he will still be caught off guard

682
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,760
and Si Yilin will elevate his military prestige.

683
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,320
Does he think I'm a fool?

684
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,970
How did he manage to gather

685
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,270
so many provisions in such a short time?
