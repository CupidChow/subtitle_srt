00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,040
June 27, 2036

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,000
Ning Manzou, the top detective of Tui Town

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,600
received a message from someone called "The Pusher"

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,560
They arranged to meet at the riverside watchtower of Wukenai

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,080
But shortly after Detective Ning arrived

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,880
a patrolling security guard informed him

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,160
"Come quick!"

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,920
The Pusher had jumped to his death

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,760
The Pusher

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,800
The legs were broken at this angle

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,680
The Pusher jumped

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,280
This matter is suspicious.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,160
Ning Tuian conducted an investigation into this matter.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,640
First, what is it?

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,680
There's an accomplice.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
Once the mechanism was triggered,

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,800
he jumped from the building.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,840
He was injected with some kind of drug,

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
which caused him to jump.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,080
He experienced hallucinations.

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,520
I saw two women in my vision.

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
Because these images kept flashing back,

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,360
I began to suspect that inside my body

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,520
lived another person.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,760
I really enjoyed cutting off people's fingers

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,360
and making them into a necklace.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,680
I became addicted to that feeling of

28
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,400
self-mutilation.

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,680
Four suspects were discovered,

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,480
all patients at the Cyber Psychiatric Hospital,

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,240
suffering from intermittent amnesia.

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,120
Diagnosed with cyber psychosis,

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,200
including delusions,

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,120
split personality,

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,040
violent tendencies,

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,520
and self-harm.

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,160
None of you four had

38
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,280
a motive to kill Tuishou.

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
However, the four had no motive to kill the deceased Tuishou.

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,560
Instead, they wanted to kill each other.

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,040
They'd kill just to get a necklace.

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,520
You have dirt on me.

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,160
We must avenge Jin Sangzi.

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,200
You want to kill me.

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
Killing him is like killing Baba.

46
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,880
Besides abusing children,

47
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,840
he would also livestream it

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,120
for certain special audiences.

49
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,520
So I decided to stalk him

50
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,800
and find an opportunity to strike.

51
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
As the investigation continued,

52
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,280
they discovered a confidential archive storage device.

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,640
They learned the memory gaps

54
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
were caused by brain-machine surgery.

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
The bearer and the carrier.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,800
The daughter, Babi, would become

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,920
the brain-machine bearer for her father Baba.

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,560
After undergoing the brain-machine separation procedure,

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
the separated individual will be divided into

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,760
a work persona and a life persona.

61
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,080
A sensory provider will be installed in Heli's body,

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,960
while the recipient will have

63
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,200
a sensory receiver installed.

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
Once he receives this command,

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
he must carry it out.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
The files on white noise

67
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,120
were stolen by a critical patient from the third floor

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,840
The group decides to investigate the third floor

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,960
This area is the ward

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,240
We've now arrived at a

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
We're at a hospital

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,760
Why are you hitting people?

73
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,040
White noise

74
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,880
Let's go crazy together

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
Let's go wild together

76
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,200
If you can't beat them, join them.

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
You're shouting louder than them.

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,520
Really?

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Sorry.

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,600
Is there a light?

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,280
You're crazy.

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,360
You're insane.

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
But this bed seems to be empty.

84
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,800
Bai Yangzuo

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Is that you, Bai Yangzuo?

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,360
Where's Bai Yangzuo?

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,440
Bai Yangzuo

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,600
I hear your voice, Bai Yangzuo

89
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,880
Where are you?

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Bai Yangzuo

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Are you Bai Yangzuo?

92
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,960
You're not Bai Yangzuo

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,680
Where is Bai Yangzuo?

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,880
Bai Yangzuo

95
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,840
Can we turn on the lights?

96
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,200
You came, didn't you, Bai Yangzuo?

97
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,640
Where are you? I can't see you

98
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Bai Yangzuo

99
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,240
White Noise

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,040
You finally came

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,840
White Noise

102
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,960
White Noise

103
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you remember me?

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,640
White Noise

105
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,440
It's me

106
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,280
Your good friend

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,560
White Noise

108
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
White Noise

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,760
I can't sleep without you

110
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,600
Wait a moment

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,640
Hold on

112
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Just a second

113
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,160
Wait

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,000
What did you call him?

115
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,320
White Noise

116
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,560
His name is Bai Yangzuo

117
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,000
Bai Yangzuo

118
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,560
His brain-machine rebirth agreement

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,880
It's all written here with me

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Black and white in writing

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,560
Bai

122
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,280
Bai Yangzuo

123
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,600
He's my good friend White Noise

124
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,000
His product information is still with me

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,560
Right?

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
You remember, don't you?

127
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
White Noise

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,040
What product information do you have?

129
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,240
I deleted all his files

130
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,240
No

131
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,160
You're remembering wrong again

132
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,240
After deletion, we each kept a copy

133
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,920
The "Bai Yangzuo" on his product information

134
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,480
Was crossed out

135
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
And rewritten as "White Noise"

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
Who exactly are you?

137
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,160
I'm White Noise.

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,920
See? I told you he's my good friend.

139
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,480
White Noise.

140
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
You claim to be White Noise?

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,280
Yes, that's right.

142
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,800
That doesn't make sense.

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
How can you prove he's White Noise?

144
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,720
I couldn't sleep.

145
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,000
It was you who used your own...

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,720
human-shaped sleep-inducing Hakimi magic...

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
to cure my insomnia.

148
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,480
Don't you remember?

149
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Right.

150
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,920
He's our town's sleep-inducing master.

151
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,040
And nothing can wake him up.

152
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,800
Prove it to me.

153
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,960
Here, let me soothe your brother.

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,880
How?

155
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,640
Have a seat.

156
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,400
Okay.

157
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Human-shaped sleep-inducing Hakimi...

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,000
Look, completely relaxed.

159
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
So impressive

160
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,040
There's one more thing that proves

161
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,400
I have the ability to lull people to sleep

162
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,720
It's because of this watch

163
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
And I often use this watch

164
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,920
to monitor sleep

165
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,520
Don't you remember

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
My weekly sleep report data

167
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,360
is excellent

168
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,960
Look

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
This is my data from yesterday

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
All thanks to this watch

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,440
It works really well

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,560
Just now after he fell asleep

173
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,240
he barely responded

174
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
He woke up on his own

175
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,200
Get someone else to prove it to me

176
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,840
That brother sitting there

177
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,200
looks a bit tired

178
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,880
You try it

179
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,360
Your face shows exhaustion

180
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,440
Your face is all red

181
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
Come on, lull him to sleep

182
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,520
Let's go to the bed

183
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,160
Heli

184
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,960
Come to this bed

185
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,600
Lull me to sleep

186
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
Make me fall asleep

187
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,080
You see

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,960
This time I trust my white noise

189
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,080
After being lulled to sleep, nothing can wake him

190
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,360
I can only show my

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,440
real skills now

192
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,560
You won't hit the back of my head, right?

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,200
A strike to the back of the head would knock you out

Look, he's asleep

197
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,760
I told you he's my white noise

198
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,080
And it's written in the product information

199
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,000
You can take a look

200
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Bai Yangzuo has been crossed out

201
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,840

He just helps your sister sleep

207
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,960

Meaning this body has been used extensively

227
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,080
How tragic, I'm just a tool

228
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,080
Friend

229
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,000
I know your memory is compromised now

230
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,520
This is your brain-machine revival agreement

231
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,520
Look at the name on it

232
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,640
Who exactly are you?

233
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,880
I'm telling you he is Bai Yangzuo

234
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,960
He is Bai Yangzuo

235
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,720
He is Bai Yangzuo

236
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,640
He's definitely Bai Yangzuo

237
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,920
Brain-Machine Rebirth Agreement by Bai Yangzuo

238
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
He is Bai Yangzuo

239
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,320
With family consent

240
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Currently suffering from cerebral hemorrhage

241
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,440

Brain-Machine Rebirth project

245
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,720
When brain-machine rebirth technology matures

246
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,960
The preserved subject will undergo brain-machine interface surgery

247
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,080
Implanting a human brain-machine rebirth chip

248
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,760
through the brain-machine interface

249
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,400
This will enable the chip to control bodily functions

250
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,720
Allowing normal daily life

251
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,440
The family only needs to pay

252
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
The surgery and preservation fees

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,440
To have Bai Yangzuo returned to them

254
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,160
Note: The brain-machine rebirth technology

255
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,360
Cannot preserve the subject's original memories

256
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,640
Family member signature - relinquishment agreement

257
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
Contract signed in 2018

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Additional note: family member deceased

259
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,360
Due to long-term non-payment of cryopreservation fees

260
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,320
Agreement voided

261
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,840
Bai Yangzuo now belongs to CyberCorp

262
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
Can be used as customized

263
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Special merchandise

264
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Personal companion cyborg

265
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,960
So you're just a personal companion

266
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
You're just merchandise

267
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,680
No wonder he's perpetually 35

268
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,200
Yes, I'm a companion robot

269
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,960
Now you're beneath us

270
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,200
Exactly

271
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,720
Why?

272
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,600
We're humiliated daily in the exhibition hall

273
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Being humiliated

274
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,320
In this world, humans are first class

275
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Animals are second class

276
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,440
Plants are third class

277
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
Plastic is fourth class

278
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,080
We're at the bottom

279
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,440
Why?

280
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,200
Because

281
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,840
We are human

282
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,800
Because we're human

283
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,320
Just obey your robot protocols

284
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,800
Alright?

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,520
At this point

286
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,200
I can only feel deep sorrow

287
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,920
So this thing of ours

288
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
has already come out, right?

289
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,040
Is there anything else here?

290
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,520
He woke up again

291
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,720
I suddenly remembered something

292
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,560
Go ahead

293
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,920
I vaguely remember you three.

294
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,040
Where have you seen us?

295
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,280
But you're from the general ward on the second floor.

296
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
I used to see you guys on the second floor all the time.

297
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
Scribbling all over the place.

298
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,560
Next time you do it,

299
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,520
invite me to join you.

300
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,160
Alright.

301
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,920
I love doodling on walls the most.

302
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm going to sleep now.

303
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,040
It's pretty late now.

304
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,400
Always seeing you guys scribbling on the second floor.

305
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Let's go.

306
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
Second floor.

307
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,040
Let's go.

308
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
Look, the lights are on.

309
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,800
Now that the lights are on, you dare to go in?

310
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
When have I ever been afraid?

311
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,280
We'll go to the second floor later.

312
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,760
Move aside.

313
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Don't stand in front blocking the way.

314
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,360
They won't come after us later, will they?

315
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,080
No.

316
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,440
Our benefits are really good

317
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
Check inside your drawers

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,640
Take a look

319
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,480
There's a box underneath

320
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,960
Under Xiao Ba's bed

321
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Is this yours?

322
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,440
Can we conduct a thorough search today?

323
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,160
When I passed by the second floor earlier,

324
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,720
I often saw you scribbling and drawing on the walls.

325
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
Just random doodles.

326
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,360
You seem to enjoy scribbling around.

327
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,080
But it doesn’t look like you’ve drawn anything.

328
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,400
Check behind that posted paper.

329
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,080
It must be hidden behind it.

330
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,880
Really?

331
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,760
No

332
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,760
That flashlight

333
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,080
Is it because of that flashlight?

334
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Possibly

335
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,120
No

336
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,720
Scribbling on the wall

337
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,000
Shelf

338
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,480
It should be here

339
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
This part of the wall, I feel...

340
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,680
Come on

341
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,320
Come on, three, two, one

342
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,120
That's it, we're done here.

343
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,840
This is the end.

344
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,480
Just this piece.

345
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Tear this part off.

346
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
I don't want to live anymore

347
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
This life is unbearable

348
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
I might as well just die

349
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,280
Why do I keep having suicidal thoughts

350
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
The medical staff immediately know about it

351
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,080
I can't even control myself

352
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,760
I don't deserve to live

353
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,640
How do they know so quickly

354
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,280
I'm going to kill myself

355
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,000
This is so strange

356
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I can't even die properly

357
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,440
So all our past conflicts were just misunderstandings

358
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,920
Our conflicts were all misunderstandings

359
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,720
Not wanting to be objectified or treated as tools

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,920
We could only huddle together for warmth

361
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,640
May 20, 2036

362
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,000
We became friends

363
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
This was written by four people.

364
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,160
The four of you wrote this, right?

365
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, doesn't this mean...

366
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,440
That the four of us have...

367
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,600
Our murderous intentions toward each other...

368
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
Have all been resolved?

369
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
It's all clear now, and...

370
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,440
Because we can't control ourselves.

371
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,000
Right.

372
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,440
Exactly.

373
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,920
It's unbearable, I want to die.

374
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,240
Want to escape this suffering.

375
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

376
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,880
Even living means being controlled by others.

377
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,680
Want to die but can't.

378
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,040
Right.

379
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,600
It's so strange.

380
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,520
Can't even die.

381
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,480
So if you kill this instigator, you'll be able to...

382
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,120
Die then?

383
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,520
No, you'll be free, right?

384
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
We thought that was the case.

385
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,680
So we identified someone...

386
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,920
To kill the instigator.

387
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,520
I see.

388
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,520
It's open

389
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,120
How did you open it?

390
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,200
520

391
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,400
We became friends on May 20th

392
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,680
It's started

393
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,080
June 20th

394
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,920
I really can't take the white noise anymore

395
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,240
If memories could be erased

396
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
and bodies could be repaired

397
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,800
does that mean the harm never existed?

398
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Is this how reborn people should be -

399
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,120
treated as mere objects by them?

400
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,080
Babi says I'm the same

401
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,000
Even when he's gone, he still controls me

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,960
I've always been a puppet in his eyes

403
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,120
not a living human being

404
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
Might as well just die

405
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
Heli says I'm just

406
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,800
a tool for rich people to get dopamine

407
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,080
Anyway, the money I saved from streaming

408
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,280
is enough for my family to live comfortably

409
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,960
The scientist Ke says

410
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
But friends,

411
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,280
haven't we all tried to kill ourselves?

412
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,840
We all failed

413
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,760
I later discovered

414
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,000
we have alarm systems implanted in us

415
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,360
That's why whenever I have suicidal thoughts

416
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,560
medical staff immediately know

417
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,480
How do they find out so quickly

418
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,760
that I'm going to kill myself?

419
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,360
Ba's suicide would affect father's interests

420
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,800
He's suicide would affect

421
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,440
the interests of the stream sponsors

422
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,320
My suicide would affect the company's interests

423
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,160
Bai is a mechanically enhanced human

424
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,960
In their eyes, he's company property

425
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,720
So we've even been stripped

426
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,680
of the right to kill ourselves

427
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,600
I can't commit suicide

428
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,960
Heli said since that's the case,

429
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,680
let's help each other out.

430
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,080
Kill each other for mutual liberation.

431
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,400
Babi said, "How twisted - I love it."

432
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,160
White Noise said, "As long as it gives me complete release."

433
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,440
Let's plan this carefully.

434
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,320
Planning group suicide.

435
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
Mutual group killing.

436
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,080
Mutual killing.

437
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,520
This was from June 20th.

438
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Then on June 26th we chatted again.

439
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,600
Babi said, "Let's execute our plan."

440
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,080
Heli said, "Tomorrow I'll prepare a hammer."

441
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,160
Babi said, "I'll prepare a medical case."

442
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,840
White Noise said, "I'll prepare a pillow."

443
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,440
Kexuejia said, "I'll prepare syringes."

444
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
Obtained some extremely potent toxin.

445
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,520
One injection causes death in 40 minutes.

446
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,960
Babi said, "Ke, inject me with poison first."

447
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Bai will smother Ke with a pillow.

448
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,080
Hei will hammer Bai, then I'll smash Hei.

449
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,840
Like a tongue twister.

450
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,000
Finally, I'll die from the poison in 40 minutes.

451
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,600
Perfect.

452
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,280
White Noise said, "Wonderful."

453
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Hope in our next lives,

454
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,520
we can all control our own destinies.

455
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,840
Kexuejia said, "Friends,"

456
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
"tomorrow is our liberation day."

457
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
"Thank you for accompanying me to the end."

458
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,840
"I wonder if this person"

459
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,280
"was trying to save us or"

460
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,880
"that's why he killed the pusher."

461
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,320
"Yes, that's possible."

462
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,400
"If he wanted to kill this pusher"

463
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,320
"to save us,"

464
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,640
"why would we kill each other first?"

465
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,600
We didn't die.

466
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,440
The four of us currently don't have these memories.

467
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,280
Before watching this, right?

468
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,640
You make a good point.

469
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
This person thinks...

470
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,520
maybe killing him...

471
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,160
is the only way the four of us can truly be free.

472
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,840
Right.

473
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,120
Not sure, I'm just guessing.

474
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,960
I don't know if I'm right.

475
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Time for injections.

476
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
Come on, gather up.

477
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,520
Gather up.

478
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Can you demonstrate...

479
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,880
our cyber psychiatric hospital's...

480
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,840
team spirit?

481
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,120
What if we refuse?

482
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,440
I'll increase your dosage.

483
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
I'll call nurses to hold you down.

484
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,720
Fine.

485
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,240
We're not even afraid of death...

486
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,920
why would we fear you?

487
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Come on then.

488
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,440
Show our psychiatric hospital's spirit.

489
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,880
Count off.

490
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,640
One.

491
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,040
Two.

492
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,440
Three.

493
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,800
Four.

494
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,800
Five.

495
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,720
Dilraba's dad

496
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,600
It's you

497
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,760
Dilraba's dad

498
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,800
What's this about?

499
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,440
You're here

500
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
He's my father

501
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you remember me?

502
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,800
Last time you got your vision tested here

503
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,240
I was standing right here

504
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,880
You stood here last time

505
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,680
Yeah, acting all mysterious

506
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,200
Then standing there, you said it was 2.0

507
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,560
Then you stepped back a few paces

508
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,760
Here it measured 1.5

509
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,680
Finally

510
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,120
When you stood here, it was 1.2

511
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
That's not right.

512
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,120
How is that possible?

513
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,440
So he's sick too.

514
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Every time after your eye test,

515
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,320
you come to fiddle with this lock.

516
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,680
The lock's password...

517
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,360
Right, it's related to that, isn't it?

518
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,560
How about I teach you how to test vision?

519
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,200
Okay, show me how.

520
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,640
Just extend your hand.

521
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
Extend my hand.

522
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,440
One finger means single vision.

523
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,120
Two fingers stacked together

524
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
means double vision.

525
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Dad.

526
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,640
Dad, don't treat me like this.

527
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,360
Don't hit me.

528
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,560
Dad, don't hit me.

529
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,480
Don't hit me, Dad.

530
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,800
Dad, please don't hit me.

531
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,040
Li Huanxiang.

532
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,560
You're wandering off again.

533
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,000
This patient

534
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,240
keeps pretending to be a nurse.

535
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,200
Your condition is clearly worsening.

536
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,880
Come with me to the third floor.

537
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Wait.

538
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,440
The rest of you stay in your rooms.

539
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,880
Where would we go?

540
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,120
Your symptoms are because you have

541
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,640
cyberpsychosis.

542
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,600
Stay put.

543
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,080
Someone will come to give you a shot later.

544
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,000
Come with me, we're going back to the third floor.

545
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,240
Yes, this one.

546
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,880
First, crack the code.

547
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,400
Crack the code.

548
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,920
He did it like this earlier.

549
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,080
Roll both hands like this.

550
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,320
Just follow his example and look.

551
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,200
You can check the others.

552
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,080
There might be other numbers.

553
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
You try it.

554
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,440
Come on, brother.

555
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm trying.

556
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
You can't get it there.

557
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,840
I can get it.

558
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,320
Hurry up.

559
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,600
Seems related to number decryption.

560
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Right, you're quick with math.

561
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Can't figure it out.

562
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,400
It's quite intuitive.

563
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,440
Let's start with the simplest one first.

564
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
1.2, right?

565
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Up.

566
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,920
What does "up" mean?

567
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,720
If it means "up"...

568
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,600
For example, if we write "up"...

569
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,920
Then what's this?

570
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,880
Is it 1.5?

571
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,440
Is it really 1.5?

572
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,720
So it's horizontal, up, right.

573
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,200
Like this.

574
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
Is it based on strokes?

575
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,840
This is the stroke direction

576
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,720
Starting point

577
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,600
Right, down, left, up, up, right

578
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's the number 6

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,840
Okay

580
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,360
Come on

581
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,720
Let's go

582
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,560
Alright

583
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,760
First one is 6

584
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,080
Second is up-left, up-right, left

585
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,920
Second is 2

586
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,520
1

587
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,840
621

588
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,760
It's open

589
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,440
It's really open

590
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,960
Impressive

591
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,920
Solved it, applause

592
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,360
Up up 1

593
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,040
Right

594
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,960
Actually, this is the Tui Cyber Technology Company

595
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,240
Actually, this is the Tui Cyber Technology Company

596
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,240
What?

597
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,240
This is a wall, right?

598
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,960
There's nothing here

599
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,560
It's completely sealed off

600
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,720
Someone jumped down

601
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,880
What could it possibly be?

602
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,440
This person might not have come from

603
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,920
might not have descended from the fifth floor

604
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,480
Right, why is that?

605
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,840
When I came from outside today

606
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,720
I did look outside

607
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,080
There was a row of windows

608
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
The window we saw

609
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
might have been from the fifth floor

610
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
but that window was actually on the sixth floor

611
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,120
You mean

612
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,280
The second-floor window is sealed

613
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,720
So we can't see this window

614
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,000
So we can't see this window

615
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,080
The window we see on the fifth floor

616
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,040
is actually on the sixth floor

617
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,600
Right

618
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,640
Yes

619
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,560
Actually, the Cyber Psychiatric Hospital used to be

620
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,040
this Cyber Technology Company

621
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
back in 2018

622
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,680
What's the point of your dad coming to open this?

623
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,800
Dad

624
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,920
Call your dad over.

625
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
2018

626
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,320
No, we have a box that's never been opened.

627
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,200
Right?

628
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
Which box?

629
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,480
The box where you found the evidence.

630
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,560
A box from Cyber Tech Company.

631
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
There's something inside.

632
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,440
But we can't open it now.

633
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
It has a combination lock now.

634
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
And on that box...

635
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,960
This part happens to be erased.

636
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,040
2018

637
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,200
So the password should be 2018.

638
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,720
I'll go get that box.

639
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Okay.

640
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,560
Be careful.

641
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,200
Then you go get it.

642
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,560
I'm not going, I'm not an investigator.

643
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,600
Where is it? I'll go.

644
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,320
First floor.

645
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
First floor, huh?

646
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,840
Never mind, I'll go.

647
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,480
You won't find it.

648
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,080
Let me do it, let me.

649
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,960
I can find it.

650
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,280
I need to move around.

651
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,800
I need to get some exercise.

652
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,600
Brother, you rest.

653
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,560
Fine, then you go look.

654
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,320
In my archive box.

655
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,200
Alright, bye.

656
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
Okay.

657
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,640
What the hell

658
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,640
Press this remote switch after entering the elevator

659
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,520
to access the sixth floor

660
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,880
The sixth floor is the legendary forbidden zone

661
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,760
Wait a minute

662
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,040
There's another paper underneath - a sticky note

663
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,080
I never expected that from the moment he built this tower

664
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,040
and founded Cyber Tech Corporation

665
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,040
he's been hiding a secret space no one knew about

666
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,320
If I hadn't accidentally discovered

667
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,640
this remote switch

668
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
I would never have known this building

669
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,280
actually has a sixth floor

670
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,920
I must expose his conspiracy

671
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,040
The mastermind

672
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,520
Whose conspiracy is he trying to expose?

673
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,480
I think it's Xiao Ba's conspiracy

674
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,880
Right?

675
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,920
Possibly

676
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,560
So it's the Xiao Ba killer

677
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,600
The security system lockdown

678
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,080
The lockdown only applies to his office, right?

679
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,560
Yes

680
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,320
Is it possible he was dying in his office

681
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
then dragged to the sixth floor and thrown down?

682
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,440
Could be

683
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:02,840
Exactly

684
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,080
Maybe there's a device on the sixth floor

685
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
programmed to throw him down

686
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,840
That's possible

687
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,200
So the office wasn't his actual death location

688
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Right, that's possible.

689
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,000
Right, this could be the place where he was controlled.

690
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,440
For example,

691
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,360
I punch him,

692
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,120
knock him out,

693
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,240
then carry him to the sixth floor.

694
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,280
The sixth floor is the actual crime scene.

695
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
Here's what I think.

696
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,080
Let's go to the sixth floor.

697
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,000
Makes sense.

698
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,880
Let's go.

699
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,200
But how do we get to the sixth floor?

700
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,280
With the remote control.

701
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,160
After entering the elevator,

702
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,560
use the remote control to go to the sixth floor.

703
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,040
Look at this elevator.

704
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,400
Bye.

705
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,880
It's stuck.

706
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,520
This elevator...

707
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,760
Okay, three, two, one...

708
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,680
Pressed it.

709
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,640
The authorities have discovered

710
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,280
Look

711
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,320
Electromagnetic adsorption point

712
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,480
Portable research operating table

713
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,440
When no research bed is available

714
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,360
The portable research table can be transported and positioned

715
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,760
Note: The research table can be suspended electromagnetically

716
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,480
and maintain balance

717
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,520
In case of power failure

718
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,600
One end of the electromagnetic plate will

719
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
What circumstances would cause power failure?

720
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,960
Dead people

721
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,640
What dead people?

722
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,080
If the boss dies, doesn't this place lose power?

723
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,640
If you unfortunately die

724
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,080
The entire building will lose power and network

725
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,760
To ensure core facilities cease operation

726
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,520
Because at that time we were

727
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,600
all together at the same time.

728
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,320
All of you have alibis.

729
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,040
I think it might be

730
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,400
a set-up mechanism.

731
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
A timed mechanism.

732
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,840
For example, when the time comes,

733
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,880
the mechanism triggers,

734
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
and he jumps from upstairs.

735
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,520
At that time we were

736
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,600
all together simultaneously.

737
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,320
You all have solid alibis.

738
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,920
When the boss died, didn't this place lose power?

739
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,880
During power outage, the electromagnetic plate

740
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,120
40 minutes.

741
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,480
Death occurs 40 minutes after injection.

742
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,920
It's poison.

743
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,440
Earlier you mentioned that poster about

744
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,120
Right.

745
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,360
The scientist said he prepared a syringe

746
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,280
and obtained a potent toxin.

747
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,200
One injection causes death in 40 minutes.

748
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,080
Wait a minute.

749
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,440
Normally it works like this:

750
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,280
The electromagnetic system -

751
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
The body is placed here,

752
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,640
there's a component that

753
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,360
when power cuts off, the body immediately

754
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,480
slides straight down.

755
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,880
Every time the window opens, after half hour

756
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,840
it automatically locks back.

757
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,880
Window opening record shows

758
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
window opened at 53 o'clock at night.

759
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,120
What do you mean 53 o'clock?

760
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,640
10:53 PM.

761
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Opened at 10:53.

762
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,360
Then closed at 11:23 PM.

763
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,920
It was continuously open for half hour.

764
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,640
That...

765
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
Now we have the murder process.

766
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,000
First knock him unconscious,

767
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,560
inject the drug and time it

768
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,160
40 minutes.

769
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,280
When he dies, power cuts off,

770
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,920
and his body immediately drops down.

771
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,440
Father's evidence of guilt

772
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,080
Father's incriminating evidence

773
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,880
Where did you find this?

774
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,160
The authorities have discovered

775
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,880
Look

776
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,040
The authorities

777
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,680
Here we have a brain-computer interface

778
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,120
Here we have a brain-computer interface

779
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,720
This

780
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,040
Let's search one more time.

781
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,440
Search again.

782
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,880
Search once more, then we'll go down to check.

783
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,880
Let's look for those things up there again.

784
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,440
Come on, today we mustn't miss any...

785
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,120
valuable clues.

786
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,640
Hammer, syringe

787
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,720
We've got the crime process

788
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,200
This pillow still has blood on it

789
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,200
Take it

790
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,400
Take everything

791
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,240
The window opened at 10:53 PM.

792
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,680
What time did he die?

793
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,360
He died at 11:22 PM.

794
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Today is June 27, 2036.

795
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,160
11:22 PM.

796
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,920
So this time is...

797
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,320
when his body fell.

798
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,520
Therefore, 10:53 PM...

799
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,920
is also a crucial time point.

800
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,120
Who opened the window?

801
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,480
His window...

802
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,080
automatically locked at 11:23 PM.

803
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
But the body...

804
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,800
fell at 11:22 PM.

805
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,360
(It fell at 11:22 PM.)

806
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,640
So he timed it precisely?

807
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,440
Of course.

808
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,760
Right.

809
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,320
So dying at 11:22 PM means...

810
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,880
Subtract 40...

811
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,520
Yes, subtract 40.

812
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,880
Correct.

813
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,600
18 minutes.

814
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,280
60.

815
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,320
50.

816
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,960
42.

817
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,640
The poison was injected at 10:42 PM.

818
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,840
Right?

819
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,760
Approximately.

820
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:37,960
Yes.

821
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
The poison was injected at 10:42 PM.

822
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
Let's go downstairs.

823
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,280
Go down.

824
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,600
Where to now?

825
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,120
Second floor.

826
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,600
Belongs to...

827
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Belongs to us...

828
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,200
A good place.

829
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,240
Let's take it one by one.

830
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,920
Right?

831
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,000
One by one.

832
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,600
Take it one by one.

833
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,120
This bed is hard enough.

834
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,880
There's no mattress on this bed.

835
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,960
Just a board.

836
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,000
So you have to lie on the blanket.

837
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,000
You can lie down

838
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,560
So you're pushing it off while lying down today?

839
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,000
Cover yourself with the blanket for a while

840
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,240
Take your socks off, it's more comfortable

841
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,560
Okay, no problem

842
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,360
I swear it'll just be five minutes

843
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,320
I'll be done in five minutes flat

844
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,680
No way, I don't believe you

845
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,000
Just give me five minutes

846
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't believe you, come on

847
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,320
Come on

848
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,120
Alright, let's go

849
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,040
This computer has been bumped.

850
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,360
What do you mean? What's wrong?

851
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,920
It's out of power.

852
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,880
Charging cable.

853
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,880
There's one on the fifth floor.

854
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,320
Then we have to go back to the office.

855
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,920
There's one next to the desk on the fifth floor.

856
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,680
It's more comfortable without socks.

857
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,920
Okay, no problem.

858
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,000
On the floor by the desk.

859
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,240
There's an outlet behind the desk.

860
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,560
Haven't you noticed a logical pattern?

861
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,000
It's on this box.

862
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,560
There's blood on the box too, see?

863
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,640
There's blood on the pillow too.

864
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,360
The pillow.

865
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,680
Where's the pillow?

866
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,040
Over there.

867
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,680
The bloody one, right?

868
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,200
Yes.

869
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,800
Is it possible someone used the box...

870
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,560
to hit him?

871
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,360
There's blood on this hammer.

872
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,560
The hammer has blood too.

873
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,680
Who used the hammer?

874
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,680
Let me check.

875
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
Ke injected me with poison.

876
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,120
Bai suffocated Ke with the pillow.

877
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,360
He then hammered Bai to death.

878
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,000
Right.

879
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,360
It's He's.

880
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,440
It's him.

881
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,880
Then I smashed He to death.

882
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,560
One possibility is

883
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,200
you've actually already carried this out

884
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,320
already died

885
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,120
died and then came back to life

886
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,320
You're too suspicious

887
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,120
because your death was by poisoning

888
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,480
so you switched places with him

889
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,960
There's a possibility

890
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,920
What's going on?

891
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
Why are you two patients here?

892
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,800
We came to get the charger.

893
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,200
Why are you here?

894
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,240
Of course I can be here.

895
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,560
What's wrong?

896
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,120
The security guard just asked me to deliver the autopsy report.

897
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,240
Where is it?

898
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Where is this place?

899
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,120
Of course I can be here.

900
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,160
Where is this place?

901
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,760
What do you mean?

902
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,520
What is this?

903
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,000
This is it.

904
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,920
The autopsy report was supposed to be given to a

905
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,000
detective named Ning.

906
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,760
We're together.

907
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,520
Where is he?

908
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,000
He's downstairs.

909
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,520
I'll deliver it to him.

910
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Yes, don't worry.

911
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,760
We're on the same team.

912
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Where's the charger?

913
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,760
Are you feeling better now?

914
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,000
Just give it to him.

915
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Please rest assured.

916
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,120
Then remember to return to your ward immediately.

917
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
I'll go ahead.

918
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay.

919
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,120
Wait, where are you going?

920
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,160
Let's take the elevator together.

921
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Second floor.

922
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,240
No need to remember.

923
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,880
Have someone take you to see that

924
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,760
detective of ours.

925
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,400
Then this confirms that person

926
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,240
The deceased is one of you four.

927
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,400
Deceased.

928
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,120
No, the murderer.

929
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,480
Someone's looking for you.

930
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,920
Someone's here to see you.

931
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,360
She's here to deliver something to you.

932
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,600
Detective Ning, you're here.

933
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,240
Go ahead.

934
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,480
I'm here to deliver the autopsy report.

935
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,520
Okay, thank you.

936
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,280
Bye.

937
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,560
The autopsy report indicates

938
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,720
Time of death: June 27, 1936.

939
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,960
Examination shows multiple fractures on the deceased's hands.

940
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,840
Organ rupture.

941
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,440
Multiple external injuries on the body.

942
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,840
Severe head trauma is particularly serious.

943
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,920
Determined to have suffered heavy blows.

944
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,320
Additionally, on the deceased's left

945
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,840
arm there's a small needle mark.

946
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,920
The deceased had been injected with a substance before death.

947
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,160
Needle mark - something was injected.

948
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,240
Blood test results.

949
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,120
The deceased's blood contained the potent "Tuilihai" toxin.

950
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,240
and "Cyber Confusion" drug.

951
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
The ultimate cause of death was

952
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,680
fatal poisoning by the "Tuilihai" toxin.

953
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,440
So he

954
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,000
didn't die from the fall.

955
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It was that poison, right?

956
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,040
Actually, that poison is more effective

957
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,200
because it allows better timing control.

958
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,720
Understood.

959
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,200
Right?

960
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,320
"Cyber Confusion" composition details:

961
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,760
"Cyber Confusion" is a powerful sedative.

962
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,800
Causes immediate unconsciousness upon inhalation.

963
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,880
Victims may naturally awaken after one hour depending on constitution.

964
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,640
Natural awakening.

965
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,400
Some special constitutions

966
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,040
may regain consciousness within one hour.

967
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,320
"Tuilihai" toxin composition details:

968
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,880
Potent purple liquid toxin.

969
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,160
Administered via injection.

970
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
40-minute incubation period.

971
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,880
Death occurs immediately upon activation.

972
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,360
That's exactly what I was talking about.

973
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,120
Here's some information.

974
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,760
Go ahead.

975
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
Read it out, my brother.

976
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,320
Ba Ba's brain-computer interface backend.

977
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,920
I know you've discovered

978
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,440
You modified the office security system

979
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,320
And connected your vital signs

980
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,280
To the building's power supply

981
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,880
Other than that

982
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,640
What other cards do you have to play against me?

983
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,040
You might as well join me

984
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
The Pusher said

985
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,800
I originally thought your research

986
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,880
Was meant to give people

987
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
A better life

988
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,120
Now I realize

989
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,120
You're just satisfying your own ambitions

990
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,440
From the moment I decided to oppose you

991
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,680
I knew I could die at any time

992
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,640
But I'll do everything to stop you

993
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Wait, who sent that to him earlier?

994
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,920
The brain-machine interface backend of one of us

995
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,400
Brain-machine backend

996
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
Was it Ba's dad's?

997
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Yes, Ba's dad's

998
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,000
But Ba's dad died before The Pusher

999
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,040
Fool. This world was always meant to be

1000
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,520
controlled by the most capable people.

1001
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,200
Only under my control will Tuizhen

1002
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,400
thrive and prosper.

1003
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,280
The Pusher says you're just a sick control freak.

1004
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,120
Your extreme need for control drove

1005
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
your daughter insane.

1006
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,240
He demanded I live entirely

1007
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,520
by his rules.

1008
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,640
Work,

1009
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,160
meals,

1010
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,960
everything had to follow his schedule.

1011
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,880
Diagnosis shows

1012
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,760
the patient suffers from

1013
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,680
cyberpsychosis

1014
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,400
and antisocial personality disorder.

1015
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,760
Daughter,

1016
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,880
what makes you think you're right?

1017
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,760
Dream on about controlling Tuizhen.

1018
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,280
You're exactly like Xiang Jingjing

1019
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,120
back then.

1020
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,120
I easily manipulated her into

1021
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,920
killing a streamer.

1022
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
I even disciplined

1023
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,120
that streamer's younger siblings.

1024
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,840
Then one day,

1025
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,000
when I regained consciousness,

1026
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,080
I found myself on the street

1027
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,640
holding a brick,

1028
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,000
standing over a woman I'd bludgeoned to death.

1029
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
In her thirties,

1030
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,280
with an ID badge identifying her as

1031
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,040
Xiang Jingjing, core researcher at Tui Cyber.

1032
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,880
I can do whatever I want

1033
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
with these ants.

1034
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,640
People are ends, not means.

1035
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,880
I will stop your conspiracy.

1036
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,800
Though ten thousand stand against me, I shall go.

1037
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,960
If I die mysteriously,

1038
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,600
Tui investigators will come looking.

1039
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
Tui Cyber Tech's

1040
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,120
schemes won't last much longer.

1041
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,200
You will be exposed.

1042
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,760
The brain-machine interface backend...

1043
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,880
I've learned of an interesting mutual-kill protocol.

1044
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,720
I can use it to kill you.

1045
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,760
If you don't want to live, then die.

1046
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,360
Why warn you before killing you?

1047
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,200
What about the voice memo?

1048
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,040
Don't forget.

1049
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,680
The promoter says I discovered that on the sixth floor

1050
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,800
there are a large number of unused encryption chips

1051
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,480
When Dilraba installs brain-machine interfaces for people

1052
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,440
he actually doesn't install encryption chips

1053
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Without encryption protection

1054
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,040
Dilraba can freely access from the backend

1055
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,440
and log into those people's brains

1056
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
I need to find a way to stop his scheme

1057
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,080
The promoter says

1058
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,600
I always feel like anyone around me

1059
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,680
could be Dilraba

1060
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,200
I have to find a way to quickly

1061
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,440
install encryption chips for those who lack them

1062
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,560
to prevent Dilraba from freely switching

1063
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,600
among numerous brain-machine interfaces

1064
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,560
and accessing them from the backend

1065
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,760
So Dilraba can become anyone

1066
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,080
Dilraba doesn't just become anyone

1067
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,440
he can manipulate anyone

1068
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,560
Manipulate anyone

1069
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,560
It's behind you

1070
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,800
There's that machine behind you

1071
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:09,800
This

1072
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,400
Right

1073
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,880
Brain-machine interface

1074
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,160
They're all empty shells

1075
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
The encryption is here

1076
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,920
Alright, look at this

1077
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,080
I've implanted

1078
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,360
a chip to monitor my vital signs

1079
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,800
connected to the office security system

1080
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,840
and the entire building's power supply

1081
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,720
I spend most of my time in the office

1082
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,200
If I'm killed in the office

1083
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,360
the doors and windows will automatically lock

1084
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
and the whole building will lose power for one minute

1085
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,600
No killer would be able to escape

1086
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,960
This increases the chances

1087
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,200
of tracking down the perpetrator

1088
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,720
The entire building loses power and network

1089
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,680
to ensure core facilities shut down

1090
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,080
preventing theft or

1091
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,600
transfer of confidential files

1092
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,160
I've already installed encryption chips

1093
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,560
in those who underwent your brain-machine surgery

1094
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,440
Only these four you're currently using

1095
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,800
haven't been installed yet

1096
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,520
Tonight I'm meeting with

1097
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,040
the top investigator from Tui Town

1098
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,640
I'll tell them everything

1099
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,040
I've discovered

1100
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,920
You can't escape

1101
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,560
Unknown voice source

1102
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,640
One day, I will still achieve my dream

1103
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,320
So dizzy

1104
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,040
That means

1105
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,160
The four of us

1106
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,840
weren’t implanted with that encryption chip

1107
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,240
The other robots all had it installed

1108
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,480
Xiao Ba can’t control

1109
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,600
So among the five of us

1110
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,760
one is Xiao Ba

1111
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,400
Then it must have been Xiao Ba's dad who killed him.

1112
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,840
Xiao Ba's dad did it.

1113
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,600
So Xiao Ba's dad killed him, right?

1114
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,080
That's right.

1115
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,840
Xiao Ba's dad was the driving force behind the killing.

1116
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,280
Exactly.

1117
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,360
No, but there's a USB drive here.

1118
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,640
Brain-machine usage log terminal system.

1119
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,320
Here, plug it in.

1120
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,640
Brain-machine interface instructions.

1121
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,760
There are four standard brain-machine interface techniques.

1122
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,240
Brain-machine loading and separation.

1123
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,880
Rebirth and sharing technology.

1124
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,760
Non-standard brain-machine interface techniques.

1125
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,000
Background login.

1126
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,600
Can access through brain-machine background login.

1127
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Infiltrate those without encrypted chips.

1128
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,520
Any brain-machine surgery recipient.

1129
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,240
The logged-in subject has no awareness or memory.

1130
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,360
Becomes a tool puppet for the login user.

1131
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,000
Controlled behavior.

1132
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,200
If the login user becomes unconscious or dies.

1133
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,520
Or other abnormal circumstances.

1134
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,200
The login user will be forcibly logged out.

1135
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,200
Meaning we are the ones being logged into.

1136
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,880
Right?

1137
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,080
The login user is Xiao Ba's dad.

1138
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,000
What else is there?

1139
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,880
There's one more.

1140
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,880
Background login at 9:49 PM.

1141
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,000
At 9:51, fell unconscious and was forcibly logged out.

1142
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,600
Wait a minute.

1143
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,240
Look, the background login occurred at 9:49.

1144
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,000
Who was logged into first at that time?

1145
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,160
He entered at 9:50 PM, right?

1146
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,600
First one.

1147
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,280
At 9:50.

1148
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,280
After you were logged in,

1149
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,080
you were the first to log in.

1150
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,440
You logged in and entered.

1151
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,040
I was first.

1152
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,480
At 9:50 PM,

1153
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,720
He Li entered the elevator.

1154
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,200
Three minutes later, Bai Noise entered the elevator.

1155
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,040
At 9:56, Ke Xuejia entered the elevator.

1156
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,920
At 9:59,

1157
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,160
Ba Bi entered the elevator.

1158
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,640
Then the second one was Bai, right?

1159
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,120
Logged in from the backend.

1160
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:16,920
What time was I?

1161
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,120
You were at 9:53.

1162
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,280
So logged in at 9:52, entered at 9:53.

1163
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,000
At 9:54, collapsed immediately after entering.

1164
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Then this was at 9:56.

1165
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,120
At 9:56, it was Ke.

1166
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,000
After Ke entered at 9:56,

1167
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,040
then collapsed unconscious.

1168
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,280
At 9:59, Ba entered.

1169
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,000
She entered at 9:59.

1170
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,760
Finally, at 10:40 PM,

1171
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
another person logged in.

1172
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
Logged in from the backend at 10:40.

1173
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,520
Then they went to get the poison.

1174
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,440
and injected it into

1175
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:45,920
that person,

1176
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,000
the pusher's body.

1177
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,600
This must be for opening the window.

1178
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,760
They had to inject first.

1179
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
The window would automatically close after half an hour.

1180
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,000
So opening the window had a specific timing.

1181
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,240
We could see earlier

1182
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,920
at 11:13 PM,

1183
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,000
or before 11:23 for sure.

1184
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,600
Actually, these steps

1185
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,560
could all be done at once.

1186
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
The order doesn't matter.

1187
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,280
Alright, let's take the stuff to the fifth floor.

1188
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,800
That place is a bit more comfortable.

1189
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,480
Okay.

1190
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,920
Now, is the theory that

1191
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,360
it was actually Ba's dad who killed them,

1192
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:16,840
right?

1193
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,600
Yes.

1194
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,520
Go to that

1195
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,400
first floor

1196
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,000
and bring that box up

1197
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,240
Fifth floor

1198
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:41,920
Fifth floor

1199
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,440
But how should we vote?

1200
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,480
We haven't discussed yet, why the rush?

1201
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

1202
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,840
Want to vote

1203
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:52,800
Come

1204
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:54,720
Let's go

1205
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,440
The killer first

1206
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,000
Come, stand in the middle

1207
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,400
Our discussion time starts now

1208
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,440
From this moment

1209
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,920
Actually what it is

1210
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,360
Who has the capability to kill?

1211
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,240
Could have done this

1212
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,040
Xiao Ba's dad

1213
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,920
Didn't you just propose a theory?

1214
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,880
I just understood it

1215
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,440
What is it?

1216
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,440
That he can jump

1217
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,200
Between your four minds

1218
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,560
Yes, he can control us

1219
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,160
Yes, manipulated you to kill

1220
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,640
So the killer is Xiao Ba's dad?

1221
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
We're done, let's find him

1222
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,000
The mastermind is him

1223
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,360
The actual perpetrator

1224
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
What we need to find now is

1225
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,800
There was a logic earlier

1226
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,720
It goes like this

1227
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,560
What's this in the computer?

1228
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,200
Brain-machine usage records

1229
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,440
That is, one two three four

1230
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,640
Total of five logins

1231
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,200
Meaning the last login

1232
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,200
Was Xiao Ba's dad entering someone's consciousness

1233
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,680
Right?

1234
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,200
Yes

1235
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,360
At 10:40 PM

1236
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,640
This person woke up

1237
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,000
Why do I say that?

1238
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,640
First you made a plan

1239
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,800
With four weapons

1240
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,640
Pillow, hammer, box

1241
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,520
Poison

1242
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,000
So through these items

1243
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,160
First there's this point

1244
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,520
After Dad Ba entered your consciousness,

1245
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,360
what weapon were you holding?

1246
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,480
I was holding...

1247
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,800
a pillow, right?

1248
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,560
So your weapon was a pillow.

1249
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,840
Your weapon...

1250
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,040
should be this box.

1251
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,320
Right.

1252
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,000
Correct?

1253
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,160
You hit with this box.

1254
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,560
Then your weapon was this hammer.

1255
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,000
You were holding poison needles.

1256
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,880
Okay, each of you four had a weapon.

1257
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,560
You took a pillow into the elevator.

1258
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,240
After entering,

1259
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,440
say I'm the pusher,

1260
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,160
I sit here,

1261
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,560
you come in and smother me with a pillow.

1262
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,760
After smothering,

1263
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,320
I'm the pusher,

1264
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,480
I use this ring to control the knockout incense,

1265
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,720
release it and you faint.

1266
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,680
That's basically the logic.

1267
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,280
You mean each of us took a turn?

1268
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,600
Took a turn on the pusher?

1269
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,000
Yes.

1270
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,720
Didn't leave, just fainted.

1271
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,240
Fainted.

1272
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,040
Whether fainted or not isn't important.

1273
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,480
Anyway, each took a turn.

1274
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,280
For example,

1275
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,000
it's like this.

1276
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,400
Who was first? He came first,

1277
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,720
entered with a hammer.

1278
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,400
You came in and hit me with the hammer.

1279
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
Yes, this process was quite funny.

1280
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,480
It's like...

1281
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,600
We entered in a line,

1282
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,400
I came in first,

1283
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,320
"What are you doing?"

1284
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,760
Right, probably not fatal,

1285
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,240
just pressed,

1286
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,440
then got knocked out by him.

1287
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,000
I just collapsed here.

1288
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,400
Then what did the next one do?

1289
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,440
Second was Bai, entered with a pillow.

1290
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,400
I'm still unconscious here.

1291
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,720
No way, I just got hit by a hammer,

1292
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,560
and here comes another.

1293
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,560
One press knocks one out

1294
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,160
Knocked out again

1295
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,760
There's blood now, right?

1296
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,160
Then, yes

1297
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:26,960
You're lying on the ground

1298
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,560
You came in and immediately grabbed a box

1299
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,720
About to smash him to death

1300
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,000
Then hit the back of his head with the box

1301
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,880
This pusher had it too rough

1302
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,240
Really took four hits

1303
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,960
The autopsy report states that

1304
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,360
It's already been mentioned that before death

1305
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,480
there were signs of severe head trauma

1306
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,600
Yes, absolutely

1307
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,280
That's correct

1308
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,200
So that means

1309
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,720
You were the last one to enter

1310
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,280
After Ke entered

1311
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,760
the poisoned needle probably wasn't administered

1312
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,040
Why is that?

1313
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,720
It definitely wasn't used

1314
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,000
If he had died

1315
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,560
died prematurely

1316
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,280
this thing would have sealed up early

1317
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,160
The poison needle only lasts 40 minutes

1318
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,000
Right, then why did you come in?

1319
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,240
Right, then why did you come in?

1320
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,760
He didn't insert it, right?

1321
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,960
He was just about to

1322
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,680
Actually, he just passed out

1323
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,400
We hit him so many times before

1324
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,320
but couldn't knock him out

1325
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,240
He was that tough

1326
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:15,880
He was just strong

1327
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,040
Very strong, powerful

1328
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,240
A real fighter

1329
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:18,920
Extremely tough

1330
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,680
Then finally Ba came in

1331
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,040
and struck him on the back of the head

1332
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,480
I think that's what knocked him out

1333
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,280
That was a pretty brutal hit

1334
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,120
He definitely passed out

1335
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,880
And then?

1336
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,280
At 10:40 PM

1337
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,160
among the four of you

1338
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,240
one person woke up

1339
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,480
This is the most crucial point

1340
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,440
What time was the window opened?

1341
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,360
This is an auto-rebound window.

1342
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,600
Window opening record for June 27th.

1343
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,520
It was at 10:53 PM.

1344
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,600
The window opened.

1345
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,480
Which means the killer.

1346
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,800
At 10:42 PM.

1347
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,920
Administered the toxin.

1348
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,240
So they woke up at 10:40.

1349
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,720
Injected within two minutes of waking up.

1350
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,880
Then went to open the window.

1351
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,920
Moved the body up there.

1352
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,880
Took about eleven minutes.

1353
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,480
To complete everything.

1354
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,360
That's the sequence of events.

1355
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,400
Right, so that means.

1356
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,920
The person who woke up at 10:40 PM.

1357
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,240
Is the killer.

1358
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,240
So the real killer is this person.

1359
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,400
Therefore this person.

1360
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,600
Is.

1361
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,040
Come on, give me a reason.

1362
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,240
Speak.

1363
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
No, I'm serious.

1364
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:19,920
Just point randomly.

1365
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,600
Okay.

1366
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,280
I just want to point.

1367
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,240
Right, point at him.

1368
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,120
But this person needs—

1369
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,880
They must meet one condition.

1370
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,240
The knockout drug lasts for an hour.

1371
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
Who has a strong constitution?

1372
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,000
And can wake up within an hour?

1373
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,560
Well, not exactly—just a unique physique.

1374
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,920
So what I mean is—

1375
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,440
Within that hour of being knocked out,

1376
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,800
someone woke up about 20 minutes early,

1377
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,680
or at some point before the rest.

1378
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,600
That’s why Xiao Ba

1379
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,480
could re-enter his body

1380
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,280
to administer the injection, right?

1381
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,120
Exactly. If that’s the case,

1382
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,280
then that person must be me.

1383
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,680
You still eat health sunflower seeds

1384
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,040
Energy sunflower seeds

1385
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,160
What are health sunflower seeds?

1386
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,480
Are they energy sunflower seeds?

1387
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,000
No, just health sunflower seeds

1388
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,440
You also eat energy sunflower seeds

1389
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,880
What do you use your energy sunflower seeds for?

1390
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,360
Normally

1391
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,120
Why do you eat those?

1392
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,120
To keep myself energized

1393
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,760
I eat energy sunflower seeds

1394
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,640
So I feel that

1395
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,120
These energy sunflower seeds are somewhat...

1396
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,120
Who knows what you're talking about

1397
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,440
Who knows about your heartbreak

1398
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,240
Eating energy sunflower seeds

1399
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,440
Do they help your body

1400
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,560
become stronger?

1401
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,000
That sounds reasonable when you say it

1402
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,880
Is it that simple?

1403
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,560
Now I'm doubting myself

1404
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,880
Don't doubt yourself

1405
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,400
Stick to your beliefs

1406
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,080
Xiao Ba, Dad's tea

1407
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,120
Old Man Ba

1408
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,120
What about Dad's tea?

1409
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,880
She's been drinking Dad's tea all along

1410
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,760
That specially brewed tea

1411
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,880
The same one his father used to drink

1412
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,040
It's exactly the same

1413
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,640
Dad's tea is specially blended for health

1414
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,520
There's some wisdom behind it

1415
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,080
Right

1416
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,840
Your physique is better than average.

1417
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,520
But there's one logic.

1418
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,200
I think his logic goes like this.

1419
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,000
What logic?

1420
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,640
For example, she delivered a box at 10 o'clock.

1421
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,880
Then it took her forty minutes to wake up.

1422
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,000
I know how to calculate it now.

1423
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,760
We should calculate based on each person's.

1424
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,120
Elevator boarding time.

1425
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,000
You calculate who had the longest duration.

1426
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,680
No, you can't calculate it that way.

1427
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,240
Do you know why?

1428
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,000
Why?

1429
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,320
For example, if I entered first.

1430
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
I was ten minutes later than her last entry.

1431
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,520
Then when she was knocked out.

1432
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,120
I was knocked out again too.

1433
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,760
What do you mean you were knocked out again?

1434
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,440
He means when he was lying here.

1435
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,240
While unconscious, he inhaled that substance again.

1436
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,080
Got drugged again.

1437
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,120
So that would reset your.

1438
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,240
Unconscious duration, right?

1439
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,040
Exactly.

1440
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,000
This way all four of us would be equal.

1441
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,760
So you're saying.

1442
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,880
There were four people piled up in this room at that time?

1443
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,680
Exactly.

1444
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,360
I think this logic makes sense.

1445
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,520
Yes, it's reasonable.

1446
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,680
Because you were indeed here.

1447
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,240
Right.

1448
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,240
If you calculate it your way.

1449
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,000
Then I would definitely be the culprit.

1450
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,680
I had the longest duration.

1451
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,360
That makes sense.

1452
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,240
Wait

1453
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,960
Have you all overlooked one thing?

1454
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,640
Xiao Ba's father possessed his body

1455
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,000
and controlled him to commit the murder

1456
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,880
The murderer who killed

1457
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,200
the victim, right?

1458
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,920
Exactly

1459
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,120
But is it possible

1460
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,280
that the person we've been with all day

1461
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,520
has actually been Xiao Ba's father all along?

1462
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,480
That's possible

1463
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,360
If this possibility exists

1464
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,280
then Xiao Ba's father must know this person extremely well

1465
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,320
He'd have to fool us completely

1466
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,440
He'd need to know everything about this person's past and present

1467
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,960
I think what you're saying is nonsense

1468
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,480
Forget it, let's vote

1469
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,240
Because why?

1470
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,960
Because it can't have been Xiao Ba's father the whole time

1471
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,720
Why not?

1472
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,720
Because you all

1473
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,200
have your own memories

1474
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,400
Even if he knew someone well

1475
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,040
he couldn't know everything about you

1476
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,960
All your backstories

1477
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,400
Wait, there is one person who could

1478
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,440
She could do it

1479
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,160
Yes, she could

1480
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,280
She's his daughter

1481
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,040
Don't you think that's too obvious?

1482
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,040
Her father

1483
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,560
Because he's her father

1484
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,320
So she's the most suspicious

1485
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,960
Right, this is reverse psychology at play

1486
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,560
Calm down

1487
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,720
You really need to calm down

1488
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,120
Take a closer look at him

1489
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,680
I'm quite suspicious of him too

1490
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,000
Why suspect him?

1491
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,040
How could he be X, bro?

1492
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,680
Could he possibly not be X?

1493
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,440
He definitely is

1494
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,480
Why am I definitely X?

1495
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,000
You're the only investigator today

1496
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
If you're not X, how can the killer win?

1497
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,960
How would 2 vs 3 work, tell me that

1498
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,240
Then how would 1 vs 4 work?

1499
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,360
1 vs 4 would be easier

1500
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,560
You'd all suspect me more

1501
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,760
That's just the logic

1502
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,920
No, I was just providing a line of thought.

1503
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,480
Here's the thing...

1504
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,240
If you follow Heli's

1505
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,360
logic on this matter,

1506
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,640
then the killer

1507
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,360
is actually Ba's father, right?

1508
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,000
(in quotation marks)

1509
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,720
It's this "Ba's father"

1510
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,480
That's him.

1511
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,160
Since he knew this person

1512
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,000
would drug all of us

1513
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,920
for one hour,

1514
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,320
how could he be sure

1515
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,280
that someone would wake up during that time?

1516
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,800
It didn't matter who woke up -

1517
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,840
if you woke up, you'd do the killing,

1518
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,640
if he woke up, he'd do it.

1519
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,760
So how could he be certain

1520
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,720
that one of us four

1521
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,280
would actually wake up?

1522
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,760
Even if no one woke up,

1523
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,960
say after one hour,

1524
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,040
I would still kill him.

1525
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,240
After two hours,

1526
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,440
I'd still kill him.

1527
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,400
So all four of you

1528
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,080
have equal opportunity in terms of evidence.

1529
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,640
We can't eliminate anyone.

1530
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,160
Yes, exactly.

1531
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,520
We really can't eliminate anyone.

1532
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,040
Brother, even if we can't identify the real killer,

1533
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,120
we should still vote for her.

1534
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,400
You...

1535
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,280
Because it's her father.

1536
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,040
The daughter pays for the father's sins.

1537
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,840
Right, actually her father

1538
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,760
carrying this out

1539
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,000
didn't care who you were,

1540
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,400
but you've been here the longest -

1541
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,280
longer than me.

1542
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,520
Even though he's my father,

1543
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,280
but you're Bai Yangzuo.

1544
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,280
That's right.

1545
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,240
You've been here since 2018.

1546
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,160
Exactly.

1547
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,480
And

1548
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,560
First, are all four of us

1549
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,440
robots?

1550
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,080
No

1551
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,720
No

1552
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,720
It's not related to robots

1553
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,640
It's brain interface

1554
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:07,680
Yes

1555
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,520
Alright then

1556
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,000
Then keep listening

1557
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,320
Look, there's a maintenance record here

1558
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,440
At the end of 2032

1559
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,560
Usage traces were repaired

1560
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,480
Upgraded to "Humanoid Sleep Companion Hakimi"

1561
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,720
In 2033

1562
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,760
Usage traces were repaired again

1563
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,000
Another upgrade was performed

1564
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,240
In 2035

1565
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,600
Both usage and reproductive traces were repaired

1566
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,000
Added humanized service features

1567
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,760
And then?

1568
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,000
My point is

1569
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,840
He's been continuously updated these years

1570
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,520
So is it possible

1571
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,240
His constitution is newer than ours?

1572
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,360
No, that's impossible

1573
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,880
This just shows one logic

1574
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,080
It corresponds to his diagnosis report

1575
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,120
Why are you defending him again?

1576
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm just being fair

1577
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,760
It doesn't matter

1578
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,280
These points explain

1579
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,480
why he was 35 years old five years ago

1580
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,000
Yes, exactly

1581
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,720
Now that's a good officer

1582
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,840
That's the logic

1583
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,240
But we're all the same

1584
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,400
Actually, we're all alike

1585
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,120
I'm saying your body has indeed undergone modifications

1586
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,840
This is something that actually happened

1587
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,120
I definitely underwent modifications

1588
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,880
Then that settles it

1589
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,880
Why would it have nothing to do with his constitution?

1590
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,520
Since his body

1591
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,120
underwent physical modifications

1592
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,720
No, if you put it that way

1593
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,960
Then I think it must be her

1594
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,000
Because of the tea incident

1595
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,360
Why?

1596
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,640
Because only Xiao Ba's father knew

1597
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,400
That drinking this tea

1598
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,760
might provide some resistance to this

1599
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,960
If you're going to say that

1600
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,480
Then I can only conclude it's her

1601
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:33,880
You mean to say

1602
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,600
Dilraba's dad knows a person's body well enough

1603
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,480
No, it's not about knowing whose body

1604
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,760
But what he knows is

1605
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,360
As long as you drink my tea

1606
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,480
What's the effect of that tea?

1607
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,240
Let's take a look

1608
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,480
Strengthens the body

1609
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,880
Since it strengthens the body

1610
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,480
What about the sunflower seeds that promote health energy?

1611
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,120
Aren't they also good for strengthening the body?

1612
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,880
And the health promotion thing doesn't exist anymore

1613
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,240
Yes, but

1614
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,960
Where is this "health promotion" place anyway?

1615
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,640
But Dilraba's dad doesn't know

1616
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,160
He doesn't know I need to eat this

1617
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,160
How could he not know?

1618
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,520
According to his logic

1619
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,160
He has a god's perspective

1620
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,080
He knows everything

1621
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,120
You've been here since 2018

1622
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,760
I only started eating this a month ago

1623
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,000
I haven't been eating this all along

1624
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,880
Was it a month ago?

1625
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,000
Yes, a month ago

1626
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,960
Because you could be lying

1627
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,200
I'm speechless

1628
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,960
Then vote for me

1629
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,960
I think this is logical

1630
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,680
If we follow your logic just now

1631
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,320
If the person above

1632
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,080
Knows someone can wake up early

1633
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,360
Then I think it's her

1634
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,960
Just because of the tea, nothing else

1635
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,080
Just the tea

1636
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,440
Then let me reverse it

1637
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,320
Isn't it the same for you?

1638
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:42,960
Whether you

1639
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,040
Know I eat these seeds

1640
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:44,480
Or eat seeds

1641
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,200
Or I modify your body

1642
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,480
That's fine, we both can

1643
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:47,840
No problem

1644
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,720
Then you two are equivalent

1645
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,160
No problem

1646
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,440
Right?

1647
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,560
From my perspective

1648
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,600
Then I'll vote for her

1649
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,040
You can implant your own consciousness early

1650
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,560
into that person's body

1651
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,320
An early update

1652
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,840
Starting from 2018

1653
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,160
when this research became available

1654
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,360
it could be applied to deceased individuals

1655
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
You make a good point

1656
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,600
But what exactly?

1657
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,920
This is how it works now

1658
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,440
That's how he could enter you four

1659
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,360
and control all four of you

1660
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Another logical point is

1661
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,560
Stop fixating on 2018

1662
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,840
It's misleading, I'm telling you

1663
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,600
Because it was actually

1664
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,080
first used in 2030

1665
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,360
Meaning it was created in 2030

1666
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,360
If you believe otherwise today, you'll lose

1667
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,760
So it was 2030

1668
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,560
when it was created

1669
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,080
Your 2018

1670
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,440
that date is irrelevant

1671
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,080
Trust me

1672
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,080
I think the breakthrough lies with him

1673
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,000
See whose X he is

1674
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Is he your X?

1675
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,240
He hasn't contradicted you once

1676
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,560
It's nothing.

1677
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,440
Diagnosed with cyber mental illness -

1678
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440
delusional disorder.

1679
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,080
Why am I thirty-five every year?

1680
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,680
Isn't that...

1681
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,360
Yes, you've imagined having four marriages.

1682
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,960
Tell me what you're looking for, I'll help you find it.

1683
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,080
It's nothing.

1684
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,320
Let's deduce who X really is.

1685
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,400
I'm really not X today.

1686
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,240
Believe me.

1687
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,840
The way to break the deadlock depends on you.

1688
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,680
Come on, speak up.

1689
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,720
The way to break the deadlock depends on me?

1690
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,320
Yes.

1691
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,240
What are you looking for?

1692
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,080
Never mind, found it.

1693
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,000
Wait for her, no rush.

1694
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,880
Wait for her to finish.

1695
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
Let's check on our Dilraba.

1696
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,200
Any new flashes of inspiration?

1697
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:44,720
We'll wait.

1698
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,840
Is this Dragon Fruit company of yours

1699
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,080
really where you work?

1700
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,000
Damn, she won't let this go

1701
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,360
Yes, it is

1702
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,600
It's where I work

1703
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,000
After I became a

1704
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,440
service robot

1705
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,600
No

1706
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,720
You don't work here

1707
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,480
No

1708
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,720
When I was in college at Tuifo

1709
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,480
then joined Dragon Fruit company after graduation

1710
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,360
Which year?

1711
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,960
No, actually let me explain

1712
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,160
There's a logic to this

1713
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,640
Their memories were implanted

1714
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,680
Because your memories keep getting erased

1715
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,760
Don't suspect me, it's pointless

1716
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,040
The logic I want to explain is

1717
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,920
Everything that happened here today

1718
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,520
was accidental

1719
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,240
Let me give you an example

1720
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,200
If I were Baba

1721
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,040
and I controlled her

1722
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,840
Whoever came first, I'd control them

1723
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,880
I could kill them with one hammer strike

1724
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,400
I'm certain I could kill them with one strike

1725
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,200
So I never considered

1726
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,920
who might recover early due to good health

1727
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,800
I wouldn't think about that in advance

1728
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,000
No, he chose the four of us to do it.

1729
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,720
He must have known this person.

1730
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,600
was obsessed with this thing.

1731
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,640
He didn't know.

1732
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,120
He definitely knew.

1733
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,200
And first, he knew about us.

1734
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:01,880
About the suicide.

1735
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,560
Exactly.

1736
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,800
The suicide plan.

1737
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,000
And coincidentally,

1738
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,440
he learned about the suicide plan.

1739
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,320
Through that plan,

1740
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,920
he just knew you had these four items.

1741
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,160
No, didn't he have that one before,

1742
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,400
there was one that said he

1743
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,640
Yes, the conversation with that person.

1744
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,160
It was written on his computer:

1745
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,720
"I learned about a mass killing plan."

1746
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,560
"I'll use this mass killing plan to kill you."

1747
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,320
"It'll be interesting" or something.

1748
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,280
Then I come in.

1749
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,360
What's the purpose of hitting him with a hammer?

1750
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,280
What's the intention?

1751
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,160
The intention.

1752
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,720
Insurance.

1753
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,720
He might not be able to kill alone.

1754
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,480
What if he dies from that hammer hit?

1755
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,000
Then the game's over.

1756
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,520
That's fine then.

1757
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,480
Right, so everyone's

1758
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,920
purpose in coming to this room

1759
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,560
is definitely to kill, not to kill together.

1760
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,320
For example, if he comes in first or you come in first,

1761
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,760
one hammer, one pillow, two people die.

1762
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,160
He dies.

1763
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,400
Then the other two don't need to come.

1764
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,520
Which means

1765
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,480
He doesn't know who among you will wake up first

1766
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:49,800
Right

1767
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,200
The process of Xiao Ba's dad dealing with the troll today

1768
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:54,680
What was it like

1769
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,560
He's been online these past two days

1770
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,640
exchanging insults with him

1771
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,960
Saying "I'll kill you, I'll get you"

1772
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,760
No, you can't kill me

1773
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,680
I need to protect

1774
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:03,320
I'll get you, I'll get you

1775
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:03,920
Just like that

1776
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,120
Kept spewing

1777
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,280
Then at the very end

1778
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,280
Ba got anxious

1779
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,040
He then said

1780
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,760
Fool, I've discovered an interesting mutual kill plan

1781
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,600
I can use this plan to kill you

1782
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,800
If you don't want to live, then die

1783
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,680
Right, when the promoter saw this message

1784
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,200
It's over, he knows he's coming

1785
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,560
Then the promoter started taking protective measures

1786
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,120
For all those who had brain-machine surgery

1787
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,480
Installed encryption chips

1788
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,640
What's this encryption chip for?

1789
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,960
To prevent Ba

1790
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,640
From logging into the backend

1791
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,840
And remotely accessing their brains

1792
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,520
To control them

1793
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,480
But didn't have time to install them on us four

1794
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,320
So only these four remain

1795
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,120
Today Brother Bai can still use them

1796
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:37,960
Brother Bai got anxious

1797
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,640
Said it's over now

1798
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,280
They're all equipped

1799
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,760
If I don't use these four now

1800
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,040
I won't get to use them at all

1801
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:42,880
Then I can't kill you

1802
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,800
And then today

1803
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,840
Because he's coming tonight

1804
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,480
I must kill the pusher

1805
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,760
before he arrives

1806
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,640
But when they came up one by one

1807
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,000
For example, I controlled

1808
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,280
The first one who came up, right?

1809
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,920
He came up and got knocked out instantly

1810
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,000
Damn, failed to kill him, what now?

1811
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,320
Quick, there's still one more available

1812
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,520
Then the next one got knocked out too

1813
01:04:59,520 --> 01:04:59,920
What should I do?

1814
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,680
There's still one left

1815
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,320
They all got knocked out

1816
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,920
Damn, about to fail

1817
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,880
Then someone woke up

1818
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,320
Exactly

1819
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,000
Then he controlled this person to kill him

1820
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,320
So today Brother Bai almost failed to kill the pusher

1821
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,200
This person waking up was unexpected

1822
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,480
Yes, I've been saying this logic all along

1823
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,520
It's just that I wouldn't say

1824
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,240
I foresaw none of you three would succeed

1825
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,080
Then she came as the fourth

1826
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,640
No, wait a minute.

1827
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,040
This means the person's awakening was accidental

1828
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:24,360
Right?

1829
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,680
Dilraba's father didn't have the ability

1830
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,880
to predict he would wake up

1831
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,760
But this still doesn't change one thing

1832
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,880
That whoever has better physical condition

1833
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,120
would wake up first

1834
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,400
Right?

1835
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,640
This is an objective fact

1836
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,360
So we can still analyze

1837
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,480
who has better physical condition

1838
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,120
This logic holds

1839
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:39,640
Okay, fine

1840
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,120
Agreed

1841
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,160
We can continue reasoning along those lines

1842
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:42,520
I think

1843
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,400
Alright

1844
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,680
About who has better physical condition

1845
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,760
Between us two, it's obvious

1846
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,000
To be honest

1847
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,480
I don't think your health is particularly good

1848
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,520
Because you self-harm

1849
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,000
This isn't direct

1850
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,160
His method is the direct one

1851
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,760
He takes medicine

1852
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,120
Both of these are direct

1853
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,480
Right

1854
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,560
Both are extremely direct

1855
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,040
But why do I feel

1856
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,280
that this one is actually relatively

1857
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,320
not as significant?

1858
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,320
Because she's his daughter, you understand?

1859
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,560
If I were Dad Ba

1860
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,320
Taking the emotional family route, right?

1861
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,040
Yes

1862
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,800
Even if she wakes up

1863
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,280
I might not let her take action

1864
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,120
But this is just my

1865
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,360
Only way to determine the direction

1866
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,320
Do you understand?

1867
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,280
I believe there are emotions involved

1868
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,440
But it's just the methods

1869
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,320
That might be problematic

1870
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:25,920
Exactly

1871
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,760
So far

1872
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,360
There are probably two people with suitable physical conditions

1873
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:30,680
Right?

1874
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,840
One is the tea for strengthening the body

1875
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,880
And the other is him who modified his body

1876
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,920
Why don't you qualify?

1877
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,840
You work every day

1878
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,920
You're a workaholic

1879
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,880
Even now you're still a workaholic

1880
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,560
To some extent

1881
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,120
He is a workaholic

1882
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,320
You have self-harming tendencies

1883
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,360
What you're implying

1884
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,160
Is that he's tough

1885
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,280
I'm tough

1886
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,400
Not that we're both in great shape

1887
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:54,840
Do you understand?

1888
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,880
Because we've both endured so much

1889
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,920
No

1890
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,320
If we follow your logic

1891
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,120
Then it should be this reasoning, understand?

1892
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,280
We're discussing factual evidence

1893
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,840
There are documented statements

1894
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,040
Saying she drank the tea

1895
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,920
There are documented statements

1896
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,160
Saying he modified his body

1897
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,920
No, he has a logic.

1898
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,720
He didn't just say "good health."

1899
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,200
Right?

1900
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,680
He said "special constitution."

1901
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,640
This special constitution

1902
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,600
might not be related to good health.

1903
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,400
For example, I might have strong drug resistance,

1904
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,120
or no alcohol allergy.

1905
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,880
That's called a special constitution.

1906
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,520
So that's me then.

1907
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,200
Special preferences, special constitution.

1908
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,360
If there's key evidence, what is it?

1909
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,280
What can prove this person committed murder?

1910
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,040
From when we went through the timeline earlier,

1911
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,800
it was already proven.

1912
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,760
I couldn't administer the first injection, right?

1913
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,880
So who administered the second one?

1914
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,960
Everyone remains the same.

1915
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,120
Is that needle here?

1916
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:48,600
The murder weapon, the needle.

1917
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,120
Here it is.

1918
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,400
Let me take a look.

1919
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,200
You want to check for fingerprints?

1920
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,040
You won't see anything.

1921
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,320
Look for the red medicine.

1922
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,840
It's purplish-red, not red.

1923
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,680
Right, so

1924
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,080
just see who has

1925
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,160
red on them.

1926
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,400
Why look at us?

1927
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,120
Check yourselves for red stains.

1928
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:04,840
Because it's poison.

1929
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,680
The poison is red.

1930
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,080
Meaning it spilled on someone.

1931
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,240
Can't see it?

1932
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,160
What if it didn't spill?

1933
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,040
Then check my melon seeds.

1934
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,400
What exactly is their effect?

1935
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,920
What's the effect of that tea?

1936
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,440
No, don't limit yourself to this.

1937
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,680
It might be related to

1938
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,400
his subsequent login.

1939
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,160
He's still logged in, right?

1940
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,680
From the investigators, who do you suspect?

1941
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,160
I suspect Bai Sect.

1942
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,520
You suspect Bai Sect, what about you?

1943
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,120
If I had to choose, I'd pick him.

1944
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,920
Why?

1945
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
Because neither of you seem likely.

1946
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,680
I'm judging by his reaction.

1947
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,240
He hasn't argued with him once today.

1948
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,200
That works too.

1949
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,640
Unique reasoning.

1950
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,920
I suddenly want to vote for him.

1951
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,840
Why?

1952
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,600
Look at him.

1953
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,240
Why though?

1954
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,600
Do you still want to vote for him?

1955
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,320
Why?

1956
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,240
Why is that?

1957
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,600
I just wanted to test him.

1958
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,360
Who are you voting for?

1959
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:58,880
Me.

1960
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,160
I'll vote for myself.

1961
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,480
You're voting for yourself?

1962
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,520
Even a random guess might get you a key.

1963
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,080
If she votes for herself,

1964
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,360
the odds between culprit and innocent

1965
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,480
would still be fifty-fifty.

1966
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,400
Because a tied vote means the culprit loses.

1967
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,480
So if she votes for herself,

1968
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,520
it's two against two.

1969
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,720
Assuming the presence of X,

1970
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,160
Let's vote.

1971
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,320
The real culprit

1972
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,400
Babi

1973
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,680
was actually being controlled

1974
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,600
using the mutual-killing scheme

1975
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,360
then faking a suicide by jumping

1976
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,600
Hello everyone

1977
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,480
It's nothing, just...

1978
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,840
I just think, as a robot...

1979
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,800
He might have more functionalities.

1980
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,720
Such a powerful person scares me.

1981
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,000
I voted for white noise.

1982
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,600
The true culprit I chose is

1983
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,720
It's actually a tough choice

1984
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,800
But if it's between white noise and Babe

1985
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,480
I'd still choose

1986
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,080
I'm a Ke scientist

1987
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,680
Today, the murderer is Ba's dad

1988
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,960
To prevent the pusher from exposing all his secrets

1989
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,320
And to stop his vicious reign

1990
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,960
We must eliminate this instigator

1991
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,040
My prime suspect is

1992
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,800
What about today's vote?

1993
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,080
Goes to

1994
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,400
Bye-bye

1995
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,000
How was it?

1996
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,240
What's with the "hey"?

1997
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,680
This episode made me feel kinda...

1998
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,040
Really distressed.

1999
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:34,680
Really?

2000
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:34,960
Yeah.

2001
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,280
"Start Guessing" Season 2, Case 9

2002
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,320
Tuizhen 2048: "Nightmare Dollhouse"

2003
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,680
Comes to an end.

2004
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,720
You've now solved nine cases.

2005
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,960
So what were today's voting results?

2006
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,840
Next, we'll announce everyone's voting results.

2007
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,840
The suspects in this case are:

2008
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,960
Babi and White Noise.

2009
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,520
Kexuejia and Heli, making four in total.

2010
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,280
Among these four players,

2011
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,680
everyone has narrowed it down to two suspects.

2012
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,120
You two,

2013
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,240
White Noise and Babi.

2014
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,160
Someone must have voted for you.

2015
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,040
It wasn't me.

2016
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,040
I believe you'll trust me.

2017
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,600
Who did you want us to trust then?

2018
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,320
You didn't say who you were voting for.

2019
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,440
Why should we trust you?

2020
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,800
The suspects who received votes are:

2021
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,720
White Noise

2022
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,440
and Babi.

2023
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,040
You're very suspicious.

2024
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,120
One of these players

2025
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,320
received four votes.

2026
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,440
Unbelievable.

2027
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,440
The player who received four votes is...

2028
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,200
White Noise.

2029
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,280
This is insane.

2030
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,640
He can continuously upgrade his body

2031
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,760
It's his unique physical trait

2032
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,880
So I'm voting for White Noise

2033
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,160
I'll still choose White Noise

2034
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:19,600
His physique might be stronger

2035
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,040
Might appear earlier

2036
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,560
My vote goes to White Noise

2037
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,960
Just think as a robot

2038
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,920
He likely has more functions

2039
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,200
Such powerful people scare me

2040
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,840
Today my prime suspect is White Noise

2041
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,160
Perhaps I think his physique is better

2042
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,280
Right

2043
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,720
You three confused people

2044
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,360
Confused individuals

2045
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,720
Brother, you kept protecting me

2046
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,600
Then voted for me in the end

2047
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,400
That really hurts, you know

2048
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,360
It's quite hurtful, you know

2049
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,920
Had to vote for you since no one else was left

2050
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,720
Okay

2051
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,560
Don't ruin our friendship

2052
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,120
Alright

2053
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,760
So is everyone's choice

2054
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,640
actually correct?

2055
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,240
You there

2056
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,040
No, I mean it's really her

2057
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,560
I don't know

2058
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,960
She's laughing

2059
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,480
Why are you laughing?

2060
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,440
What's wrong with you?

2061
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,160
Listen

2062
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,360
Can't contain herself

2063
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,640
The excitement and joy inside

2064
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,160
You know what?

2065
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,200
When I was the culprit before and wasn't caught

2066
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,520
I felt the same way, you know

2067
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,720
Can't hold it in, right?

2068
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,280
Yes, just feels so happy

2069
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,440
It's really you

2070
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,320
It was you

2071
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:31,960
Oh no

2072
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,040
So it was you

2073
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,160
She's so happy

2074
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,200
She can't suppress her smile

2075
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,600
Why are you so happy? My god

2076
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,080
Can't keep a straight face

2077
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,280
Don't trust so easily

2078
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,520
So this case's culprit is confirmed

2079
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,520
Failure

2080
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,040
Okay

2081
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,160
What

2082
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:08,720
What

2083
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,200
What do you mean?

2084
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,480
We lost.

2085
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,960
He's not the killer.

2086
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,400
Wait a minute.

2087
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,960
No, wait a second.

2088
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,960
He's not the killer, right?

2089
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,720
No way.

2090
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,840
Wait, let's listen first.

2091
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,640
Hold on.

2092
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,040
It's over, mind blown.

2093
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,280
Episode 9 just fried your brain cells.

2094
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,720
The real killer is...

2095
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,600
Before revealing the real killer,

2096
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,040
let's first announce

2097
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,720
whether there's an X in this case.

2098
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,280
Oh my goodness!

2099
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,200
Am I the only one?

2100
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,440
This case

2101
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,200
has an X.

2102
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,280
Uh, sorry about this,

2103
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,880
I'm the X in this episode.

2104
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,960
So,

2105
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,880
I know Bai noise isn't the killer,

2106
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,720
so there's no other way.

2107
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,520
Buddy, I'll have to eliminate you.

2108
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,840
We'll solve cases together next time.

2109
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,440
We'll work together again next time.

2110
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,880
Can't help you this time.

2111
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,080
So who is the real culprit behind this case?

2112
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,560
Please X, step forward to him.

2113
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,440
It's not me.

2114
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,560
Brother...

2115
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,240
It really wasn't me.

2116
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:24,880
Little sister...

2117
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,000
Just admit it, it's fine.

2118
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,920
At this point...

2119
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,760
Give it up.

2120
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,440
It's already come to this.

2121
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,000
Brother, you've failed me again.

2122
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,680
It really wasn't me, I swear.

2123
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,320
No, I said don't let this ruin our bond.

2124
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,000
Look at him.

2125
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,800
Isn't it him?

2126
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,800
The real culprit is

2127
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,920
Me, the murderer

2128
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,600
Heli

2129
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,120
Speechless

2130
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,200
See? I told you it wasn’t me

2131
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:01,800
Thank you, everyone

2132
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,120
Here’s the thing

2133
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,640
This case is truly difficult

2134
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,800
Very difficult

2135
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,880
Speechless

2136
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,960
So hard

2137
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,480
The two of you are highly suspicious

2138
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,400
Come on, Ke-scientist, tell us what’s good about his body

2139
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,360
Go ahead, say it

2140
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,720
If I had known, I wouldn't have voted wrong.

2141
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,040
I said it, I said he self-harms every day.

2142
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,480
Then he protected him.

2143
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,040
If he self-harms, how could he still be alive today?

2144
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,800
It's not that he's tough, but his constitution is just good.

2145
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,160
That was the idea I proposed at the time.

2146
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,360
And another point is...

2147
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,480
It's about my livestream project.

2148
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,800
Right, he can do many things.

2149
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,720
I can sing for three days and nights straight.

2150
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,600
I can eat chicken legs for fifteen days in a row.

2151
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,040
That's why my health is good.

2152
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,520
Good, good health.

2153
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,520
This is about keeping an eye on him.

2154
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,400
I've been telling you not to keep staring at him.

2155
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,760
Right, why do you keep staring at me?

2156
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,320
Because of your...

2157
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,920
2018 death or something.

2158
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,640
And so on.

2159
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,040
That's also a direction.

2160
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,280
I was just speaking up for him here.

2161
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,480
I said, does he look like a murderer to you?

2162
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:04,760
Look at him.

2163
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,400
Why?

2164
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,760
Do you still want to vote for him?

2165
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,280
Why?

2166
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,280
Right, you even saved him once.

2167
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,280
I'm really speechless, I said why?

2168
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,080
Okay.

2169
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,880
So what everyone missed...

2170
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,800
The crucial evidence is...

2171
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,760
The key evidence everyone overlooked is...

2172
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,640
On Heli's livestream-exclusive action camera,

2173
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,520
there's a label that says "Livestream Exclusive."

2174
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,920
The label has traces of...

2175
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,320
a liquid the same color as the venom.

2176
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,960
This evidence directly points to the real culprit.

2177
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,640
I've been hinting at you all along

2178
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,560
You know what?

2179
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,400
The murder weapon

2180
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,040
Blood

2181
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,920
What if there's crucial evidence?

2182
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,040
What can prove this person committed murder?

2183
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,040
Is that needle here?

2184
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:53,560
The murder weapon - the needle

2185
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,040
Here it is

2186
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,760
Let me take a look

2187
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,800
You want to check for fingerprints, right?

2188
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,040
You won't be able to see anything

2189
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,280
Look, red medicine

2190
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,880
It's purplish-red, not red

2191
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,000
Right, so

2192
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,080
Then we just need to see who has

2193
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,280
red on them

2194
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,440
Why look at us?

2195
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,400
Check if you have any red on you

2196
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,040
Because the poison is red

2197
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,160
Meaning it spilled on someone

2198
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,400
Can't tell, can you?

2199
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,480
What if it didn't spill on anyone?

2200
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,920
Do you have blood on you?

2201
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,960
I hid it

2202
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,000
Hidden here

2203
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,640
This is my livestream tag

2204
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,120
Where did you hide it?

2205
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,320
Behind the chair

2206
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,920
But logically there's another point

2207
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,640
He was the first to enter

2208
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,280
He was most likely the first to wake up

2209
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,360
When I was analyzing her logic

2210
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,200
I wanted to rule him out

2211
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,240
But then he gave me a theory

2212
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,360
That completely convinced me

2213
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,120
About circular inhalation

2214
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,680
It's not that today's case is special

2215
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,720
At first I didn't even know I was the murderer

2216
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,440
Why hasn't the killer sent me any messages?

2217
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,240
There's another possibility

2218
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,600
The killer themselves might not know

2219
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,560
that they're the killer

2220
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,680
They've lost their memory

2221
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,000
They don't know they committed murder

2222
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,600
Time of death was 11:22 PM, which means

2223
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,160
subtract 40

2224
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:24,800
Subtract 40 minutes, right?

2225
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,160
Correct

2226
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,720
The poison was injected at 10:42 PM

2227
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,560
Autopsy report

2228
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,720
Final cause of death

2229
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,200
Death by potent toxin poisoning

2230
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,680
Potent toxin composition details

2231
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,240
Powerful purple liquid toxin

2232
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,520
Administered via injection

2233
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,520
40-minute incubation period

2234
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,240
Instant death upon activation

2235
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,760
Potent toxin - Purple liquid

2236
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,920
Purple liquid

2237
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,920
I just told him

2238
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,960
Just follow normal reasoning

2239
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,920
At first I didn't know I was the killer

2240
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:43,960
It was later

2241
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,880
when I heard the autopsy report

2242
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:49,120
that he was killed by a needle

2243
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,440
Then I noticed

2244
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,680
and remembered my

2245
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,800
equipment had

2246
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,120
the words "for live streaming"

2247
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,080
with something red on it

2248
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,480
Okay

2249
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,560
But he was indeed X

2250
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,960
You got angry earlier

2251
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:00,760
I said

2252
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,760
so I told you something

2253
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,960
I said using this method to judge me

2254
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,440
is pointless

2255
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,080
Because

2256
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,400
you always say this

2257
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,280
Forget it, let's drop it

2258
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,560
Let's leave it at that

2259
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,640
It's over, really

2260
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,640
The final episode is ruined

2261
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,800
Let's end it here

2262
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,920
Now we'll present the golden key

2263
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,760
Time for the golden key award

2264
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,040
Who should give it?

2265
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,680
You do it, it's your mess

2266
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,440
Thank you

2267
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,160
Thanks, little sister

2268
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,200
Today I just hitched a ride

2269
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,360
I didn't really contribute much

2270
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,080
In the end I didn't protect him either

2271
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,040
It was just the three of us going at each other

2272
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,160
You two were going at each other

2273
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,960
Right, mainly it was us two fighting

2274
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,800
Yeah

2275
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,080
Because of that tea and those energy sunflower seeds

2276
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:51,920
You didn't eat anything

2277
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,080
Yet you're still in such good health

2278
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,640
I should have killed you back then

2279
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,320
You're such a bad person yet you...

2280
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,320
You've killed so many people... whatever

2281
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,520
You were just a tool yet you're so happy about it

2282
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,800
So what if we won?

2283
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,320
Right? Looking down on us

2284
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,640
No, when you said you got the wrong person earlier

2285
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,840
I was terrified myself

2286
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,200
I thought it really was me

2287
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,720
So this case was really difficult

2288
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,120
None of us had any psychological preparation

2289
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,000
If I were the killer I'd need to hide something

2290
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,840
I was the only X who needed to hide something

2291
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,320
But I didn't expect White Noise to protect me

2292
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,000
I was really touched

2293
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,720
So sad, so upset, so hurt

2294
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,640
Actually I didn't plan to vote for you later

2295
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,360
I figured I'd just vote for her

2296
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,640
But your final choice was

2297
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,400
"Bang" - you just voted for me

2298
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,320
Very sad

2299
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,040
It's all the same

2300
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,120
See, we both voted for him too

2301
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,000
In the same situation yet you voted for me

2302
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:42,800
No

2303
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,520
Even sadder now

2304
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,440
You know why?

2305
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,680
Because of this...

2306
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,320
I'm completely speechless

2307
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,920
Because I lied to my little sister twice

2308
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,640
Hope you're happy, come again next time

2309
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,560
I'm very happy

2310
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,440
Wow, so many handsome guys

2311
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,160
Hello

2312
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,040
Have you seen my brother?

2313
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,200
Who's your brother?

2314
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,440
Who's your brother?

2315
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,840
Brother

2316
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,800
I'm your sister, do you remember me?

2317
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,600
I used to have a sister named Keke

2318
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,200
Keke

2319
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,320
Ke

2320
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,440
Ke, that...

2321
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,320
Keke

2322
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,040
I am Keke

2323
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,160
Keke

2324
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,720
As for my former sister

2325
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,960
She was with him

2326
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,720
The work personality interacted with him

2327
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,240
Then thought he wasn't good

2328
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,240
So divorced him

2329
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:37,840
Right

2330
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,440
But my sister disappeared

2331
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,000
I don't know where my sister is

2332
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,240
I've been looking for you for so long and finally found you.

2333
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,120
Where have you been?

2334
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,720
I went to Tui Taoyuan.

2335
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,320
Because I moved to Tui Taoyuan.

2336
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,960
The scenery there is exceptionally beautiful.

2337
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,120
Just like the concept art I designed for my game.

2338
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,840
I believe my other self will also be full of inspiration.

2339
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,600
And let me tell you,

2340
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,880
my masterpiece game will be completed soon.

2341
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,000
Masterpiece game.

2342
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,840
The air there is really fresh.

2343
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,120
The people are very nice too.

2344
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,720
It's great for my work.

2345
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,200
After you recover from your illness,

2346
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,720
remember to come to Tui Taoyuan to find me.

2347
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,240
You can bring all your friends along.

2348
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,920
This is your husband, do you remember him?

2349
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,600
Your ex-husband

2350
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,080
We've been divorced for a long time

2351
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,720
He's your husband - ex-husband

2352
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,880
Yes, you were with him before

2353
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,000
Right, then you suddenly started being violent at home

2354
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
So we... you know

2355
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,520
No violence

2356
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,240
I wasn't violent

2357
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,520
They said you neglected the family

2358
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,880
Stopped loving you

2359
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,520
Golden Throat is the real violence

2360
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,000
Yes, she is

2361
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,520
Yes, sorry, yes

2362
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,160
So that's how it was

2363
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,000
Hello, ex-husband

2364
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:53,920
Hello

2365
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,440
I've been doing game design at Tui Taoyuan

2366
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,200
The people there are very nice

2367
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,200
They affectionately call me "Goose"

2368
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,400
Because I'm Ke Goose Shell

2369
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,920
Goose, then Ke Shell

2370
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,600
Goose goose goose

2371
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,120
Ke Shell

2372
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,200
Do you know what

2373
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,640
my latest game is called?

2374
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,640
No idea

2375
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,280
Feels like being called on by a teacher

2376
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,880
My game is called

2377
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,680
"The Mysterious Player"

2378
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,240
"The Mysterious Player"

2379
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:41,400
Nice

2380
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,000
Well then I

2381
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,760
I see you and your friends are

2382
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,880
having a good time here

2383
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,160
Then I can rest easy

2384
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,480
I'll head back to Tui Taoyuan now

2385
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,520
Come visit when you're free

2386
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,440
And remember to eat

2387
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:52,880
Okay

2388
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,880
Bye

2389
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,640
Bye sis

2390
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,200
Bye

2391
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,520
Her game is called "The Mysterious Player," right?

2392
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,240
Yes, "The Mysterious Player"

2393
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,160
"The Mysterious Player"

2394
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,400
Didn't your sister disappear?

2395
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
Yes, she suddenly reappeared

2396
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,480
And brought me gifts

2397
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,280
Big bro

2398
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,720
It can't be behind this chair behind me, right?

2399
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,280
Impossible

2400
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,760
So the goose was actually Ke the scientist's sister, Ke Ke

2401
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,440
We've finally found her

2402
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,520
She's hiding in Tui Taoyuan

2403
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,000
Let's go catch her now

2404
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,320
Those five are locked in the secret chamber.

2405
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,520
This is the...

2406
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:39,760
The person from yesterday...

2407
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,480
who locked them...

2408
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,800
inside his own prison cell.

2409
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
Every piece of clothing here...

2410
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,920
contains chips that resonate...

2411
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,400
with your brain-machine interfaces.

2412
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,440
Now...

2413
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,560
we need to find that crucial person...

2414
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,440
from their memories.

2415
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:56,240
The one holding the gun...

2416
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,480
Don't you...

2417
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,280
We can report to Beiju...

2418
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,480
Report to Beiju...

2419
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,960
The woman who escaped prison...

2420
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,480
That robot...

2421
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,080
Yes...

2422
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,680
The domestic nanny robot...

2423
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,520
Beiju...

2424
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,440
The nanny robot...

2425
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,000
Right...

2426
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Beiju is their leader.

2427
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,720
I've been designing games at Tui Taoyuan...

2428
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,160
My current game is called...

2429
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,160
"Mysterious Player."

2430
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,040
These two books...

2431
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,040
"Five Bodies"...

2432
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,280
and "Cold-Blooded Academy"...

2433
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,640
by manga artist 8D...

2434
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,720
"Mysterious Player."

2435
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,240
Connect the neural interface

2436
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,560
Install it into the brain-computer interface

2437
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:04,720
In this episode,

2438
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,400
we encountered

2439
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,400
a case of manipulating others to commit murder.

2440
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,960
Although the manipulation method

2441
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,120
was fictional,

2442
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,240
this type of relationship

2443
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,280
already has established rules

2444
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,200
within our legal system.

2445
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,320
This is called indirect principal offender.

2446
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,080
An indirect principal offender refers to

2447
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,240
a perpetrator who,

2448
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,120
with criminal intent,

2449
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,600
utilizes someone without legal capacity

2450
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,680
or criminal intent

2451
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,040
to commit criminal acts,

2452
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,040
thereby achieving their criminal purpose.

2453
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,560
Using someone without legal capacity -

2454
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,960
for example, instructing a 6-year-old

2455
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,120
child to steal a phone.

2456
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,440
A 6-year-old doesn't bear

2457
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,480
criminal responsibility.

2458
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,160
Using someone without criminal intent -

2459
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,560
for example, a doctor giving toxic

2460
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,320
injection to a nurse

2461
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,400
to administer to a patient.

2462
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,920
The nurse is unaware.

2463
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,600
In such cases, the person being used

2464
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,280
is merely a criminal instrument.

2465
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:45,960
Between the two parties,

2466
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,040
there's no joint criminal offense.

2467
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:48,640
What about the legal liability

2468
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,440
of an indirect principal offender?

2469
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:51,840
Generally speaking,

2470
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,720
an indirect principal offender

2471
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,080
should bear the same criminal liability

2472
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,280
as a direct principal offender.

2473
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,600
This is because

2474
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,280
the perpetrator plays

2475
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,200
a decisive role in the crime,

2476
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,000
and their criminal intent

2477
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,400
has a direct causal relationship

2478
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,400
with the criminal outcome.

2479
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,240
This episode's story

2480
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,840
continues to make us ponder

2481
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,840
the legal issues

2482
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,880
in the AI era

2483
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,320
This episode's story has already

2484
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,040
touched upon marriage freedom

2485
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,720
privacy protection

2486
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,440
personal information protection, and more

2487
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,000
In fact, with the rapid

2488
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,080
development of AI technology

2489
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,680
especially

2490
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,200
the swift emergence

2491
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,240
of generative AI applications

2492
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,440
AI-related

2493
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,600
disputes are gradually emerging

2494
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,400
Artificial intelligence

2495
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,120
poses challenges to various rights

2496
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,040
including portrait rights, reputation rights

2497
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,440
privacy rights, and personal information

2498
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,480
protection

2499
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,320
In the field of human rights

2500
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,360
AI also has the potential

2501
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,120
to create large-scale

2502
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,080
systemic algorithmic discrimination

2503
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:41,800
rights violations

2504
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,280
and human rights infringements

2505
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,840
and has already caused

2506
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,960
complex legal issues

2507
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,320
Let's give two examples

2508
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,040
When users provide sensitive

2509
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,160
information to chatbots

2510
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:55,200
without proper protection

2511
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,520
leading to sensitive information leaks

2512
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,040
this may harm

2513
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,240
users' personal information

2514
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,440
and even privacy rights

2515
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,760
Another example is

2516
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,680
when artificial intelligence

2517
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,560
is used to censor social media

2518
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,280
platform content,

2519
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,360
improper censorship decisions

2520
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,680
may harm freedom of speech.

2521
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,520
Both privacy and free speech

2522
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,120
are protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

2523
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:16,960
and our nation's constitution

2524
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,280
along with legal protections.

2525
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,240
Meanwhile,

2526
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,000
our country's existing laws

2527
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,280
on data protection, cybersecurity, unfair competition

2528
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,200
and e-commerce

2529
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,360
can also continue to apply

2530
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,360
to the governance

2531
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,040
of artificial intelligence.

2532
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,920
Through this series

2533
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,080
of legislation and regulations

2534
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,600
for the AI industry,

2535
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,600
we enhance transparency,

2536
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,840
accuracy, and reliability.

2537
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,960
Overall,

2538
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,040
we pursue both development and security,

2539
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,040
promote innovation,

2540
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,200
and emphasize law-based governance.

2541
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,400
This can provide

2542
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,840
legal safeguards for current

2543
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,520
industry growth and human rights protection.

2544
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,280
So we'll be trapped here forever.

2545
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,320
Right now, we're trying everything to escape.

2546
01:31:59,080 --> 01:31:59,600
What's going on?

2547
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
Looks like people from that Bai Sect.

2548
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,480
It seems all our friends have arrived.

2549
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,840
We should be

2550
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,080
getting ahead of Organization B

2551
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,160
to find the goose first.

2552
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,560
Even if you know my plan,

2553
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,160
you still can't stop Organization B.

2554
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,360
So we've been playing this game all along.

2555
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,280
Xiao Xi escaped the curse

2556
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,440
and lived normally in Tuiyi.

2557
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:30,880
Why?

2558
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,560
He's normal? He's a dinosaur!

2559
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,800
This must be their

2560
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,600
action plan.

2561
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,160
Then he won't board that ship,

2562
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,000
and that tragic incident won't happen.

2563
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,400
If their plan succeeds,

2564
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,800
an unpredictable disaster will occur.

2565
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,640
We can control him,

2566
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,080
otherwise,

2567
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,840
everyone will die.

2568
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,920
A bloody battle

2569
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,160
has begun again.
