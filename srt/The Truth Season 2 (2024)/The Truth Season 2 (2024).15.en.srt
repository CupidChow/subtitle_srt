00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,380
1988 Tuizhen - A Turning Point in History

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,620
Today, Tuimanghuo Trading Company

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,500
welcomes a grand occasion

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,300
The 8th anniversary celebration is here

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,220
Good

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,780
Alright

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,500
Then I'll announce

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,140
Our Tuimanghuo Trading Company's

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,420
8th anniversary celebration

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,540
now officially begins

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,580
Okay

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,180
Quiet

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,940
As everyone knows

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,020
during our annual meeting

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,540
our HR department's performance didn't happen

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,900
Does anyone still remember what it was?

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,940
I know

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,260
Let me meow along

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,580
Meow together

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,660
Right

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,380
Not bad

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,300
Yes, meowing

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,820
This program of ours is brought to you by

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,820
Led by President Thomas

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,580
And our HR department

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,780
Along with five other Toms

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,980
To present to everyone

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,500
Welcome Big Tom and Little Tom

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,740
Let's begin then

30
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,140
Alright

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,940
Come on, President Tom

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,780
Actually, I don't particularly like this

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,700
But I just feel that

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,540
Since it's the anniversary celebration, let's have some fun

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,660
What about yours?

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,100
Alright, come on friends

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,260
We all have some

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:48,940
Here you go

39
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,420
Everyone gets one

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,660
Take it

41
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,900
Here, please take our props

42
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,820
Put on the cat ears and cat gloves

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,380
One for each person, right?

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,660
My head is too big

45
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,660
What if it doesn't fit?

46
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,260
This works

47
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,060
Not bad

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,740
Not bad

49
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,420
Why does it have to be crooked?

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,900
But why only fold one?

51
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,820
You're a one-eared cat

52
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,660
One ear... I don't know either

53
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,300
How did this happen?

54
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,940
King of Overwork, this is too much.

55
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,140
Even my ears are tired from all this.

56
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,260
The tired-eared cat.

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,620
The tired-eared cat.

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,100
Right.

59
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,420
Let's do this, guys.

60
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,940
Get the music ready.

61
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
Oh my god, help!

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
Let's meow together

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,940
Acting cute in front of you

64
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,100
Oh meow meow meow meow

65
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,300
This is the mighty cat

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,180
Look how scary this is

67
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,460
I don't want to dance like this

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,820
And also

69
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,300
Come on

70
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,820
No

71
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,660
Let's do it together

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,380
Come

73
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,380
Who are we performing for?

74
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,300
For the ones in front

75
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,860
For the camera, face the camera

76
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,540
That's terrifying

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,220
This old cat

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,540
Alright, thank you all for your hard work

79
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,100
Thank you everyone

80
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,540
Sorry about that

81
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,900
Sorry for offending your eyes

82
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,500
Please excuse my poor performance

83
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,180
So what does everyone think?

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,580
Not bad

85
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,620
That's amazing

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,740
When it comes to our company's looks

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,220
We're exceptional

88
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,900
We're really outstanding

89
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,260
Right? Exactly

90
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,500
Sit down, this doesn't concern you

91
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,900
What do you mean it doesn't concern me?

92
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,980
Average appearance level

93
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,340
The key point is

94
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,940
I think our employees

95
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,540
Mainly match your standard of looks

96
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,420
What's going on here?

97
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,140
Right

98
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,740
If we match that standard, we're doomed

99
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,380
What's happening?

100
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,540
Let's talk properly

101
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:26,940
Talk properly

102
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,060
Have a proper conversation

103
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,180
It's the holiday season

104
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,620
Then let's begin

105
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,980
The second performance

106
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,860
Second performance

107
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,900
These colleagues here

108
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,100
Have prepared a performance

109
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,580
Called "Only the Competitive Can Win"

110
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,100
Alright, let's get started then

111
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,740
Here we go

112
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,820
Got work

113
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,260
Is it time to sing?

114
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,100
Let's go.

115
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,660
Rice bowl, oh rice bowl

116
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,100
Where's the applause?

117
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,980
Success

118
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,300
So successful

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,420
Extremely successful

120
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,780
That was sung beautifully

121
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,460
Good, very nice

122
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,700
Thank you all for your hard work

123
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,740
Tony

124
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,580
What do you think about their

125
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,300
performance just now?

126
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,140
I think it was

127
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,180
My opinion doesn't matter

128
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,420
It's what you think that counts

129
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,300
Right?

130
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,140
How do you think they

131
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,020
performed just now?

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,660
I think

133
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,340
It truly matches our company's name

134
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
Everyone was so busy

135
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,420
Right from the beginning

136
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,300
Everyone was extremely busy

137
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,460
Especially the final dance

138
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,660
Have you seen balloon people before?

139
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,180
Balloon people

140
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,060
The balloon man at the supermarket entrance

141
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,020
Then five in the middle

142
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,060
I think it's actually quite mediocre

143
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,300
The performance is average

144
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,340
The show is also average

145
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,060
He's dead

146
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,260
Killed him

147
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,620
Okay, he's dead
