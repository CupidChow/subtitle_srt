but also many unknown

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,760
juicy scoops

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,640
This week besides the star-studded

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,960
grand show rehearsals

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,320
we have frontline reports from fashion queen Dilraba

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,440
Plus the love-hate relationship

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
between Heli and Moyu Wang

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,280
Without further ado, let's begin

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,240
Let's give a warm welcome to Bali

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,160
Come, let's welcome Young Marshal He

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,600
Let's give a warm welcome to Young Marshal Ning

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Meticulous Brother, Young Marshal Ke

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,160
Bai Youcai, come on

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,400
Wang Esq.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,360
The biggest news in Tuizhen this week

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,200
is undoubtedly the Bali Fashion Week

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,120
with handsome men and beautiful women taking turns on the runway

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,600
That's so dazzling it blinds little Dudu's eyes

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,840
It's such a visual feast that

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,400
I won't need to eat for a week

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,040
What?

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,160
Haven't had enough yet

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
Got it

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,960
I'll sneak you backstage right away

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,600
Straight to the frontlines of gossip

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,520
Where should I sit?

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,680
Come

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,480
What's this?

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,360
Why is there a knife here?

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
Getting ready for later

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,800
You know

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,080
You're basically confessing

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,720
Right

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,480
Confessed

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
Quick

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
So shiny

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,840
Look

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
So you killed him

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
This is from Brother Spider

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
I didn't do it

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,320
But your fingerprints are on it

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
I never touched it

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,480
Let me

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,240
And my saliva

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,880
And my saliva

57
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,520
Here we go.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,280
Let's begin then.

59
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,840
Let's see what this is.

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
Ketchup.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
What is all this stuff?

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
It's ketchup.

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,120
Aren't you checking the clues, bro?

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,800
I didn't look.

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Because you're the killer.

66
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,840
So you don't need to look.

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,320
Look at this situation.

68
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,240
I really need to examine this carefully.

69
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,880
You are...

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,960
Don't speak.

71
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,800
Just pretend you don't know.

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,960
Aren't you a tailor?

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, I'm a tailor.

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,360
Why are you holding a knife?

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,240
For cutting—for cutting clothes.

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,080
Don't overthink it.

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Alright?

78
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
Please don't overthink it.

79
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,560
Why are you hiding it in your sleeve?

80
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:24,920
I...

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,160
None of your business.

82
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,400
Why is there a knife on every table?

83
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,400
You scared me, I thought...

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm telling you, this is definitely a trap

85
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,880
Knives and ketchup

86
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
Does every table have ketchup?

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,040
Soon there'll be real "blood"

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes, that's possible

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,800
You took out the knife

90
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I've already drawn my sword

91
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,600
Why do you have a knife?

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,920
Of course I do

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
Seriously?

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,280
You two, stop playing with knives here.

95
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,520
Rehearsal is starting.

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
My lyrics, my melody.

97
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
My dance, my script.

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
It's way too complicated.

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,240
Tui Bao, my head is spinning just looking at this.

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,400
You just happened to restock.

101
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,960
These lyrics...

102
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,000
You just happened to...

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,320
I was just thinking of buying new clothes.

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
But you just happened to...

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
Restock them.

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,120
New stock arrived, perfect.

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
What a coincidence.

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
Longing for new clothes.

109
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,880
Wearing them makes you enchanting.

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,840
You just happened to...

111
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,520
Restock them.

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,840
Bali has plenty of great ideas.

113
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,720
A pair of scissors.

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,640
A pair of scissors to cut new outfits.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,840
The order line stretches endlessly.

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,480
Booming business, can't grab one.

117
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,560
How does it go? I forgot again.

118
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,960
Bali has plenty of great ideas.

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,920
A pair of scissors to cut new outfits.

120
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,560
Cut new outfits.

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Order.

122
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,480
The order line stretches endlessly.

123
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,320
Okay.

124
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,120
The order line stretches endlessly.

125
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Shout out my name.

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Young Marshal 101 shines bright.

127
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,600
How does the third group sing it?

128
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
Bali has plenty of...

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,640
Great ideas.

130
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,680
A pair of scissors cuts new outfits.

131
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,360
This is a new song.

132
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
Don't know, haven't heard it.

133
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,720
There will be a short dance.

134
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,400
Dance.

135
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,560
You can...

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,720
Solo dance.

137
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,240
Is there still dancing?

138
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,960
Don't know.

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,120
Everyone's going up to dance, right?

140
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,920
Everyone is on stage.

141
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,280
They're all going up too.

142
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,760
Okay.

143
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,040
They all have to pull us along.

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,880
When to enter

145
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,600
Two three four five, go

146
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,760
Longing for a new outfit

147
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,920
Wearing it makes people fascinated

148
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,440
You’ve just restocked

149
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,080
Can’t afford to miss it

150
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,240
Afraid of missing out on good stuff

151
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,200
The new style suits me perfectly

152
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
You want a fresh breakthrough

153
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,560
Source text

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,800
Source text

155
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,000
Source text

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,720
Source text

157
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
Go down

158
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
Let’s go, right?

159
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,560
Make this fashion trend

160
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,760
It’s all because of this idol group 101

161
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,400
101

162
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,920
101

163
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,640
Too popular

164
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
Quite lengthy

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,800
Where does Dilraba's scissors point

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,160
They point at the young marshal's new clothes

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,080
Shout out my name

168
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,080
v

169
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,560
Where does Dilraba's scissors point

170
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,520
They point at the young marshal's new clothes

171
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,480
Shout out my name

172
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,360
Young Marshal 101 shines bright

173
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,280
Move down

174
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
When to move down

175
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,440
After singing 101

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
That's quite something

177
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,840
101

178
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,360
Come closer

179
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,800
Okay

180
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,960
Luckily dodged that one

181
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,320
All about the performance

182
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,280
Alright

183
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,040
You guys put on quite a show

184
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,240
Wait, who's secretly

185
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
memorizing melodies during break time?

186
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,000
You just happened to restock

187
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,280
Perfectly timed restock

188
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,000
Stop bragging

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,800
I need to use the bathroom

190
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,360
Stop

191
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,680
You two are really too much

192
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,440
Be careful

193
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,120
Working hard in secret

194
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Waiting to amaze everyone

195
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,680
It's not just you guys

196
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,800
Isn't this our young commander He?

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Why are you secretly getting extra training from the teacher?

198
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Source text

199
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,440
Let me steal the show

200
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm out of breath

201
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,120
I can't hit this high note

202
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
Actually you're not off-key

203
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,680
You're just unfamiliar with this vocal range

204
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,760
Open up

205
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,080
Powerful

206
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,080
Perfect

207
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,000
Exactly

208
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,480
Push downward with force

209
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,560
Let me powerfully

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,880
That's it

211
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,120
Now you can hit that high note

212
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,800
There you go

213
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Push teacher.png

214
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Now squeeze it

215
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Strong

216
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,680
Yes

217
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,240
Powerful pose

218
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,760
Let me strike a powerful pose

219
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,840
Perfect, just like that

220
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay, let's do it once

221
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,640
Let me strike a powerful pose

222
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,640
Let me steal the show

223
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,800
Perfect

224
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
Got it, good

225
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,040
Who's radiating charm here?

226
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,160
Turns out it's our very own

227
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,920
number one beauty

228
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
Who would've thought on and off stage

229
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
she has two different personas

230
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
The contrast is striking

231
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,040
What should I do?

232
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,160
I'm falling harder

233
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,800
So graceful

234
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,680
Unbelievable

235
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,560
Transcendent

236
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,680
Oh, not bad

237
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,040
Oh, not bad

238
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,160
Hey, not bad

239
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,080
Pretty good

240
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,960
Xiao Ba, the deposit is missing

241
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Oh no oh no oh my god

242
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,200
Xiao Ba's hard-earned money is gone

243
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,680
What should we do then?

244
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,960
The money's just gone

245
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,200
That was just the deposit

246
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,040
The down payment

247
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
If the deposit's gone, I'll have to compensate them

248
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,960
No need

249
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Just make the clothes

250
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
for them when the time comes

251
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
The deposit was 20%

252
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,040
Your profit margin

253
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,160
is 40% per garment

254
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,080
You'll still make money

255
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,320
What if the money's really lost?

256
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Nothing that can't be solved

257
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,240
with some rest, Xiao Ba

258
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,960
What's this?

259
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
Made in Tuizhen. What?

260
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,960
What is this?

261
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,600
Are you guys asleep?

262
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
No.

263
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
Some are still awake.

264
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,640
Only one person is awake.

265
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,800
Everyone else is asleep.

266
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Hello.

267
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,920
Hello.

268
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,520
Where is everyone?

269
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Hello.

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
Just stay here.

271
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
Stay put.

272
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
After resting,

273
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,840
Fully recharged.

274
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
Newbie on the road.

275
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,960
Leave no stone unturned.

276
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,640
The year 1923.

277
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,680
In 1923, we were jumping into the river.

278
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,920
1923.

279
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,040
The three of us were busy jumping into the river.

280
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
November 1923.

281
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,280
This is 1923.

282
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,360
On February 7, 1923,

283
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,840
He knew his partner had issues.

284
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,640
When did his partner leave?

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,840
After making a lot of reasonable points,

286
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,280
They found the real culprit was someone else.

287
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
That was awkward.

288
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,880
Is Heli Moyu just trying to fish in troubled waters?

289
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
Every member of the detective team is better than KING.

290
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,840
The investigation is full of comedic moments.

291
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,280
There's only one truth.

292
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,720
No way, I won't accept that.

293
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,640
This Commander He...

294
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
What's going on with you?

295
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,360
How did you...

296
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,080
How did you get first place?

297
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,240
Come on, Old Bai, you try.

298
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,040
Go ahead.

299
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,120
Let me try.

300
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Let me see this thing.

301
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,880
Is it really this simple?

302
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,160
Spin a few times.

303
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Spin five times.

304
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,320
One.

305
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,200
Two.

306
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,960
Three.

307
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,880
Four.

308
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,960
Five, done.

309
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,440
Here we go.

310
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,160
Three, two, one, flick.

311
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,240
It flicked off.

312
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm really dizzy.

313
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,760
Here, sit down first.

314
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,480
Sit.

315
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,280
So dizzy.

316
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,840
Come on.

317
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,960
Cover one eye.

318
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,400
Okay.

319
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,200
Don't remove it.

320
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,680
Alright.

321
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,720
One, two, three, four, five.

322
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Done, don't remove it.

323
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,720
Flick.

324
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
Nothing.

325
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,560
How is everyone so good at this?

326
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,000
See? They totally beat you.

327
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,560
If you're going to mess with me, I'm better than KING.

328
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,640
Commander He.

329
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,760
Someone's been bullying you too, right?

330
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,960
This feeling of being bullied...

331
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,040
Doesn't feel good, does it?

332
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,600
This...

333
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,320
Come on, now it's your turn.

334
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,360
Go ahead.

335
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,280
One, two, three, four, five.

336
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,800
Five.

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,040
Three, two, one, flick.

338
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,080
I played

339
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Finally, one didn't miss

340
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,640
Only you yourselves know

341
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
whether you've been corrupted

342
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,880
We definitely know

343
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,280
who the bad guys are

344
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,320
Then between two investigators

345
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
they'll soon clash

346
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,640
Right.

347
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,680
There's one.

348
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,280
There's a detective who's actually an undercover criminal.

349
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
But what we can't confirm yet is

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,440
whether the killer has completed their mission.

351
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,960
So these two

352
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,440
might or might not have been corrupted.

353
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,120
Not necessarily.

354
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,480
Could the killer's mission

355
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,240
be about eating oranges?

356
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,920
It's about eating oranges, right?

357
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,240
Eating oranges.

358
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,720
Making everyone eat oranges.

359
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,800
If that's the case, we're done for.

360
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,160
I didn't distribute them.

361
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,720
I was sitting there eating by myself.

362
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
But you initiated this action.

363
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,440
I didn't initiate anything.

364
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,720
I was just eating by myself.

365
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,680
I only gave you some because you asked.

366
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,520
Then he came over and took two.

367
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
So whose evidence basket is this in?

368
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
This is Bai Youcai's.

369
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,720
He was the one distributing oranges to us.

370
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,360
Right, that's my evidence basket.

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
What, trying to frame me?

372
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,160
Let's all take a look at how

373
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,560
the oranges were distributed.

374
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
During the hide-and-seek

375
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,960
competition segment,

376
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
after I disappeared for twenty days,

377
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,000
I was knocked out with a club.

378
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,200
I was already in a room

379
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,160
There were only two people in that room at the time

380
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,240
Just a man and a woman

381
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,280
Please don't falsely accuse me

382
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,360
Strange

383
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,160
So now in this round

384
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,280
We've confirmed their murder motives

385
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Both of them

386
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,360
Don't even have motives yet

387
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,200
So that means we're both innocent

388
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,480
Don't take it upon yourself

389
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm begging you

390
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,320
Just stop talking

391
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,000
You're innocent

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm certain you're innocent

393
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,240
Alright, now we'll

394
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,520
Start with some wild speculation

395
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,280
Bai Youcai, who do you suspect?

396
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Already suspecting people?

397
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,440
I thought we couldn't speculate wildly?

398
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,760
Only the killer can make wild claims

399
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,280
No, I mean who do you guess?

400
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,880
Let's make some guesses

401
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,000
Guess, just guess randomly

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,120
I'd rather not guess

403
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,720
Let's just falsely accuse everyone first

404
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,600
Accuse everyone in turn

405
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,720
Right, who do you think?

406
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,600
Who do I think?

407
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,040
I think it's me

408
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,320
Alright

409
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,000
How about it?

410
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,680
Beautiful

411
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,160
Extremely high-end

412
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,840
High-end game

413
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,320
Right

414
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,920
So your feud with Master Le

415
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,800
is about what?

416
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,200
Also to protect

417
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,200
I just want to take him down

418
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
Just shut up

419
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,560
You've got the will but not the guts

420
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,880
You might have the guts

421
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,000
but you can't do it

422
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,560
I have the guts but can't do it

423
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,520
Okay, your logic

424
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,240
I didn't understand any of that

425
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,320
No

426
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,560
The current design is so complicated

427
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,760
It shouldn't be this complicated

428
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
If it were me, I'd just slash through it

429
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,640
That simple, very brutal

430
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,960
Straight with an axe

431
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,880
One simple slash

432
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,480
Thanks for ruling out that I'm a good person

433
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,120
That's what I thought first

434
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,080
Okay, no problem

435
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,160
Next we have the Wang legend, right?

436
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,880
My physical evidence is a bit complicated

437
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,920
Very complicated indeed

438
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,560
These few men

439
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
all revolve around it

440
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,920
It must be complicated

441
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,840
So who's the killer?

442
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,960
I already have someone in mind

443
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
In Bai Youcai's mind

444
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,480
He already

445
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,880
The next second he stood up to vote

446
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,720
I think it's already

447
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Exactly

448
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,880
I've already filled out my ballot

449
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
You're just bragging

450
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,240
Didn't I just write it?

451
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,160
Didn't you see it?

452
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,240
You didn't write it

453
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,920
I did write it

454
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,600
I just haven't thought of the reason yet

455
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,120
Very suspicious

456
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,760
Used some clever methods

457
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,280
Clever techniques

458
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
X is definitely him

459
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,240
Need I say more?

460
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,160
No

461
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,800
Then why accuse me?

462
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,240
About this X matter

463
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,960
There might be X or might not be X

464
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,480
But this time there definitely is

465
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,800
Why definitely?

466
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,680
No, I also think it's him

467
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,040
But not you

468
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,880
But not me

469
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,760
Then it must be you

470
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,200
You can vote for me

471
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,720
Right

472
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,240
What are you laughing at?

473
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,480
What's so funny about you?

474
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,120
There's something wrong with you.

475
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,040
I think your smile...

476
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,560
I think you're not yourself today.

477
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,920
Of course I'm not myself.

478
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,320
You've been desperately trying...

479
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,720
to avoid saying "the killer."

480
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,040
I said...

481
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,720
In my keywords...

482
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,920
I never mentioned "the killer."

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
I think X doesn't matter anymore.

484
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,200
It doesn't matter.

485
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
X really doesn't matter.

486
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,640
It's unimportant.

487
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,480
I think X is meaningless.

488
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
During the day I went to buy chicken

489
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,120
But they all said I was a murderer

490
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,440
The chicken shop wouldn't let me buy chicken soup

491
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,040
So I had to buy a chicken myself

492
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,640
And stew it myself

493
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,440
I spent the whole day making soup

494
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,120
The entire day making soup

495
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Tell me about your evening

496
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,080
I only had one thing in the evening

497
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,120
At 10:40 I went to Bajia Alley

498
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
Knocked on her dormitory door

499
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,680
To give her chicken soup

500
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,760
But there was no response

501
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,600
I could only go home

502
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,800
And drank the chicken soup myself

503
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,280
Is there anyone who can verify this?

504
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,560
Bulldozer Chicken

505
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,840
Bulldozer Chicken

506
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,400
What's Bulldozer Chicken?

507
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
Can't you make up a better story first?

508
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,080
I genuinely spent the whole day making this chicken soup.

509
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,680
Really.

510
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,600
Don't say "really," you're just...

511
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
Only Bulldozer Chicken can verify this.

512
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,240
He went to buy chicken there.

513
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,600
He can't prove it himself either.

514
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,200
He said after making the soup,

515
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,440
did he drink that soup himself?

516
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,680
Was he even doing this?

517
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,440
You know what?

518
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,440
Does Bulldozer Chicken even exist now?

519
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,760
Or bring Bulldozer Chicken's owner

520
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,400
over here.

521
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,040
Let's check Commander He's room.

522
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,520
Commander He.

523
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,480
Why did you suddenly then

524
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
make chicken soup for her?

525
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,720
Not earlier, not later,

526
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,080
you chose that moment to make soup.

527
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,040
That just feels suspicious to me.

528
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,560
There should be a chicken head left here.

529
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,040
Because for his stewed soup,

530
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,160
he'd cut off the head parts.

531
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,640
The chicken tail should still be in the room.

532
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,440
We should be able to find it.

533
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,960
He prepared it here then took it home to stew.

534
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,520
Alright

535
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,080
This episode of Tui Town's General Store

536
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
ends here

537
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,920
To all our bulldozers

538
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,600
Do visit the General Store often

539
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,720
Same time, same place next week

540
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,520
More surprises waiting to be discovered

541
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,040
Come on

542
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,120
All you little killers, veteran killers

543
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,160
Veteran killers

544
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,680
And Killer X

545
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
That's right

546
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,480
I am Killer X

547
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,760
None of you are good people

548
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,240
Let me tell you

549
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,880
Do I look

550
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,360
really like a killer to you?

551
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,080
Why won't you believe

552
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,320
that I'm suspicious?

553
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,040
You're really going all out now

554
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
Is it that scary?

555
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
At this point

556
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,560
stop with this lovesick persona

557
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,160
alright?

558
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,000
Take these crazy elements

559
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,800
and push them to the extreme

560
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,760
You'll become

561
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,560
the ultimate character in this show

562
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,080
This game is called Radish Squat

563
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,040
Then I'll be Bai Yu

564
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
You can be Bai Yu

565
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm Bai Yu

566
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,640
Then what am I called?

567
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,600
You call me

568
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm Dilraba, okay

569
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,320
After Bai Yu squats, Liu Yuning squats

570
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,120
Liu Yuning squats

571
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
After Liu Yuning squats, Liu Yuning squats

572
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
After Wang Xun squats, Zhou Keyu squats

573
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,120
It's stuck

574
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,200
Zhou Keyu isn't me

575
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,000
It's not him
