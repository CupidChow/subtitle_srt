1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,000
A comprehensive medical view

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,320
With hollowed-out patterns

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
We were wrong too

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,840
If I make this mistake, I'll really have to

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,640
withdraw from the competition myself

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,320
This self-doubt of yours

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,240
self-criticism

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,160
self-questioning

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,440
Only highlighted by comparison with peers

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,280
Herbal Memory Garden

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,080
Isn't it this one?

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,680
They're the same

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Same as which one?

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,400
Which one is it the same as?

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,200
Oh dear, I really can't remember

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,960
Can't remember a single thing

17
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,120
I don't remember anything

18
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,520
I even know who this one is

19
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:30,960
Chen Pi

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,120
Hawthorn

21
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,480
Effect

22
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,880
Everything I remembered is gone now

23
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,800
Herbal Medicine Battle

24
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,960
Everyone is being cautious

25
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,280
Whose should we take?

26
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,880
Come, let me read your face

27
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,480
Look me in the eyes

28
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,200
Bullying Consultation Room Two

29
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,960
Let's talk less

30
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Some of them are guilty

31
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,480
How great it would be to eliminate them

32
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,320
Are you going to eliminate him?

33
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,440
We can protect you

34
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,160
No need, let's eliminate them first

35
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,640
I can't wait

36
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,600
Eliminate Consultation Room Two

37
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
If anyone tries to stop us next round

38
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,400
We'll eliminate whoever stops us

39
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,920
We'll stop them

40
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,680
Why is he so arrogant?

41
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,520
I want to eliminate him

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
What do you mean?

43
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,240
"Let's Start Brainstorming"

44
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,120
Great Brain Development

45
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,720
Hello everyone

46
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
Welcome to

47
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,600
"Let's Start Brainstorming"

48
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm the apprentice doctor here

49
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,120
Hou Zhuocheng

50
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,440
And I'm still receiving

51
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,040
Cui Shaoyang's brainwaves

52
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,080
As the hall assistant

53
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,080
Welcome our apprentice doctor team

54
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,320
To the year 2048's

55
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,360
Second acting hall leader selection

56
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,720
Then

57
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
Let's give the warmest applause

58
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,360
To welcome Pengpeng's return

59
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,200
Pengpeng

60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,800
How did you

61
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Introduce me? Say I left?

62
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
What did you say last time?

63
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
He said you were banished by him

64
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
We only realized you weren't coming at the end

65
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,680
Right

66
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,200
I went back to rest for a while

67
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280
And now I've

68
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,880
Returned full of energy

69
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,080
And today I'll also

70
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,880
Actively compete for

71
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,040
The hall leader position

72
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
So this episode's

73
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,160
Assessment rules remain the same

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Alright

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Then let's reveal it right away

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,640
This episode's highly anticipated

77
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
brainpower enhancement services

78
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,000
One is a gentle and soothing

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,520
back relaxation massage

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
A firmer touch is also fine, actually

81
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,920
The other is a swift and decisive

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,560
back muscle-building service

83
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,880
Back muscle-building

84
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,080
Yes

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,040
Both are premium services for the back

86
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,800
Sounds incredibly satisfying

87
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Next up is

88
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
the new clinic formation segment

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,520
In the blink of an eye

90
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,960
it's already the ninth clinic formation

91
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,520
Today's teammate selection order

92
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
will also be determined by

93
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
the results of our competition

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,680
Looking

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,920
Pitch

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
Little bunny be good

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,360
Open the door

98
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
Are you reciting a spell?

99
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,880
Cursing a rabbit?

100
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Each doctor will take turns like this

101
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,560
Sing one line of lyrics

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
After singing, we'll get

103
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,520
Pitch data

104
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,560
Then based on this pitch data

105
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,600
We'll determine the ranking

106
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,800
The one with the lowest pitch

107
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
Will be our first place winner

108
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,320
They'll win this competition

109
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
Let's see who can sing lowest

110
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
Okay, I'll go first then

111
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you ready?

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,720
Yes, we're ready

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,920
Three, two, one

114
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,320
Little bunny be good

115
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Open the door

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,520
That's impressive

117
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,200
Pengpeng's current pitch is at G1

118
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,280
Almost at F1 now - it's F1

119
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,120
That low?

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,720
Yes

121
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,320
Little bunny be good

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,560
Open

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I feel like I'm gonna throw up

124
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,480
Open

125
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,840
Stop

126
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Stop

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,320
The lowest note is actually E2

128
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
Next is our Zongyu

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,320
Little bunny be good

130
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,520
Open the door

131
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
It's F1, also F1

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,960
But you're slightly below F1

133
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,160
Now Zongyu is in first place

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,320
Understood

135
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,840
Three two one

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,480
Little bunny be good

137
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,440
Open the door

138
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,480
G2

139
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,280
Good

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,480
Little bunny be good

141
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,200
So aggrieved

142
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Open the door

143
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,040
About to cry

144
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,400
Yours is at G1

145
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,880
Zifan, are you ready?

146
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,840
Three two one

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,640
Little bunny be good

148
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,160
Open the door

149
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
E2

150
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Kaikai

151
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Little bunny be good

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Open the door

153
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,480
This is very good

154
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,640
G1

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,720
Okay

156
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,840
Our first place winner has been decided

157
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,720
It's our Zongyu

158
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,240
Thank you

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,920
Second place is our Pengpeng

160
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,840
They've both earned

161
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,440
the right to choose teammates first

162
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,240
In the previous eight episodes

163
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,600
I've actually teamed up with everyone

164
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,760
except Brother Pengpeng

165
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,320
So today I kind of want

166
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,200
to team up with Brother Pengpeng

167
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
I actually wanted to choose Zongyu too

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,360
But since he's first place

169
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,920
I feel like

170
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,560
we might be split into different teams

171
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
And then I thought that's kind of...

172
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,120
actually quite nice

173
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,560
Alright

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
So our first clinic team is decided

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
It's our Pengpeng

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,960
and our Zongyu

177
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
forming our first clinic team

178
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,200
Haoyang and Kaikai are both G1

179
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,880
So it's a tie between you two

180
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,400
Let's do this

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
You'll decide by rock-paper-scissors

182
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,000
who's third and who's fourth

183
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,680
Okay

184
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
Rock-paper-scissors

185
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,280
Alright

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,480
Now our Kaikai gets to choose first

187
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,720
Haven't teamed up with Minghao

188
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
Then I'll choose Minghao

189
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,440
Good

190
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,520
So our Kaikai and Minghao

191
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,720
have successfully become

192
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
our second clinic team

193
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
This episode I want to choose Xiaolong

194
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,120
I want to try some new combinations

195
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
Actually, I was thinking the same today

196
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Saves me the trouble of choosing

197
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,480
Then our Haoyang and Xiaolong

198
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
successfully form the third clinic team

199
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,280
Okay

200
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,520
Then our remaining Zifan and I

201
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,120
will form the fourth clinic team

202
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,840
Long-time-no-see teammate

203
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,320
I've really missed this

204
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
Good, that's perfect

205
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,120
Alright everyone

206
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,200
What will our first round game be?

207
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,960
Same as usual

208
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,320
We'll decide by drawing cards

209
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,120
What should we draw?

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,200
He Yun

211
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,960
He Yun

212
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,760
Okay, this one

213
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
Herb Competition

214
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,160
Is it our questioning

215
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,560
that got us eliminated?

216
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,640
Questioning

217
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,480
Questioning

218
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,280
We question

219
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,560
Goodbye

220
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,280
I won't speak anymore

221
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Each clinic should send one representative

222
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,080
to play rock-paper-scissors

223
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,640
Come on, rock-paper-scissors

224
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Let's do another one

225
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,960
Rock-paper-scissors

226
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,040
Okay

227
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,440
Starting with Clinic 1, Clinic 2

228
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
Clinic 3, then Clinic 4

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
Take two, right

230
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,400
Two, correct?

231
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,280
Each take two

232
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Okay

233
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,680
Then let's start from the consultation room

234
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,040
This one first

235
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,480
No, this one first

236
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,320
Let’s take more first

237
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,680
Alright

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,840
We have the outpatient director

239
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,960
We want to take three

240
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,120
Okay, any objections?

241
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,560
No one questions

242
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,320
Take three

243
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,440
We're also outpatient department directors.

244
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
You're outpatient department directors too?

245
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
I don't question it.

246
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,880
Neither do you question it.

247
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,800
We don't question it.

248
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,560
We don't question it.

249
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
If you say you're outpatient directors, then you are.

250
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,560
We don't question it.

251
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
Everyone is being very cautious.

252
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,720
Then we'll take some.

253
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,640
Take three.

254
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,400
Okay.

255
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,640
Alright, let's go to the next examination room.

256
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,840
Don't tell me you're outpatient directors too?

257
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,600
We are.

258
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,120
What are you?

259
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,360
Pharmacists.

260
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,560
Whose should we take?

261
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
It must be those two outpatient directors.

262
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,880
They're already outpatient directors anyway.

263
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,160
The other one only has a one-fifth chance.

264
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,560
of being the pharmacist.

265
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
Come, let me read your face.

266
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,120
Look me in the eyes.

267
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
Let me read your face.

268
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,280
Are you the pharmacist?

269
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,720
No.

270
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,080
Are you the pharmacist?

271
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Then...

272
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
They seem like pharmacists.

273
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,880
Then I think it's Examination Room 2.

274
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,640
I think...

275
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,880
Minghao's eyes show a hint of weakness.

276
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,640
Bullying Examination Room 2.

277
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,400
Any doubts?

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,000
We are the pharmacists.

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,160
We are the pharmacists.

280
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
To stop you.

281
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
You're just going to

282
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
give up like this?

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,440
In that case,

284
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,600
you'll get nothing this round.

285
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
Let's talk less.

286
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,000
We're trying to provoke their doubts.

287
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,440
Right.

288
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Any objections?

289
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,080
Don't question it.

290
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,240
No objections.

291
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,760
No objections.

292
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,480
Then we'll withdraw.

293
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,600
No objections.

294
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,680
Anyway, they're the outpatient directors

295
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,320
and pharmacists.

296
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,640
Then we're the outpatient directors.

297
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,520
We should take three medicine packages.

298
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,160
No,

299
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
if you don't question this, it's really...

300
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,360
Some of them are guilty.

301
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,120
I won't question it.

302
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,920
No questioning.

303
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,920
Should we question it or not?

304
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,280
Let's not question it.

305
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,240
Forget it, just forget it.

306
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Let it go.

307
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,480
Take three then.

308
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
Being kind to others is being kind to yourself.

309
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,800
Should we swap?

310
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,600
No swap, we can draw again.

311
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,240
No, I'm worried someone might challenge.

312
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,280
I want to draw one first.

313
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,000
Alright.

314
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,840
We're the administrative directors.

315
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,000
We want to exchange cards.

316
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,160
Swap.

317
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,600
Actually, him swapping cards doesn't matter.

318
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,880
They really have it.

319
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,600
I think so too.

320
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,760
Fine, go ahead and swap.

321
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,440
Go ahead.

322
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,240
Okay, we'll swap one.

323
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,760
Let's go.

324
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
We're still the outpatient directors.

325
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
We'll take three more herbs.

326
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,120
We need to take three more herb packs.

327
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,800
They're taking three more.

328
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Then we can initiate consultation.

329
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,800
Anyone want to challenge?

330
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,280
Any challenges?

331
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
We're the outpatient directors.

332
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,480
We're the outpatient directors.

333
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,880
Let them take first.

334
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,840
You go ahead.

335
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,840
Can initiate consultation now.

336
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,280
Right.

337
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,200
You'll need next round.

338
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,240
to initiate consultation.

339
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,600
Right, we can't consult now.

340
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,680
We'll just take one.

341
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
So obedient.

342
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Our turn now.

343
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,000
We're those outpatient directors.

344
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,040
We'll take three more.

345
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,880
Any challenges? No one again.

346
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,040
No challenge.

347
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Forget it.

348
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
We are the outpatient department director

349
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,360
We'd like to take three

350
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,800
Go ahead

351
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,280
Take them

352
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,840
We won't question it

353
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
No questions, take them

354
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,120
Let's directly target Clinic One.

355
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,520
I think we should incite Clinic Four.

356
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,720
Clinic One will be eliminated right away.

357
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,600
Really.

358
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,520
I think so.

359
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay.

360
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,920
Alright then.

361
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,200
If we incite them, it'll definitely happen.

362
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,560
Fine.

363
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,640
They'll surely do it.

364
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,440
Agreed.

365
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,920
Good.

366
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,360
To make everyone wait less here,

367
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Yes, we've decided—

368
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,440
We'll eliminate one person.

369
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,080
Right.

370
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,600
Do you get what we mean?

371
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,440
What do you mean?

372
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,960
Got it.

373
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,480
Understood.

374
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,320
Clear.

375
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,760
Good.

376
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,120
Alright.

377
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,000
We'll eliminate—

378
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,280
Take out one of theirs.

379
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,640
What does that mean?

380
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Got it? Understand?

381
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
They only have one left.

382
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,760
So that so-called clinic director

383
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,680
must be questioned.

384
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,520
Your seven cards

385
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:17,960
Right.

386
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,280
will definitely make you lose one.

387
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
Okay, your turn now.

388
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,200
You should take theirs too.

389
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,560
Otherwise they'll eliminate us.

390
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,680
How about we eliminate them instead?

391
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,760
Are you going to eliminate him?

392
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
Absolutely.

393
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,680
We won't eliminate you anyway.

394
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Right, so you should take their cards.

395
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,600
No.

396
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,920
I think the current strategy is

397
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,560
we need to protect ourselves.

398
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,360
Because we're weak.

399
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,800
We only have three medicine packs.

400
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,160
Right.

401
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,840
And we don't know

402
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,720
what cards you have.

403
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,080
Right.

404
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,760
Our priority is self-preservation.

405
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,640
Right, let's protect ourselves.

406
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,640
If we take two medicine packs,

407
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
will anyone stop us?

408
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,400
But both of them are outpatient department directors

409
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,760
Basically everyone

410
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,400
Just don't you two stop us

411
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,440
We won't make a move either

412
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
We won't eliminate you

413
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,120
But the problem is

414
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
You need to initiate this action first

415
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
Then we can decide whether to

416
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
We're just discussing in advance

417
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,360
But if you take theirs

418
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
They can't eliminate them

419
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,800
Right

420
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,280
How great it would be to eliminate them

421
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,840
We can protect you

422
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,720
No need, eliminate them first

423
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,560
You can protect us, right?

424
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:03,960
Yes

425
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,520
Why can you protect us?

426
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,000
Meaning we won't eliminate you

427
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,440
We have the chief surgeon

428
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,080
How is this

429
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Then we can protect you too

430
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
He never had the ability to protect you

431
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,640
Wait a minute

432
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,680
If we don't take theirs

433
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,320
You'll eliminate us, right?

434
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,600
Not exactly

435
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,160
We have eight

436
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,120
You can do as you please

437
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
It's up to you

438
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,040
They have eight

439
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,240
You should come over here.

440
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,560
Right.

441
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,360
We've got it handled.

442
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,800
You take him out, we'll take him out.

443
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,360
Problem solved.

444
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,760
But why choose us?

445
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,360
Instead of them?

446
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
We only have one now.

447
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,120
We're no threat to them.

448
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,040
That actually makes sense.

449
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,680
It does make sense.

450
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,000
That's logical actually.

451
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,720
It's quite reasonable.

452
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,000
Right?

453
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,560
Besides, Yang Zongyu is a man of integrity.

454
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,320
Are we not trustworthy?

455
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm dying of laughter

456
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,360
Wait a minute

457
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,960
Our turn

458
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Just to make it clear

459
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,560
We're taking Action Three

460
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,440
But if anyone

461
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
has the clinic director

462
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,000
or tries to stop us next round

463
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,280
whoever stops us, we'll take them out

464
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,120
Okay

465
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,960
So don't stop us

466
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,800
Any objections?

467
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,560
If not, we'll take it

468
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,160
Confirmed

469
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,000
We'll stop you

470
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,560
So you're stopping us?

471
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,320
We're stopping you

472
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,160
We stop them

473
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,240
This isn't what I expected

474
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,440
This isn't what I expected either

475
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,320
How about we

476
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,840
Let's go down first

477
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,880
Right

478
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,160
Let's go for tea instead

479
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,360
Then don't take it

480
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,240
Now it's our turn

481
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,600
Think carefully

482
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,440
Think carefully

483
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,040
Think carefully

484
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
Actually now we could

485
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
We owe Clinic 2 a favor

486
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,720
Take out Clinic 1 first

487
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,000
Or

488
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
We owe Clinic 1 a favor

489
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,360
Take out Clinic 2

490
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,960
I think we should take out Clinic 2

491
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,840
If you take out

492
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,600
You take us out

493
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,560
Then they take you out

494
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,000
Then you

495
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,800
What they're saying

496
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
This advantage disappears, right?

497
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
Then it's just you two left

498
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
Exactly the same situation

499
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,760
Both with one left

500
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,600
Then you're in the same position as us

501
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:38,840
Right

502
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,200
Why should we have two opponents

503
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,320
Instead of just one

504
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,200
So you're saying

505
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,880
The two of us

506
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
In your current assessment

507
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Can create the same situation for you

508
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
They're actually the same

509
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,160
Right

510
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
They're not the same

511
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,760
They have no reason to take us out

512
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,040
If they take us out

513
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,560
It only gives Clinic 3 an advantage

514
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,480
Their chances of competing with you

515
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
Are much higher than ours

516
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,200
We only have one life

517
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
They'll definitely prioritize taking you out

518
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,160
Okay

519
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,200
That's how it is

520
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,560
Take out Clinic 2

521
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,400
Hurry, I can't wait any longer.

522
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
Target Consultation Room Two.

523
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,720
Alright.

524
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,280
Okay, good.

525
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,240
Consultation Room Four.

526
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
In the next two rounds,

527
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,440
Do you have two rounds left?

528
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,880
At first,

529
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,240
we thought from your advantageous position.

530
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,560
Right.

531
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,080
I initially trusted you to target them.

532
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,920
That's why we targeted them.

533
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,280
But now,

534
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,960
he even suggested

535
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,120
whether to discuss it with you.

536
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,600
Now you want to target us.

537
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,640
But we did consider

538
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,160
I think

539
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,680
what's your reasoning?

540
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Now our outcome

541
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
is left for them to decide.

542
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,560
Who are they targeting now?

543
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
We should directly target Consultation Room Two.

544
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,680
Target Consultation Room Two.

545
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,240
Good.

546
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,160
So why do you

547
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,280
want to target Consultation Room Two?

548
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,800
Because his logic is correct.

549
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,680
If I stay,

550
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,600
if I eliminate him,

551
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,640
I'll be left with two full-health opponents.

552
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,360
But have you considered

553
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,880
Zongyu is so smart,

554
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,040
he's implying you're not as clever as him.

555
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,480
That's not acceptable.

556
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,360
In my opinion, Huang Kai is smarter than Zongyu.

557
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,960
Well said.

558
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
Straight-up lost.

559
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,960
What?

560
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
The outpatient director and pharmacist

561
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,000
didn't lie at all.

562
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,440
Right.

563
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,480
Such honest people,

564
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,160
and you just eliminated them.

565
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,000
Consultation Room Four.

566
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,400
Okay, now it's (Consultation Room) Three's turn.

567
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,240
Come on, let's think about our move.

568
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,760
I think we should take two medicine packs.

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,160
But they'll try to stop us.

570
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,400
They're the outpatient directors, seriously.

571
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,720
First, if we execute

572
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Plan Three, they'll stop us.

573
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
If we attack them,

574
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,440
but we have the head nurse.

575
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,760
Actually, you'll lose

576
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,360
your medicine packs.

577
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,320
And if we now

578
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
I think this game

579
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,120
has two logics:

580
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,760
One is about deception or honesty,

581
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,280
that's one logic.

582
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,520
The second is

583
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,160
about the balance

584
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,320
of power.

585
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
If we use three medicine packs

586
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,640
to attack them,

587
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,680
we'll have no cards left.

588
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,440
That's the first point.

589
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,640
Then in the next round

590
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,760
they'll take three medicine packs,

591
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,360
their medicine packs

592
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,600
will far outnumber ours.

593
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,000
Do you understand what I mean?

594
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,160
We'll fall far behind them.

595
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,680
We can challenge them,

596
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,160
he must be outpatient.

597
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,400
Even if they really have outpatient,

598
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,360
so what?

599
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,880
You should challenge them later,

600
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,200
and if you only have one life left,

601
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,680
you'll need to challenge them again.

602
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,200
Let's assume we're not

603
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,560
If our attack succeeds?

604
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I don't think it will succeed.

605
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,360
Actually, you should now consider

606
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,040
whether to aim for second

607
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,360
or third place.

608
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,720
Why is he so arrogant?

609
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,640
I want to attack him.

610
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,840
I really think we can take them down

611
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,240
We

612
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,760
Zongyu, let's eliminate them

613
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,960
We have this idea

614
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,720
Why don't we team up to take them out

615
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
We actually only have one of those

616
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,440
Right

617
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,760
No, my reasoning is this

618
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,560
First we'll reduce them by one health point

619
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,680
Then regardless of whether they have a head nurse

620
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,560
We'll challenge them

621
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,960
We'll try our best to reduce them by one HP

622
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,280
Then when your turn comes next

623
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,800
You can reduce them by another HP

624
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,120
But we'll need at least two turns

625
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,960
I know

626
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,560
I just wanted to explain this

627
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
This strategy

628
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,520
Because we don't want to fight you

629
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,800
We might not survive until

630
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,800
It's fine, doesn't matter

631
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,560
Then let's make our move first

632
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,120
Yes, I think taking them down is possible

633
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,840
We'll strike directly

634
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,960
You're the lead surgeon

635
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,040
Then want to eliminate us

636
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,520
Correct

637
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,560
And we're the head nurse

638
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,160
Challenge?

639
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,840
Challenge

640
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,160
Failed challenge, discard one

641
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
This feels terrible

642
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,360
It's okay, think about us

643
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
You're doing fine

644
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,840
Still have 10% (mental energy) left

645
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,600
You're a good person

646
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,320
Next time I want to be a good person

647
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,760
Now we'll draw a card

648
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,240
So what I mean is

649
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,680
Surgeon (Doctor)

650
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,600
Alright then, we

651
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,800
We're basically now

652
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,600
playing with our cards revealed

653
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:40,960
Right

654
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,520
Okay

655
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,160
Next round is ours, right?

656
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,560
We're the outpatient department directors

657
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,800
We'll take three medicine packages

658
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,800
Outpatient department director

659
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,360
Should we challenge them?

660
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,200
They're the outpatient department directors

661
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,680
No challenge

662
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,080
Why are you so submissive to them

663
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,640
but come down hard on us?

664
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Then it's your turn

665
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
No one challenged them

666
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,560
We're the administrative section chiefs - swap cards

667
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,080
Challenge?

668
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,520
No challenge

669
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,560
We won't challenge you

670
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,160
Will they challenge?

671
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Are you going to challenge?

672
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,920
We're not

673
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,880
Yes, I understand

674
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,720
Remember this bond between us

675
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,760
We didn't remember

676
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,360
Then we

677
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,320
How many medicine packs do you have?

678
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,720
We have four.

679
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,040
I think we can take their medicine packs.

680
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,800
Let me think.

681
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,360
Because they most likely

682
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,520
took a head nurse for protection.

683
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:46,960
I think

684
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,880
and then add an outpatient department director.

685
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,160
Alright, then let's take those two.

686
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,000
We want to take you two.

687
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,040
Wait a minute.

688
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,520
We are pharmacists.

689
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,240
We'll take two medicine packs from you.

690
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,080
We're pharmacists too.

691
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,880
We're also pharmacists.

692
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,840
We'll stop them.

693
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,840
Whether to challenge or not.

694
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,240
We only have one life.

695
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,160
Should we challenge?

696
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
I think they'll take the head nurse.

697
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
Do you think we should challenge?

698
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,960
Think about it.

699
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,360
Whether you challenge or not.

700
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
Actually puts them in a.

701
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,480
Higher position.

702
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,000
Consider this.

703
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,280
If your challenge succeeds.

704
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,760
They'll be damaged.

705
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,120
If your challenge fails.

706
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,520
They'll move from current third.

707
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,840
To second place.

708
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,120
Think about it

709
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,480
Why would they

710
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
not want us to take it?

711
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,440
Why risk losing this card

712
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,760
by claiming to be pharmacists?

713
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,560
That's my reasoning.

714
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,800
If they weren't,

715
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,440
they'd just say "you take it"

716
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,560
right?

717
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,360
They might

718
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
think they're ahead

719
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,560
in the rotation,

720
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,320
so they're blocking first.

721
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,360
Block if possible,

722
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,960
if not,

723
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,880
I still have more cards

724
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,240
more medicinal ingredients

725
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,960
than you all.

726
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,520
But currently,

727
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,560
we're all at 1 HP.

728
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,520
Given the situation,

729
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,360
they'll target you two,

730
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
you'll be third regardless.

731
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,560
They won't target us -

732
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,600
we could've attacked but didn't.

733
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:56,960
Right.

734
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,120
Yes, we'll self-attack later.

735
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,800
Self-attack.

736
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,360
Then attack again

737
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,240
that Clinic Room 2.

738
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,160
I think if we don't question it

739
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,200
Let's calculate for our next turn

740
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
we can only draw one card at most

741
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,120
We can't do anything to them either

742
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,760
But we shouldn't target them

743
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,720
If we draw another card next turn

744
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,240
then they'll eliminate us

745
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,640
Just 7 herb packs can take us out

746
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,920
Right, they want to eliminate us

747
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,400
We want to maintain balance

748
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,720
They'll definitely eliminate us

749
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,080
Why?

750
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,760
Because right now

751
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,680
we're actively attacking them

752
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,960
How many herb packs do you have now?

753
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,480
4

754
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,760
They'll have 7 next turn

755
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,560
Then let's question it

756
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,080
Question it

757
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,000
Even if it's true, there's nothing we can do

758
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,320
I think the probability isn't that high

759
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
No choice.

760
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Done.

761
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,040
Then we switch a card, right?

762
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,720
Right.

763
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
I think they might actually be...

764
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,960
But we won't question it.

765
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Actually, we'd be out in two rounds.

766
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,160
Then aren't we

767
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,200
Didn't we lose?

768
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,920
You're definitely losing

769
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,160
Because you can't take out their two health points

770
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,480
They'll definitely take one of your health points next round

771
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,720
Okay

772
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,360
Then we're the outpatient directors

773
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
We get three medicine packs

774
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Should we give up or keep playing?

775
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,200
If you don't challenge

776
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,000
they'll lose anyway

777
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,120
No, if you challenge there's still a chance

778
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,560
Right

779
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,040
If you don't challenge, they'll attack you next turn

780
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,880
Right

781
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Then let's challenge

782
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
We have to challenge anyway

783
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,360
No, we...

784
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,040
No, they'll immediately have seven

785
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,560
We're pharmacists

786
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
Whatever role you are won't help

787
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,200
All three pharmacists are here

788
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,840
And you still say you...

789
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,240
That's amazing

790
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,640
What are you?

791
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,280
Challenge

792
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm still thinking how we could...

793
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,360
We're outpatient directors

794
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,200
We can reveal

795
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Okay

796
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Okay

797
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,840
I'm still thinking

798
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,840
What cards could make them have fewer cards

799
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,040
I say we have three cards

800
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,360
It's over

801
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,440
I have a question

802
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,160
When we were the surgeons

803
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,760
attacking you

804
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
you claimed to be head nurses

805
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Were you really head nurses?

806
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,280
Yes

807
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,440
How do they always have survival cards?

808
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,240
Their cards are too good

809
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,840
They're just the chosen winners, right

810
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,120
Indeed, the cards we drew were great

811
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,200
Right, our starting cards were excellent

812
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,040
Think about it, if that attack had succeeded

813
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,000
We'd be in the most advantageous position

814
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,120
Our second round assessment

815
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,680
What should we choose?

816
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,440
Ban Nan Gen

817
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
Ban Nan Gen

818
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,360
Not choosing that

819
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,840
Ba Dou

820
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,040
We already chose Ba Dou yesterday

821
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,160
Tian Ma

822
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,960
Not choosing Tian Ma either

823
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,840
Huajiao

824
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,680
Yes, choose Huajiao

825
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,400
Medical Panorama

826
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,840
Here

827
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,640
Here.

828
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
There are five main views.

829
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,560
Front view

830
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,720
What does front view mean?

831
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,240
1 2 3 4 5

832
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,440
Then place this here

833
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
Put that here

834
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,560
There are four over here

835
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Four

836
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,680
Alright, is that it?

837
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,840
Done.

838
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,600
Ready.

839
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,600
Press it if you're sure.

840
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
We've pressed it.

841
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,760
Did they arrange it wrong?

842
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,080
No

843
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,560
Yes

844
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,120
Don't scare me

845
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,000
It's correct

846
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,120
You scared me

847
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,280
Bro, this self-doubt of yours

848
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,080
Self-criticism, self-doubt

849
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,880
Still have to

850
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,800
Still have to fight alone

851
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,240
I think

852
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,840
No, I'm arranging the top view

853
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,000
Right, I was just arranging it too

854
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,080
So it's a bit messy

855
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
I see something's off with yours

856
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,040
Let me add something

857
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,000
I think starting with the top view is more correct

858
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,240
The top view definitely won't be obstructed

859
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,680
Right

860
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,040
Yes, assemble the top view first

861
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,640
No no no

862
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,280
Below

863
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,320
Top view

864
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,080
Front view is the same

865
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,360
Right?

866
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,200
There's a hollow part

867
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,680
Wrong

868
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,520
Continue

869
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,440
Take a photo first, we'll see

870
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,160
They took photos too

871
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We're also wrong

872
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,360
No, you're clearly missing one here

873
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
Need to attach it

874
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Five

875
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Yes, five, then what?

876
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,920
This part is transparent

877
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,040
Because there's nothing here

878
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,520
One two three

879
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,360
One two three four four

880
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,200
The fourth one

881
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,840
Yes, the fourth one

882
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,640
Place one here, here

883
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,800
Let's go first

884
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,360
Then let's take it slow.

885
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,280
Thank you.

886
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,800
Then we'll take our time.

887
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,760
We can't afford to make any mistakes here.

888
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
Later, we'll take a good look.

889
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,800
1 2 3

890
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,960
Anyway, the left view is correct now.

891
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,760
1 2 3 4 5

892
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,200
1 2 3 4

893
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,720
1 2 3 4 5

894
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,360
The bottom one is empty.

895
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,240
The main view is also empty.

896
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,880
This one's empty too, good.

897
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,280
Top view? There it is.

898
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,320
Okay, this seems correct.

899
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,840
Let me check.

900
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,120
Good.

901
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,760
If this is wrong, I'll really...

902
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,400
...withdraw from the competition myself.

903
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,040
Correct.

904
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,640
Impressive.

905
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,000
All thanks to our peers' contrast.

906
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,200
1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5

907
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,680
1 2 3 4 5

908
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Top view.

909
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,880
3 5 3

910
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,080
3 5 3

911
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,720
Yes, 3.

912
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,480
5, Brother Pengpeng, 5.

913
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,800
Like this.

914
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,400
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3

915
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,680
The main view is a...

916
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,000
Right

917
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,000
We pressed it

918
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,760
We pressed it

919
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,760
Correct

920
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Okay

921
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,320
So nervous

922
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,520
3

923
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,960
3

924
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,480
Corner

925
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,640
Two

926
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,280
First take the top view 3 3

927
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
1 2 3

928
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,680
1 2

929
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,840
There's one here

930
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,080
Then the front view is 1 2 3 4

931
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,240
As for the left view

932
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,480
Like this, shoot

933
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,640
Wait a moment

934
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,040
Correct

935
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,680
One layer is missing.

936
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,000
Every single time,

937
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,280
We're so anxious every time.

938
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,560
Let's take another look

939
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,080
We're also wrong

940
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,440
The top view is incorrect

941
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
The top view is correct.

942
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,280
There's an extra one here.

943
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,720
No, I just randomly placed this.

944
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,680
Should we take the photo then?

945
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,320
Wait a moment.

946
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,160
We're ready, take it.

947
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,560
That's good.

948
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,520
Front view

949
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,720
One like this

950
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,000
One of these

951
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,760
I'll assemble it for you

952
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,560
You watch the top view

953
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,360
1 2 3 4 5

954
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,320
No hollows in the front view

955
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,040
Just build upwards directly

956
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,040
Top view is wrong

957
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,960
3

958
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,000
That one - correct

959
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,360
And then this one is

960
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,880
Feels right now

961
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,120
First place winner, please explain.

962
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,080
Our plan is

963
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,680
we'll first construct the base from the top view

964
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,280
as the foundation.

965
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,200
Even if the bottom layer has hollow spaces,

966
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,920
we're certain that

967
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,160
on top of this base

968
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,880
there must be solid wooden blocks.

969
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,800
Next, I'll handle the front view,

970
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,760
while Xiaolong checks the left view.

971
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,520
The first step is

972
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,680
to confirm if there are any hollow spaces.

973
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,600
If there aren't any hollow spaces,

974
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,720
assembly will be easier.

975
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,320
If there are, we'll need to be careful.

976
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,240
That's about it.

977
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,680
By combining the front and left views,

978
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
we'll know if there are hollow spaces.

979
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,280
Next, let's

980
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,600
start the third round of the game.

981
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,280
Which one should we choose?

982
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,040
Wujiapi

983
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,880
Memory Herb Garden

984
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,640
We'll now begin with

985
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,840
the Fourth Consultation Room which has the highest mental capacity score

986
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,600
starting the card flip

987
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,760
then we'll proceed clockwise

988
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,600
Okay

989
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,720
I'll remember the first two

990
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,760
You remember the last two

991
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,680
I'll remember the lower ones

992
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,120
The lower ones - I'll take the lower ones

993
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,440
Then you remember this side, I'll remember that side

994
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,960
No problem, we'll fight side by side

995
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,040
Advancing together

996
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,440
One left, one right

997
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,040
They're different

998
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,640
Cover them up

999
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,480
If they're different, just cover them all

1000
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,800
Cover

1001
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,760
Cover them, good

1002
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,640
Is it my turn now?

1003
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,440
The characters are the same.

1004
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,000
What about Tianshan?

1005
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,680
Tianshan.

1006
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,480
Study love.

1007
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,280
I really can't remember.

1008
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,120
Can't remember at all.

1009
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,400
It's our turn now, right?

1010
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,640
Let's flip one first.

1011
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,920
It's a bit difficult.

1012
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,400
How should I record this?

1013
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,240
How about this one then?

1014
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,360
Shen Pi

1015
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,880
I remember it was 1 4

1016
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,120
The 4th one

1017
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,960
The 4th one, correct

1018
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,960
Clinic Room 4: 1 point

1019
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,320
Flip that one, the leftmost one

1020
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,400
Hay

1021
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,200
Pet grass

1022
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,960
Long sunflower

1023
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,120
They're different too, just flip randomly

1024
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,400
Flip one first

1025
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Wu Gong

1026
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,520
Just flip randomly

1027
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,480
Flip any one

1028
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,760
Wu Gong, all done

1029
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,960
Can't remember at all

1030
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,680
Completely can't remember, how to memorize this?

1031
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,400
Do you remember where the hay is?

1032
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,760
One is here, another is here

1033
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,960
Let's flip this one first

1034
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,840
The colors are different

1035
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,280
Then don't choose that

1036
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,800
Then just flip randomly

1037
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Flip this one

1038
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,440
There's one that seems

1039
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
It seems like

1040
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,280
Looks like

1041
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,920
Isn't it this one?

1042
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,480
Why do I remember this one and that one

1043
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,320
are both Wu Yi?

1044
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,320
We've

1045
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,440
Exam Room 2 plus 1 point

1046
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,640
Fight God Dragon

1047
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,040
This one's been flipped already

1048
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,200
You go ahead

1049
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,760
I can't remember which one that was just now

1050
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,840
Then let's just flip one randomly

1051
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,120
Let's flip this one

1052
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,520
Go ahead and flip

1053
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,600
This was just flipped

1054
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,800
Already flipped

1055
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,240
Let's just guess one randomly here

1056
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,280
Then this one

1057
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,880
Wait, wait before taking

1058
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,840
Let's just pick one randomly

1059
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,480
Frozen Sword Throat, same one

1060
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,280
Same as which one?

1061
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,120
Which one is it the same as?

1062
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,400
Same as the one they just flipped?

1063
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,120
Let me think about the details

1064
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,480
Yes yes, exactly this color

1065
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,520
Lin Hao flipped this one

1066
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,320
This is a bit difficult

1067
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,120
Let's just make a random guess

1068
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,320
It's fine to take a look

1069
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,880
Remember to choose between these two spots

1070
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,920
3-3

1071
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,160
3-3

1072
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,320
Are you sure?

1073
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,080
Then let's flip it later first

1074
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,040
First flip the hay

1075
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,720
Clinic One plus 1 point

1076
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,000
Do you think it's this one?

1077
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,840
I think it's this one.

1078
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,200
No

1079
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,480
This one hasn't been flipped yet, right?

1080
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,240
Not flipped yet

1081
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,040
Hawthorn

1082
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:16,880
You remember, right?

1083
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,920
I remember

1084
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,680
Should be this one

1085
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,040
My mistake, sorry

1086
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,720
This one hasn't moved, it's flat

1087
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,680
This "Xue Lian" seems to have appeared there

1088
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,160
Maybe, is it this one?

1089
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,200
Yes, this one

1090
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,040
Not at the bottom anymore

1091
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,880
What? What do you mean?

1092
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Then just flip another one randomly

1093
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,760
Flip out 2 and 3

1094
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,040
All done

1095
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,120
Wu, all done

1096
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,520
I know where it is

1097
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,840
I also know where it is

1098
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,520
Let's look at this one

1099
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,280
Go ahead

1100
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,160
Shi Junzi, this one hasn't been flipped

1101
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,680
Do you remember "all done"?

1102
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,960
I kind of want to see this one

1103
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,080
"All done" I remember it was in this area

1104
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,160
A row of parallel ones, maybe this one

1105
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,640
This one

1106
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,760
Look

1107
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,720
Clinic 1 +1 point

1108
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,080
I think this is

1109
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
Then you go first, we'll flip this one

1110
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,440
Okay, flip that one over

1111
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,760
This one

1112
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,560
No

1113
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,280
Okay

1114
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
Alright, we got it

1115
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,480
Okay

1116
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,920
Clinic 2 +1 point

1117
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,120
Now it seems there isn't any

1118
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
None that have appeared before

1119
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,840
You can still flip

1120
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,280
We can flip the unseen ones first

1121
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,600
Those two

1122
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,080
Flip one first

1123
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,200
Flip one first

1124
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,920
I already know who this is

1125
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,360
Chen Pi

1126
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,360
I already know who this is

1127
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,000
Chen Pi

1128
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,880
Sorry

1129
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,720
Effect

1130
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,360
Alright, flip it back

1131
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,320
Just flip any one first

1132
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,200
This one

1133
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,480
Just as expected

1134
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,880
Okay, let's flip one

1135
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,280
Has appeared

1136
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
Let's flip this one

1137
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,960
Shi Junzi, different color

1138
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,360
Flip one first

1139
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,520
We haven't flipped this one, right?

1140
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,400
Flip it

1141
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,880
What great luck

1142
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,400
It's luck, right

1143
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,520
Just pick any one, this one

1144
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,400
Okay

1145
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,560
It appeared last time

1146
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,400
Clinic 2 gets +1 point

1147
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,760
Always picking from below us

1148
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
Long Kui seems to have appeared before

1149
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,320
I think this was the one picked earlier

1150
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,560
This was the one before

1151
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,760
So unlucky, we met it again

1152
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,440
I bet it's the other Long Kui

1153
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,880
Right?

1154
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,400
What if?

1155
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,520
I remember it's here

1156
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,760
Has anyone touched this one?

1157
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,720
No.

1158
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,520
Really haven't.

1159
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,960
Truly haven't.

1160
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,800
I believe you. This...

1161
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,240
Let me handle it.

1162
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,760
You've kept records, right?

1163
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,560
The colors don't match.

1164
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,880
It's fine, nothing can be done about it.

1165
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,280
It's okay.

1166
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,880
This is the first one to flip.

1167
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,880
Just flip any one, I think.

1168
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,040
Lingzhi.

1169
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,920
Is that the one?

1170
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,160
Flipped.

1171
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,480
Okay, Clinic Four gets one point.

1172
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,640
Continue.

1173
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,000
This one hasn't been flipped yet.

1174
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,280
Shengjiang.

1175
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,560
Or this one.

1176
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,080
Or this one.

1177
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,760
Or this one.

1178
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,560
Or this one.

1179
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,000
Or this one.

1180
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,760
This one.

1181
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Stop playing around.

1182
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,880
This one, let's go with this one.

1183
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,280
Long Kui

1184
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,080
The colors are different.

1185
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,160
This one.

1186
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,080
Just pick one randomly

1187
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,520
Yin Xing

1188
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,160
This one

1189
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
I think that one hasn't been translated yet, right?

1190
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,400
Go ahead and translate it

1191
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,600
Wu Gong

1192
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,200
Just pick any one to translate

1193
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,120
Pick one that hasn't been translated yet

1194
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,120
I'll translate it

1195
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,680
Go ahead

1196
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,600
Yin Xing

1197
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,560
Is it that one?

1198
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,840
This one

1199
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,560
Yes

1200
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,120
The color is different

1201
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,720
This is the third time

1202
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,800
The color is different

1203
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,960
The color is different

1204
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,080
The color is different

1205
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,720
Let's pick one that hasn't been translated yet

1206
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,720
Translate this one

1207
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,680
If you can't translate this

1208
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,640
they'll figure out the next one

1209
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,560
To be honest, it's a bit uncomfortable.

1210
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,240
Yinxing

1211
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
This is Yinxing, right?

1212
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,960
Anyway, it's not our turn.

1213
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,440
This Yinxing...

1214
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,120
So it doesn't matter.

1215
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,240
These two...

1216
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Then I remember...

1217
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,960
Let's flip that one.

1218
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,480
This isn't even Yinxing.

1219
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,120
It's not even Yinxing.

1220
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,880
Then let's turn it over.

1221
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,480
I gave you a chance, but you couldn't make use of it.

1222
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,280
Okay.

1223
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,560
I've flipped through it, I remember.

1224
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,920
Sorry.

1225
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,040
Is this it?

1226
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,640
I remember it was this one.

1227
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,440
This is it.

1228
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,480
This one has never been touched, right?

1229
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,080
It's that one

1230
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,320
That one

1231
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,280
Right

1232
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,400
Clinic 3 +1 point

1233
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,280
Flip it

1234
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,160
Go ahead and flip it

1235
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,760
Pearl

1236
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,280
Then whatever

1237
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,240
Go ahead, flip any

1238
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,000
This seems familiar

1239
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,200
But the color's different, I think

1240
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,360
That card

1241
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,920
The one behind the person

1242
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,960
Lucky

1243
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,080
Take the one in the top left corner

1244
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,240
Clinic 4 +1 point

1245
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,000
Yes, this one's unflipped

1246
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,360
Shi Junzi

1247
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,840
I remember Shi Junzi was...

1248
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,880
Probably this card

1249
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:34,880
No, Long Kui

1250
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,440
Long Kui again

1251
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,760
Let's flip this first

1252
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,240
Flip

1253
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,960
That one's ours

1254
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,920
Clinic 2 +1 point

1255
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,280
Shengjiang seems to be these two

1256
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,760
Right?

1257
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,880
Clinic 2 +1 point

1258
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,160
Now just flip randomly

1259
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,240
First flip the unflipped ones

1260
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,320
Tianshan

1261
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,800
I know where it is

1262
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,240
This one, I think it's this

1263
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,200
Just flip this one

1264
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,200
Too bad

1265
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,240
My turn

1266
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,080
Flip an unflipped one

1267
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,720
This one

1268
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,200
Okay

1269
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,080
Flip this

1270
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,480
Pet Grass

1271
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,880
Haven't seen it, really haven't

1272
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,480
Never seen

1273
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,040
Then flip an unflipped one

1274
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,800
Another unflipped one

1275
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,480
The second one

1276
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,280
Do you remember where that is?

1277
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,480
Over by the two Shengjiang areas

1278
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,640
Clinic 4 gets +1 point

1279
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,880
This one, flip this one

1280
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,480
This is Longkui

1281
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,960
But do you remember

1282
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,920
Where the other Longkui is?

1283
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,120
Okay, flip

1284
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,960
Okay

1285
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,080
Look at this, let's check this one

1286
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,440
Let's check this and make a note

1287
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,280
Let me find Quanxie

1288
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,840
This is Quanxie

1289
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,320
Okay

1290
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:50,880
Okay

1291
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,360
Okay

1292
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,920
Go ahead and flip

1293
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
You take that one

1294
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,680
I think it's this one

1295
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,520
Flip it

1296
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,800
It's these two, right?

1297
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,600
Right

1298
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,360
Clinic 2 gets +1 point

1299
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,480
Clinic 2 gets +1 point

1300
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,360
This one then.

1301
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,440
Then let's randomly flip another one.

1302
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,960
I'm relieved it's not Long Kui.

1303
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,560
Flip the one below the human figure.

1304
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:22,920
This one.

1305
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,280
Right.

1306
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,200
What was this again?

1307
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,120
Flip it.

1308
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,400
Exactly.

1309
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:31,960
They flipped the hay.

1310
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,000
I just double-checked it.

1311
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,960
Ours is...

1312
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,160
This is pet grass, right?

1313
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,000
Go ahead and flip.

1314
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,680
Flip this one.

1315
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,480
I remember it was this one.

1316
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,040
Flip.

1317
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,720
Just pick any one.

1318
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,360
This one then.

1319
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
Let's do it.

1320
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,720
Okay.

1321
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,000
Finally flipped that hawthorn card.

1322
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,080
Keep flipping.

1323
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,160
Haven't seen this before.

1324
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,000
The one to the left of the human figure.

1325
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,560
It's nothing

1326
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,480
This

1327
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,360
This is Long Kui

1328
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,120
Right

1329
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,240
I remember everything

1330
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,440
No one could forget

1331
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,120
Clinic Room 4, plus one point

1332
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,360
Then flip one that hasn't been flipped

1333
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,480
Flip Long Kui

1334
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,680
The color is different

1335
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,880
I want to flip that one

1336
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,080
The one in front of them

1337
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,800
Ling Zhi

1338
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,000
Let me think, this one...

1339
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,320
Ours then

1340
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,120
Ours then

1341
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,760
Top two cards

1342
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,520
Flip one first

1343
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,480
Then let's pick this one.

1344
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,400
Anyway, it's the one we just liked.

1345
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,080
This one?

1346
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,680
This one?

1347
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,400
Yes, just in case.

1348
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,240
Flip this one.

1349
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,560
Go ahead, it's all luck.

1350
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,640
This one.

1351
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,320
Let's look at this one, take a look.

1352
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,640
We've already flipped this one.

1353
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,720
This one, we haven't flipped this one, right?

1354
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,040
We've flipped this one too.

1355
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,000
It's fine, we can flip it.

1356
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,960
I'm fine with anything.

1357
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,920
Hawthorn, this...

1358
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,880
Let's check this one again.

1359
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,080
Wu Yi.

1360
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,080
Let's open this one and take a look.

1361
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,760
This one.

1362
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,280
Pet grass.

1363
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,520
I want to flip that one first.

1364
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,120
This one, right?

1365
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,880
All done.

1366
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,320
That one.

1367
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,600
I've been remembering this one for a while.

1368
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,560
That one.

1369
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,920
All my memories are gone now.

1370
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,440
That one

1371
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,280
The one between Jiansuefenghou and Wu Yi

1372
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,360
Okay, this one

1373
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,000
Pet grass

1374
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,920
He cleared them all

1375
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,400
Cleared it

1376
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,040
Impressive

1377
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,040
That one

1378
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,760
Wu Yi

1379
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,240
Impressive

1380
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:25,680
Finished flipping

1381
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:26,800
Go ahead and flip

1382
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,120
Flip it

1383
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,680
That one

1384
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,760
Flip this one, right?

1385
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,760
Impressive

1386
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,480
It's over

1387
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,360
How many points do we add?

1388
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,920
Impressive

1389
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,600
Okay

1390
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,640
We should hug

1391
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,440
Let's hug

1392
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,960
Why is it us again?

1393
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,200
We're last place, right?

1394
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,280
Everyone remembers this

1395
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,200
Actually needs some event

1396
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
To make it easier to remember

1397
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,120
I feel this game is somewhat like

1398
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,560
A bit like snooker

1399
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,480
Yes, exactly like clearing the table

1400
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,360
The table-clearing one

1401
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,720
The winner can keep winning

1402
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,680
After our intense game

1403
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,280
Our Clinic 1 earned 13 points

1404
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,960
Truly impressive

1405
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,400
Alright everyone,

1406
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,960
The three rounds of assessments have concluded.

1407
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,880
So what does our final intelligence ranking

1408
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,560
look like?

1409
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,880
Congratulations to Zifan from Clinic 4 and myself,

1410
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,640
We're blessed.

1411
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,160
Blessed once again.

1412
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,000
How

1413
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,120
did we become the new generation's acting hall masters?

1414
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,000
Now we enter this episode's most grand segment

1415
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,440
That is

1416
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,800
The inauguration ceremony of our acting sect leader

1417
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,600
Bring out the gourd

1418
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,600
Happiness again

1419
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,200
Happiness again

1420
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,800
Happiness again

1421
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,640
Then let us

1422
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,720
Directly proceed to our

1423
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,200
Photo session ceremony

1424
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,160
Today our Clinic Two

1425
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,280
And our Clinic Three

1426
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,640
Will receive brain enhancement services

1427
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,640
Specifically

1428
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,320
Gentle back relaxation enhancement service

1429
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,000
And the swift problem-solving

1430
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,480
Back muscle enhancement service

1431
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,120
The swift method won't actually use knives right?

1432
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
Then you'll do the swift method

1433
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,040
You'll build muscle

1434
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,600
Okay

1435
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,840
And you'll do the gentle method

1436
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,240
Okay

1437
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,520
Alright, bring out the props

1438
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,120
This requires planking

1439
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,040
Onto the body

1440
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,160
Slapping cards

1441
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,560
Must flip them over

1442
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,120
Then let's begin

1443
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,080
Let's go

1444
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,760
What's the plan?

1445
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,600
Take it off, come on

1446
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
Lie face down

1447
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,320
Minghao, have you ever taken clothes off?

1448
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,880
I've worn this outfit since birth

1449
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:46,960
Do we need to

1450
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,280
Are we pulling his clothes?

1451
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,600
Help me adjust the clothes

1452
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,320
Okay

1453
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,760
You're giving me too much

1454
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,440
This feels so strange

1455
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,280
If it's strange why keep adding more?

1456
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,680
Like fish on a chopping block

1457
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Brother Kai, come

1458
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,920
Let's go

1459
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,240
Alright, let's get started.

1460
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,760
Okay.

1461
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,160
This is a bit difficult

1462
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:21,760
It's red

1463
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,280
It's red

1464
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,800
It's red

1465
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,520
Sorry

1466
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,240
Can it really be flipped over?

1467
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,440
I think it's been sitting too long and got stuck

1468
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,920
Yeah, I feel like it's sticking to me a bit

1469
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,000
Yeah, it's stuck

1470
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,600
All this time, I've been getting hit for nothing

1471
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,280
What if you stack three together?

1472
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,040
Stack three together

1473
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,440
Like this?

1474
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,760
Yes, don't let it stick to you

1475
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,960
Aim properly

1476
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,880
Okay, that's it?

1477
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,840
Okay

1478
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,720
Go ahead, Brother Kai

1479
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,040
So big

1480
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,320
Such deep hatred

1481
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,120
He needs to use the core to generate force

1482
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,240
Let's begin

1483
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,000
It might pass in one go, really

1484
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,160
What if I don't...

1485
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,280
What if I miss?

1486
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,440
No problem

1487
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,120
Done

1488
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,080
Ready

1489
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,040
Okay

1490
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,120
Then we're in the second group

1491
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,040
Brainpower enhancement service

1492
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,400
Now, welcome to Clinic Three

1493
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,960
Lying face down is best for your back

1494
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,440
What's this?

1495
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,040
Sand

1496
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,480
Cumin

1497
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,080
What is this? Pop Rocks?

1498
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,680
Pop Rocks

1499
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,880
Crushed peanuts?

1500
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,080
Selling lamb skewers!

1501
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,600
Bird

1502
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,280
Chick

1503
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,960
Suddenly I think this one isn't bad either

1504
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,360
Should we put it on top?

1505
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,320
Ready to eat

1506
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,720
Eat

1507
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,560
Gobble gobble

1508
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,040
Let's begin

1509
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,440
Taken

1510
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,040
Okay

1511
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,040
Feeling good, Brother Long?

1512
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,480
Not bad

1513
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,920
It's kinda like acupuncture

1514
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,600
Something's pricking you

1515
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,760
But it doesn't hurt

1516
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,960
No

1517
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,800
It's in

1518
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,560
It's removing those...

1519
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,960
Hasn't it been 90 seconds yet?

1520
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,440
Such a long 90 seconds

1521
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:39,760
Okay

1522
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,320
Next

1523
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,280
Come on

1524
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,040
This back

1525
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,120
This back is really different

1526
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,360
This Xinjiang back

1527
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:51,920
He can pinch

1528
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,800
Pinch the CD for him

1529
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,600
Pour water here for him

1530
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,680
And this is the feeding trough

1531
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,240
Right

1532
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,560
They just stand on both sides

1533
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,280
Just scatter some inside

1534
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,240
Don't move, don't laugh

1535
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:06,920
You stay still

1536
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,800
It's a bit too much

1537
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,720
Can't eat anymore

1538
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,880
Okay, let's bring out the chickens

1539
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,440
Put one on each side

1540
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,680
This is going smoothly

1541
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,880
Can you feel it?

1542
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,600
Yes

1543
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,680
Ticklish, very comfortable

1544
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,160
Let's just say the closing remarks here

1545
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,040
Then let these two chickens

1546
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,640
Keep eating

1547
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,240
Start using your brains

1548
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,040
Okay, we're leaving now, bye

1549
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,120
Let's do the closing remarks first

1550
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,360
No

1551
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,880
Don't forget me

1552
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,200
Okay

1553
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,320
In the blink of an eye, our 9th

1554
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,480
Acting Hall Master ceremony

1555
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,800
Has completely concluded

1556
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,400
Yes

1557
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,000
May the Brainstorming Hall

1558
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,360
Under your leadership in the future

1559
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,240
For Tui Town

1560
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,440
For Earth, for the universe

1561
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,960
Emit endless brainwave signals

1562
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,560
Let's shout our slogan together

1563
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,440
Start using your brains

1564
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,920
Great brainpower development

1565
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,080
Bye

1566
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,320
Bye

1567
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,720
We're entering the game world

1568
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,360
To find that B organization

1569
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,440
Loading

1570
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,520
All things return to one

1571
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,600
It's open

1572
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,800
Is anyone there?

1573
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,560
Even if you know my plan

1574
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,080
you can't stop Organization B

1575
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:19,960
Play the piano

1576
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,360
Come on, Peng

1577
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,160
Let's have one person play

1578
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,960
while eight search for the stick

1579
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,320
The door's open

1580
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,680
Counted too slow

1581
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
Hurry back

1582
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,760
Hou

1583
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,320
What's the situation?

1584
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,560
We're the same kind

1585
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,120
We're done for

1586
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:39,920
Behave yourself

1587
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,360
Okay, later

1588
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,680
It hurts, help me up

1589
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,280
I don't see where the stick is

1590
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,600
Go

1591
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,400
Where's the stick?

1592
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,840
No one survives this
