1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,600
How do we get there?

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,240
Come on.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,240
Let's get hyped!

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,640
Let's go.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,400
Let's move.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,640
Start.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,280
Go.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,760
This is my character prop.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,880
The killer's stuff is over there.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,960
Pretend to be the killer.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,520
Be careful, I'm telling you.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,200
I want this.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,760
Give this to me.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,840
Come on, give it to me, I can do it.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,880
Spin the plate.

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,160
There's nothing I can't do.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,360
You're here.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,760
This is our standard slogan now.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,360
Hand.

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,720
Yes, that's it.

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,160
Through a small competition.

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,400
Five of us guys against five guys.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,240
We must take them down.

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Chongqing Leg King.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,800
Then our Leg King has arrived.

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,040
This is the real Leg King.

27
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,920
All Leg Kings.

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,000
Shandong.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go Shandong!

30
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Protector.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,400
Don't.

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
Protector.

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
Even us supporters have our pride.

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,840
Should we cheer up a bit?

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
He wants something more cheerful.

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
Like from the 80s.

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,800
The cheerful 80s.

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,720
How do we do it?

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,520
Brother, you tell us.

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,960
I don't know, just like this.

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,000
Three parts heaven.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,480
Walk like this.

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,120
Isn't this how the 80s should be?

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,960
Move forward like this.

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,720
Yes, just like this.

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,360
We can keep walking like this.

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,880
Okay.

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,080
Alright.

49
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,760
I say...

50
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,120
No, let's start walking normally first.

51
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
Just before we arrive...

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,080
We'll reach that "No Hair No Sky" salon.

53
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,440
"No Hair No Sky."

54
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,360
Three, two, one, go!

55
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,880
We'll walk sideways like this.

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
We're sideways.

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,840
Let's interact a bit

58
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
This interaction is a bit sudden

59
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,760
Sure, take a look at this

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
Ba Character Eyebrow Salon

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,840
Right, Aimanghuo Trading Company

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,720
Hairless & Lawless Hair Salon

63
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,000
Ready

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,560
Three, two, one, go

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,880
Hands on hips

66
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,800
How do you do "hands on hips"?

67
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,920
So tired

68
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,280
Okay

69
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,640
Come on, let's go

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,480
Go

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,720
Let's go, everyone

72
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
Push the skating rink

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
Go

74
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,640
Done

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,720
I skate with this thing

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
Not very well

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,000
You can do it

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
At your age

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,000
At your age you should be able to skate

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
I really can't, really can't

81
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,600
I skated with single-wheel ones as a kid

82
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,720
Inline skates are easier

83
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,280
No, same thing

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Inline skates are better than

85
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,720
quad skates

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,320
Nonsense

87
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,480
Quad skates are unstable

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,080
Inline skates are more stable

89
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,640
No

90
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,280
Just tie the laces tighter

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,760
Right, those inline skates

92
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,600
They're like ski boots

93
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:12,880
Right

94
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,560
They're very tight

95
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,600
Yes, they have lateral

96
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,160
ankle support

97
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
Yes, they're deeper

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
They support the ankles

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
Just tighten the laces more

100
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Otherwise your ankles will wobble

101
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,680
and you can't skate well

102
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,720
I...

103
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,680
Can I do it? Be careful

104
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,360
Of course you can, why not?

105
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,920
How do I get there?

106
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,560
Come, let me show you.

107
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Just go straight ahead, like this.

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
I can't do it.

109
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
But you said you didn't know how.

110
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
I don't know how, look at me walking sideways.

111
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,320
Okay.

112
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,880
It's fine.

113
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Wait a moment

114
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,880
Look

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,920
You can skate

116
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,360
Yu Ning Association

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,040
I can't

118
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Is that okay?

119
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
Brother Ning, do a backslide

120
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
Backslide

121
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,000
You're good at this

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,440
That's all you can do?

123
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,040
You're too good

124
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
That's all you've got

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
That's enough, it'll do

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,560
Come on

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Let's get hyped

128
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,000
Come, let me help you.

129
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,280
Not up yet.

130
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,240
Come, let me teach you.

131
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes, stand first.

132
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,040
Stand.

133
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
Then shift your body's center of gravity.

134
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Lean forward slightly.

135
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Bend a little.

136
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,120
No, not like that.

137
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,560
Look at this.

138
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,760
It can stand like this.

139
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,440
Yes.

140
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,960
Just lift your foot.

141
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,640
And it'll stay put.

142
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,800
This way it stands.

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,720
Right? Just brake.

144
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,200
That works.

145
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,440
Then I'll just go like this.

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,720
The more relaxed you are, the easier it is.

147
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,480
You're just too tense now.

148
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,160
Take your hands off, relax.

149
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,960
Any tricks to this?

150
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,200
Any techniques?

151
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,680
No tricks.

152
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm not very good at this myself.

153
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,040
It doesn't matter if you skate well.

154
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,400
Hands in pockets first.

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
The ground is so slippery.

156
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,120
Go.

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,880
Let's go.

158
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,400
Don't, don't bump into me.

159
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,280
I don't know how to brake.

160
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,440
Come, I'll teach you.

161
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,160
Just tuck it into the small pocket.

162
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,160
We crashed.

163
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,440
Tuck it into the small pocket.

164
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
Just tuck it in.

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
How does he skate backwards?

166
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,560
To skate backwards, you have to position your feet like this.

167
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Bro, you're better at giving instructions than anyone.

168
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
You try it.

169
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Backwards, look.

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,960
Go backwards.

171
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
How do I do this?

172
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
How do you skate backwards?

173
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,040
To skate backwards, you need some momentum.

174
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,840
How do I get momentum?

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,640
Come on, let's do that racing thing.

176
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,280
See who's faster.

177
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,240
Race.

178
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
What do you mean, race?

179
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,840
A speed race, right?

180
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,320
Come on, hurry up.

181
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,960
Waiting for you.

182
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,160
Walk on your tiptoes.

183
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,600
He looks like those...

184
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,840
Parents waiting ahead for their child.

185
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,040
Slow down, take it easy.

186
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,160
It's fine.

187
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,960
Feels like your legs aren't yours anymore.

188
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,640
Thanks.

189
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,840
This is how you skate?

190
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,960
Look, skate like this.

191
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,880
That's good.

192
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,480
Like this.

193
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,840
Stand on the outermost side, okay?

194
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,320
You're on the outside.

195
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
You can push off the railing to speed up.

196
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,160
Okay?

197
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,520
Okay.

198
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
Come on, let's do a speed race.

199
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,720
And he's trying to speed up?

200
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,640
No, you need to glide smoothly.

201
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,080
Let's coordinate our movements.

202
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,000
Just keep your legs together.

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,360
We'll go past that red line.

204
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,080
You say "go."

205
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,200
Wait a second.

206
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,400
Don't we need this?

207
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,520
That racing thing

208
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,200
This racing thing

209
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,280
Come on

210
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,640
One, two

211
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,680
Is this how it is?

212
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,040
Right

213
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,000
Start

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,640
Go

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,240
Brother, slow down

216
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,600
It's fine

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:38,840
First place

218
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,400
We won

219
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,800
Great, first place

220
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,720
First place is impressive

221
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,680
Not bad, we weren't far behind

222
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Alright

223
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,360
Impressive

224
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
Can anyone do this?

225
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,480
Can you?

226
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,720
I can try

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
You can play this?

228
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,240
You're really good

229
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,920
This needs that whistle, right?

230
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,840
That kind

231
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,680
Whistle

232
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,600
It's the reed inside its mouth

233
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,360
This one, right?

234
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
Yes, exactly this reed

235
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,360
With this, you can make it sound

236
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,720
Okay

237
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,360
How do you blow it?

238
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,000
It's not easy to blow

239
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,160
Can't get a sound out of it

240
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,040
This takes a lot of effort

241
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,840
Yeah, you really have to blow hard

242
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
The key is how to handle it

243
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,920
No idea

244
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,080
Bro, just try to blow it first

245
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,560
And you wanna manage the keyboard too?

246
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
You need to have a lot of confidence for this.

247
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
You need strong lung capacity for this.

248
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,960
Come on, you can do this, right?

249
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,280
This hula hoop is so hard.

250
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,760
This hula hoop is too small.

251
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
You're doing okay, but I can't.

252
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,160
Some people can even rotate their necks

253
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
Neck rotations are impressive

254
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,520
Doesn't it hurt your throat?

255
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,200
No, this is too crazy

256
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't move

257
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,840
Ring toss

258
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,720
Moving target

259
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,160
Move

260
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,360
If you get it

261
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,560
You'll slip right at your feet

262
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,600
Then it's over

263
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Like this

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,760
Let's make it fair

265
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,000
You toss one at me, I'll toss one at you

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Okay?

267
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,320
Here it comes

268
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,960
Come on

269
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,400
Like this, I'll crouch a bit

270
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,800
No need

271
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
No challenge

272
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,440
No challenge at all

273
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,600
This is actually hard to get

274
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,880
Very difficult

275
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,920
Okay, beat the drum

276
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,000
So noisy

277
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,520
There are so many snacks here

278
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,840
This yogurt curd is just right.

279
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,760
Thank you

280
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,360
Shh

281
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,640
This cream cake is especially delicious

282
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,080
This one is especially tasty

283
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,360
Really delicious, this one

284
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,200
What is this thing?

285
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,120
So delicious, this one

286
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
So good—big bite

287
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,800
What's this

288
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,280
His expression

289
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,120
Is it spoiled?

290
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,600
No, it's fine

291
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
That's just how this yogurt is

292
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,440
It made my eyes water

293
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,120
What is this?

294
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,320
Yogurt curds

295
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,280
You took too big a bite

296
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,560
Here’s more

297
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Have a piece

298
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:43,880
Bai Yu

299
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,920
This is really tasty

300
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,600
So delicious, really

301
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Yogurt

302
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
Yogurt

303
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Yogurt

304
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,640
Be a decent person

305
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
Is it really this sour?

306
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Just eat it like this

307
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,120
It's just this sour

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
It's fermented

309
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,800
Fermented

310
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
Full of probiotics

311
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,480
It's actually delicious

312
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,520
Only the striving succeed

313
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,320
Your turn now

314
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,000
Me?

315
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,680
Me what?

316
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,160
Breaking performance records is our only goal

317
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
Should we stand on it first?

318
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,040
Yes

319
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,680
Let's go

320
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,400
This is my character prop

321
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,520
The murderer's stuff is over there

322
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,600
Pretend to be the murderer

323
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,600
Be careful, I'm warning you

324
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,400
Put that thing down

325
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,640
This is yours

326
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,480
This is mine

327
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,840
This is your prop

328
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,520
Mine

329
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,280
What's this?

330
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,200
Ruler

331
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Keqin's ruler, right?

332
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,640
I want this

333
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,200
Give me this one

334
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,760
Isn't that the one?

335
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,960
Come on, give it to me—I can do it.

336
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
Plate spinning.

337
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,280
There's nothing I can't do.

338
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,120
Pick it up and start spinning

339
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,480
Just like in acrobatics

340
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,520
those spinning plates

341
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,360
Plate spinning

342
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,640
Good

343
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,560
This feeling

344
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
When singing this line

345
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,160
You need to pick up this sign

346
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,800
Break it

347
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Yes

348
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,120
You don't need to

349
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,280
Just use a normal fist

350
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,840
Don't use this style

351
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,720
After you're done

352
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
Just put it on the ground

353
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
Then for the third line

354
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Actively run through the entire chain

355
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,200
Align the granularity

356
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,800
Yes, align it

357
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Align the granularity

358
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,400
Everyone just do the flower hand gesture

359
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,080
Here we go

360
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,680
Spin however you want

361
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,160
Just keep spinning

362
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,600
Only the hustlers win

363
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,120
Okay, next we'll

364
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
Strong black coffee

365
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,520
Strong black coffee

366
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,920
Goji berries in hot water

367
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,800
Drink while singing

368
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,360
Right

369
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Strive to be first, refuse mediocrity

370
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,960
Once in position

371
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,920
Start singing when in position, hold still

372
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,240
So whoever sings comes here?

373
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,200
No

374
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
Just sing standing in place

375
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,400
No fancy moves

376
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,400
Promotion, smooth sailing

377
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,840
Promotion

378
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,520
Smooth sailing

379
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,400
Face challenges with excitement

380
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,440
With excitement

381
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,680
Excitement

382
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,920
Face challenges with excitement

383
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
And this

384
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,000
Then for "Three Parts Fate"

385
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Walk back to original positions

386
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Move while walking

387
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,880
Need to separate

388
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,080
We still need to

389
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,880
Three Parts Fate

390
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
Must have a stealing motion

391
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Stealing things

392
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,120
Hand in hand

393
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,200
Then raise them up

394
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,640
Shake

395
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,680
Wave

396
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
Yes, wave

397
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,120
Show your edge

398
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,960
Come on, come on

399
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,720
Very simple

400
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,080
The two of us are very simple

401
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,200
You're here

402
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,960
Right here

403
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,400
This is already our standard chant

404
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,760
Last time we squatted in front, right?

405
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,000
This is the position now, right?

406
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,000
Hands

407
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,600
Yes, that's it

408
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,440
Okay

409
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,600
Let's try it once with the music

410
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Then walk forward

411
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,880
Walk until you reach this horizontal row

412
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,160
Don't complain about declining performance yet

413
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,760
Take initiative to review during meetings

414
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,840
Actively streamline the entire workflow

415
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,600
Align the granular details

416
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,320
Breaking performance records is the only goal

417
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,360
Year-end bonuses won't fall from the sky

418
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,520
Grind relentlessly, never surrender

419
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,560
Achieve your dreams

420
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,520
Dreams

421
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,360
Perfect attendance proves your worth

422
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Extra strong black coffee

423
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,560
Goji berries in hot water

424
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,880
Only the grinders prevail

425
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Good. Triangle.

426
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,520
Triangle

427
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,600
Strive to be the best, never settle for mediocrity

428
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,640
Maintain clients to keep your job

429
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,280
First, the slogan must be inspiring

430
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,800
The work has clear direction

431
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,160
Expanding channels is our conviction

432
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,520
The workplace is like a rollercoaster

433
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,800
Tidal Wave

434
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,440
United we reveal our edge

435
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,120
They're coming

436
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,440
Promotion flows smoothly

437
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Hearts stir to meet the challenge

438
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,920
Stealing things

439
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,680
Let's go

440
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,120
Three parts are heaven's will

441
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,000
Seventy percent depends on hard work

442
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Only the diligent will win

443
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
The workplace is like a rising and falling

444
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,920
gorilla

445
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,200
Work together in synergy

446
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,760
To shine brightly

447
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,800
Promotion, smooth sailing

448
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,240
Embrace challenges with a stirring heart

449
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
Thirty percent is fate

450
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,320
Seventy percent depends on hard work

451
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,800
Only the diligent will win

452
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,120
Everyone

453
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,080
"Only the diligent will win" ahead of time

454
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
Ahead, must be ahead

455
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Alright, all done

456
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,200
That's it

457
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,360
Let's play a game

458
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
Have a competition

459
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,840
Let's have a chicken fight competition

460
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,600
As the promoting company

461
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:10,960
Representing the promotion company

462
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,040
The ultimate champion

463
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,520
I love watching everyone compete

464
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
Now each team please send one representative

465
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
To compete as your representative

466
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:17,920
So we've reached the climax

467
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,880
Hekefu versus Captain Ning

468
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,080
Ready, three two one go

469
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,800
Go

470
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,000
Good, Captain Ning makes the first move

471
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
What are these two doing?

472
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,600
Cheering for their respective teams

473
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,120
Go team

474
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,040
Come on

475
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,920
The winner is Captain Ning

476
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,880
Brother Bai, Brother Bai

477
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,120
You're done for.

478
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,920
Okay

479
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
Put down your axe.

480
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,680
Chop him. A man of action, not words.

481
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,120
Three, two, one, go!

482
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,880
Alright, we can see...

483
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,360
Bai Sect has used an item.

484
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,400
He's using his small axe.

485
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,680
Good, aggressive offense!

486
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,880
The two are now engaged in combat.

487
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,160
Height advantage is evident.

488
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,040
He can only kick at his shins.

489
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,920
Quick!

490
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,440
Come on!

491
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,520
It seems like...

492
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
Bai Sect has...

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Bai Sect has gained the upper hand.

494
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,240
Use a skill!

495
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,680
Keqin is being forced back step by step.

496
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,400
Master, strike his lower body!

497
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,280
Counterattack!

498
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,720
Congratulations, Kelidu

499
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,280
Simple and easy

500
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,520
Didn't maintain balance well

501
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,640
Hi

502
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,280
Hi

503
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,080
Everyone

504
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,560
Through a small competition

505
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,800
Five of us guys vs. five of you guys

506
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,080
You win three rounds against us

507
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,960
What for?

508
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,360
What are we competing in, brothers?

509
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,920
What’s the challenge?

510
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,480
Stone Thigh

511
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,280
This… leg wrestling?

512
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,760
Leg clamp

513
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,360
Sis Ba is the office belle of our company

514
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,000
The one and only sis

515
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Sis will be the referee

516
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,320
Okay

517
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,800
Alright

518
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,040
Come on

519
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,760
Captain, Bai Mai

520
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,200
You and the Captain give it a try

521
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,880
We'll try

522
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,920
Right, let Sis Ba show you

523
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,440
How to do it

524
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:24,960
Technical guidance

525
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,920
How to do it? You take over

526
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,040
One person keeps their legs together

527
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,200
The other clamps their legs

528
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,560
Don’t let their legs separate

529
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,840
Squeeze hard

530
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
Don't let his legs close

531
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,040
Just like this

532
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,360
And then?

533
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,080
Then don't let them separate

534
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Aren't they separated now?

535
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,040
You've spread them completely apart

536
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,760
Completely separated

537
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,320
Right

538
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,560
This

539
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,600
This is how you play

540
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,040
Come on, Hekefu and Kelidu

541
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,840
You two try it too

542
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,240
What are we trying with each other?

543
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,360
Right

544
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,360
Do you know about Tian Ji's horse racing?

545
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,480
You'd better know it

546
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,680
Each other's strength

547
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,440
Draining our energy

548
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,000
Right, I think so too

549
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,080
Absolutely not

550
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,120
If you want to compete

551
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,360
Just compete with us directly

552
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,800
Right, you do two rounds

553
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,560
Pengpeng, you with him

554
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,200
We don't need to, we'll

555
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,880
Come on

556
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
Why are you two shy, right?

557
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
What do you mean we're shy?

558
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,800
Come on

559
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,720
Don't use force

560
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,080
Defend strictly, okay?

561
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Ready, one two three

562
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,760
Begin

563
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,600
Don't kill each other

564
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,840
That's about enough

565
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,120
Okay, that's good

566
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
This means we win

567
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,680
Just split up and we win

568
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,240
No, we need to spread out more

569
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,160
Then let's go

570
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,520
The culprit escaped on a tricycle

571
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,240
Where did he go?

572
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,760
I'll send you off

573
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Where are you taking me?

574
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,800
Let's go, straight away

575
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
I'll go ahead first

576
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,520
Brother Mai

577
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,000
The rear tire has a leak

578
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,720
So when you ride it

579
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,880
it's not very convenient

580
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,560
That's it

581
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
You've exhausted all your leg strength

582
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,920
Exhausted

583
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,880
Mistake

584
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,160
Sis Ba, why don't you decide

585
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,720
Decide who fights whom

586
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,160
I'll choose... that

587
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,520
I should pick someone weaker

588
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,360
Let me see who looks weaker

589
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,280
Who do you think is weaker?

590
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,600
You should look at their thighs

591
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,480
Look at the thighs

592
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,160
His thighs here

593
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,720
You can't tell through clothes

594
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,960
Chongqing Thigh King

595
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,360
This one has thinner legs

596
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
This is Shandong Thigh King

597
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
Shandong thighs

598
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,040
Shandong Thigh King

599
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,680
All thicker than my legs

600
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,480
Just pick one quickly

601
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,920
You do it

602
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,520
Me?

603
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,120
Yes

604
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,920
Then you do it

605
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,680
I'll do it

606
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,960
Put away the axe, bro

607
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Don't you dare take it out

608
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,960
Come on

609
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,160
We must defeat him

610
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,800
I've been biking all morning

611
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Chongqing Thigh King

612
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
Put your axe in the middle, hold it like this

613
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,680
Bro, you just need to

614
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,640
When he gets close

615
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,680
Just go "crack"

616
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,080
Bro, let me tell you

617
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,320
It's starting now

618
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,840
Started

619
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,960
Three two one, begin

620
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,000
It's already begun

621
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,840
Use force

622
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,280
Put in strength

623
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,560
Good, Chongqing Thigh King

624
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,480
Chongqing Thigh King

625
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,280
Push through

626
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,960
Chongqing Thigh King

627
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,840
Get your leg over his, quick

628
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,920
Sis

629
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes

630
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,920
Okay

631
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,600
Then who will fight him?

632
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,160
Come on

633
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,680
Then here comes our Leg King

634
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,160
This is the genuine Leg King

635
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,360
This one's the Leg King

636
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
All Leg Kings here

637
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,560
Three, two, one

638
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,080
Use your strength

639
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,080
The explosive power is good

640
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,680
Can't open it

641
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,240
No good, he's too...

642
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Why don't you just axe him?

643
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,880
Can't do that

644
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
Can't affect our teammates

645
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,680
Use your strength

646
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,080
What's the verdict?

647
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,320
I don't think it'll work

648
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,360
Sorry about that

649
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
Long legs make it tiring

650
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,200
Then there's no way

651
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,520
You guys are indeed tall

652
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,480
Come on

653
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,320
Then let's go

654
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,280
Three, two, one, begin

655
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,200
Has it started already?

656
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,960
Ambush

657
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,120
Close it

658
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,000
This thing won't work like that

659
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,440
This thing of his is really...

660
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,280
He's tickling me

661
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,720
Don't lose your spirit, young man

662
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,200
No

663
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,560
Young man

664
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,000
The king of curls has become the king of itches

665
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,800
Put some strength into it

666
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,760
Come on, young man

667
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,400
Can't even handle this? Oh my god

668
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
Hard to apply force, no good

669
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Let's take a break first

670
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,000
Tired

671
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,040
Exhausted

672
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,720
Have you chosen yet?

673
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,000
Don't know who they are

674
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,320
Then let's go with purple outfit

675
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,160
Purple, come on

676
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,160
This young man clearly

677
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,800
You've trained at Shaolin Temple before, right?

678
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,960
Practiced horse stance

679
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,760
Trained at Shaolin Temple

680
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,120
Must choose the outside

681
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Brother Xun, outside

682
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,640
Choose the outside

683
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
No, you need to pick the lock

684
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,360
So you need to unlock me

685
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,440
We need to open

686
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,560
This is too difficult

687
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,040
Maybe we shouldn't open that lock

688
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,240
Come on, brother

689
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Shandong Leg King

690
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,240
Ready

691
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,040
Okay

692
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,960
Three two one, go

693
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,800
Shandong

694
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,880
Go Shandong!

695
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,640
Shandong

696
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,640
Isn't it open enough?

697
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,000
Lost

698
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,840
As expected of the king of competition

699
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,800
Here comes match point

700
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,560
His long legs put him at a disadvantage

701
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,520
Don't go so deep

702
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,640
Understood, okay

703
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,160
Okay

704
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,280
Three two one, begin

705
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,920
Put in strength

706
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,800
What is this

707
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,920
Foot, get the foot

708
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,800
His is already...

709
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,920
Deciding round

710
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,760
Use your ankles

711
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,520
Harder

712
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,360
Come on

713
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,840
Push hard, break through

714
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,560
Quick, someone stop Bai Sect

715
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,160
He's going for the axe

716
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,120
He's going to chop me

717
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Protect me

718
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,320
Don't

719
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,680
Protect me

720
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,520
Even our supporters have pride

721
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Quick

722
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,680
This is all messed up

723
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
How could such a story exist

724
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,680
That hurts

725
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,840
His legs are so stiff, no one can pull them apart.

726
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,720
We won.

727
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,320
Sorry about that.

728
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,640
Three to two, we won.

729
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,600
Our apologies.

730
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
What if we lose?

731
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:52,960
To be honest,

732
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,280
we’re also helping you solve the case.

733
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,800
How about this—

734
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,480
This time, we’ll go easy on you, okay?

735
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,160
Okay.

736
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,760
Deal.

737
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,600
Same as before, then.

738
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
Right, Thomas’s spirit—

739
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,800
we should still uphold it.

740
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,480
Wait a second.

741
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,200
Didn’t you just lose to him?

742
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,800
I did lose to him.

743
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,480
Switch with someone else.

744
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,800
This is like Tian Ji’s horse racing strategy, isn’t it?

745
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,440
You just won,

746
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,360
so you decide.

747
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,400
If we’re using Tian Ji’s strategy,

748
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,120
I should pick a stronger opponent.

749
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,320
How about I take out one of your strongest?

750
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,120
The strongest one, then.

751
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,880
Fine, that works.

752
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,560
Let’s go.

753
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,040
Alright, three, two, one—go!

754
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
This saves effort

755
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Of course

756
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,120
It won't open

757
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,600
It really won't open

758
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,120
This is really effortless

759
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,720
It really won't budge

760
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,360
Alright, final countdown from ten

761
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,560
Ten, nine

762
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,680
Eight, seven

763
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,200
Wow, really

764
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,760
Six

765
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,440
Not moving at all

766
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,040
Five

767
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,000
This is really saving effort

768
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,240
Three, two, one

769
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,920
Okay

770
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,400
Looks like we've overcome

771
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,360
The inner muscle strength

772
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,680
Is still quite sufficient

773
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,120
My turn now

774
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,600
Bro, you take on the toughest one

775
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,080
Is this the toughest one?

776
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,680
No

777
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,360
The toughest is that one

778
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,480
The one wearing brown pants

779
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
Should let bro

780
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,080
Handle the toughest one

781
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,320
Aren't we using the Tianji horse racing strategy?

782
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,880
Focusing on

783
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,080
Alright, I'll take on that

784
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Toughest one

785
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,840
Okay

786
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,320
Leave it to you

787
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,240
Even if I lose, it's fine

788
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,120
Because we've already won these two

789
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,000
You two just need to win one more

790
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,280
Right?

791
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,320
Okay, just worried we might both lose

792
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,680
No, then it would be a tie

793
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,600
Three two one, begin

794
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,280
Don't go "hey hey hey"

795
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,960
You should go "waaah"

796
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,280
Getting pumped

797
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,040
Three

798
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,000
Gave up

799
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,640
Gave up

800
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,160
Started

801
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,160
Countdown didn't finish

802
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,560
The overachiever got careless and lost Jinzhou

803
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,320
What the hell

804
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,400
Cramped up

805
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,120
He's got cramps

806
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,360
Next round then

807
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,560
Come on

808
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,720
Three

809
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,200
Transferred my inner energy to you

810
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,720
Two, one

811
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,400
Begin

812
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,720
Blue Veins, Dragon's Blue Veins

813
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,760
An evenly matched duel

814
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,000
Final ten counts

815
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,040
Ten, nine

816
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,600
Eight, seven, six

817
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Where are my guardians?

818
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,320
Four, three, two, one

819
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,280
Alright

820
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,840
It didn't open

821
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,680
We won

822
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,200
Three to zero

823
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,960
Alright, that's enough

824
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,680
Sorry about that

825
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,760
Then this round is indeed three to zero

826
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
Our skills are inferior, we admit it

827
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,160
We admit it
