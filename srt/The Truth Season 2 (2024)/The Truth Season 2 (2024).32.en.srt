1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,780
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Game Rules

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,940
Six players per episode

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,460
Divided into four suspects

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,220
and two investigators solving the case

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,940
The real culprit hides among the suspects

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,900
The culprit's mission

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,580
is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,420
without being discovered by others

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,020
Only the real culprit can lie

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,740
Notably

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,660
This season introduces new gameplay

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,340
The player as the culprit

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,260
If they pass a certain test

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,260
can choose between the two investigators

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,700
to turn one into X

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,820
X's mission is

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,740
during subsequent investigations

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,580
to actively help the culprit escape

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,620
Victory conditions

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,140
After investigation concludes

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,140
players vote for the culprit

22
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,500
If the culprit receives fewer votes

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,140
than other suspects

24
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,900
then culprit and X get golden keys

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,140
Otherwise, correct voters

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,540
receive golden keys

27
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,180
June 3, 2004

28
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,460
marked the first day of

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,900
Tui Zhen Art Academy's

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,740
three-day anniversary celebration.

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,580
However, during several students'

32
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,460
dress rehearsal of "Swan Lake at Tui",

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,180
the large screen suddenly displayed

34
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,580
a distress video from Zi Daole.

35
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,140
Zi Daole

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,860
Zi Daole

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
What happened to Zi Daole?

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,700
In the cabinet

39
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,300
Everyone discovered

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,420
Zi Daole dead inside the prop cabinet.

41
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,660
What?

42
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,180
Zi Daole

43
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,940
Later during the investigation,

44
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,100
in the empty piano room,

45
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,860
a second victim TYP was found.

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,180
TYP

47
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,500
TYP

48
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,940
As investigators continued searching,

49
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,980
they discovered the hidden

50
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,300
Tui Empire behind the school laundry.

51
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,740
This led them to deduce

52
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,620
that the two victims

53
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,740
might have been the forum moderator and 555

54
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,460
collaborating in the crime.

55
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,860
It should be two people

56
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,220
among our four suspects.

57
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,780
Correct.

58
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,900
Two people.

59
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,500
Yes.

60
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,780
But regrettably,

61
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,380
in the end they failed to capture

62
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,860
the true mastermind,

63
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,580
who managed to escape.

64
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,540
How should we spar against each other?

65
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,180
We still have a performance tomorrow.

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,340
Saw Xiao Ai sing and then jump to her death.

67
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,020
The anniversary celebration at Tui Zhen Art School continues.

68
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Everyone:

69
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,220
What other strange things will they encounter?

70
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,060
I am the Canary

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,580
I play the role of

72
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,500
Princess Jinka

73
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,260
My name is He Dinghong

74
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,100
In the drama, I play the Demon King

75
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,820
Big White Goose

76
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,740
Hello everyone, my name is Ning Hao

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,780
I play the role of the War God, Prince Dayu

78
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,340
I am Bai Yangzuo

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,220
I play the cowardly and fearful

80
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,340
Prince Xiaoyu

81
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,780
Hello everyone, I am Ke Daole

82
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,020
I play the role of

83
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,860
The brave and skilled Prince Maomaoyu

84
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,740
I am Ba Zimei

85
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,820
In the drama, I play

86
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,100
the female lead, White Swan

87
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,140
Hello

88
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,540
So beautiful

89
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,780
You're really too...

90
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,260
This is my leading lady.

91
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,700
You look down on me, don't you?

92
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,180
Brother-in-law.

93
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,540
Don't be like this, brother-in-law.

94
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,860
Aren't you the Great Demon King?

95
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
I'm the Great White Goose Demon King.

96
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,940
In the drama, I play the...

97
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,980
male lead.

98
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,540
Slap in the face.

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,740
Brother, sit down quickly.

100
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,860
What's wrong?

101
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,260
Quick, sit down brother.

102
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,420
Just now, our...

103
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,900
one of the two female leads...

104
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,300
said she wants to add a kissing scene.

105
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,980
Planning to do it here...

106
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,100
With who?

107
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,180
She'll randomly pick a lucky audience member.

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,820
Brother won't be joining.

109
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,700
What a pity.

110
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,420
Where's the director?

111
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,860
Yes, we have rehearsal today.

112
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,620
Exactly, rehearsal.

113
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,100
But why hasn't our director arrived yet?

114
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,780
Hello Director.

115
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm really sorry.

116
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,180
Yesterday I...

117
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,260
stayed up all night revising...

118
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,420
the script of "Swan Lake Push".

119
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,100
After much deliberation yesterday,

120
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,900
I thought...

121
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,020
having the demon king turn the princess into a black swan...

122
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,940
would be more exciting.

123
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,820
So this morning...

124
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,620
I discussed it with Ba Zimei...

125
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,380
about this matter.

126
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,900
Right.

127
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,860
I know about this.

128
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,260
Because this morning...

129
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,420
when Rui Sibai told me about it...

130
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,300
I thought it was good too.

131
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,060
This creative idea...

132
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,620
Plus...

133
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,700
I've never tried...

134
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,900
this black swan look before.

135
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,860
So I really want to give it a try.

136
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,620
Let's begin now.

137
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,100
Everyone else keeps their same roles.

138
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,020
Let's start the official rehearsal, okay?

139
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,420
Got it.

140
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,020
Okay.

141
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,260
Right.

142
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
His lines have been changed too.

143
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,540
The black swan finally turns back into a princess.

144
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,380
What was on the torn last page?

145
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,780
Right, ask the director.

146
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,260
Did you see the last page of the script

147
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,820
was torn off?

148
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,780
Was this your edit?

149
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,140
There's some hidden plot

150
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,740
During the performance

151
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,020
I'll tell you then.

152
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,940
Now let's begin the official rehearsal.

153
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,540
Let's start with He Dinghong.

154
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,540
Go ahead.

155
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,500
So sudden.

156
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,620
So cool.

157
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,980
He Dinghong, show everyone how it's done first.

158
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,420
You should laugh heartily to the sky, then

159
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,820
begin casting spells, like Immortal Changheng.

160
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,420
Because you're from

161
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,540
the mysterious East's Great Demon King.

162
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,220
Great White Goose.

163
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,100
Great Demon King.

164
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,660
Right.

165
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,060
I turned the princess into a Great Black Goose.

166
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,180
No, Great Black

167
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,100
Great Black Goose.

168
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
Black Swan.

169
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,620
Great Black Goose.

170
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,820
Black Swan.

171
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,660
What about the princess?

172
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,900
The princess is

173
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,540
I'm the princess.

174
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,900
You? You're the princess.

175
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,500
Work with me here.

176
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,660
Alright, let's begin.

177
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Change

178
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,620
Change

179
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,540
Good

180
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,380
You performed very well

181
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:43,780
Canary

182
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,180
How do you think He Yun performed?

183
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,460
Not bad at all

184
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,820
I'd give it 99 out of 100

185
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,620
Good

186
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,740
Next up is

187
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,340
Bazimei and the three princes

188
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,380
You'll perform

189
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,140
Bazimei dancing by Swan Lake

190
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,380
Then Heavy Rain, Light Rain, and Drizzle

191
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,100
These three princes will compete

192
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,500
Wanting to see the black swan's dance

193
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,100
We're going for awkwardness, right?

194
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,980
Alright, you can go on stage now.

195
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,820
Everyone pushing to be first.

196
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,220
I need to get away.

197
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,020
Put your weapon down.

198
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,900
Don't accidentally hurt me.

199
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,860
You put that down right now.

200
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,620
Come on.

201
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,420
Okay, wait a moment.

202
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,380
Let me find the music for "Swan Lake Push" first.

203
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,980
There's also music?

204
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,900
Why should I?

205
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,740
Why is it that my thing is...

206
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,100
Because I think you're just...

207
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,420
You can cast spells just by standing there.

208
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,540
So we didn't give you any music.

209
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,980
Fine.

210
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,780
Everyone started scrambling

211
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,220
Let me do it

212
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,380
Come back

213
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,580
Don’t

214
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,740
Why didn’t you stop them?

215
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,540
What are you doing?

216
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,500
Black Swan

217
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,020
Okay

218
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,700
The Great Demon King is speechless.

219
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,500
Turn me into her.

220
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,460
That was awkwardly funny.

221
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,620
You made it awkward again.

222
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,300
Okay.

223
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,820
Now, let's welcome our

224
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,500
Golden Card Princess, Canary,

225
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,220
and Bai Yangzuo.

226
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,780
The two of you will perform

227
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,620
fighting over me,

228
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,620
overcoming all odds to finally be together.

229
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,260
Bai Yangzuo.

230
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,860
Princess, make your voice softer.

231
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,660
No, you can't.

232
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,780
Vomited

233
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,540
She vomited

234
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,620
Pink bubbles, feel them

235
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,580
What

236
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,140
Before dying

237
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,420
I want to give you a

238
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,460
True love's kiss

239
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,300
Die immediately, huh

240
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,780
There are scenes even you can't handle

241
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,980
Little killer

242
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,380
You actually failed to catch it

243
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,820
Jin Kala's scene

244
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,900
Alright, because today

245
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,180
Ba Zimei's outfit is also very beautiful

246
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,980
So I'd like to see

247
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,460
The Black Swan and Prince Xiaoyu

248
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,900
The same scene from earlier

249
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,220
I should perform it just like her, right?

250
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,140
Come on, same scenario

251
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,340
You don't have to

252
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,620
You can try a different performance style

253
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,300
I

254
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,180
Let's try it

255
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,380
First, let me be the narrator

256
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,700
On this day

257
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,140
Having been scolded by the Queen for not marrying

258
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,340
Prince Xiaoyu

259
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,300
Came to Tuie Lake to relax

260
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,140
And met the beautiful lone Black Swan

261
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,380
The Black Swan told Prince Xiaoyu

262
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,260
About her misfortunes

263
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,260
They found kinship and fell in love

264
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,660
Prince Xiaoyu secretly vowed

265
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,860
To definitely turn the princess back

266
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,540
What was supposed to be a proper play

267
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,460
Has turned into what?

268
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,620
Alright, it's now 10 o'clock

269
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,580
Before the official performance

270
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,180
We need to protect

271
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,660
The stage setup

272
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,220
So you all

273
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,460
Shouldn't stay in the small auditorium

274
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,140
Then I have something to do now

275
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,860
I'll take my leave first

276
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,460
Okay

277
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,100
Bye director

278
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,340
Be safe, don't die later

279
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,180
She wants us to leave now

280
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,380
No

281
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,180
She said when we're free

282
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,380
Don't stay here

283
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,220
Let's get going too

284
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,540
Alright

285
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,060
Okay?

286
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,620
Can you get through the door?

287
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,380
Walk sideways

288
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,460
Students

289
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,540
Tui Zhen Arts Academy Anniversary Event:

290
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,740
Musical "Swan Goose Lake"

291
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,660
Now officially begins

292
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,100
This performance

293
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,780
will be broadcast live by the school TV station

294
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,500
I'm a goose

295
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,460
I'm a big white goose

296
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,540
Should we rehearse once more?

297
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,100
Let's perform

298
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,700
Just go straight into it

299
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,740
Let's go

300
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,100
Help!

301
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,980
What?

302
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Someone come quick!

303
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,780
Someone's dead!

304
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,900
Quick, someone come!

305
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,380
Hurry, hurry!

306
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,740
You scared me!

307
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,420
Wait, your wing

308
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,780
Your wing

309
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,620
You got stuck in the door just now

310
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,500
Stuck in the door

311
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,740
Students, follow me

312
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
What's wrong?

313
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,540
What happened?

314
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,340
Director

315
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,140
Respect

316
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,340
Yesterday Xiao Ai had an accident here.

317
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,260
Unexpectedly,

318
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,860
Sisi had another accident here.

319
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,740
I just saw in the dormitory courtyard

320
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,180
Xiao Ai jump to her death.

321
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,620
The courtyard has been sealed off.

322
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,180
Stay right here.

323
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,140
Two more people have died.

324
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,300
At 11:20,

325
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,940
I received an anonymous message

326
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,620
telling me to come to the second-floor atrium.

327
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,060
But when I arrived at the atrium,

328
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,020
through the glass window,

329
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,580
I saw Sisi lying

330
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,620
on the first-floor ground.

331
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,140
I rushed downstairs

332
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,100
but found the door couldn't be opened

333
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,420
due to the tape.

334
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,460
So I had to run to the convenience store

335
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,900
to get a utility knife.

336
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,420
This one.

337
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,540
I slid it through the door gap

338
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,260
to cut the tape and enter the atrium.

339
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
Then I found Sisi

340
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,820
had already stopped breathing completely.

341
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,100
This has nothing to do with me.

342
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,660
Don't blame me for this.

343
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,340
I'm too shocked,

344
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,580
I need to go rest now.

345
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,900
It's raining

346
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,340
Tui Town 2004

347
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,980
Tui Arts Tales: The Midnight Curse

348
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,940
Officially begins

349
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,740
The current time is

350
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,540
June 4, 2004

351
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,420
11:30 AM

352
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,660
The deceased in this case, Rui Sibu

353
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,100
was a sophomore at Tui Town Art College

354
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,420
majoring in Music Performance

355
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,340
Preliminary investigation suggests

356
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,740
Rui Sibu's death

357
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,420
may not be accidental

358
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,220
The murderer

359
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,060
is likely among

360
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,660
Ning Hao

361
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,780
It's you again

362
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,860
Canary

363
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,460
He Dinghong

364
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,540
Ke Daole

365
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,700
these four individuals

366
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,380
Ba Zimei and Bai Yangzuo

367
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,580
are temporarily not suspects

368
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,300
and thus serve as investigators

369
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,620
Whoever picks me as X

370
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,900
I'll make them lose

371
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,980
He Dinghong is struggling now

372
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,420
What's troubling him?

373
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,220
If

374
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,020
he picks Bai Yangzuo

375
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,100
we'll easily figure it out

376
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,700
They're working together

377
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,420
If he doesn't pick Bai Yangzuo

378
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,740
Bai Yangzuo will torment him to "death"

379
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,260
That's why he's in agony now

380
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,300
Please have the two investigators remain at the crime scene

381
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,220
to conduct preliminary evidence collection

382
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,140
I deserve to die

383
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,420
Printed out by a machine

384
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,820
There's still blood on the forehead

385
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,740
After today's rehearsal ends,

386
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,100
come to the laundry room.

387
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,020
This is that

388
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,380
Push it.

389
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,700
Star of Push Arts.

390
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,380
Hu Jie deserved first place, right?

391
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,300
Although we're in the same year,

392
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
he's actually my childhood idol.

393
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Inside this room,

394
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,940
there's just this scaffold left.

395
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,380
The scaffold is 6 meters high.

396
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,740
She died from head trauma.

397
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,020
She fell from up there.

398
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,860
(Continuation) fell down.

399
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,420
Wasn't she supposed to go to the laundry room?

400
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,540
What was she doing here?

401
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,580
Then let's check for other.

402
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,860
external injuries.

403
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,500
She was wearing a bracelet.

404
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,820
The shoes are nothing special

405
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,740
Very clean

406
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,700
The shoes should be fine

407
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,620
Probably not

408
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,100
Her foot was injured

409
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,180
Her feet were tied up

410
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,100
Tied up within an hour

411
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,980
Leaving ligature marks

412
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,380
And left hanging

413
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,540
Hang her by the feet

414
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,820
Upside down, then drop her

415
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,380
Right

416
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,620
Got it

417
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,940
That guy who came earlier mentioned

418
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,580
the convenience store

419
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,300
Yeah

420
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,380
Where are your wings?

421
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,780
I just broke them for this investigation

422
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,420
I snapped my wings off

423
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,540
I’m a wingless black swan

424
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,940
What are you doing here?

425
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,820
You are...

426
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,420
You are Bai Yangzuo?

427
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,980
Yes, that's right.

428
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,620
My classmate

429
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,420
What's her name?

430
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,340
Xiao Rou

431
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,860
I'm Xiao Wei

432
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,020
Xiao Wei

433
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,740
Yes, Xiao Wei

434
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,300
What were you doing in the courtyard?

435
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,740
Someone just died

436
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,180
The school store has surveillance cameras

437
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,580
This exact camera

438
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,580
It might have captured some clues

439
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,180
Notice

440
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,700
Starting today, all campus buildings

441
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,660
with windows above the second floor will be sealed

442
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,340
Bai Yangzuo

443
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,660
Aren't you Xiaorou?

444
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,780
Isn't she Xiaowei?

445
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,420
I am

446
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,820
I'm Xiaowei

447
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,140
I work at this convenience store

448
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
She just said she's Xiaowei

449
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,900
Xiaorou stammers when she sees me

450
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,980
Xiaowei doesn't stammer when she sees me

451
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,460
I'm Xiaowei

452
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,940
Xiaorou

453
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,460
A long time ago

454
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,780
She disappeared somewhere

455
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,140
After our colleague checks the surveillance

456
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,460
They'll definitely report to the boss

457
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,140
This is her computer

458
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,540
It should have logged in

459
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,660
Her chat account

460
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,580
But I know nothing about computers

461
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,500
Maybe you can figure it out

462
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,060
The secret of Super Light Bottle

463
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,980
That colleague of ours really cares about beauty

464
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,500
She always talks about

465
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,700
Taking Super Light Bottle

466
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,620
Can make you look more beautiful

467
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,380
Our store recently has a

468
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,180
Swisse photo check-in event

469
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,020
Using our store's popular product

470
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,940
Swisse Super Light Bottle

471
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,420
To take check-in photos

472
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,900
Showing your beautiful jawline

473
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,700
Then you can

474
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,100
Get an uplifting card

475
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
Do you want to participate?

476
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,180
I'll do it

477
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,820
Let me try

478
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,380
Okay

479
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,900
I know what you just mentioned

480
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,060
Because I've been taking

481
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,420
Swisse's Super Light Bottle

482
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
This is your Shang Yang card.

483
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,220
Thank you.

484
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,420
You study it first.

485
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,940
I'll go organize the stock in the back.

486
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,340
Okay, thanks.

487
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,060
Bai Yangzuo.

488
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,700
Keep it up.

489
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,620
She likes you.

490
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,860
Blunt, horn, fall, bud, swallow, field.

491
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,300
Each one can be matched, right?

492
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,660
Wheat field, oats, malt.

493
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,220
That's wheat.

494
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,740
Right.

495
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Blunt.

496
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
Obtuse angle.

497
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,460
Corner.

498
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,060
Horn.

499
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,700
Angle.

500
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,500
Reason, gene, cause and effect.

501
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,660
Sulfur, vulcanization, sulfuric acid.

502
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
Red, yellow, green, purple.

503
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,220
Ergothioneine.

504
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,980
That's right

505
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,300
So the secret of the Super Light Bottle

506
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,380
is ergothioneine

507
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,900
But I have to say

508
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,220
the Super Light Bottle truly helps

509
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,820
enhance facial contours for a more attractive look

510
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,300
effortlessly achieving a lifted, radiant state

511
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,460
The beauty-loving shop assistant

512
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,580
Okay

513
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,180
Let's go

514
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,900
Please have the two detectives escort the suspect

515
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,340
Prepare for questioning

516
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,300
While the detectives search the crime scene

517
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,420
members of the Brainstorming Hall have also collected

518
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
some evidence related to

519
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,620
the four suspects in this case

520
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,220
Since it's raining heavily outside

521
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,060
we shouldn't go to the Brainstorming Hall

522
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,180
Let's conduct the interrogation in the small auditorium

523
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Alright

524
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,060
Wow, the small auditorium

525
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,860
Why aren't there any fruits?

526
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,060
Conspiracy

527
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,020
Why did you change your clothes?

528
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,900
Because while gathering evidence earlier,

529
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,980
I broke my wings.

530
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,020
Violating celestial laws,

531
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,620
I was banished to live as a mortal.

532
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,900
That is quite annoying.

533
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,860
To show my respect for deduction,

534
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,740
I'm also wearing a vest.

535
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,620
You look even more sinister now.

536
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,100
We're so close,

537
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,300
can't you see right through me?

538
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,820
There isn't even a dark

539
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,060
place to hide here.

540
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,620
What are you afraid of?

541
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,860
What is it that scares you?

542
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,740
I'm sneaking around

543
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,860
I've had a thief's instinct since childhood

544
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Okay?

545
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,140
A thief's instinct since childhood

546
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,420
I think these recent murders

547
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,820
are actually all connected to this

548
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,540
Seven Urban Legends

549
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,020
So far, about four of them

550
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,380
have already come true

551
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
There's someone—

552
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
Zidaole

553
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,300
TYP

554
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,980
It hurts

555
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,940
31

556
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,020
There are 30 people in our class

557
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,540
And now there are still three (urban legends)

558
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,780
Three more people will die

559
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,020
So regarding today's deceased

560
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,260
this Ruisi Bai

561
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,060
I'd like to ask everyone

562
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,380
what your relationship was with the deceased

563
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,060
So let me start

564
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,580
Ruisi Bai and I were classmates

565
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,180
and also roommates

566
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,820
In Ruisi Bai's previous musicals

567
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,140
I was always the female lead

568
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,940
Ruisi Bai was my junior

569
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,780
She invited me

570
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,020
to support her "Swan Lake Push"

571
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,060
Don't you have a job, senior?

572
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,980
Didn't you graduate and find work?

573
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,620
I didn't graduate

574
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,420
Well, she's a producer

575
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,140
TYP, don't you remember?

576
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,060
He has status today

577
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,460
First of all

578
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,260
Well

579
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,820
Control your smirk

580
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,060
Here's the thing

581
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,020
Ruisi Bai and I were classmates

582
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,700
but she worked in theater

583
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,180
while I'm mainly in films

584
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,700
Actually, between us

585
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,300
there wasn't much overlap

586
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,780
But her talent

587
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,740
I did quite admire

588
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,380
She was quite an impressive director

589
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,180
Ruisi Bai and I

590
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,500
were also classmates

591
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,660
She worked in musical theater

592
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,580
but our exchanges

593
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,460
were limited to artistic matters

594
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,740
Did you interact for long?

595
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,020
I just had the honor to perform in

596
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,620
some plays she directed

597
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,740
that's all

598
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,780
We only discussed artistic matters

599
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,940
Of course, I still have a place in his heart.

600
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,180
Gone.

601
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,420
That fast?

602
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,940
That was yesterday.

603
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,300
So that's yesterday's story now, right?

604
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,780
You...

605
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,260
What's wrong?

606
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,460
I'm just speculating, what's wrong with that?

607
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,220
Really?

608
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,940
How unusual, really.

609
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,540
Let me explain my relationship with Rui Sisi.

610
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,700
Because actually, in her mind...

611
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,380
Sorry.

612
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,060
The female lead she envisioned...

613
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,140
Has always been me.

614
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,660
She could see the potential in me.

615
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
I see.

616
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,060
We actually had a good relationship.

617
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,380
Because she appreciated me.

618
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,300
She always said she'd give me the lead role.

619
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,020
Then why did you keep approaching her?

620
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,220
No.

621
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,300
Actually, in today's production...

622
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,220
She was the lead.

623
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,900
My situation was simpler.

624
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,100
I just transferred here last year.

625
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,860
With her, it was just director and actor...

626
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,140
That kind of relationship.

627
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,540
And my connection with her...

628
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Was only through my work with Dilraba...

629
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,180
Appearing in her productions.

630
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,380
Nothing beyond that.

631
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,580
So composed.

632
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,860
Feels rehearsed.

633
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,620
I had no special relationship with the deceased.

634
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,500
Every movement calculated.

635
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,740
Even the hands behind the back.

636
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,100
I said exactly the same thing as him

637
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,300
Why suspect me then?

638
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,980
Why did you have to say

639
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,420
exactly the same thing as him?

640
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,220
See?

641
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,060
He's your boyfriend

642
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,740
That's right

643
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,500
Exactly like that

644
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,060
I haven't been here long

645
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,860
How could I have much interaction with her?

646
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,500
That's correct

647
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,740
So everyone's connection with the (deceased)

648
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,860
is just a

649
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,380
not very significant relationship

650
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,020
just a superficial connection

651
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,020
Let me explain

652
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,820
At the scene

653
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,540
we found this evidence report

654
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,740
The deceased is Rui Sibai.

655
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,300
The crime scene

656
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,900
was in the dormitory courtyard.

657
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,140
Just now,

658
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,940
we found some evidence.

659
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,860
"I deserve to die"

660
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,340
wasn't handwritten,

661
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,980
but printed by machine.

662
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,620
This clearly indicates

663
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,740
she definitely didn't commit suicide.

664
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,140
Based on evidence

665
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,220
collected at the scene,

666
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,700
the corpse had head trauma

667
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,580
and bloodstains.

668
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
And this bracelet

669
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,500
Yes, this bracelet

670
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,100
was found on her right wrist.

671
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,980
(discovered)

672
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,540
She had a bracelet

673
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,940
with an inscription reading:

674
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,180
"Exquisite silver bracelet, durable and strong,

675
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,300
won't deform if dropped from under 7 meters."

676
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,340
So she must have

677
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,940
fallen from over 7 meters

678
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,620
for it to deform.

679
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,140
She did indeed

680
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,740
fall from height,

681
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,980
but whether this fall was

682
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,060
the direct cause of death

683
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,940
remains unclear.

684
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,860
The rooftop has been sealed off,

685
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,460
and this is

686
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,780
what we saw on the scaffolding earlier.

687
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,100
Scaffolding height: 6 meters.

688
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,380
Okay, the scaffold is 6 meters.

689
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,220
Take me for example.

690
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,780
That would make it over 7 meters.

691
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,860
You mean based on height, right?

692
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,900
Right, doesn't that create...

693
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,700
a fall from over 7 meters high?

694
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,580
Are there any other fatal injuries?

695
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,300
Also, on her ankles...

696
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,420
there are ligature marks.

697
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,300
She was tied up.

698
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,660
It might not have been a fall.

699
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,780
I think...

700
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,860
And this is

701
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,540
a note found in her coat pocket

702
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,140
that says

703
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,460
"Sis Li, after today's rehearsal ends,"

704
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,620
"come to the laundry room."

705
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,380
"I'll tell you"

706
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
"the truth about Ai Changge's suicide."

707
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,340
We finished rehearsal at 10 o'clock

708
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,220
and everyone left from here.

709
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,620
Because she wasn't

710
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,780
allowing us to stay here.

711
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,460
It was already 10 o'clock,

712
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,380
and before the official performance

713
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,020
we needed to protect

714
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,500
the stage setup.

715
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,460
So you shouldn't stay

716
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
in the small auditorium.

717
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,020
"I have something to do now, I'll leave first."

718
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,860
Later we found

719
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,700
surveillance evidence

720
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,780
showing that at 10:15

721
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,900
she was heading toward the laundry room.

722
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,780
This is surveillance footage from 9:00 to 11:30.

723
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,900
Sis Li

724
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,780
10:15

725
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,100
She didn't go upstairs.

726
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,460
Did she come out?

727
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,500
No.

728
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,660
She didn't come out.

729
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,340
No.

730
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,980
Because the laundry room is a blind spot -

731
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,060
there's no surveillance there.

732
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
She turned in there, yes.

733
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,260
The next time we saw her

734
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,980
she was already a corpse.

735
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,580
This is that surveillance footage

736
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,780
Watch the footage carefully

737
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,700
Yesterday we didn't examine the footage properly

738
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,300
The beauty-conscious shop assistant

739
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,620
From the dormitory building

740
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,740
10:15 AM, Sisi

741
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,740
Who was there at 11:20?

742
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,620
Xiao Huang

743
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,580
He went to find that girl

744
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,620
He saw it

745
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,300
11:26 AM

746
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,740
He rushed to that courtyard

747
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,940
Then he went to borrow a knife

748
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,260
Got a blade from the convenience store

749
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,820
Then opened the door

750
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,020
We estimate the time of death

751
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,500
Was between 10:15 AM

752
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,460
And 11:20 AM

753
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,020
When was this surveillance activated?

754
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,100
From 9:00 to 11:30 AM

755
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,500
Yet no one passed through here

756
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,900
Let me tell you something

757
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,780
When I killed that person yesterday

758
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,740
The situation today is completely different

759
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,580
Haven't gone to jail yet

760
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,780
I completed all preparations

761
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,380
Before the surveillance was activated

762
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,620
Which means it's very possible

763
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,140
That with surveillance starting at 9 today

764
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,500
If I were the killer

765
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,140
I could have done everything

766
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,300
Openly and freely

767
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,700
All sorts of things

768
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,140
There's one problem

769
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,580
We're rehearsing here

770
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,340
That means entry wasn't from this side

771
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,660
That door was

772
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,980
Taped shut from the inside

773
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,620
If this person taped it

774
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,300
From the inside

775
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,740
How did they exit afterward?

776
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,180
If the upper section

777
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,580
Was completely sealed

778
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,300
I rushed downstairs

779
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,340
Only to find the door

780
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,540
Couldn't be opened due to the tape

781
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,620
So there should be

782
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,940
another exit inside

783
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,100
You mean within the courtyard

784
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,980
there's a hidden passage?

785
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,500
Exactly

786
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,300
Then there's one piece of evidence

787
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,140
Three sheets of paper from the Push Bar

788
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,140
The 2003 Push Art Star

789
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,500
selection results

790
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,100
First place was Hu Jie

791
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,540
And last year's last place was

792
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,460
Ai Sing

793
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,820
2003

794
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,140
Right

795
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,180
This year, Hu Jie is last place

796
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,140
600th place: Hu Jie

797
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,860
Someone already commented on the second one.

798
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,980
Saying the last place was Ai Singing.

799
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,820
She's always been first before.

800
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,180
Shocking.

801
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,540
There's another detail in the second one.

802
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
That is,

803
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,740
According to tradition,

804
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,100
no one should acknowledge her all year.

805
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Our school's tradition is

806
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,060
to ignore whoever comes in last place.

807
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,820
School bullying.

808
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,380
Right.

809
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,420
Then on the third floor,

810
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,500
Hu Jie is first.

811
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,380
Well deserved.

812
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,180
This shows Hu Jie

813
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,500
has real talent.

814
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,060
And Hu Jie,

815
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,220
though we're the same age,

816
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,060
was actually my childhood idol.

817
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,140
Who didn't grow up

818
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,420
watching his shows?

819
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,900
Hahaha.

820
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,980
I used to watch

821
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,500
his debut sci-fi kids' show every day.

822
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,700
I heard Hu Jie wrote sci-fi stories as a kid

823
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,380
and even won children's sci-fi awards.

824
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,060
So impressive.

825
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,580
After all these years of being a fan,

826
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,020
I definitely chose right.

827
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,220
The problem is

828
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,420
the one who was always first

829
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,380
suddenly came in last,

830
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,660
and last year's winner

831
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,020
is now in last place too.

832
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,260
This proves

833
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,580
there's something wrong with the selection.

834
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,900
So who's first this year?

835
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,180
Me.

836
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,940
Or perhaps it means

837
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,660
Some people are more envious

838
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,900
Or the top performer

839
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,060
always faces threats

840
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,940
If you obey me

841
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,700
I can continue to support you next year

842
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,260
But everyone

843
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,020
disobeyed that person

844
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,340
So the next year

845
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,540
they were placed last

846
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,420
Let you experience

847
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,860
the consequences of disobeying me

848
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,340
Principal, the case is closed

849
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,140
Another thing

850
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,980
is that we also met someone

851
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,620
Xiao Wei

852
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,980
Xiao Wei

853
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,900
I am

854
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,100
I am Xiao Wei

855
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,060
Then when Xiao Wei saw me

856
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,980
she would roll her eyes

857
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,020
Xiao Rou would

858
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,420
Xiao Rou would

859
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,100
stutter

860
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,100
But today, Xiao Wei

861
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,460
started stuttering instead

862
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,580
It feels like their personalities swapped

863
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,580
Do you remember

864
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,700
Xiao Wei created the escape room

865
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,860
"Push Guest Empire"

866
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,420
But I know nothing about computers

867
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,100
Maybe you guys can figure it out

868
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,060
Because of Xiao Rou

869
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,460
Back then, the whole class

870
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,260
called her an ugly girl

871
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,180
Ugly girl

872
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,740
Right

873
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,380
And (Xiao Wei) acted ambiguously towards him

874
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,420
Classmate Bai, you can do it

875
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,260
Very cute

876
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Does Xiaowei have any nicknames?

877
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,980
Nickname

878
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,660
Xiaowei

879
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,740
Didn't you say Xiaorou was called Dinosaur Girl?

880
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,020
Is it possible that Xiaowei...

881
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,580
Yes, and another thing is...

882
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,340
You asked her where Xiaorou went

883
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,260
She said she had already disappeared

884
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,380
for quite some time

885
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,620
Disappeared

886
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,260
Have you seen Xiaorou recently?

887
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,740
Xiaorou

888
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,820
A long time ago,

889
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,140
she disappeared without a trace.

890
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,900
Yesterday at the laundry room,

891
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,460
the one we caught

892
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,380
was a Dinosaur Person.

893
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,100
So complicated

894
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,260
I'll go first.

895
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,260
This is evidence against He Dinghong.

896
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,380
In He Dinghong's dormitory drawer,

897
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,660
we found

898
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,020
a photo of him

899
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,620
on a date with a girl.

900
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,780
The girl has an English name,

901
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,020
Canary.

902
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,940
It's her online alias.

903
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,620
But on this girl's face

904
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,820
there are inexplicably many red dots

905
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,340
Her red dots

906
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,460
are natural acne she was born with

907
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,780
Nine pimples are her trademark

908
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,140
That's definitely her

909
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,940
I have nine black moles

910
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,860
I'm just her replacement

911
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,260
They're at the Eiffel Tower

912
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,660
Seven-star Michelin restaurant

913
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,580
This is the Champs-Élysées

914
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,020
And then

915
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,780
they also went through this

916
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,500
By the Seine river

917
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,980
Seems like he fell into the river, right?

918
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,980
She came to save you, didn't she?

919
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,340
Speak up

920
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,460
This girl is named Canary

921
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,060
She's been with me since childhood

922
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,260
A childhood friend

923
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,220
We grew up together

924
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,180
What?

925
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
A long time ago,

926
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,260
I followed my uncle

927
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,940
Director He abroad

928
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,940
where he filmed movies

929
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,900
and I lived with him

930
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,220
That's when I met

931
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,100
a little girl named Canary

932
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,940
We spent time together

933
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,980
and shared many experiences

934
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,100
Playing beneath the Eiffel Tower

935
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,020
and by the Seine River

936
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,500
Moreover,

937
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,300
after I fell into the river

938
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,300
she saved me

939
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,060
She gave me the gift of life

940
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,780
So you promised to marry her?

941
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,700
You promised to marry me too!

942
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,340
Don't interfere

943
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,540
Stop causing trouble

944
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,300
He was just mean to you

945
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,620
Now he's gradually becoming

946
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,620
impatient with you

947
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
He doesn't like you anymore

948
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,020
I always feel when he holds me

949
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,340
his hands are so cold

950
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,980
his eyes are so cold when he looks at me

951
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,060
and his kisses aren't sincere

952
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,420
Because you have a fever

953
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,260
That's harsh

954
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,580
But later because

955
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,100
my uncle was returning to China

956
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,900
there was no other choice

957
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,780
so I had to return to China with him

958
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,020
and with her

959
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,860
we lost contact after that

960
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,740
And then, this is the second one.

961
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,780
A letter found in the pocket of Hedinhong's school uniform.

962
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,060
Krien is yours.

963
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,420
It's me.

964
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,900
It was my English name when I was abroad.

965
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,980
So fancy.

966
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,540
Krien.

967
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,660
I want to say goodbye to you.

968
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,100
Please don't think it's sudden.

969
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,260
Let me tell you a story.

970
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,740
The day you transferred to Tuiyi.

971
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,300
I recognized you at first sight.

972
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,620
But with the canary

973
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,060
You fell in love instantly

974
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,780
And seemed to forget me completely

975
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,620
After last year's Star Artist selection ended

976
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,500
I never thought you'd become

977
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,980
One of those who ignore me

978
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,140
But still, I thank you

979
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,540
The memories of our childhood

980
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,140
Were the only happiness

981
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,220
In my painful life

982
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,460
Goodbye

983
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,260
Krien

984
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,060
A canary that no longer sings

985
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,540
Xiao Ai sings

986
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,780
Xiao Ai was your childhood sweetheart

987
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,180
You're so cruel

988
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,780
You hurt Xiao Ai

989
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,020
Every night

990
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,660
You video called me in the dorm

991
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,780
She heard everything

992
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,860
Yes, you were even roommates

993
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,540
Did Xiao Ai recognize him later?

994
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,300
He was dating me

995
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,580
We kept video calling

996
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,380
Sometimes he'd say "What are you doing, babe?"

997
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,900
Are you even human?

998
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,700
So

999
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,500
So what? Say it

1000
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,260
So you made her so heartbroken

1001
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,940
That she jumped to her death

1002
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,380
You're her killer

1003
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,140
Vote

1004
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,620
Did you recognize that Ai Singing?

1005
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,020
I don't know her.

1006
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,820
I only found out yesterday.

1007
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,140
Ai Singing was actually

1008
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,580
my former Canary.

1009
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,740
Only knew yesterday.

1010
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,260
That's when I realized.

1011
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,980
Because I just

1012
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,780
Last September,

1013
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,900
when I transferred back,

1014
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,580
the first person I saw was her.

1015
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,860
Why did I fall for her?

1016
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,580
Why?

1017
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,620
Not just because of

1018
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,220
her extraordinary beauty,

1019
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,980
but also because of

1020
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,100
the 9 pockmarks on her face.

1021
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,820
Not pockmarks.

1022
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,020
They were beauty marks.

1023
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,620
Anyway, I thought they were pockmarks.

1024
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,980
I thought she was

1025
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,740
my childhood Canary.

1026
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,340
Where did this letter come from?

1027
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,620
I don't know who gave it to me.

1028
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,740
I just found it in my dorm.

1029
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,940
When did you receive the letter?

1030
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,100
This letter was yesterday -

1031
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,380
after we received news

1032
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,380
about Ai Singing's suicide,

1033
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,940
that's when I got it.

1034
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,940
You dealt her the fatal blow

1035
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,700
So the reason was

1036
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
he didn't recognize her

1037
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,700
and just went along with everyone

1038
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,620
to bully her together

1039
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,260
and ended up hurting her

1040
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,300
I never imagined that while I loved you so much

1041
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,980
you were actually bullying me

1042
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,380
and even found another girlfriend

1043
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,220
I can't go on living

1044
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,180
I'll die

1045
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,100
Then, in your computer

1046
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,980
we discovered an issue

1047
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,660
You've also visited

1048
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,740
the Tweet Empire website

1049
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,700
I just logged in last night

1050
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,020
After logging in,

1051
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,500
there was an anonymous private message saying

1052
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,260
they saw your post asking

1053
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,860
if anyone knew

1054
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,460
how Xiao Ai died.

1055
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,380
"I know the truth—

1056
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,900
her death is related to Sisi."

1057
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
Rui Sipai was known in school

1058
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,780
as the notorious bully queen

1059
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,660
who took pleasure in tormenting classmates

1060
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,220
During the freshman year's

1061
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,780
Performing Arts Star selection

1062
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,660
through Rui Sipai's vote manipulation

1063
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,860
Ai Sing ended up in last place

1064
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,300
After the evaluation was over,

1065
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,620
all the students at school stopped paying attention to Ai Changge.

1066
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,220
They collectively treated her as if she were invisible.

1067
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,380
Originally, she was the hot favorite for the female lead in the final play,

1068
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,700
"Carmen Li Le."

1069
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,660
as the leading female role.

1070
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,140
But she missed the opportunity because of this incident.

1071
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,940
Isolated, she

1072
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,700
never sang again.

1073
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,180
It is speculated that due to the Push Art Star

1074
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,860
restarting the evaluation,

1075
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,220
Ai Changge was worried that she

1076
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,180
would continue to be rated last.

1077
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,380
She couldn't bear the pain of covert bullying

1078
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,540
and chose to commit suicide.

1079
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,580
So you killed

1080
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,780
Rui Sibai,

1081
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,620
please explain.

1082
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,780
After I received this letter,

1083
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,020
I was actually very upset.

1084
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,460
My childhood friend,

1085
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,580
encountered such unfair treatment at school,

1086
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,020
such unfair treatment.

1087
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,780
And

1088
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,060
what upset me the most is

1089
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,700
that I myself was involved in it.

1090
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,940
Because I wanted to find out who harmed Ai Changge,

1091
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,660
who exactly caused her death,

1092
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,140
so I logged into the Pusher Empire

1093
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,900
and sent such an anonymous letter,

1094
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,140
to ask if anyone knew

1095
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,140
the truth of the matter.

1096
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,660
While I was sitting

1097
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,860
by the Helpless River,

1098
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,140
someone sent me this information,

1099
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,060
which clearly explained the situation.

1100
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,300
It said that Rui Sibai caused this incident.

1101
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,180
That's why I developed

1102
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,060
the intention to kill

1103
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,020
against Rui Sibai,

1104
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,540
the intent to kill and hatred.

1105
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,940
But I know that Rui Sibai bullied Ai Changge,

1106
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,820
I know Ai Changge

1107
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,780
was my childhood friend,

1108
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,260
and it all happened last night,

1109
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,940
there was absolutely no time to do all this.

1110
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,260
What's wrong with this tree bark?

1111
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,740
After receiving this information,

1112
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,380
I returned from Wukenai River.

1113
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,620
I checked around the dormitory and art building,

1114
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,740
going through every room.

1115
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,220
After searching around,

1116
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,540
I heard noises outside,

1117
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,460
then saw by the riverside

1118
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,260
two fallen trees.

1119
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:00,980
On the tree bark,

1120
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,300
there was a pig's nose imprint.

1121
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,420
Then I spotted a

1122
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,020
pig-faced person,

1123
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,780
a "pig-man".

1124
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,420
You couldn't tell if it was human

1125
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:09,900
or if it was

1126
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,740
a monster.

1127
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,500
Monster.

1128
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,260
Yesterday we met a dinosaur-man,

1129
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,700
today a pig-headed man.

1130
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,420
Xiaorou also mentioned

1131
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,260
a swap occurred

1132
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,900
between Xiaorou and Xiaowei -

1133
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,740
their personalities were swapped.

1134
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,900
Right.

1135
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,700
Okay, I'm done.

1136
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,620
His murder motive

1137
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,940
was to avenge Canary (Ai Singing).

1138
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,380
Canary, share your evidence.

1139
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,500
I was once with this person

1140
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,860
in a relationship for so long.

1141
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,900
I always thought you were a gentleman,

1142
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,860
but never expected

1143
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,740
I

1144
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,740
never expected

1145
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,660
this white T-shirt

1146
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,740
was found between your bed frame

1147
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,540
and the foot of your bed.

1148
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,140
It's covered in leaves and smells like dirt.

1149
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,860
What's the explanation?

1150
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,300
And these boxer shorts,

1151
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,980
I think they're a bit dirty.

1152
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,540
It looks like someone soiled them here.

1153
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,620
It's yellow.

1154
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,020
Did you wet yourself?

1155
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,780
That's dirt.

1156
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,020
These are my sleep pants.

1157
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,260
This is my sleepwear.

1158
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,020
Then why are they so dirty?

1159
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,740
And with leaves too?

1160
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,580
I'd like to ask about this one

1161
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,100
You like to play this game

1162
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,340
Help me!

1163
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,300
This was found on the bed frame

1164
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,860
and at the foot of the bed

1165
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,540
Is it possible that these are

1166
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,660
the cuffs that restrained the victim's feet

1167
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,180
Wait a moment, let me finish first.

1168
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,100
Go ahead.

1169
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:12,940
This

1170
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,380
blushing

1171
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,620
These handcuffs

1172
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,780
are a personal hobby of mine

1173
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,820
Listen to me

1174
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,340
Is it that perverted?

1175
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,780
First, we finished handling the case

1176
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,940
You call that finishing a case?

1177
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,340
You killed someone

1178
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,020
No

1179
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,500
Last night we were in the training room

1180
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,340
After finishing the case

1181
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,020
I went to handle some personal matters

1182
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,940
What matters?

1183
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,420
None of your business

1184
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:36,900
What's it to you?

1185
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,820
My own business

1186
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,940
Who's your roommate?

1187
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,700
He Dinghong

1188
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,500
He Dinghong

1189
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,620
You're asking me who my roommate is?

1190
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,860
Yes

1191
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:47,740
Wait a minute

1192
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,820
Let me finish first

1193
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,820
Every word I say next is true

1194
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,860
Although it sounds unbelievable

1195
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,220
But you have to believe me

1196
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,300
Go on

1197
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,460
Here's what happened

1198
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,940
Last night we were in the training room

1199
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,500
After finishing the case

1200
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,300
I handled some personal matters

1201
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,860
Then I returned to the dorm

1202
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,460
Later in the dorm

1203
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,460
I fell asleep

1204
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,420
After I fell asleep

1205
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,020
I suddenly felt my nose

1206
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,500
Hurt badly

1207
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,140
Then I also felt

1208
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,660
My butt hurt terribly

1209
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,580
Needed to use the bathroom

1210
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,300
You're my roommate

1211
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,860
You're making me look suspicious

1212
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,780
What's wrong with my butt hurting?

1213
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,220
Can't my butt hurt?

1214
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,540
Let me finish

1215
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,140
I clearly fell asleep in my dorm bed

1216
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,140
But when I opened my eyes

1217
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,420
I was by the Wukenai River

1218
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,780
I realized I knocked down two trees

1219
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,900
How did you know

1220
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,860
that you knocked them down?

1221
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,220
Because I felt pain at that moment

1222
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,620
and then two trees fell in front of me

1223
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,300
When I opened my eyes

1224
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,860
I thought I had knocked them down

1225
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,660
Then because it hurt so much

1226
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,780
I wanted to scream

1227
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,380
But the sound I made

1228
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,940
turned into a pig's squeal

1229
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,380
So I crawled to

1230
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,140
the riverbank

1231
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,900
and looked at my reflection

1232
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,020
only to discover I'd become

1233
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,660
a person with a pig's head

1234
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,180
Then I saw

1235
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,580
a pig-faced person

1236
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,500
When I looked again

1237
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,460
I saw on the tree bark

1238
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,580
the imprint of a pig's snout

1239
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,980
It's you.

1240
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,660
That thing I saw at night.

1241
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,140
It was you.

1242
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,420
So you're the "Pig Man".

1243
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,300
Yes.

1244
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:18,980
This is the first time you've discovered.

1245
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,660
That you have this condition, right?

1246
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,180
Right.

1247
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,940
Then I thought.

1248
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,180
I might scare people.

1249
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,780
I might even hurt someone.

1250
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,860
So I went and got these handcuffs.

1251
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,500
To cuff myself to the bed.

1252
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,460
Just in case, you know?

1253
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:32,900
Where did you get them?

1254
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,300
I took them from the props department.

1255
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,380
It says.

1256
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,980
Okay.

1257
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,860
That's evidence number two.

1258
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,780
This.

1259
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,220
Under the bed.

1260
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,420
I don't even want to touch it.

1261
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,780
Here's what happened.

1262
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,380
First of all, this isn't mine.

1263
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,860
This isn't my clothing.

1264
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,620
Last night,

1265
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,940
after finishing up

1266
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,020
our case,

1267
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:03,980
I took care of some personal matters.

1268
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,860
I returned to my dorm to write songs.

1269
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,420
While writing,

1270
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,220
I heard sounds from the hallway -

1271
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,100
sounds of pain.

1272
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,340
Like someone was in great pain.

1273
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,540
So I opened the door

1274
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,420
just a crack,

1275
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:17,900
and looked out.

1276
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,300
Then I saw someone completely

1277
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,620
wrapped in blood-stained bandages

1278
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,060
walking down the hallway.

1279
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,660
That might have been

1280
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,060
the same person we encountered.

1281
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,380
"It hurts so much."

1282
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,620
I'm not sure if it was that person,

1283
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,100
but I

1284
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,460
was just describing

1285
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,380
their appearance.

1286
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,620
After they walked away,

1287
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,860
I noticed

1288
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,820
some clothing left on the floor.

1289
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,540
I quickly went out

1290
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,180
to pick it up.

1291
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,020
I wanted to investigate

1292
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,220
what was going on,

1293
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,620
but I was too scared,

1294
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,620
so I took it back

1295
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,580
and decided to check

1296
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,780
when morning came.

1297
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,420
Did you check in the morning?

1298
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,580
At dawn we came here to rehearse.

1299
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,020
I see.

1300
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,940
I'm innocent.

1301
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,660
Next piece of evidence.

1302
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,180
His computer

1303
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,620
Push it

1304
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,860
The post on Pushba

1305
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,580
Recommendation post

1306
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,660
The light of musicals

1307
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,020
Those who haven't seen "Pig Head"

1308
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,140
Go watch it now

1309
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,380
"Pig Head" tells the story of a child star

1310
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,620
who loses himself

1311
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,300
after achieving early fame in showbiz

1312
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,060
Then someone on 3rd floor said

1313
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,220
It's quite good

1314
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,260
Very realistic acting

1315
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,340
Someone replied

1316
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,020
Because the lead actor played himself

1317
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,180
That's why it's so real

1318
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,260
Did he gain weight

1319
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,860
for the sake of art?

1320
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,700
Another reply came

1321
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,660
He was already fat

1322
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,900
Then 4th floor said

1323
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,820
Has no one mentioned

1324
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,180
The character name deserves credit too

1325
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:46,940
Pig Head

1326
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,420
Who came up with it?

1327
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,380
Someone replied

1328
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,380
Heard it was suggested

1329
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,140
by a handsome guy in their team

1330
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,540
Then Dollar replied

1331
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,140
Thanks for confirming

1332
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,900
Then 5th floor asked

1333
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,420
What does "Pig Head" really mean?

1334
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,420
Another reply came

1335
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,340
It's a homophone for "pig head"

1336
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,620
This Dollar keeps

1337
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,580
replying as an insider

1338
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,420
You there

1339
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,860
Then someone on the 7th floor said

1340
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,380
Don't argue

1341
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,340
Any other musical recommendations?

1342
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:14,980
Someone replied

1343
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,620
"Carmen Inside" is also good

1344
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,340
Agreed

1345
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,620
Dilraba looks so beautiful in it

1346
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,580
I won't say a word

1347
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:23,820
Then someone else said

1348
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,540
And she's super nice too

1349
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,180
"Carmen Inside"

1350
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,220
The female lead totally deserves it

1351
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,540
It's actually dual female leads

1352
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,380
I'm going to report this guy

1353
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,660
Someone on the 8th floor said

1354
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,300
Isn't anyone curious about "Zhu Tou"

1355
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,420
What's the male lead's real name?

1356
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,620
Reply: It's Zhu Tou (Pig Head)

1357
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,740
Said: Stop joking

1358
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,220
It's Hu Jie

1359
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,340
Seems he was a child star

1360
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,140
Someone else replied

1361
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,420
But you really can call him Pig Head

1362
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,260
I heard before

1363
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,340
He was that "Snorer" in the dorm

1364
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,620
Dollar said

1365
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,860
That's him

1366
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,020
This Dollar seems to know

1367
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,540
Tell us

1368
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,620
What does this mean?

1369
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,620
This story is quite long

1370
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,980
It's rather lengthy

1371
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,180
Ever since freshman year

1372
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,860
when I transferred to this university

1373
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,180
I often heard in the dorm

1374
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,980
snoring sounds

1375
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,700
This

1376
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:09,980
also somewhat resembles

1377
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:10,980
What else?

1378
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,980
That's how it always is.

1379
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,380
It was this kind of really loud noise.

1380
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,540
But at that time I was busy

1381
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,860
dating the canary.

1382
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,100
So I didn't pay much attention to it.

1383
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,300
Until November came,

1384
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,460
the snoring affected my sleep

1385
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,380
which later caused me

1386
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,340
to have a major accident during a performance.

1387
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,860
So I went to ask

1388
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,860
about the source of the snoring I heard,

1389
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,940
which was dorm 202.

1390
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,180
That's Ning Hao and Hu Jie's

1391
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,300
dorm room.

1392
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,460
I went to confront him,

1393
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,140
asking if the snorer

1394
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,540
was his good friend Hu Jie.

1395
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,340
He said yes.

1396
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,540
So I found out about this Hu Jie

1397
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,420
who snores loudly

1398
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,300
I thought

1399
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,100
I must find a way

1400
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,260
to get back at him for this

1401
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,500
Later on, this Ruisi Bai

1402
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,860
wanted to create a musical

1403
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,860
because she heard about Hu Jie's situation.

1404
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,420
After Hu Jie gained weight,

1405
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,740
he rarely got any performance offers.

1406
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,780
So he no longer had

1407
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,980
opportunities to perform.

1408
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,340
Ruisi Bai

1409
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,660
learned about this

1410
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,780
and got some inspiration.

1411
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,580
The so-called child star who was once extremely popular

1412
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,540
but became lonely after growing up -

1413
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,580
this kind of story.

1414
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,460
She wanted to create

1415
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,300
a musical like this.

1416
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,300
And she wanted Hu Jie himself to star in it.

1417
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,780
Then I suggested to her

1418
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,380
that I thought this was

1419
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,300
a chance to get back at him.

1420
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,420
I told Ruisi Bai,

1421
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,340
"Why don't you change

1422
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,180
the main character's name

1423
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,140
to 'Zhu Tou'?"

1424
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,460
Because it sounds like "pig head"

1425
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,860
since he snores a lot.

1426
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,180
Then Ruisi Bai happily

1427
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,220
accepted my suggestion

1428
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:38,660
and agreed.

1429
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,100
She even changed

1430
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,820
the musical's title to "Zhu Tou."

1431
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,860
During the performance,

1432
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,420
when Hu Jie introduced himself,

1433
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:44,820
he said,

1434
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,300
"Hello everyone, I'm Zhu Tou."

1435
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,900
The audience all said Hu Jie was Zhu Tou.

1436
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,020
It was like...

1437
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,380
After hearing these voices,

1438
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,020
I secretly felt

1439
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,140
really satisfied.

1440
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,420
You're not a good person.

1441
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:55,980
You...

1442
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,660
It's just...

1443
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,940
so shady.

1444
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,180
Didn't you say you and Ruisi Bai

1445
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,660
weren't close?

1446
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:04,980
Right,

1447
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:05,900
I forgot to mention earlier,

1448
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,540
in her musical "Zhu Tou,"

1449
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,260
I also played

1450
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:09,860
a rapper.

1451
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,460
So I had the honor of performing in

1452
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,300
her theatrical productions

1453
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,700
But my interactions with her

1454
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,380
were strictly limited to artistic matters

1455
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,460
So you're saying you had no motive for murder

1456
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,660
Do you think I did?

1457
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,860
Come on, your turn.

1458
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,820
Next.

1459
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,340
Me.

1460
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,060
Your turn.

1461
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,180
The first piece of evidence.

1462
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:41,740
On him.

1463
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,140
Who? Me?

1464
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,700
First evidence.

1465
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,460
Hanging in Room 202.

1466
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,260
A pillowcase stained with blood.

1467
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,980
And a bloodstained bedsheet.

1468
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,900
A pair of pants with stains.

1469
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,380
Could be blood or just dirt.

1470
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,060
So much blood in your dorm.

1471
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,980
What's with all this blood?

1472
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,820
What happened?

1473
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,380
After our discussion last night.

1474
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,820
I went back to my room.

1475
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,300
Just as I was about to fall asleep.

1476
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,420
I suddenly felt.

1477
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,780
All over my body.

1478
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,580
My arms, legs, back.

1479
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,620
Everywhere started to.

1480
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:27,620
Grow hair.

1481
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,580
Grow hair.

1482
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,260
Grow hair.

1483
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,460
Not grow hair.

1484
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,940
Split open.

1485
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,060
Split open.

1486
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,460
A tearing sensation.

1487
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,340
Then it started.

1488
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,140
With small and large cracks.

1489
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,780
I started bleeding all over.

1490
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,860
Bleeding everywhere.

1491
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,140
Yes.

1492
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,900
It was all.

1493
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,860
Like being cut with a knife.

1494
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,340
Did it hurt?

1495
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,740
Excruciating.

1496
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,900
What was the word he used just now?

1497
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,580
Scream in pain.

1498
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,380
Scream in pain.

1499
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,060
Started screaming in pain.

1500
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,340
Scream in pain.

1501
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,140
Started screaming in pain.

1502
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:04,940
So he.

1503
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,940
The one screaming in pain yesterday was you.

1504
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,620
That's right.

1505
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,660
Then I felt extreme pain at that moment.

1506
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,100
So I went to the...

1507
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,340
...under the bed to find bandages.

1508
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,300
Found some bandages.

1509
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,980
Then I used them to...

1510
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,900
...bandage all the wounded areas.

1511
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,740
After bandaging myself...

1512
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,660
I gathered all the blood-stained...

1513
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,460
...sheets, quilt covers, pants...

1514
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,260
...shirts and such.

1515
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,260
Took them to the laundry room.

1516
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,140
I wanted to wash them clean.

1517
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,020
Because I was afraid...

1518
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,420
You really care about cleanliness.

1519
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,260
Even at a time like this...

1520
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,300
...you didn't go to the hospital?

1521
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,820
Instead you did laundry?

1522
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,260
I feared that if people saw me...

1523
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,340
...they would scorn me.

1524
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,540
Scorn you?

1525
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,700
Wouldn't we help you?

1526
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,020
Right, wouldn't we save you?

1527
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:52,540
But I'm someone who...

1528
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,700
...values reputation greatly.

1529
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,540
After all, I'm an award-winning actor.

1530
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,380
In terms of public image...

1531
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,060
...I can't let people see me covered in blood.

1532
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,100
Alright.

1533
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,380
But here's the strange thing...

1534
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,180
When I was walking back...

1535
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,660
...and checked the bandages...

1536
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,100
I discovered that my wounds...

1537
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,100
...had healed.

1538
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,740
So just going to the laundry room healed you?

1539
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,940
No, not from going to the laundry room...

1540
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,180
It was while returning from...

1541
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,620
...the laundry after washing the clothes...

1542
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,020
...that I noticed it.

1543
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,420
They had healed.

1544
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,100
Healed.

1545
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,540
Second one

1546
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,460
Hello

1547
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,980
There's a photo in the desk drawer

1548
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,740
Actually I couldn't quite tell where this was

1549
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:39,580
Let him explain

1550
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,900
Is it a convenience store?

1551
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,820
Looks like a convenience store

1552
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,700
It is a convenience store

1553
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,300
What's the story behind this photo?

1554
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,620
We had a performance the next day

1555
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,820
So around

1556
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,180
10:30 pm I went out

1557
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,540
To practice

1558
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,220
A song I prepared

1559
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,260
for "Swan Lake Push"

1560
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,660
Though I didn't get to perform it today

1561
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,500
On my way back after practicing

1562
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,540
I passed by this convenience store

1563
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,260
When I suddenly noticed someone inside

1564
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:03,940
Couldn't see their face

1565
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,860
Because it was dark

1566
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,620
When I got closer

1567
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,780
They seemed to be

1568
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,460
Sneakily eating dragon beard candy

1569
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,420
I found it really creepy at the time

1570
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,660
Eating dragon beard candy

1571
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,940
It was already late at night

1572
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,980
I thought this person was suspicious

1573
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,980
I couldn't tell if they were human or ghost

1574
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,100
Because I could only see their back

1575
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,820
All dark

1576
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,300
So I took a photo with my phone

1577
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,860
Third, the computer.

1578
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,340
Then,

1579
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,140
This is a post on Tuiba.

1580
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,660
OP Guaguale said:

1581
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,100
"My relative works in the entertainment industry,"

1582
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,380
"Recently had a meal together"

1583
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,700
"and heard lots about"

1584
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,820
"some shocking scandals that'll blow your mind."

1585
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,860
"Everyone grab your popcorn,"

1586
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,740
Various commenters replied:

1587
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,980
"Okay" "First!" "Bumping" "Ready and waiting"

1588
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,740
"OP hurry up and post!"

1589
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:45,900
Guaguale started posting:

1590
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,540
"About this sophomore"

1591
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,020
"two-character name actor"

1592
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,940
"Keyword: child star"

1593
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,820
"Before debut as a kid,"

1594
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,140
"Hu Jie"

1595
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,620
"looked nothing like this."

1596
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,060
"Had major plastic surgery."

1597
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,780
They also posted

1598
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,860
a photo of Hu Jie.

1599
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,620

1600
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,860
"Hu Jie looks like this?"

1601
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,340
Random User A replied:

1602
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,340
"Collapsed! Fan turned hater."

1603
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,620
Then Random User B:

1604
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,700
"I vaguely heard before"

1605
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,420
"insiders say he got work done."

1606
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,700
"Let me share more tea about Hu Jie -"

1607
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,580
"listen to his snoring audio!"

1608
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,700
That's the sound

1609
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,660
So noisy

1610
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:27,940
You blockhead

1611
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,700
How dare you criticize others

1612
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,580
Everyone else is saying

1613
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,420
The facade has shattered

1614
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,420
Should've said it earlier

1615
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,140
We wouldn't have let him claim it

1616
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:38,980
the "Star of Push Arts" award

1617
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,780
Then an anonymous source spilled that

1618
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,780
He trash-talks fans behind their backs

1619
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,340
Calling them ugly,

1620
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:53,220
tacky, stupid, and annoying

1621
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,180
But easy to manipulate

1622
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,740
Just throw them some crumbs

1623
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,740
and they'll go crazy for me

1624
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,060
Then there's more –

1625
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,420
Gossip Channel added

1626
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,060
he's a wild player privately,

1627
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,620
dating 18 girls at once

1628
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,820
Everyone's fueling the drama

1629
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:06,660
Until finally someone

1630
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,740
summarized all

1631
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,420
Hu Jie's trash behavior

1632
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,180
and the hate train began

1633
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,460
What does that have to do with him?

1634
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,020
He was the one who leaked it, right?

1635
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,300
That's correct.

1636
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:27,900
Let me explain to everyone.

1637
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,020
What does this have to do with me?

1638
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,900
Because Hu Jie was my roommate.

1639
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,100
And I really admired him.

1640
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,140
Ever since childhood,

1641
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,060
first, he was a child star.

1642
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:35,740
At our school,

1643
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,340
while we were studying,

1644
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,340
he was already acting in youth idol dramas.

1645
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,780
I was so envious of him.

1646
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:40,900
Because at that time,

1647
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,300
I could only be an extra.

1648
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,420
I was just a background actor.

1649
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,460
I might have filmed that

1650
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,940
"Crazy Stone Thief"

1651
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,180
Didn't you become famous after filming that?

1652
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:48,940
It hasn't been released yet.

1653
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,300
Doesn't production take about a year?

1654
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,820
I see.

1655
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:51,500
I wasn't famous back then.

1656
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,060
Understood.

1657
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:52,620
I didn't become famous.

1658
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,060
So,

1659
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:53,980
this was just a post

1660
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,900
I saw online.

1661
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,700
I just saved it.

1662
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,100
Because I pay attention to

1663
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:57,660
everything about him.

1664
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,220
I've idolized him since childhood.

1665
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,820
You just read these posts?

1666
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,220
Yes.

1667
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,460
Didn't participate in posting them.

1668
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:12,860
Next piece of evidence

1669
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,900
Let me tell everyone

1670
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,740
whether he participated in posting

1671
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,700
Alright

1672
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,660
This is

1673
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,980
found under his dormitory bed

1674
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,580
a metal box attached there

1675
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,460
First, look at this

1676
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,220
The accounts used for recent posts

1677
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,340
All the usernames and passwords

1678
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,380
belong to him

1679
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,220
You fabricated

1680
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,820
And he has a checklist that includes:

1681
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,420
Plastic surgery - mentioned

1682
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,540
Snoring - mentioned

1683
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,540
Insulting fans - mentioned

1684
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,700
Dating eighteen girlfriends - in progress

1685
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,300
Seems unnecessary

1686
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,220
What evidence is being fabricated?

1687
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,220
Now whatever is said,

1688
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,700
people believe it

1689
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,940
Malicious rumors

1690
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,940
Killing people

1691
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,580
And harming others

1692
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,860
This is your jealousy towards Hu Jie

1693
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,620
Biggest gossip in town

1694
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,940
Child stars outshine grassroots talents

1695
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,700
Epic masterpiece "Ambush Face-to-Face"

1696
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,540
Rumored lead actor replacement

1697
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,460
Circle it and explain

1698
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,900
What gives you the right

1699
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,540
Too much jealousy

1700
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,300
Such strong jealousy

1701
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,460
Is the voice recorder included too?

1702
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,580
Hu Jie, I have an audition coming up.

1703
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:49,780
For a villain role.

1704
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,780
But I can't get the tone right for one particular line.

1705
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,780
Could you demonstrate it for me?

1706
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,260
This part?

1707
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,140
Let me try.

1708
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:58,940
These fans are so ugly.

1709
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,820
Tacky, stupid, and annoying.

1710
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,740
But at least they're easy to fool.

1711
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,980
Oops.

1712
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,780
This person...

1713
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,220
Ning Hao.

1714
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,820
Taken out of context.

1715
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,340
"Ning" is bad.

1716
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,660
Maliciously edited to spread rumors.

1717
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,260
You've broken the law.

1718
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,820
This is illegal.

1719
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,300
He already broke the law yesterday.

1720
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,420
And...

1721
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,300
Don't rush.

1722
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:28,780
It's not over yet.

1723
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,940
This photo...

1724
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,580
This is Hu Jie's real appearance.

1725
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,780
So handsome.

1726
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:35,700
Look.

1727
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,740
He said you're ugly.

1728
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,260
Claimed you had plastic surgery.

1729
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,940
It's malicious photo editing.

1730
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,100
You're so mean.

1731
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,860
Recording people's voices secretly again.

1732
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,420
What else?

1733
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,500
Who was snoring?

1734
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:55,660
How despicable

1735
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,140
Who's snoring?

1736
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,940
Spreading rumors about others

1737
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,940
Poor Hu Jie

1738
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,540
Fine

1739
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,700
Since you've all found this evidence

1740
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,220
I can only

1741
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,260
Admit it

1742
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,020
Originally, this

1743
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,060
Director He

1744
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,260
the renowned Director He

1745
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,820
was going to film a drama called

1746
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,940
"Ambush in Plain Sight"

1747
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,740
Initially, they considered casting me

1748
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,380
but this Hu Jie

1749
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:31,820
snatched it away

1750
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,780
Hu Jie directly took

1751
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,460
this opportunity from me

1752
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,420
It really stung me

1753
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,100
So then I wanted to get back at him

1754
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:43,860
I wanted revenge on him

1755
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,620
Then I'll spread rumors about you online

1756
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,140
I'll just say this about you is bad

1757
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,100
That's no good

1758
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,460
You've all seen the photos

1759
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:50,780
I deliberately

1760
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,340
Photoshopped

1761
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:51,700
Right

1762
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,180
Made him look ugly on purpose

1763
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,380
Create a fake edited photo.

1764
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,900
Then I'll use my own account to spread it.

1765
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,420
"Can you believe he looks like this?"

1766
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,060
To gain validation.

1767
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,060
Then I'll record my own snoring.

1768
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,220
And spread rumors about him online.

1769
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,380
Then I'll use alternate accounts.

1770
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,020
To hype it up.

1771
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,460
To insult him.

1772
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,980
Including secretly badmouthing fans.

1773
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:11,460
That segment.

1774
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,660
Actually someone asked him.

1775
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,220
To demonstrate an audition scene.

1776
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,540
So he performed.

1777
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,220
That kind of character portrayal.

1778
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,140
But I took that middle segment.

1779
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:19,900
Cropped it out.

1780
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:20,940
Took it out of context.

1781
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,740
Posted it online.

1782
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:22,900
For everyone to judge him.

1783
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:23,660
Then.

1784
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,260
Afterwards when throwing more.

1785
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:25,900
Dirt at him.

1786
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,500
I think people would believe it.

1787
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:27,900
Because.

1788
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,900
Mass cyberbullying happened.

1789
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,860
Yes, mass cyberbullying occurred.

1790
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,100
As long as one thing.

1791
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,180
Is believed to be true.

1792
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,300
Then anything else you say.

1793
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,180
Will seem true.

1794
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:34,940
Regardless of truth.

1795
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,580
They don't care about truth.

1796
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,580
Only what they want to see.

1797
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:39,220
Venting.

1798
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:39,900
Releasing anger.

1799
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,060
Later Hu Jie gave up on himself.

1800
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,300
He was ultimately.

1801
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,180
Actually cyberbullied.

1802
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:45,980
Precisely by you all.

1803
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,220
After the online abuse.

1804
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,300
He couldn't get work.

1805
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,900
Then completely gave up.

1806
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:51,900
Grew increasingly overweight.

1807
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,860
And more unattractive.

1808
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,060
So later he starred in their.

1809
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,540
Lead role called "Zhu Tou".

1810
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,140
That's how it was.

1811
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,420
So I did this thing.

1812
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,060
Look at yourself

1813
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,300
That's why you were bleeding last night

1814
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:05,860
Right?

1815
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,980
Karma, is it?

1816
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,940
So there's a reason you turned into a pig-headed man

1817
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,380
Have you done something similar before?

1818
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,700
You also participated in the cyberbullying.

1819
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,860
I participated too.

1820
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,620
Part of the so-called bullying against Hu Jie.

1821
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:22,900
There's one more thing.

1822
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,580
That, uh...

1823
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,460
Rui Sipai was also a bully.

1824
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,180
Then why did you kill Rui Sipai?

1825
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:29,620
I didn't mean to kill her.

1826
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,900
But what everyone's saying now
has nothing to do with Rui Sipai.

1827
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,660
It's completely unrelated.

1828
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,260
It's only about Hu Jie.

1829
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,260
Today's case must be related to Hu Jie.

1830
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,820
But Hu Jie is missing now, right?

1831
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,540
Hu Jie was ranked last.

1832
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,020
Rui Sipai had been controlling

1833
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,820
our "Rising Star" rankings.

1834
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,020
She manipulated the rankings.

1835
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,460
During the freshman year's

1836
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,020
"Rising Star" competition,

1837
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,900
through Rui Sipai's vote manipulation,

1838
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,100
Ai Changge ended up last.

1839
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,500
Was Hu Jie ranked last this time?

1840
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,340
Yes.

1841
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,340
Please look at the screen.

1842
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,780
600th place: Hu Jie.

1843
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,780
600th place.

1844
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,540
Correct.

1845
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,620
So far they haven't had

1846
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,180
any significant connection to the deceased.

1847
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,580
It's all about Hu Jie.

1848
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,060
My turn.

1849
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:27,900
Your turn.

1850
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,020
My turn.

1851
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,540
This was found in your...

1852
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,020
coat pocket.

1853
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,020
What is it?

1854
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,740
Dragon beard candy.

1855
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,340
After practicing singing...

1856
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,380
I passed by this convenience store...

1857
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,620
and suddenly noticed someone inside...

1858
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,260
acting very...

1859
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:45,940
sneakily eating dragon beard candy.

1860
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:47,460
I found it really creepy at the time.

1861
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,420
Turns out the person I saw...

1862
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,900
eating the candy was you.

1863
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,900
So you were the one he saw.

1864
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,340
What were you doing?

1865
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,260
I...

1866
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,340
I seemed possessed.

1867
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,020
Listen to me...

1868
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:07,700
After yesterday's incident...

1869
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,260
I was extremely nervous.

1870
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:09,940
But I remembered...

1871
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,500
we had a performance the next day...

1872
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,660
so I had to practice and rehearse.

1873
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,460
So I went to the dance studio...

1874
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,740
to work on my movements.

1875
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,020
While practicing...

1876
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,060
suddenly...

1877
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,580
everything turned white...

1878
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,580
engulfing me.

1879
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,940
I tried to escape...

1880
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:29,940
but couldn't.

1881
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,580
I truly couldn't escape.

1882
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,060
I said...

1883
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,500
"Let me out! Release me!"

1884
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,820
Was I too immersed in my role?

1885
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,620
I kept struggling, feeling dizzy...

1886
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,780
When I woke up again...

1887
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,740
I was at the convenience store.

1888
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,220
I teleported.

1889
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:46,140
And...

1890
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,820
I saw myself...

1891
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,380
eating dragon beard candy.

1892
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,620
I was bewitched.

1893
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,500
You sleepwalk too?

1894
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,500
You have no memory...

1895
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,940
of going from the studio to the store?

1896
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,660
Yes.

1897
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,740
Then let me ask you this

1898
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,540
Tui Zhen Art Academy dormitory inspection record

1899
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,780
Room 102 has Ba Zimei

1900
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,860
and Rui Sibai

1901
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,260
Room 201 has He Dinghong and me

1902
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,380
Room 202 has Ning Hao and Hu Jie

1903
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,860
Present in dorm?

1904
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,540
Possessing knives?

1905
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,060
All marked with X's

1906
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:18,820
Yes

1907
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:19,660
What's this about?

1908
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,700
Because I'm the dorm supervisor's

1909
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,980
assistant supervisor

1910
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,620
That day was my turn to accompany her

1911
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,540
for dorm inspection

1912
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,380
So at 1 AM

1913
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,460
I inspected dorms with her

1914
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,460
But

1915
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,860
not a single person

1916
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,740
none of you

1917
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,580
including Hu Jie

1918
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,580
was in their own dorm

1919
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,060
We were furious

1920
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,260
At 1 AM

1921
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:38,820
Yes, at 1 AM

1922
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:39,740
everyone was missing

1923
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,940
No one was in the dorms

1924
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,460
Weren't you eating candy at 1 AM?

1925
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,820
I finished the candy later

1926
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:45,980
and woke up at the convenience store

1927
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,900
At 1 AM I returned to

1928
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,620
my dorm building

1929
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,220
The supervisor said

1930
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,620
"We're inspecting rooms"

1931
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,020
But he had already returned by then

1932
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,820
I first saw the candy eating

1933
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,740
then returned to print photos

1934
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:55,380
After printing

1935
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,660
I prepared to sleep

1936
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,980
Then I bled after sleeping

1937
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,220
Then you went to the laundry room

1938
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,460
When you went to laundry

1939
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,260
it might have been after 1 AM

1940
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,460
Anyway I was with the supervisor

1941
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,380
when we saw

1942
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,140
empty dorms

1943
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,060
None of us were there

1944
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,260
And nobody had knives

1945
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:11,340
You're not here, right?

1946
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,100
He's not here either, right?

1947
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:12,420
No.

1948
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,660
I'm out relaxing.

1949
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,940
Where are you relaxing?

1950
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,780
Nowhere special.

1951
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,900
I need to have a serious talk with you.

1952
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,340
Canary.

1953
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,300
What's wrong?

1954
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,740
What's your relationship with Ai Singing?

1955
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,620
Roommates.

1956
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,180
Because on here,

1957
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,740
are her chat logs with Ai Singing.

1958
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,260
Let me read them to you one by one.

1959
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,500
Her QQ name is Morning Glory.

1960
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,060
She said to Ai Singing,

1961
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,780
"Sister Singing, my hair is messy."

1962
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:42,300
"When will you be back?"

1963
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,260
"Can you braid my hair?"

1964
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,780
"You know I can't do my own hair."

1965
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,340
"Sister Singing,"

1966
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,500
"can you buy me some snacks?"

1967
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,300
"I'm feeling a bit peckish."

1968
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:47,860
"Sure, little sister."

1969
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,220
"How about dragon beard candy?"

1970
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:49,860
"No."

1971
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,100
"I choked on it as a child."

1972
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,620
"Never liked it since."

1973
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:54,780
"Okay, little sister."

1974
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,220
"I got you some spicy strips."

1975
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,740
"My brother used the Heimlich"

1976
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,620
"to save me."

1977
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:58,660
"Alright."

1978
01:11:58,660 --> 01:11:59,140
"That shows"

1979
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,420
"it was unusual behavior that day."

1980
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,820
"I just don't eat dragon beard candy."

1981
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:03,940
"Sister Singing, I have a bit of a cold."

1982
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,220
"Remember to turn off the AC"

1983
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,180
"after I fall asleep today."

1984
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,100
"Sister Singing, I have pimples."

1985
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,380
"Remember to buy me medicine."

1986
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:09,900
"The one that"

1987
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,020
"when you had nine pimples at once as a kid,"

1988
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,860
"left no scars."

1989
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,420
"My face"

1990
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,460
"already has nine pimple scars."

1991
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,340
"Can't have any more."

1992
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:17,900
"You know."

1993
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,820
Sister Changge, I'm craving braised pork.

1994
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:25,540
Sister Changge, the homework is due Monday.

1995
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:26,900
I'm counting on you for my share.

1996
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,260
Sister.

1997
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,460
Are you going to the cafeteria later?

1998
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,140
Remember to bring me some braised pork.

1999
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:30,580
Changge says:

2000
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,180
I have rehearsals for "Carmen."

2001
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,020
I don't have time to go.

2002
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:33,580
Morning Glory says:

2003
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,060
Really?

2004
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,180
But I really want to eat it.

2005
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:35,900
Changge says:

2006
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,020
Really? Alright.

2007
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:37,900
Don't be upset.

2008
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,820
After my audition is over,

2009
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,060
I'll treat you to a feast.

2010
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:40,900
Okay.

2011
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:42,260
Changge says:

2012
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,820
Little sister, I'm in line at that

2013
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,860
viral milk tea place with a 3-hour wait.

2014
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,020
What flavor do you want?

2015
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,540
She didn't reply.

2016
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:49,420
Then she added:

2017
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,860
Little sister, I got braised pork today.

2018
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,900
Do you still want some?

2019
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,820
Still no reply.

2020
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,300
Little sister.

2021
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,660
Are you really ignoring me?

2022
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,140
During this time,

2023
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,500
she didn't respond for over a month.

2024
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,500
Ai Singing says,

2025
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:07,980
Little sister,

2026
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,500
This is the last time I'll call you sister.

2027
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,460
I once believed

2028
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,860
we were best friends.

2029
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:13,620
My heart ached when you lost your parents

2030
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,700
and became an orphan.

2031
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,580
I always treated you like a sister.

2032
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,340
All you needed to do was call out

2033
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,220
call me "big sister"

2034
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,420
and say thank you,

2035
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,700
and I would have willingly

2036
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,860
done anything for you.

2037
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,860
But all of this

2038
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,860
was just me deceiving myself.

2039
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:28,660
To you, I was just a servant,

2040
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:29,580
a nanny,

2041
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,660
a puppet on strings.

2042
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,020
My compromises only earned me

2043
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,620
your complete indifference.

2044
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,660
I never imagined

2045
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,580
that after the Talent Star competition,

2046
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,420
you'd ignore me like everyone else.

2047
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,420
Your disregard

2048
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,460
has made me

2049
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,500
completely isolated in this school.

2050
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,860
I thought mockery, insults, and discrimination

2051
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,900
were the heaviest burdens to bear,

2052
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,580
but I never realized

2053
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,340
that when everyone ignores you,

2054
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:51,180
this invisible, silent bullying

2055
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:52,580
is like an invisible hand

2056
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:53,620
that's suffocating me.

2057
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,940
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

2058
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:55,980
You killed her.

2059
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,780
Stop it.

2060
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,620
You killed her.

2061
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,540
No.

2062
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,260
You should have died yesterday.

2063
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:04,940
But you're too despicable.

2064
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,620
I can't stand women like you.

2065
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,260
Even if you were my sister, I'd slap you.

2066
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,460
Stop fighting

2067
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,500
You hit me

2068
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,380
She killed your

2069
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,820
childhood sweetheart

2070
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:21,900
Hurry up

2071
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,140
She knew and deliberately approached me

2072
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,020
Or

2073
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,740
She was two-timing

2074
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,180
And spending other people's money

2075
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,300
What did I do wrong?

2076
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,340
I did nothing wrong

2077
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,420
Did I force her?

2078
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,340
When will you finally die?

2079
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,980
No, you all judge who's right

2080
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,180
Did I force her?

2081
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:50,300
Am I the same as those bullies?

2082
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,860
You're taking advantage of her loneliness

2083
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,300
You're exploiting her needs

2084
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,740
The feeling of being needed by others

2085
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,700
You're using her

2086
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,460
Spending her money

2087
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:00,740
No

2088
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,580
Making her take care of you

2089
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:02,460
Break up

2090
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,460
Stop talking

2091
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,300
Break up

2092
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,780
Later she came in last place

2093
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,660
Actually I didn't want to isolate her

2094
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,460
I still wanted to interact with her

2095
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,140
Then I started bossing her around harshly

2096
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,500
That's also a form of bullying

2097
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:20,340
But Raisbeck wouldn't allow it

2098
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:21,300
She said

2099
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,660
If you dare say one more word to her

2100
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,740
I won't let you perform in

2101
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,180
any of my plays

2102
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,780
I had no choice

2103
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,900
I'm not wrong

2104
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,500
It's not my fault

2105
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,300
It's theirs

2106
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,180
A vicious woman like you

2107
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,860
would care about her feelings?

2108
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:38,900
She doesn't care about her feelings

2109
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,860
She only cares about being the lead role

2110
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,820
Right, she just obeyed Raisbeck

2111
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:43,620
Right

2112
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,100
I couldn't help it either

2113
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,820
I was being threatened too

2114
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:48,380
Yes

2115
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:54,020
I was just swaying between both sides

2116
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,620
I didn't do anything particularly vicious

2117
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:05,140
Okay

2118
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,140
Murder motive

2119
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,500
It seems only I have it

2120
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:08,820
Right

2121
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:09,740
Only he

2122
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:12,340
had a clear motive to kill Ruisibai

2123
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,420
But those three were

2124
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,780
somewhat bullying

2125
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,300
the kind that picks on others

2126
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,300
Three bullies

2127
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,220
all got their comeuppance

2128
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,060
From small cracks to large fissures

2129
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,460
I started bleeding all over

2130
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,540
Like being cut with knives

2131
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,860
Then while practicing movements

2132
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,820
suddenly everything turned white

2133
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,020
When I woke up again

2134
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,180
I was eating dragon beard candy

2135
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:37,620
It was bizarre

2136
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,020
Moreover

2137
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,340
I went to the convenience store

2138
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,180
Later in the dorm

2139
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,100
I fell asleep

2140
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,060
After falling asleep

2141
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,460
I suddenly felt

2142
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,860
my nose hurt badly

2143
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:47,740
Then I felt

2144
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,220
extreme pain in my buttocks

2145
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,540
When I opened my eyes I found

2146
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,780
I was by the Wukenai River

2147
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,620
He bullied too

2148
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,180
No

2149
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,900
He didn't have any strange behavior

2150
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,620
But you three all had strange changes

2151
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,180
I didn't intentionally mean to harm her

2152
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:02,500
Right

2153
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,420
Because Xiao Ai recognized him

2154
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,220
That's why it seemed

2155
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,500
he ignored Xiao Ai

2156
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,300
But he didn't realize

2157
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:12,940
We are the bad guys.

2158
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,820
Why did we kill Rui Siba?

2159
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:15,180
Yes.

2160
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,820
Right now, only I have a motive for murder.

2161
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,340
But the bullying behavior—

2162
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,100
I didn’t intentionally—

2163
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,980
take actions to harm her.

2164
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,740
Alright, let’s give you a good persona.

2165
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,220
Later, we’ll make you the killer.

2166
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,380
For now, let’s establish your character—

2167
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,540
build up your heroic moment.

2168
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,740
Then condemn the three of us.

2169
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,100
We’ll talk about the rest later.

2170
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,340
Okay.

2171
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,820
We will now proceed to the X confirmation process

2172
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,820
It's finally your turn, you two

2173
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,740
Will you choose me?

2174
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,660
Please pick me.

2175
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,180
The killing intent is so strong

2176
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:39,060
You're being unusually calm

2177
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:41,820
She's not calm

2178
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,260
She seems somewhat angry

2179
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,700
So Ning Hao chose you, huh?

2180
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,460
Stop pretending

2181
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,340
Little killer

2182
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,500
So you're the murderer

2183
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,020
So this is how it is

2184
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:52,940
That explains it

2185
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,300
Just being this careless

2186
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,980
Pretending nothing happened

2187
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,700
You're acting strange

2188
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,300
You're being weird

2189
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,700
You're using this anger

2190
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,780
And directness to cover your guilt

2191
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,740
Hasn't my anger been obvious all day?

2192
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:10,060
I've been angry since last night

2193
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,380
You're so fake

2194
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,540
How clever of him

2195
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,260
So exaggerated

2196
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,020
Alright then

2197
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,340
Let's go to the victim's room

2198
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,420
Coincidentally, we were roommates

2199
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,020
No problem

2200
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,140
Room 102, let's go

2201
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,580
Let's go inspect the room

2202
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:43,940
Keep an eye on that Bai Yangzuo

2203
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,300
Don't be the last one to leave

2204
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,780
The lights will dim soon

2205
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:03,820
Which one are you?

2206
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,100
This is my bed.

2207
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,060
It's written on it.

2208
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,500
What's going on here?

2209
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,940
Ba Zimei has a beard.

2210
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,940
Look quickly!

2211
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,300
The "Ba"-style beard.

2212
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,420
Who is "Ba"-style beard?

2213
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,460
She's a detective.

2214
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:32,860
This is a girl's bed.

2215
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,540
Sorry.

2216
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,620
What's with this photo?

2217
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:48,620
This is my grandfather.

2218
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,780
And then I...

2219
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:51,580
What's wrong?

2220
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,060
I'm sad.

2221
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,940
Yes, some sad memories are coming up.

2222
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:54,620
Well...

2223
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,020
This orphanage is called...

2224
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,380
Little Star Orphanage.

2225
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:57,900
The orphanage...

2226
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:58,780
Actually...

2227
01:20:58,780 --> 01:20:59,180
Yes.

2228
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,500
I'm an orphan.

2229
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,140
Actually...

2230
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,500
Little Star Orphanage...

2231
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,260
That's right, Little Star Orphanage.

2232
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:09,260
Zhou Keke's orphanage.

2233
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,580
The orphanage where Zhou Keke used to be.

2234
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,340
Keke, which orphanage were you in?

2235
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,300
What?

2236
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,740
I was at Little Star Orphanage.

2237
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,020
It's okay.

2238
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,220
Let her finish first.

2239
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,700
When I was little...

2240
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,140
I grew up in the orphanage.

2241
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:25,700
And this person...

2242
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,340
His name is Ba Zi...

2243
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:28,060
Hu...

2244
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:28,660
Mei.

2245
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,220
No...

2246
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,700
Mei, as in eyebrow.

2247
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,260
He's my grandfather.

2248
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,580
But this grandfather...

2249
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,860
was from the Ba family who adopted me.

2250
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:37,500
The Ba family adopted me.

2251
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:37,820
The Ba family...

2252
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,980
So I became Ba Zimei.

2253
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:41,100
Ba Zimei.

2254
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:41,940
Yes.

2255
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,780
So this is...

2256
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,660
the story behind this photo.

2257
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,420
This was when he...

2258
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,100
adopted me.

2259
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,580
Holding me at the orphanage entrance.

2260
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:47,540
when this photo was taken.

2261
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,140
So she's an orphan.

2262
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,500
I'm an orphan.

2263
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,460
Yes.

2264
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,220
Your adoptive grandfather looks quite like you.

2265
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,780
Let's look for other clues.

2266
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,900
She's strange

2267
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,300
This person is strange

2268
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:10,540
What's wrong?

2269
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,300
Why?

2270
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,580
All her clothing sizes

2271
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,420
are different

2272
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,940
The drawers and such

2273
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,020
The drawers, of course

2274
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,100
Of course

2275
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,340
The drawers, naturally

2276
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:20,740
That

2277
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:21,540
This drawer

2278
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,020
What kind of mechanism is this?

2279
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:29,900
It's not a mechanism.

2280
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,940
I just accidentally knocked it off.

2281
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,020
There's a computer.

2282
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:38,260
Come here.

2283
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:39,300
Okay.

2284
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,500
Watch closely, everyone.

2285
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,580
Let's check QQ first.

2286
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,740
This app is always the most dramatic.

2287
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,340
This is Sisi's QQ.

2288
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:51,540
Log in.

2289
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,020
Who?

2290
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,620
She's chatting with Morning Glory.

2291
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,220
And this is...

2292
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:56,780
Dollar.

2293
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:57,900
Dollar is you, right?

2294
01:22:59,100 --> 01:22:59,860
Dollar.

2295
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,460
Who's this? So cringe.

2296
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,060
This must be him.

2297
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,940
Yesterday's email was from him.

2298
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,020
What's-his-name, Ruohan?

2299
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,580
It's you, right?

2300
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,420
Dollar

2301
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,220
Today's Art Star

2302
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,340
Don't vote for Ai Singing

2303
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,100
or my musical

2304
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:22,580
won't be performed

2305
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,340
Understood?

2306
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,260
This year's Art Star

2307
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,620
Don't vote for Hu Jie

2308
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,020
or my musical won't be performed

2309
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:30,900
Understood?

2310
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,340
Hu Jie is out too

2311
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:33,740
This Ruisibai

2312
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,780
is the one behind Art Star

2313
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:35,740
The mastermind

2314
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,740
On the night of June 3rd

2315
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:41,780
at 11:30 PM

2316
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:42,780
Ruisibai told me

2317
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,100
She asked me to give her

2318
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,180
a personal item of mine

2319
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:46,220
She needed it urgently

2320
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,100
I told her

2321
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,540
I just lost a friend

2322
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,420
can't fall in love again so soon

2323
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:51,420
She said "Don't be narcissistic"

2324
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,460
"I'm creating a play"

2325
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,300
"I need inspiration"

2326
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,020
"As a fellow creator you should understand"

2327
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,060
"What friend did you lose?"

2328
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:56,820
Right

2329
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,020
The one I lost

2330
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,420
The guy who died yesterday

2331
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,860
No, my girlfriend who died

2332
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:02,820
Zhi Daole

2333
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:03,780
The one you killed

2334
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,740
Why are you pretending here?

2335
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,020
I know I killed her

2336
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,420
I'm not denying it

2337
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:11,660
So you're heartbroken

2338
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,220
Zhonghua brand pencil

2339
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,660
Made in China

2340
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:22,020
Retreat to jot down inspiration anytime

2341
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,060
Advance to give autographs anytime

2342
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,700
Can even serve as an eyebrow pencil in emergencies

2343
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:26,940
The most cost-effective stationery

2344
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,500
Bar none

2345
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,580
Every creator

2346
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:30,340
Essential everyday item recommendation

2347
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,060
Exactly

2348
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:31,700
Good

2349
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:33,300
Bring it over now

2350
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,460
Leave it at my dorm door

2351
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:35,620
11 PM

2352
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,740
11:30 PM

2353
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,660
She's just asking us for one

2354
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,100
Our personal item

2355
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,740
Why is she asking you for it?

2356
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:45,260
What's your relationship?

2357
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,660
It says here

2358
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,420
We're just ordinary

2359
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:49,060
Art exchange relationship

2360
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:49,780
Impossible

2361
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:50,660
She asks and you just give?

2362
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,980
And it's personal too

2363
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,660
Look what she said

2364
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:54,660
She said "Give me one"

2365
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,260
I urgently need your personal item

2366
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,260
I just lost a friend

2367
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,340
Can't fall in love so quickly

2368
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,660
I said I don't like you

2369
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,580
She said "Don't be narcissistic"

2370
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,500
I need inspiration for my work

2371
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,180
As a fellow creator, you should understand

2372
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,220
That's how I interpreted it

2373
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,820
I'm such a good creator

2374
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,860
So I said fine

2375
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:10,940
Of course I'll give you mine

2376
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,340
Mention creation and it's all good

2377
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,140
Of course

2378
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,380
Are you two

2379
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,180
Both have some peculiar habits

2380
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,020
One wicked woman

2381
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,100
One perverted man

2382
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:23,580
I'm not perverted

2383
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,540
That was to restrain myself

2384
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:29,420
Everyone,

2385
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:30,820
check your own chat history

2386
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,900
and explain

2387
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,380
where you're going.

2388
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,260
I'm going out for air.

2389
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,060
This is really unusual.

2390
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:39,940
I just can't...

2391
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,980
Let me check mine

2392
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,180
This year's Star of Performing Arts

2393
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,460
Don't vote for Ai Singing

2394
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,820
This was from 2003

2395
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:50,380
I was involved

2396
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,580
Then in 2004 it said

2397
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:53,580
Don't vote for Hu Jie

2398
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,660
Or my musical won't be performed

2399
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,620
Got it, no problem

2400
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,060
You have one too

2401
01:25:59,020 --> 01:25:59,900
Then she told me

2402
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,260
Give me one of your personal items

2403
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:01,780
I need it urgently

2404
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,020
I said

2405
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,260
Huh? What for?

2406
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:03,460
She said

2407
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,940
I want to create a custom play for you

2408
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:07,980
Using your personal items for scenes

2409
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:08,780
Then

2410
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,340
I gave her my shoe lifts

2411
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,460
With personal belongings,

2412
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,460
one can perform rituals.

2413
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,420
What?

2414
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:21,260
Perform rituals.

2415
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,100
To make them transform.

2416
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,140
Rituals.

2417
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,020
Didn't everyone experience hallucinations?

2418
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,140
I looked at the reflection,

2419
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,260
and saw I had become

2420
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,980
a pig-headed human.

2421
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,020
My body,

2422
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,820
arms, legs, back,

2423
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:35,860
everywhere started

2424
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,660
developing small and large cracks.

2425
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,940
I began bleeding all over.

2426
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,540
While practicing movements,

2427
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,580
suddenly

2428
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,220
a white haze appeared,

2429
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,140
enveloping me.

2430
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,500
I tried to escape,

2431
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:49,500
but couldn't.

2432
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,140
I truly couldn't escape.

2433
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,060
No way.

2434
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,220
No, he said it might be

2435
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,220
she needs personal items

2436
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,500
to perform rituals.

2437
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,380
How do you know?

2438
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,220
He said so.

2439
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,340
How do you know?

2440
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,860
They didn't take your things.

2441
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:05,860
Why do you know?

2442
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:09,180
Right.

2443
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,460
Didn't take yours.

2444
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,260
Didn't take mine.

2445
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,700
But I didn't hallucinate.

2446
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,180
You saw pigs hitting walls,

2447
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:17,020
pigs hitting trees.

2448
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:17,780
Those weren't hallucinations.

2449
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,980
They were real.

2450
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:19,780
That was me.

2451
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,220
It was really me.

2452
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,460
He was really hitting the wall.

2453
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,260
Turned into this state.

2454
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,540
This transformed state of his,

2455
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:24,700
is it a curse?

2456
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,500
Look at the morning glories again.

2457
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:32,460
In other words,

2458
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,820
sent to all three of us

2459
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:34,540
Right

2460
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,340
Okay

2461
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,420
Got it, sis

2462
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,060
Yes, sis

2463
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,100
Give it to me

2464
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,380
You also asked for personal items

2465
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,260
Then, okay sis

2466
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:46,060
Sis

2467
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,740
Finally recognizing my talent

2468
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:49,900
My personal item is this book

2469
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,980
"How to Conquer Handsome Young Men"

2470
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,940
I read it devoutly every night

2471
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,220
Then place it under my pillow

2472
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,580
Only then can I feel at ease

2473
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,060
Is this item sufficient?

2474
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:58,900
Sufficient

2475
01:27:58,900 --> 01:27:59,940
Bring it to me now

2476
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,340
Leave it at my dorm door

2477
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:08,820
So what this means is

2478
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:09,820
last night

2479
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:13,100
Ruisibai asked separately about Canary

2480
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,540
me, and that guy

2481
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:15,380
Ninghao

2482
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:16,140
Ninghao

2483
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:17,820
for our personal belongings

2484
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:18,780
And coincidentally

2485
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:20,780
all three of us turned into monsters

2486
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:22,580
Strange things happened

2487
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:23,460
There must be a connection

2488
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,300
Strange things happened

2489
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:24,980
right?

2490
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,340
And what confirms this is

2491
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,700
the three of us saw each other

2492
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,220
going through the monster transformation

2493
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,540
You saw Dragon Beard Candy

2494
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,980
I saw the Gauze Man

2495
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,540
He saw the Pig-headed Man

2496
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,900
This proves it wasn't an illusion

2497
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:37,660
Yes

2498
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,900
Don't even need to hear the evidence

2499
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,780
Xiao X

2500
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:46,780
I've already...

2501
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:51,860
The dorm supervisor just asked me to collect

2502
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,140
the dorm trash

2503
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:54,620
I've already collected from the second-floor dorms

2504
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,820
and Room 101

2505
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:56,980
We'll help you throw it away

2506
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,100
We need to check the trash

2507
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:01,780
Then when you leave later

2508
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:02,980
take Room 102's as well

2509
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:03,700
Okay, sure, thanks

2510
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,460
Thank you

2511
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:05,900
Perfect timing

2512
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,300
Thanks

2513
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,420
True

2514
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:09,260
Come on

2515
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:12,060
Look at this stool

2516
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:13,100
Come here

2517
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:13,820
Whose is this?

2518
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,140
Look first

2519
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:14,900
Wait a moment

2520
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:17,460
This is dorm 201's trash

2521
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,300
Who's in 201?

2522
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:18,820
Ours

2523
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,460
Mine

2524
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,660
Mine and He Dinghong's

2525
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,300
2004

2526
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,260
10 Must-Listen Songs for Music Students

2527
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,460
"Bright Daylight"

2528
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:31,700
"Push Because You Push"

2529
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:32,460
"The Heir of Push"

2530
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,140
"Six-Section Staff"

2531
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,220
"When Love Approaches"

2532
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:34,980

2533
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,820
"Complicated Love"

2534
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,740
"So-Called"

2535
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,540
"North of the River"

2536
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,540
"The First Snow of 2004"

2537
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,380
The first snow of 2004

2538
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:46,980
On the cassette tape

2539
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,860
When we open it, we'll discover

2540
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,780
If you see this message

2541
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,820
It means you're gradually mutating into

2542
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,620
a monster from campus legends

2543
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,460
This is a cursed school

2544
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,500
If you're in this school

2545
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,380
and someone curses you

2546
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,060
then you'll turn into a monster

2547
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:06,820
Yes

2548
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,100
The method of cursing is

2549
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,580
to take the target's personal item

2550
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:11,700
to the secret shrine

2551
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,060
in the night study room

2552
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,540
attach the curse to the personal item

2553
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,060
and the curse will take effect

2554
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:18,860
It's written below:

2555
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:20,340
Why are you doing this to me?

2556
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,460
I discovered I had turned into

2557
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,060
a person with a pig's head and human body

2558
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:31,220
If you place a curse on a personal item

2559
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,500
the curse will take effect

2560
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,580
Ruisi Bai told me

2561
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,780
She asked me to give her

2562
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,260
one of my personal belongings

2563
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:38,300
You were cursed by that person (Ruisi Bai)

2564
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:43,820
This is a 2B pencil, right?

2565
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:44,580
This is indeed a 2B pencil.

2566
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,380
What's written at the bottom?

2567
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:46,860
Pig head.

2568
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,220
Pig-headed humanoid with a drastically increased appetite.

2569
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:53,620
Responds only with grunts.

2570
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,420
Exactly.

2571
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:58,260
This is what I use for creating.

2572
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,580
2B pencil.

2573
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,420
Alright, explain this.

2574
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,380
What's going on here?

2575
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,420
This...

2576
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:07,820
It's a long story.

2577
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:09,540
Last night I...

2578
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:10,860
After turning into a pig-headed humanoid...

2579
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,540
Returned to the dorm.

2580
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,420
Tried to handcuff myself to the bed, right?

2581
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:14,260
When I opened the door...

2582
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,180
I found on the floor...

2583
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:16,580
My tape spread open.

2584
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:17,940
And inside the tape...

2585
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,940
I saw this newly appeared message.

2586
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,540
I knew it was a curse.

2587
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,660
So I followed...

2588
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,060
The instructions on it.

2589
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:27,180
To this shrine.

2590
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,060
Sure enough, I found...

2591
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:28,780
On the pencil...

2592
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,380
Written descriptions of my symptoms.

2593
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:31,700
I thought...

2594
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,300
This Ruisibai cursed me.

2595
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:33,900
But I don't know...

2596
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,100
Why she cursed me.

2597
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:39,980
So you want to kill her...

2598
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,300
To break the curse.

2599
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,500
No.

2600
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,660
You're wrong.

2601
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,060
Listen to me.

2602
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,180
Why I say at this time...

2603
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,140
I don't want to kill her.

2604
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:50,980
Because I need to know...

2605
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:52,340
How to break this curse.

2606
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,740
How to return to my original form.

2607
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:54,820
After all, you've all forgotten...

2608
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:58,100
I'm TYP's hottest pop star.

2609
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,300
When I saw this

2610
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,460
2B pencil,

2611
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,540
my first thought was

2612
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:07,420
that Ruisi cursed me.

2613
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:08,020
But I don't know

2614
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:08,900
why she would curse me.

2615
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,620
We have no grudge between us,

2616
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:12,100
why would she do this to me?

2617
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:12,980
I just want to find her

2618
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:13,980
and confront her -

2619
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,580
why did she do this,

2620
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,980
and how to change me back.

2621
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:18,780
That's the logic.

2622
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:20,140
What you just said

2623
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,420
is really flawless,

2624
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:23,220
as if it was memorized.

2625
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,140
When did you get the tape?

2626
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,700
The tape was when I turned back into a pig-head.

2627
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,940
Turned back into a pig-head.

2628
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,140
No, turned into a pig-head.

2629
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,220
Got the handcuffs.

2630
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,500
It was something I found after returning to the dorm.

2631
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,820
You know when I sleep,

2632
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:43,860
I sleepwalk out.

2633
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,020
Turned into a pig-head.

2634
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:45,620
Before I slept,

2635
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:46,940
This thing wasn’t here yet.

2636
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:50,660
Next

2637
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,860
Which room is this for?

2638
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,060
This one

2639
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:52,860
101

2640
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:53,780
Whose room is 101?

2641
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,500
Mine

2642
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:55,540
Yours

2643
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:56,260
Yes

2644
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,100
This is

2645
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,900
Strong tea, strong tea, strong tea...

2646
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,460
It's written below

2647
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:01,860
If you see this message

2648
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,460
It means you're gradually becoming

2649
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,940
Just the same conversation I had with him earlier

2650
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:08,260
Then she drank a packet

2651
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:09,580
To refresh herself, right?

2652
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,380
Right

2653
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:13,940
Because I accidentally ate dragon beard candy yesterday

2654
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,140
I couldn't vomit it out

2655
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,900
I could only brew some strong tea

2656
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,580
To cut through the grease

2657
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,140
So I drank this tea

2658
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,180
Before going with the matron for room inspection

2659
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:24,900
But then

2660
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,180
After I returned from room inspection

2661
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,620
I saw an extra line of text

2662
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,580
Someone cursed me

2663
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:33,140
Who is she?

2664
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,100
I'm so resentful

2665
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,380
I did nothing wrong

2666
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:38,780
Did you go?

2667
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:40,180
The shrine

2668
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,940
I went

2669
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,500
Is it here?

2670
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,780
"How to Conquer Handsome Boys"

2671
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,420
Yes

2672
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,140
You read it yourself

2673
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:49,060
I think you'll read it with more feeling, go ahead

2674
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,980
To conquer handsome boys

2675
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:56,460
A good first impression is crucial

2676
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,100
In our education

2677
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,980
The basic way to make a first impression

2678
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:02,460
Is to always show your good manners

2679
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,100
When facing handsome boys

2680
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,380
You can call him "brother"

2681
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:09,300
Call him "brother" in different tones

2682
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,420
Brother

2683
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,140
Help!

2684
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,060
When facing handsome young men,

2685
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:25,260
you must be very sweet-tongued

2686
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,380
to gain their attention

2687
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,340
and future prospects.

2688
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:31,780
I've been hit!

2689
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,780
Hit!

2690
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,460
So the reason you're so sweet-tongued

2691
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:41,060
is because you keep eating dragon beard candy, right?

2692
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:42,940
To make your words extra sweet.

2693
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,180
Yes, brother.

2694
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:44,940
So then?

2695
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:52,300
Turned into the monster behind the white curtain,

2696
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,460
lost control of my body.

2697
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:56,820
Let me explain:

2698
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,100
Ruisibai asked me for

2699
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,300
this personal item,

2700
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,780
so I went to give it to her.

2701
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,420
Then I ate some dragon beard candy,

2702
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:03,260
and when I returned I noticed

2703
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:04,820
an extra line of text on this tea.

2704
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:05,500
Exactly.

2705
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,380
The shrine...

2706
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,180
I must go investigate.

2707
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:10,340
Then I saw my notebook placed there,

2708
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,780
with symptoms of this curse written in the back.

2709
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,940
Someone is definitely trying to harm me.

2710
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,140
That person is

2711
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:18,580
Ruisibai!

2712
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:21,460
I can't eat even a bit of sugar,

2713
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:22,740
yet she made me eat candy.

2714
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:25,060
I'll kill...

2715
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:26,260
That's going too far.

2716
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,460
I just want to figure out

2717
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,140
You two are basically the same

2718
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,060
Gave personal belongings

2719
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:36,980
Then after being cursed

2720
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:37,980
Turned into monsters

2721
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,220
Okay

2722
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,140
Next

2723
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:43,620
Come on

2724
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,300
I'll open this myself

2725
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,260
This is mine

2726
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,420
Height-increasing insoles

2727
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,340
This tall

2728
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:54,700
So that's why

2729
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,420
So that's how you're so tall

2730
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:03,740
Because I myself

2731
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,660
am 1.67 meters tall

2732
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,180
so to maintain 1.77 meters

2733
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:09,140
I have to walk on stilts every day

2734
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:16,020
That's too much

2735
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,220
This...

2736
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:22,860
What is this?

2737
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,820
Same as what was said before

2738
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,380
If you're reading this text

2739
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,500
it means you're gradually becoming

2740
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,860
the monster from campus legends

2741
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:32,340
Here

2742
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:33,340
The note is here

2743
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,900
Bleeding all over

2744
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:36,860
In unbearable pain

2745
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:38,020
Forever repeating

2746
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,860
This is her curse on me

2747
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:42,860
So I became that person covered in

2748
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:44,220
wounds and bleeding

2749
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:45,500
and in unbearable pain

2750
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,580
forever repeating

2751
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:47,860
Basically the same as your stories

2752
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,380
She used

2753
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:49,660
she also asked for my personal item

2754
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:50,860
My shoe lifts

2755
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,980
were my personal item

2756
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:52,980
I gave them to her

2757
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:54,100
But the problem is

2758
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,020
when I returned to my dorm I found

2759
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,060
I had originally wrapped myself

2760
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,260
with bandages, right?

2761
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:59,020
Then I got better

2762
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:00,340
After recovering, I returned to my room

2763
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:01,220
Back in my room I discovered

2764
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:01,860
that on these bandages

2765
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,140
someone had written a line

2766
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,980
the same words as yours

2767
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:05,660
Yes

2768
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:06,860
Then I went to that place

2769
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,460
and retrieved my shoe lifts

2770
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:09,780
Three identical stories

2771
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:10,500
Exactly

2772
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:15,740
Look

2773
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:16,660
I turned into a pig's head

2774
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,460
because I gave that guy (Hu Jie)

2775
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,420
the nickname "Piggy"

2776
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,820
Have your symptoms matched up with

2777
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,820
anything you've done to someone?

2778
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:24,100
Something similar?

2779
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:27,180
No

2780
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,060
I only remember when I was little

2781
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:31,220
I choked on dragon beard candy

2782
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,420
on the white sugar coating

2783
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:34,900
Here's

2784
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,420
the logic I want to explain

2785
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,260
It goes like this

2786
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,060
Whether it's my bandages

2787
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,100
your tea leaves

2788
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:44,220
or your cassette tape

2789
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:46,220
Someone came

2790
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,100
to tell us the truth, right?

2791
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:48,580
Right

2792
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:52,820
So who is this person?

2793
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:54,420
I think it's the one who cursed us

2794
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,300
What?

2795
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,260
Respect

2796
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:58,260
Respect told you

2797
01:37:58,260 --> 01:37:59,260
she cursed you?

2798
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,460
How do you know

2799
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:01,780
it was Respect who cursed you?

2800
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,860
Because she asked for your personal items

2801
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:04,380
Yes

2802
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,340
But how can you prove

2803
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,580
that she was the one who attached these things

2804
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,700
to the shrine?

2805
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,780
But we just placed them

2806
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:10,300
at Respect's

2807
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,700
Someone hacked Respect's QQ account

2808
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:17,780
to contact us privately

2809
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:18,260
We only

2810
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:19,420
left our personal belongings

2811
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:20,500
at her dorm room door

2812
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:21,180
not handed them to her directly

2813
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:21,940
Exactly

2814
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:24,260
Did you see it with your own eyes?

2815
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,820
Then it must have been me

2816
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,140
Possibly

2817
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,100
Because the Tweet Empire

2818
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,900
has this QQ account (service)

2819
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:41,340
The Tweet Empire was established in

2820
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,220
October 2001

2821
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,460
and developed services like thesis rewriting

2822
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,740
and QQ account theft

2823
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:47,580
Yes

2824
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:48,900
You can hack others' QQ accounts

2825
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:49,740
Correct

2826
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,460
But then why

2827
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:53,180
What proof do you have that it's not Ruisi?

2828
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:53,860
Then what proof do you have

2829
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:55,020
The proof is that

2830
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,780
It's possible now.

2831
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,460
Should we go to the shrine?

2832
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:08,340
That might be better.

2833
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,260
The night study room, right.

2834
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,580
Alright, let's go there first.

2835
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,340
Let's go.

2836
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:15,020
We're going to the shrine.

2837
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:16,100
We might find out then.

2838
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,620
Under maintenance, no entry.

2839
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:20,420
Let's take the other stairs.

2840
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:23,140
Follow me.

2841
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,140
You know your way around.

2842
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,100
This feels like it's going to be scary again.

2843
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,380
It's time for the roundtable meeting again.

2844
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,100
Friends,

2845
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,300
This is the "spell-casting" site.

2846
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,500
Six are done.

2847
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,180
Six.

2848
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:57,340
Perfect, let's pick one and sit down.

2849
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,180
Then let's all give it a try together.

2850
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:00,540
We're about to begin.

2851
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,620
Come on.

2852
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:05,060
My heart is already beating a little fast.

2853
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,100
No

2854
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,500
Let's wait a moment first

2855
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,380
What's the point of us sitting down?

2856
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:15,820
I don't know either

2857
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,740
Of course it's to rest

2858
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:18,620
First let's...

2859
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,380
Right, I forgot

2860
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,420
Evidence collection

2861
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:30,620
What we discovered

2862
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,980
The night study room's secret is too important

2863
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,100
I'll use our group's

2864
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:35,300
note-passing contents

2865
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:36,540
to create a password lock

2866
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:38,220
Nobody tell anyone else

2867
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:39,580
Several passwords

2868
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:41,300
They're letter codes, right?

2869
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:43,780
Oh my, there's more than one lock

2870
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:48,900
The study room's notes

2871
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,180
Drew a circle

2872
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,260
The first one

2873
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:06,180
Ah Niu 7758258

2874
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,060
53880

2875
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:10,180
3155530

2876
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:13,900
Second is Ah Hua

2877
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,460
00544

2878
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:17,100
44944

2879
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,700
Just try it then

2880
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:19,820
I'm so mad

2881
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,980
Mad mad mad at you

2882
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:26,060
Then, darling

2883
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,180
987

2884
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,380
3166

2885
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,580
What does 987 mean?

2886
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:35,780
987

2887
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,780
Just won't go

2888
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:39,260
No

2889
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:40,900
That's not right either

2890
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,500
Darling just won't go

2891
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:49,020
What does Orz mean?

2892
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,140
It's that kneeling down

2893
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,380
Falling like this means

2894
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,340
The kneeling emoji

2895
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:57,180
Sorry, possibly

2896
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:58,220
I'm sorry

2897
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:03,980
Kiss me, love me

2898
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:07,500
I'm only 880

2899
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:11,580
I want to hug you

2900
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:12,740
Let me hug you

2901
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:14,100
Right, 880 means hug you

2902
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:14,660
Right

2903
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:15,220
Isn't it?

2904
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:16,980
So you remember this means hug?

2905
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:21,340
Then what does 0 mean?

2906
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:23,700
0054

2907
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,260
Let me try what it means

2908
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:31,460
Try to move me

2909
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:34,020
Move me

2910
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,500
Zero seven

2911
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:38,860
Try to move me

2912
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:39,900
Try if you dare

2913
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:40,780
This makes me furious

2914
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,820
So angry

2915
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:46,500
Then it's this

2916
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,820
Green means move

2917
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,380
Right

2918
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:50,300
Hug or move?

2919
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:56,780
What about that combination lock?

2920
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,940
The lock has 5 digits

2921
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:00,180
And a 4-digit one

2922
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,620
Isn't this red and green?

2923
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,580
Does this mean hug?

2924
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:06,180
This means move

2925
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:06,900
Hug move

2926
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:08,900
Hug move

2927
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,180
But there are five of them

2928
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:23,660
Isn't it right here?

2929
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:24,340
Just this line, right?

2930
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,260
Isn't this BO

2931
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:26,460
BAO is correct, right?

2932
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:28,700
D

2933
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,740
Next is still green

2934
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:37,900
NG

2935
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:41,700
Black represents BU

2936
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:45,420
Alright

2937
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,540
What is this thing

2938
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,820
Safety matches

2939
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:08,500
Come on

2940
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:11,700
Begin the spatial transfer ritual

2941
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:13,700
Sit, come here

2942
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,260
You go first.

2943
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:20,580
I saw Sisi earlier.

2944
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:22,180
She entered the night study room just ahead.

2945
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,180
I followed right behind her.

2946
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:24,980
But the room was completely empty.

2947
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:26,700
She couldn't have gone to

2948
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,820
the school's abandoned space, could she?

2949
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:29,580
That's right

2950
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,140
Can we use "The Strange Tales of Tuiyi"

2951
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:33,020
to open the abandoned space?

2952
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:33,940
Exactly

2953
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:35,340
Sit in the night study room

2954
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:38,140
Place candles on the circular marks on the table

2955
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,060
The lights will go out

2956
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:41,380
After lighting the candles in order

2957
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:43,460
Recite "The Strange Tales of Tuiyi"

2958
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:45,900
And the door to the abandoned space will open

2959
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:49,100
Got it

2960
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,780
Alright, let's take this

2961
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,780
and the moment we plug it in

2962
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:58,620
the lights will go out

2963
01:44:58,620 --> 01:44:59,700
That's the first step

2964
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:02,380
Then we'll light it with matches

2965
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:04,580
Each person will light it in turn

2966
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,540
and recite the Ghost Story of Tuiyi

2967
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:08,620
Here, one for each of you

2968
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:12,540
But we only have 6 people

2969
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:13,180
We only have 6 people

2970
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,220
There are 7 in total

2971
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,260
Um...

2972
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:15,780
There will be...

2973
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,620
Someone will read the 7th one

2974
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,780
A head pops out

2975
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,140
Kick it down

2976
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,140
Whack-a-mole

2977
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,540
It's already set up

2978
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:33,180
It's fine

2979
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,780
This was expected

2980
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:36,660
Alright

2981
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:42,420
Why are we playing this?

2982
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:57,740
Ready

2983
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,500
Whoever reads last might...

2984
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:04,660
It's okay, Sis Li

2985
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,420
You've got someone sitting beside you

2986
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:10,620
Your hands are shaking

2987
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,620
It's fine

2988
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:16,940
Just hold on

2989
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:27,500
Quickly give me a candle

2990
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:37,140
Alright

2991
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:38,340
Like this

2992
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:39,420
Give it to me

2993
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:41,060
Can you see it like this?

2994
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,180
3 2 1

2995
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,300
Don't go, don't go, don't go

2996
01:47:59,180 --> 01:47:59,940
Come, follow me

2997
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,340
Come

2998
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:03,500
This is so scary

2999
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,780
This revolving door is single-person passage only

3000
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:06,620
Then we might end up

3001
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:07,660
in different places

3002
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,460
There are so many in the abandoned toilet

3003
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:17,620
monsters

3004
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,020
Let's go quickly

3005
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,900
Is this a confinement room?

3006
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:26,700
Wow, blood handprints

3007
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:27,980
So much blood on this bed

3008
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:28,700
What does it signify?

3009
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:32,580
He's extremely suspicious

3010
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,260
These two time periods happen to be

3011
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:35,140
perfect for committing murder

3012
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,620
Actually, we're all the same

3013
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:37,780
We all had the same opportunity

3014
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,820
In fact, everyone had the chance to do it

3015
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,940
Today we just need to find Rui Sisi's

3016
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:42,820
killer and that's it

3017
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,060
Why do you immediately think

3018
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,820
I'm correct about this?

3019
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,860
Are you also playing the

3020
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:47,940
particularly clever killer strategy?

3021
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,860
If you're going to play like this

3022
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:49,700
then I'm sure it's you

3023
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:51,740
It might not be him
