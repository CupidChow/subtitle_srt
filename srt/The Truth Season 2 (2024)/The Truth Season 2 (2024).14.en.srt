1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Very handsome

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,200
Not bad

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,360
Piece of cake

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,160
Come on, let's evaluate

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,480
Start the wheel

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,760
Lake

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,400
Almost up to the neck

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,080
West

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,560
Still thinking

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Still hesitating

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,360
Okay, let's try again

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,800
"Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk"

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,520
"Wild Grass"

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,320
"Hot Wind"

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,200
"Storm in a Teacup"

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,040
"Village Opera"

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,080
"From Hundred-Plant Garden to Three-Flavored Study"

18
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,680
I've got the right connections

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,280
Come on, big boss

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,960
Better to mistakenly "eliminate" a thousand

21
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,000
Than let one slip away

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,440
Let's start with twenty

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,280
Thought about it

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,840
Two is a bit too few

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,480
Nine bucks

26
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,360
Just give me twenty

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,480
Final offer: eight

28
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Deal

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,320
Number three

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,720
Speak

31
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,280
You can have them all

32
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,880
They formed an alliance

33
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,400
We have no friends

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,920
Brothers, we meet again.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,720
Cut.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,360
Cut.

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,200
Welcome to

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
"Let's Start Thinking!"

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,560
This is Tuizhen Town's

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,920
century-old renowned pharmacy

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,240
Thinking Hall.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,960
As for me,

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm the assistant to the Hall Master.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,200
Cui Shaoyang.

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,560
Now let me introduce our

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,640
eight apprentice physicians.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,680
Please greet everyone in turn.

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,320
Let's fill the gaps

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,560
and form a line up front.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Today we should also discuss

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,760
your personal expectations

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,840
and goals for this session, okay?

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,240
Hello everyone,

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm Yang Zongyu,

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,920
last session's acting Hall Master.

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,520
It was a great experience,

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,400
and I'll strive to retain the title.

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,400
Hello everyone,

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,920
I'm Huang Kai.

60
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,160
I'll also compete for Hall Master this session.

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,160
Hello everyone,

62
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm Wei Xiaolong.

63
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,640
I too have my eyes on

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,160
the acting Hall Master position.

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,360
Hello everyone,

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm Hou Zhuocheng,

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,600
the best football-playing physician in Thinking Hall.

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,000
Hello everyone,

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm Hu Minghao,

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,120
currently a law student.

71
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,640
Hello everyone,

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm actor Dong Zifan.

73
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,440
Our goal today is simply

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
to dethrone last session's acting Hall Master.

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,680
Hello everyone

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm Ren Yinpeng

77
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,960
This time I'm still taking an unconventional approach

78
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
Growing stronger with each battle

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Good

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Yu Haoyang, come here

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,040
I

82
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,880
What should I say

83
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
This time

84
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,720
In this episode, I

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Will definitely retain my

86
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,920
position as acting hall master

87
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,640
Though I don't seem very confident

88
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:31,920
But

89
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
One two three

90
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
Next time let's be more "chuunibyou", okay?

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,600
Okay

92
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,480
I'd like to ask

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
Those who want to be hall masters

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,440
What's your core philosophy?

95
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,680
Handsome photos, I guess

96
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Is this person really that superficial?

97
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,800
Alright, let me try again

98
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,800
Gourd

99
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
It's fine, you don't need to do it again

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,560
Now then

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,040
Let's get to the main topic

102
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,400
First, I should explain to everyone

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
And introduce to the audience

104
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,800
The rules for competing to be acting hall master

105
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
Alright, to motivate everyone,

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
this time we'll

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
first reveal the brain power enhancement service

108
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,680
which greatly relieves stress and strengthens willpower -

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
the foot massage exercise.

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,640
As for the second one,

111
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,800
it's the ultra-motivational body tempering

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
butt stick training.

113
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,640
Seems more interesting than last session.

114
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,720
I'd like to try it.

115
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,200
I'd like to try it.

116
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,920
Alright, brother

117
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,080
I'll grant your wish

118
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,280
Okay, we'll now proceed to

119
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,680
the teammate selection phase

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
Who wants to go first?

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,960
Show your ambition.

122
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,720
I will.

123
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
But I don't have much ambition.

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,480
I just want to fight.

125
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,880
Alright.

126
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,280
So our order...

127
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,400
will be decided by the first one to finish.

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
They'll choose the second.

129
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,640
Okay.

130
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,480
Then let's invite student Hu Minghao.

131
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,840
Let's step back a little.

132
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,360
Step back.

133
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,120
To avoid accidental harm.

134
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
Okay

135
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,400
Maybe it was the wind

136
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
Missed it

137
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,960
Very handsome

138
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,640
But it didn't hit

139
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,200
Do you want to try again?

140
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,720
Sure

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,880
Can't try anymore

142
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,240
Alright

143
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
Then you'll pick the next one

144
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Who will shoot?

145
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,120
Understood

146
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,360
Watch me

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,520
The pose is cool

148
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
Don't just copy mine

149
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Impressive

150
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,640
As expected of the "Divine Dragon"

151
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,520
Incredible

152
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,600
Come

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,440
Nine cups

154
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,720
Nine cups

155
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah, piece of cake

156
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,400
You're making this awkward for me

157
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,000
No problem, your pose looks cool.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,520
Yes.

159
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Next shooter, step up.

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,160
It's broken

161
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,240
Here we go

162
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
This is kinda cool

163
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,760
The current record for most one-hit KOs

164
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Eight taken down in a single strike

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,280
Come on

166
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,360
Show it

167
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,240
White Tiger's Den

168
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,440
White Tiger (Den)

169
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,000
Three

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This one is three

171
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
Temporarily ranked first

172
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Right now my mind

173
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,000
Has already learned everything

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,680
But I don't know if my hands

175
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,560
Have learned it or not

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
This posture is effective

177
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,080
Suddenly confident

178
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
How should I put it

179
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,200
Handsome

180
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,520
How should I say

181
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,280
Not bad

182
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,000
Ren Yinpeng

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,280
This time I want to try something new.

184
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,760
It's still up to you to decide.

185
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,160
Brother Huang Kai, do you want to come with me?

186
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,640
Yes.

187
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,600
Right, you can only come with me now.

188
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,960
So domineering.

189
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,520
Come on, let's stand together.

190
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
Wei Xiaolong, ranked second.

191
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,840
Hu Minghao.

192
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,760
Dong Zifan, who hit five targets.

193
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
My turn.

194
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,440
Hou Zhuocheng.

195
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Hou Zhuocheng.

196
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,560
Congratulations to our original team.

our Yang Zongyu and Yu Haoyang

Huang Lian.

208
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Why do you want Huang Lian?

209
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Because I want to be mute.

210
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,400
Don't want to talk.

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,480
Just kidding.

212
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880

213
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,680
what's really behind Huang Lian.

214
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,480
The doctor can't hold back.

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,320
What lakes are in your southwest?

272
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't know what lakes are in the southwest

274
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,480
Is it over?

275
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,840
It stopped spinning

276
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,520
Congratulations to our Clinic Three

I'd like to interview Dong Zifan and Hou Zhuocheng

283
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,600
When the bandage reached where just now

284
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
Did you have a moment

285
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,120

286
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480

It's a bit

319
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,000
a little painful

320
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,640

Right, Western Zhou originally had

394
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,440
West

395
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,520
Good

396
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,200
This round of assessment has concluded

397
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,120
Now please doctors

398
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,520
Come with me indoors

399
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,040
We'll continue the assessment

400
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,200
Let's go

401
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,640
Which medicine card should we choose this round?

402
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,520
Which medicine card should we choose this round?

403
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's pick Bai Zhu.

404
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,040
Bai Zhu's challenge is:

405
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,400
"Physician's Formation Duel."

406
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,920
Has anyone here played Chinese checkers before?

407
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,560
Yes.

408
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,640
Ren Yinpeng.

409
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,520
Do you have any insights about Chinese checkers?

410
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,480
All the pieces.

411
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,160
If they land in the opponent's starting positions.

412
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,920
That counts as a win.

413
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,120
This is the same principle.

414
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
What everyone needs to pay attention to is.

415
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
Whether it's mild tonic potions.

416
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Or potent elixirs.

417
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,720
After each movement.

418
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,800
They will flip over.

419
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,760
Alright, everyone gets one minute

420
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,560
to discuss tactics.

421
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,120
The game rules are about

422
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,600
how to conserve moves

423
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,280
to quickly

424
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
make leap jumps.

425
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,280
We can't go one by one,

426
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,600
we must advance together.

427
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:25,960
We must advance together.

428
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,520
Right.

429
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:26,880
Right?

430
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
Thinking one move at a time.

431
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
Let's consider the first move -

432
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,960
which would be most suitable.

433
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
The core is moving forward,

434
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,280
moving forward.

435
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,440
If you want the first move,

436
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,360
how would you take initiative?

437
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,000
I'd think about how to defend.

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,120
There's no way to defend.

439
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,160
This game doesn't allow defense.

440
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,480
Are you awake?

441
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,400
Come, first let's determine

442
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,960
the first clinic to participate in the battle

443
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Clinic Two will take the lead in the battle.

444
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,800
Which clinic

445
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,440
will face off against Clinic Two?

446
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,960
Let's take a look at the wheel.

447
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,880
Congratulations to Clinic One

448
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,480
Successfully matched with Clinic Two

449
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480
Clinic One goes first

450
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,080
He takes a step forward

451
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,520
We take a step forward

452
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,600
He can jump over us

453
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,600
Can't jump that way

454
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,880
I think we can jump diagonally

455
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,520
But we won't follow him

456
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,200
Jump diagonally together

457
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,840
We can mirror it

458
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,440
No takebacks in chess

459
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,560
The clinic's

460
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,400
is still very swift

461
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,040
First, administer warming tonics

462
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,360
Why?

463
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,080
Move diagonally to the center

464
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,920
That jump

465
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,560
That flip, keep jumping

466
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,520
Go

467
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,800
Charge straight in

468
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,280
Then move this forward

469
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
But they can move away

470
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,280
If he moves away, it'll cost him a move

471
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,520
Come over here

472
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,760
Okay

473
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,800
Upper

474
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,480
Two clinics strategically

475
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Were crafted by the same master

476
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
If we go this way,

477
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,440
we can jump two later.

478
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,200
I think

479
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,440
We need to let this middle one pass through

480
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,960
We need someone to act as a bridge for it

481
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,720
Move this teapot

482
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,400
diagonally across

483
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,080
That way when he jumps over

484
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,000
we can jump over too

485
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Now it's more evenly matched

486
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,880
We can jump too

487
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,160
Yes, of course we can

488
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,240
Watch the flip

489
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,880
Yes, jump

490
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,200
Just focus on attacking

491
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,360
No need to think about defense

492
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,600
Go, let's go first.

493
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,280
We'll just wait for him to move.

494
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,760
When he moves, we'll take position.

495
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,440
When he moves, we'll occupy.

496
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,600
Alright.

497
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,240
Moreover, we can...

498
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,200
First, let's take this move...

499
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,960
and postpone it for later.

500
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,760
This...

501
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,680
Let's occupy first.

502
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,280
Secure the base.

503
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,040
Then we'll take the second one too.

504
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,320
Right?

505
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,840
Hold position.

506
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,280
Good.

507
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,720
Then next, let's take that...

508
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,760
Move that needle over.

509
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Is it that needle?

510
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,080
Can place it there.

511
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,640
Because that needle...

512
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,560
can move anytime.

513
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,480
We can figure out a way...

514
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,120
to move our lagging pieces...

515
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,000
those two at the very bottom.

516
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,560
Yes.

517
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,320
Right, we have to wait for them.

518
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,880
But they're not moving.

519
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,440
We have nowhere to jump.

520
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,880
They'll definitely move on this side.

521
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,680
Black is slightly ahead.

522
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
Let's go discuss this.

523
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
How to discuss?

524
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,520
Just our thoughts.

525
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,400
Come on.

526
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,880
Look, it's just

527
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,360
Don't let them see

528
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,480
They've made up their minds

529
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,360
Right, they have some

530
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,120
strategies against you

531
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,200
Not convenient to discuss here

532
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,120
We don't have any strategies

533
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,280
How are they targeting us?

534
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,560
Just some petty tricks

535
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,280
We'll have some too

536
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,720
Do we have any tricks?

537
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,800
Not for now

538
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,080
Come

539
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,760
Move this over here

540
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,400
This one can go over

541
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,400
Okay

542
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,800
Right, don't let him jump.

543
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,760
They're starting to block him.

544
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,800
Okay

545
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,480
This one goes forward

546
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,240
This teapot can't go anywhere

547
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,120
Yes, good, that works

548
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,200
Nice

549
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,640
If we leave now,

550
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,120
he can't jump, right?

551
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,520
I feel this move right now

552
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
is a bit awkward

553
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
They've outmaneuvered us

554
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,360
This occupies

555
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,800
Occupies

556
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,360
Here

557
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,520
Immediately responded

558
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,640
Immediately responded

559
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,840
Take apart the one in the middle

560
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,560
Yes, once it flies out

561
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
we can leave

562
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,240
We're always one step ahead of him

563
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,200
Once it comes out, we go in

564
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,600
Black was just ahead

565
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,760
Now Red has the advantage

566
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,760
Red has already... you know

567
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,160
It feels like

568
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,880
They're ready to win

569
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,040
It's clear - Red

570
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,200
The current situation is

571
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,520
Bridges are getting fewer

572
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,600
Give it to them, let them come out

573
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,960
Let's get this over there first.

574
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,880
The Go Prodigy

575
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,440
The Go Prodigy

576
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,040
The Go Prodigy has gone through

577
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,640
Got too excited

578
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,600
Started celebrating early

579
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,720
No, it's just time to sing

580
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,840
Calculate the number of steps.

581
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,200
One step, two steps, three steps, four steps.

582
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,640
Four steps—he can win in four steps.

583
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
We can't win in four steps.

584
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,360
We can't get past this point.

585
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,920
The Go Player

586
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,640
It's over

587
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,080
No matter what move we make, they'll win

588
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,680
Consultation Room 2

589
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,320
Are you willing to forfeit voluntarily?

590
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,120
Even if we don't give up, they've already won

591
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,880
Your strategy

592
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,240
Can you explain it in detail?

593
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
This game has only two principles

594
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,840
The first principle is

595
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,800
to maximize your own flexibility

596
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,560
The second principle is

597
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,800
to minimize your opponent's flexibility

598
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,720
We can also jump

599
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,560
Yes, of course you can

600
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,680
Watch the flip

601
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,520
If we move away from this

602
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,040
He can't jump then, right?

603
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,640
Let's begin, start right away

604
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,280
Let's go with this first

605
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,040
Right

606
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,440
Then I'll...

607
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,240
Go

608
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,720
Keep moving forward

609
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,880
There shouldn't be any issues

610
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,840
Take this path, go straight ahead first

611
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,000
It's really fast

612
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,160
Don't even need to time it

613
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,160
This should be released quickly

614
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,040
I think we should place this here

615
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,240
It's fine, trust me

616
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,000
Just take this directly

617
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's go forward first

618
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,800
This way...

619
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,480
Let him build the bridge

620
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,640
We should go forward first

621
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,240
Just take this path

622
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,160
Go straight

623
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Why not take this way?

624
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,760
Move these two

625
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,080
It's fine

626
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,680
If this one leaves, it can still come back here

627
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,760
If it leaves here, it can still return here

628
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,560
Just take this one

629
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,400
Do you believe me?

630
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,360
I don't know.

631
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,960
I'm not sure.

632
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,560
Fine, I'll listen to you.

633
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,880
"Slingshot Tactic"

634
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,600
It already has a name.

635
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,560
Our tactic.

636
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,720
"Slingshot Tactic"

637
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,000
Dong Zifan crossed his arms again.

638
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,320
I need to learn it.

639
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
One more goal

640
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,840
Later, let's take this one first

641
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,800
This one goes first

642
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,840
Move

643
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,400
Move

644
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,240
Keep moving

645
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,560
Don't move

646
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,000
Let me think about this middle one

647
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,840
This middle one

648
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,560
Think about it

649
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,200
If we don't move, he will

650
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,920
Indeed, if we don't move, he will

651
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,320
This one comes first

652
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,880
Should it come over?

653
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,880
Okay

654
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,280
Go straight from here to here

655
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,800
Shall we go?

656
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,480
We currently have six warm supplements

657
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,440
Actually, warm supplements are quite useful

658
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,760
Warm supplements can be moved freely

659
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,120
Maybe we should go this way first

660
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,080
This one goes here

661
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,880
The strong ones can't come over

662
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,280
We can go this way

663
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,520
Go

664
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,320
Let him in

665
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,440
Then go straight here

666
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,280
No problem, right?

667
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,360
If you go here, we'll move forward

668
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,120
Okay

669
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,080
No problem now

670
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,800
No problem

671
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,600
This really isn't a problem

672
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,440
We have no issues now

673
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,960
They're all teapots

674
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,440
Can't move

675
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,960
Wait a moment

676
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,960
Our side

677
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,200
If we make this move

678
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,320
That one gets left there

679
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,720
This one stays here

680
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,880
Yes, this is a good move

681
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,680
This is a good move

682
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,520
Let me see how good this move is

683
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,240
These two pieces can't move at all

684
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,320
Your move

685
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,080
Just move here

686
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,960
Move here

687
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,280
Just make the move

688
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,480
How to move?

689
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,200
Just move here

690
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,080
Okay, how do we go now?

691
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,160
He's so handsome

692
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,120
Just move this one here and jump

693
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,880
Where did he jump to?

694
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,360
Ignore him.

695
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,160
Sorry to interrupt.

696
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,880
Stop fighting

697
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,880
We'll go first

698
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,800
This one goes first

699
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,600
Yes, this one stops here

700
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,440
That's right

701
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,480
Come on

702
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,040
We're already done

703
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
You're already finished.

704
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,040
We're really done for.

705
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,600
Three steps.

706
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,040
If you don't make three moves,

707
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,720
we'll win.

708
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,440
It's reversed.

709
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,120
No reversal.

710
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,040
We've had the upper hand all along.

711
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,680
So cocky.

712
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Just a matter of time.

713
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,040
Let's finish this quickly.

714
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,880
So arrogant.

715
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,440
Just a matter of time. Let's go.

716
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:49,920
No

717
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,560
Look

718
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,000
Let me tell you

719
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,280
I jump here

720
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,760
Jump here

721
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,520
From here to here

722
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,440
Jump here and it's done

723
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,920
We really can't move anymore

724
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,400
First, let's give applause

725
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,200
To our Clinic Team Four

726
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,880
Now, I'd like to ask first

727
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,960
Student Yu Haoyang

728
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,560
Why are you so confident?

729
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,240
First accumulate potent pills in the center

730
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,280
First place this here

731
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,600
Then jump over here

732
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,200
There's already a simple bridge here

733
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,800
Then at this moment

734
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,120
Accumulate another potent pill

735
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
Store these two here

736
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,560
Take this

737
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,720
It's like a slingshot like this

738
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,520
Launch it out

739
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,880
Then this one comes back

740
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,840
Then launch again

741
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,480
Our strategy has only one approach

742
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,440
Move the warming tonic pills to the center

743
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,480
Move this here

744
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,320
This one jumps over

745
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,680
We're essentially a slingshot

746
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,560
Okay

747
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,360
Then I can

748
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,880
Keep sending pieces here continuously

749
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,440
I think this is

750
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,720
The only best opening move

751
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,360
Applause

752
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,960
Indeed

753
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,080
This really requires

754
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,440
Great wisdom

755
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,880
Congratulations to Clinic Team Four

756
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,800
We will now proceed with

757
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,520
our third round of assessment

758
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,360
This time, we'll choose the semi-fright approach

759
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,800
For example, if the answer is two characters,

760
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,200
you can write an idiom or phrase for it.

761
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,320
Use a space.

762
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,240
For instance,

763
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,320
"sunshine."

764
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,920
"too what."

765
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,240
Then I would

766
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,760
If the answer has several characters,

767
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,040
I'll indicate secretly

768
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,880
with a number.

769
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,760
roughly how many characters.

770
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,800
Got it.

771
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,440
The first clinic to compete is

772
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,560
Clinic One.

773
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,200
Come on.

774
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Huang Kai directly chooses

775
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,960
Clinic Two, Three, or Four.

776
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,640
Who do you want to face?

777
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,960
Let's pick Clinic Three.

778
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Okay, Clinic Three.

779
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,640
The question is this:

780
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,360
When writing public hints,

781
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,400
also consider

782
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,160
that this thing

783
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,280
should best let your teammates know

784
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,880
while keeping the opponents guessing.

785
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,000
They've finished writing their public hints.

786
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,600
Public notices don't lie, right?

787
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,480
Do public notices deceive or not?

788
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,320
You need to judge for yourself.

789
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:08,760
Next group for us.

790
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,840
We don’t rely on intuition at all.

791
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,440
Then let's be honest

792
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,520
and sincere.

793
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,040
Just write the answer directly here,

794
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,120
and we'll see if we believe it.

795
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
Hard to guess

796
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,360
Forbidden

797
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,920
Alright, now your entire body

798
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,800
Stop breathing

799
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,160
I'm getting the feeling

800
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,960
Suddenly felt a surge of energy

801
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,640
What do you think?

802
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,640
When you're confident

803
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,360
It really makes a difference

804
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Wait a second

805
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,320
Come on, Kaikai

806
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,960
Three

807
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,680
Two

808
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,760
One

809
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,880
Please reveal your answer boards

810
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,880
Congratulations to Clinic Three

811
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,280
for successfully increasing brainpower by 20%

812
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,880
That wasn't easy

813
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,760
20%

814
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
What does this mean?

815
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,560
Morse code

816
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,320
They must have their own schemes.

817
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
They must have their own plans.

818
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,680
Whoever wins this round

819
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,920
will directly obtain

820
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,400
victory in this assessment

821
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,760
Three

822
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,960
Two

823
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,800
One

824
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Please show your answer board

825
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,680
Congratulations to Clinic Two

826
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,720
for winning this round of assessments

827
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,920
Now, can you explain this?

828
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,160
This is one of our codes

829
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,440
Twenty-six letters

830
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,880
Letters

831
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,880
I've thought of a way

832
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,160
The sequence in the alphabet

833
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,320
abcdefg

834
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,840
Arabic numerals are single-digit

835
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,720
Single-digit

836
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,520
Simplified uppercase is

837
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,160
Tens place

838
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,800
The tens place is one's tens place

839
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,360
Traditional-style uppercase

840
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,440
Is two's tens place

841
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,080
Four is d, five is e

842
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,680
Yes, that's right

843
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,640
As for this "big three"

844
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,840
It corresponds to the alphabet's

845
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,480
Twenty-third position

846
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,600
Right, this is "wan"

847
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,240
As per tradition,

848
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,280
Following the usual practice,

849
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,560
we need to flip the sign on this medicine cabinet.

850
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,920
We'd like to see the peony flower.

851
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,840
Is that possible?

852
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,160
The peony flower, right?

853
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,480
Yes.

854
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,840
Alright.

855
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,480
Let's see what happens.

856
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,280
What's the peony's challenge?

857
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
The physician's scheme.

858
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,680
Board game time

859
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,480
Now let's determine

860
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,440
which clinic

861
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,240
will be our first round manager

862
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,840
Each clinic sends one representative

863
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,400
to play rock-paper-scissors

864
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,800
until we have a final winner

865
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,720
Come on

866
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,600
Rock-paper-scissors

867
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,720
Okay

868
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,000
Clinic two is eliminated

869
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,320
Go

870
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,600
Alright

871
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,200
Next

872
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,920
we'll start with clinic three

873
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,840
proceeding clockwise for drawing and delivery

874
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,400
Let's go

875
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,640
Better to mistakenly "eliminate" a thousand

876
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,240
than let one slip through

877
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,320
You draw

878
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,640
Alright everyone, check your cards.

879
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,880
Let's see ours.

880
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,360
You think they'll inspect us, right?

881
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,480
No problem.

882
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,520
Whether to inspect these two is tricky.

883
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,080
I think...

884
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,120
There's no need to transport.

885
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,400
Let's go.

886
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,640
Transporting four mountain berries.

887
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,400
Bribe?

888
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,840
No bribe.

889
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,360
Inspect these four mountain berries.

890
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,720
Very sincere.

891
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,680
Four mountain berries.

892
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,800
Two times four is eight.

893
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,280
Boss, pay eight silver coins.

894
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,920
No, actually I...

895
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,760
Didn't want to inspect you at first.

896
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,600
But what you declared...

897
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,160
Is just too absurd.

898
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,960
Very sincere.

899
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,480
Next.

900
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,640
We're transporting...

901
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,000
Three raw rivers.

902
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,760
And one more...

903
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,200
Let me see what to choose...

904
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,440
Add a ginseng then.

905
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,840
We won't bribe.

906
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,440
Scammers, they're here to scam.

907
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,200
Why not inspect when they have ginseng?

908
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,160
Why not inspect this?

909
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,720
They all have rare items.

910
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,680
Let's try for another ginseng.

911
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,280
If there's ginseng, we'll definitely open it.

912
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,320
Why aren't you checking?

913
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,600
Come on, open it.

914
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,920
Open it and let me see.

915
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,760
No ginseng.

916
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,720
If we open it and find rare herbs,

917
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,320
you have to pay me.

918
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,680
Then we'll consider this passed.

919
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:23,960
Right?

920
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,280
Common herbs are acceptable.

921
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,000
This is just the deduction amount, right?

922
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,200
We have two hawthorns,

923
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,520
one Tianshan snow lotus,

924
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,280
and one quisqualis.

925
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,320
But we're bribing you.

926
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,040
What's your ideal price?

927
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,720
Ten dollars.

928
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,440
Ten dollars is acceptable.

929
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,240
Ten dollars.

930
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,760
Ten dollars is a bit much.

931
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,160
The fine should only be eight dollars.

932
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,480
Right.

933
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,760
Eight dollar fine, but the problem is

934
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,240
with eight dollars, these two would be confiscated.

935
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,360
Their value is higher than that.

936
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,600
No, I mean

937
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,720
let's not just look at the numbers.

938
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,320
Do us a favor now.

939
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,800
Don't forget we're the fourth ones.

940
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,440
So that's eight dollars.

941
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,920
But let's be friends,

942
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,600
make it seven.

943
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,640
What's one dollar difference?

944
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,160
Seven is acceptable.

945
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,520
Seven.

946
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,880
The chief manager moved to examination room four

947
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,800
We are "unscrupulous merchants"

948
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,160
We hope everyone will bribe us generously

949
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,480
Shengjiang

950
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,680
One Shengjiang

951
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,600
One Shanzha

952
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
One Chenpi

953
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,600
And one more

954
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,080
Shijunzi

955
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,640
We choose to bribe

956
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,760
How much to bribe?

957
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Four coins

958
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,040
Reasonable

959
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,400
What do you think?

960
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,760
Unreasonable, five coins

961
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,640
Okay, five coins

962
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,640
Friends in Consultation Room 2

963
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
Two hawthorns and one tangerine peel

964
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
No bribery

965
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
What's the point of opening three common ones?

966
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,800
Just open them

967
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,320
Two hawthorns and one tangerine peel

968
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,800
Even if they're all common

969
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,640
We only need to compensate six yuan

970
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,640
But if he has rare ones

971
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,680
Then

972
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,440
So what's your decision?

973
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,200
We'll follow you

974
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,800
Open

975
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,640
Open

976
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,720
Then compensate

977
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,520
No loss

978
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,840
Next, number three

979
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
We'll transport

980
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,240
One hawthorn

981
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,280
One raw ginger

982
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,320
And two ginseng roots

983
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,960
We're willing to offer

984
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,040
Ten yuan as bribe

985
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:15,920
Eight

986
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,760
Eight

987
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,720
They can earn sixteen

988
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,320
Let's open it

989
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,080
But I think

990
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,280
There shouldn't be two ginseng roots

991
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,040
Because in the whole deck

992
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,560
There are only two ginseng roots total

993
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,680
I think we should just take the bribe and leave

994
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,720
That works too

995
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,520
Eight

996
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:29,960
Agreed

997
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,160
The chief manager arrived at Clinic One.

998
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,240
Who bribed us?

999
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,360
Hurry.

1000
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
Hand over the goods.

1001
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,480
We're figuring out how to pay you.

1002
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,280
Give whatever you think is fair.

1003
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,080
Any amount is acceptable.

1004
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,040
One Longkui.

1005
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,920
One Jiansuefenghou.

1006
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,640
Three bundles of hay.

1007
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,080
One Shengjiang.

1008
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,960
We've invested everything.

1009
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,560
You still have Jiansuefenghou.

1010
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,880
But although Jiansuefenghou is rare,

1011
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,440
its value isn't that high.

1012
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,040
Right?

1013
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,720
So we're willing to give you

1014
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,840
the fine money instead.

1015
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,560
No

1016
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm certain

1017
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,320
Absolutely

1018
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,040
What's your basis?

1019
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,760
You replenish cards quickly

1020
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,960
so he can transport more goods

1021
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,320
Even if he transports ordinary goods

1022
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,480
transporting more ordinary goods

1023
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,360
would still fetch higher prices than ours

1024
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,480
Will you go all in later?

1025
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Yes

1026
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Good, we have a disagreement

1027
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,040
Conflict

1028
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,840
So we decided

1029
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,080
whoever wins gets their way

1030
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,520
What's the conflict about?

1031
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,440
He wants to take bribes

1032
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,240
I don't

1033
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Do you completely refuse

1034
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,160
or do you think it's too little?

1035
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:39,880
I refuse

1036
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,880
Three, two, one

1037
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,080
Three, two, one

1038
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:45,840
Okay

1039
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,640
Check

1040
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,320
Three plus eight is eleven

1041
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,040
Confirmed

1042
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,960
Business is tough these days

1043
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,400
Come on

1044
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,560
We haven't yet

1045
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,200
What's up

1046
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,800
So it's just you two playing?

1047
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,640
Sorry about that

1048
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,920
Trying to win back right away, huh?

1049
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:10,760
Come

1050
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,320
Three Chenpi

1051
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,720
One Shijunzi

1052
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,960
Then I choose to bribe you

1053
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,720
I'll give you five

1054
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,600
You won't lose out

1055
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,680
Don't you have nothing now?

1056
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,600
Yes

1057
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,320
Three rare cards

1058
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,360
Very risky

1059
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,720
We've already

1060
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,320
angered one group

1061
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,360
If we anger another group

1062
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,120
We won't be able to do business

1063
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,200
Come

1064
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,080
Okay, wait a moment

1065
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,440
Did Huang Kai make a concession?

1066
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,320
Can concede

1067
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,760
So originally you thought

1068
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,280
If we concede

1069
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,160
Maybe there's a chance

1070
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,480
They might complete three rare cards

1071
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,920
Then they could take a huge lead

1072
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,920
So your final choice is

1073
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,680
I'll follow your lead.

1074
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,800
What just happened?

1075
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,480
It's nothing.

1076
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,320
Check.

1077
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,920
Three Chenpi.

1078
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,680
One Shijunzi.

1079
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,400
No.

1080
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,880
Did he open it wrong or right?

1081
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,400
Just now.

1082
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,520
Opened correctly.

1083
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,680
No.

1084
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,000
As long as it's rare, you can open it.

1085
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,200
If the boss opens it, we definitely won't lose.

1086
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,360
Right, exactly.

1087
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,720
You need to consider your bribe amount.

1088
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,280
Is it enough to sway him?

1089
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,800
Make him feel that even if you give more,

1090
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,760
it's still worth it.

1091
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,680
No problem, sway them.

1092
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,520
Boss.

1093
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,760
Let me report to you

1094
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,200
about our cargo shipment.

1095
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,000
We plan to transport

1096
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,840
two Shengjiang,

1097
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,280
two dry grasses and one Shijunzi.

1098
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,640
Currently before us,

1099
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,600
there are no rare herbs.

1100
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,800
So we've decided

1101
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,040
to pay a five-dollar bribe.

1102
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,840
What do you think?

1103
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:40,960
What's your opinion?

1104
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
I think...

1105
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,120
Right.

1106
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,080
Start whispering.

1107
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,120
Brother Huang Kai.

1108
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,760
Brother Huang Kai.

1109
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,240
Brother Huang Kai.

1110
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,920
Brother Huang Kai.

1111
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,400
Open.

1112
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,040
Open.

1113
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,160
Pry the door open.

1114
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,840
You decide.

1115
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,720
Open it

1116
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,040
Then you opened the right one

1117
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,800
Opened correctly

1118
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
Hand it over

1119
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,320
Alright, the chief manager is very anxious

1120
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,760
Let's start with twenty

1121
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,160
Thought about it

1122
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,600
Two Shengjiang

1123
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,160
One dry grass

1124
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,080
One Shanzha

1125
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,680
Then give a two-yuan bribe

1126
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,400
Anyway, you have rare ones inside now

1127
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,560
Or maybe not

1128
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,600
Bet you'll fine him when opened

1129
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
Two

1130
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,120
Two is a bit few

1131
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,720
Won't give

1132
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,160
Won't give three either

1133
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:31,800
Not giving

1134
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,520
Not giving even one

1135
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,720
Just open it, nothing more to discuss I think

1136
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,320
Open it

1137
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,720
Two Shengjiang

1138
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,280
One dry grass

1139
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:37,920
One Shanzha

1140
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,640
Very honest

1141
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,360
Thank you

1142
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,040
We have two Shanzha, one Shengjiang

1143
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,320
Two Shanzha, one Shengjiang

1144
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,640
They don't have any rare ones now

1145
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,640
They might have saved up three

1146
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,760
Saved three (rare) herbs to transport together

1147
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:52,840
Open it

1148
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,560
Open

1149
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,240
Congratulations, the gamble paid off.

1150
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,920
He was lying.

1151
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,560
One mountain card.

1152
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,720
One.

1153
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,720
Shengjiang.

1154
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,280
There's still one Shi Junzi card

1155
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,480
Currently, I have

1156
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,880
the most Shengjiang cards

1157
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,680
That one could get fifteen

1158
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,080
We're willing to give you four

1159
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,160
Fifteen and you give us four?

1160
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,280
You just took more than ten from us

1161
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,000
You just took over ten from us

1162
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,040
Show a little more sincerity

1163
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,360
Let's both show some sincerity

1164
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,960
My lawyer

1165
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,920
We're both law school graduates

1166
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,720
Let's discuss the terms

1167
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,640
Calculate the value

1168
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,880
Our current offer is this

1169
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,800
We'll temporarily take ten from you

1170
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,320
Plus an agreement

1171
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,880
You'll let us go next round

1172
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,400
What do you think?

1173
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,040
We'd prefer one less

1174
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,720
Nine

1175
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,320
Nine plus you don't target us next round

1176
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,960
Right

1177
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,880
Nine... no

1178
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,720
Brother Huang Kai has been "ruling behind the curtain"

1179
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,440
"Pulling strings from behind"

1180
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,840
Then I think you shouldn't target us

1181
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,160
We might actually benefit

1182
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,480
Our losses might be smaller

1183
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,600
Final offer: eight

1184
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,040
Eight plus you don't target us next round

1185
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,720
Then how about this

1186
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,080
Next time

1187
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,440
You won't target us either

1188
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,640
Round for round

1189
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,200
Sincerity for sincerity

1190
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,480
Deal

1191
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,360
Wait

1192
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,200
How can you guarantee

1193
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
You won't target us next round?

1194
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,760
On our honor

1195
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,680
Here's what: you

1196
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,920
Are you willing

1197
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,040
to put these twenty in the middle

1198
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,960
as collateral

1199
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,120
Is this how law works?

1200
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,920
Alright, let’s not say more

1201
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,360
Just—

1202
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,000
no more talking

1203
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,240
Okay

1204
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,400
Right, no more

1205
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,400
The contract’s signed

1206
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,240
Can this be placed here?

1207
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,400
It looks very uncomfortable to me now.

1208
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,680
It should be placed in this spot.

1209
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,720
Next, let's welcome the chief manager

1210
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,200
to our third consultation room

1211
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,920
We're going all in

1212
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,360
Two Tian Shan Xue Lian cards

1213
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,040
Two pieces

1214
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,480
Shi Junzi

1215
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,120
One Long Kui

1216
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,160
One Chen Pi

1217
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,040
Five rare items

1218
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,760
One common medicine

1219
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,840
How much should we offer?

1220
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,920
We'll give you everything we have

1221
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,560
So you directly

1222
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,000
invested all the money

1223
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,360
They should be three Shijunzi

1224
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,480
Give it all to us, okay.

1225
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,720
We all profit, we all benefit.

1226
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,280
I have it.

1227
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,920
I've got it.

1228
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,520
Directly obtain this.

1229
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,200
Thirty-four.

1230
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,520
Good, that's acceptable.

1231
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,640
Do those three Tian Shan study bonds still hold value?

1232
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,640
Not really.

1233
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,080
We're at a loss.

1234
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,080
We've lost out.

1235
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,000
Next round we'll treat you as

1236
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,200
You'll be the shopkeepers

1237
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,080
We'll offer the highest price

1238
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,520
They've formed an alliance

1239
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,160
I think it's quite obvious

1240
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:13,880
Don't hold any

1241
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,040
hope for them anymore

1242
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,120
Next

1243
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,080
Who's next?

1244
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,680
We have one Shijunzi

1245
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,280
One Longkui

1246
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,680
One Shengjiang

1247
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,520
And one

1248
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,560
Chenpi

1249
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,800
His Shengjiang is about to max out

1250
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,760
Directly give you 15 for Shengjiang

1251
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,720
All to you

1252
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,600
Just give me 20

1253
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,320
Too much

1254
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,040
Not much

1255
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:32,720
17 then

1256
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,560
How about 18

1257
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,200
Let's not haggle over small amounts

1258
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,520
Then 18 it is

1259
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,200
Okay

1260
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,320
Alright

1261
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,360
Longkui

1262
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,520
Next clinic

1263
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,120
Three dry grasses

1264
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,000
One Shanzha

1265
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,560
Will you choose to bribe?

1266
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,320
Not a single cent

1267
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,840
Not giving anything

1268
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,600
No payment

1269
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,280
Let's pass

1270
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,920
Let's be friends

1271
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,960
Now you want to be friends?

1272
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,520
We have no friends

1273
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:56,960
No friends

1274
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,640
Friendless

1275
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,840
Truthfully

1276
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,480
Fine

1277
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,640
Then move on your own

1278
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,320
Two Shengjiang

1279
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,400
One Shanzha

1280
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,520
Nothing

1281
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,440
Not worth opening

1282
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:12,920
Won't open

1283
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,720
Pass

1284
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Thank you

1285
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,840
We have one Shengjiang

1286
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,080
Two bundles of hay

1287
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,720
Then bribe with eight

1288
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,880
We're doing this too

1289
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Small

1290
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,040
But you already have two

1291
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,200
And the Shijunzi hasn't been revealed yet

1292
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,880
If in your hands

1293
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,320
For example, if you had two Shijunzi

1294
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,920
How much would you earn?

1295
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,640
Thirty

1296
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,840
What do you think?

1297
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
We don't think it's much

1298
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,840
Let's open and see

1299
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,680
Then open it

1300
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,880
Then the delivery failed

1301
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,360
We made a profit

1302
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,440
We have three Shengjiang

1303
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,040
Three Shancha

1304
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,960
Then we'll bribe you

1305
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,760
How much?

1306
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,520
Twenty

1307
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,440
Deal

1308
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,440
Clinic One

1309
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,440
Two dry grasses

1310
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,160
Two Shengjiang

1311
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,920
One Longkui

1312
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,800
One Tianshan study romance

1313
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,320
Let them pass

1314
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,400
Let them pass directly

1315
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,880
Not even a bribe

1316
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,800
We keep our word

1317
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,240
We'll accept the loss

1318
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,720
They've collected three Shijunzi

1319
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,800
We

1320
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,240
Transport two pearls

1321
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,200
Then one Shengjiang

1322
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,280
One Chenpi

1323
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,480
Bribe twenty

1324
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,080
I think

1325
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,880
The last two rounds

1326
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,880
Are both our turns

1327
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,040
Don't let their rarity increase

1328
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:44,880
Open

1329
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,960
Two Longkui

1330
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,680
One Shengjiang

1331
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,680
One Chenpi

1332
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,320
Then these two are losses

1333
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,400
One Shanzha

1334
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,440
Two Shengjiang

1335
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,120
One dry grass

1336
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,280
Two Chenpi

1337
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:55,960
Open

1338
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,960
Not lying

1339
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,200
Such good luck

1340
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,320
Compensation of twelve silver coins, shopkeeper

1341
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,160
The final round of trade begins

1342
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,320
Number three

1343
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,280
Speak

1344
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,040
We

1345
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,200
One Shengjiang

1346
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,760
One Shanzha

1347
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,400
And then one

1348
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,080
One Lingzhi

1349
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,400
And then two Chenpi

1350
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,320
Five pieces

1351
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:23,840
A fine of five dollars

1352
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,760
I'll give you six

1353
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,120
Not a penny more

1354
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,520
But

1355
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,800
Then we won’t take that one, forget it

1356
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,280
And all these are correct

1357
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,360
Why does he have three Lingzhi?

1358
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,640
If he passes,

1359
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,520
the value is twenty-seven.

1360
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,040
Luckily he didn't.

1361
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,000
Fifteen.

1362
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,960
Two hawthorns.

1363
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,680
Two raw rivers.

1364
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,720
One sunken hide.

1365
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,240
I don't believe it, show them.

1366
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,840
Show.

1367
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,520
Honest and simple.

1368
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,480
What kind of luck is this

1369
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,720
to draw so many common cards?

1370
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,280
Here, you owe ten silver coins.

1371
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,080
We didn't get that many the whole game.

1372
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,600
We won't say anything.

1373
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,440
Listen first.

1374
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,880
Two sunken hides.

1375
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,920
One hawthorn.

1376
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
One raw river.

1377
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,680
One pet grass.

1378
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,560
One long sunflower.

1379
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,000
Total is half the profits.

1380
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,520
Agreed.

1381
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,080
Split it half and half.

1382
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,640
Six pieces.

1383
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,160
Agreed.

1384
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,080
Take six.

1385
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:47,200
Alright

1386
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,640
Alright

1387
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,280
Next

1388
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,680
we’ll compile the data from each clinic

1389
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,680
to see how much mental energy has been collected.

1390
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,040
The second time

1391
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,360
About to become acting hall leader

1392
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,400
Do you have anything to say to each other?

1393
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,280
He is a

1394
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,920
player with a great gaming mentality

1395
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,240
He's always been like this

1396
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,800
Okay

1397
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,120
Like this

1398
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,760
And when I have suggestions

1399
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,400
He basically

1400
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,560
always listens to me

1401
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,680
I feel like I'm the type

1402
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,160
of rather unstable player

1403
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,440
So we actually complement each other well

1404
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,800
I feel like I

1405
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,200
don't overthink things

1406
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,040
Usually I just

1407
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,400
take things one step at a time

1408
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,640
But Yu Haoyang seems

1409
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,000
to quickly

1410
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,560
come up with strategies

1411
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,640
And he adjusts promptly

1412
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,640
based on everyone's performance

1413
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
Never expected

1414
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,360
that after round three

1415
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,400
Clinic 3 would be ranked last

1416
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,760
Yet after one round

1417
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,640
they escaped the brainpower enhancement service

1418
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,200
Regarding this

1419
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,760
do you two have anything to say?

1420
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,520
We feel like we're hitting our stride

1421
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,720
Because our scores now

1422
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,640
are really close together

1423
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,880
Yes, very happy

1424
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,400
Hope we can keep this up next time

1425
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,200
Now

1426
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,640
comes this episode's most solemn

1427
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,360
and grandest ceremony

1428
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,640
That is

1429
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,400
the Acting Hall Master inauguration

1430
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,600
Let me personally bestow this upon you two

1431
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,000
So now they each have two gourds

1432
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,320
Come

1433
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,760
We meet again

1434
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,080
What a coincidence

1435
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,520
Thank you

1436
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,480
This feels familiar

1437
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:36,480
Come

1438
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,000
Now, let’s all move outside

1439
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,920
For some mental stimulation

1440
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,120
Where to hit?

1441
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,040
There’s a mic here

1442
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,520
Hit the butt

1443
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,200
And you broke the mic in one go

1444
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,960
Anything else you’d like to say?

1445
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,120
About to be offended again

1446
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,800
Offended

1447
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,640
Last time was the front

1448
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,760
This time it’s the back

1449
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,400
I’ll remember

1450
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,040
The feelings you gave me

1451
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,520
Okay

1452
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,000
I heard everything

1453
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,520
He said thanks to our "Start Using Your Brain"

1454
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,320
Come

1455
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,680
How much is this?

1456
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,160
95.9

1457
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,560
Only 4.1 away from 100

1458
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,040
Is this acceptable?

1459
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,880
97.4

1460
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,560
Still 2.6 short

1461
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,480
Heavens

1462
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,320
99.4

1463
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,360
Only 0.6 short

1464
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,040
Is he doing this on purpose?

1465
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,600
A wolf in sheep's clothing

1466
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,560
What do you want to say to Huang Kai?

1467
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,680
I'll do my best

1468
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,360
You'll do your best

1469
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,520
He'll hold back

1470
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,240
104.7

1471
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,360
Are you ready, Ren Yinpeng?

1472
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,640
That's it for now.

1473
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,000
Come on.

1474
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Wait, there's a mic.

1475
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,240
You touch his butt first.

1476
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,040
Okay.

1477
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,760
This definitely isn't enough

1478
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,960
It's actually 94.2

1479
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,200
Only 5.8 away from success

1480
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,320
He just stood the staff upright

1481
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,480
He's going to slash you

1482
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,880
in half in a moment

1483
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,480
Waist-cut! Oh my!

1484
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,720
No, I just wanted

1485
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,880
Let me try, Brother Huang Kai

1486
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,920
Please bear with it for a while

1487
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,200
Okay

1488
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:39,920
Okay

1489
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,800
Okay

1490
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,480
Congratulations, 102.2

1491
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,080
This method is more straightforward

1492
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,040
Yes

1493
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,000
Now then

1494
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,800
it's time for our

1495
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,440
foot massage premium service

1496
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:54,960
Come on

1497
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,680
Let me do it

1498
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,400
Before we officially begin,

1499
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,120
Wei Xiaolong

1500
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,080
How do you feel?

1501
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,160
Comfortable

1502
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,360
One

1503
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,320
Hot feet, huh?

1504
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,680
I can't speak right now.

1505
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,440
He's not talking.

1506
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,440
Go, Wei Xiaolong, go!

1507
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,360
Two

1508
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,680
One more to go

1509
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,480
Three

1510
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,840
Perfect

1511
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,000
Is Minghao okay?

1512
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,400
No sensation

1513
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,840
Actually, this looks

1514
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,760
quite sharp and dense

1515
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,560
Not bad

1516
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,560
Yeah, not bad

1517
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,440
Actually, foot massage doesn't feel like much

1518
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,840
So today's value-added service

1519
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,200
comes to an end here

1520
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,760
I'm still very grateful

1521
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,960
to today's eight physicians

1522
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,320
Let's all witness together

1523
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,920
a high-quality battle of wits

1524
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,200
The path of medicine is long

1525
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,960
Looking forward to seeing everyone

1526
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,400
return to challenge again after gaining experience

1527
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,680
for the acting Sect Leader position

1528
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,720
Finally, wishing the acting Sect Leader a smooth term

1529
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,680
May the Brainstorm Hall's reputation grow daily

1530
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,600
Alright

1531
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,400
So this episode of "Let's Start Brainstorming"

1532
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,040
is coming to an end

1533
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,640
See you next time

1534
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,680
Goodbye

1535
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:50,760
Goodbye

1536
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:51,600
Physicians who drank plain water

1537
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,800
Physicians who drank plain water

1538
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,280
will form a clinic together

1539
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,800
You got "magma" three times in a row

1540
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,400
Tone down the veins a bit

1541
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,040
Crying, Brother Huang Kai

1542
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,120
You're all acting

1543
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,040
It's really just plain water

1544
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,760
Another familiar assessment

1545
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,920
There are two self-proclaimed "chess kings"

1546
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,760
The divine dragon "1" move keeps appearing

1547
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,440
Four words for everyone

1548
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,800
"Return to the arena"

1549
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,880
If you play this, won't you be ready to win?

1550
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,760
Then you'll block, right?

1551
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,040
Should we block?

1552
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,400
We're one step too late

1553
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,120
Can't block anymore

1554
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,720
Come on, the "god" of show effects

1555
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,840
He's specifically blocking us, right?

1556
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,760
Just happened to have time to check over there

1557
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,280
Hoist with his own petard

1558
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,400
Locked "tight"

1559
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,560
What else can we even do?

1560
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,000
This is driving me crazy

1561
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,160
You're surrounded

1562
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,160
Not necessarily

1563
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,720
Truth will always come to light
