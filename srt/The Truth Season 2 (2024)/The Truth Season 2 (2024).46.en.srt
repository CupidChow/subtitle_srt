1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's discuss how to divide this.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,200
Who said we're discussing with you?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,480
We'll take it ourselves.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,680
This is the only way.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,760
Become his stepping stone.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,800
Why would you say that?

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,200
Genius.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,720
I feel like we're being blocked by three parties.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,560
Let's push one out.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,280
Spread out, I'll go first.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,800
Here.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,400
They ran.

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,920
Two blacks.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,000
This goes against human nature.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,960
I think this is impossible.

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,560
This is crazy.

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,040
If you come over, he'll consume you.

18
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,760
It's over.

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,520
Is the pressure this intense?

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,960
Fine, you win.

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,160
Do the first two have any 2s?

22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,000
No.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,920
Actually, yes.

24
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,160
Very close now.

25
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,200
Both sides are very close.

26
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
Good, it's very clear now.

27
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,080
Why is it always missing?

28
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Our three-to-one guess.

29
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,520
Seems like we've never guessed right.

30
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,840
Prediction failed.

31
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,240
He's choosing between two, right?

32
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,960
But not necessarily.

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,840
What if you guess correctly this time?

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
Leave it to fate.

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Let's start brainstorming

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,000
Brainpower unleashed

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,960
Welcome to

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,120
"Let's Start Brainstorming"

39
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,520
I'm today's apprentice physician at Brainstorm Hall

40
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Acting Hall Master Hou Zhuocheng

41
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,320
Because our hall assistant Cui Shaoyang

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,880
and our intern physician Ren Yinpeng

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,000
offended me in previous episodes

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,880
So I sent them away

45
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
for external training

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,680
Therefore today I'll be

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,640
handling some of the assistant's duties

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,600
which means I hold all the power

49
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,720
There are 7 physicians including myself

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
who will participate in this episode's

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,200
election for Acting Hall Master

52
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,120
Long time no see, everyone

53
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,560
In the blink of an eye, it's already 2048

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
This is a brand new year

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,480
full of expectations and challenges

56
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,160
Now Chinese culture leads the latest trends

57
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,520
That's why today all our physicians

58
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,480
are dressed in neo-Chinese style

59
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,000
showcasing our cultural confidence

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
Times are changing

61
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,640
but our evaluation rules

62
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,440
remain unchanged

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,640
So for this episode,

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
our brain enhancement service

65
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,440
is what?

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,200
Facial cell vitality enhancement lasting for eons

67
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,280
Vitality boost

68
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,240
Facial massage

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,160
The second is

70
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
Preservation lasting for eons

71
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,880
Full facial imprint memory enhancement

72
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,160
Memory boost

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Right

74
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,880
It's basically a facial mold

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
I think it collapses like this

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,560
That's how it can last for eons

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,040
During our previous 7 team formations

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,520
Did anyone have someone they wanted to team up with

79
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,160
but missed the chance to?

80
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,440
Or someone you've teamed with before

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,320
but would love to team up with again?

82
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,840
I think my collaboration with Brother Kai last time

83
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,720
was extremely enjoyable

84
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,360
Great, I'd like to team with Brother Kai again

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,840
Yes, we can work with Brother Kai again

86
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,360
to strive harder

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,920
to achieve first place again

88
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,720
to accomplish great results again

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
1 million

90
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,440
Absolutely

91
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,200
I feel that with Zifan

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
last episode

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,040
there was a bit of regret

94
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,440
so I think

95
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,680
we can strive harder

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Okay

97
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Today our autonomy

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,520
is back in your hands

99
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
As long as you can win

100
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,880
the upcoming magic cube competition

101
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,240
you can choose your desired teammate

102
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,920
Because there are seven of us

103
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,960
So today one doctor

104
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,400
will have to fight alone

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
meaning one person per team

106
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,840
Oh my goodness

107
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
Let's get ready and begin then, come on

108
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Why are you laughing?

109
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,000
Is someone done tightening it?

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
No, I'm checking it.

111
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,200
Not very patient, to be honest.

112
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,800
Our Zongwei is number one

113
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Is it tightened properly?

114
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,840
Alright

115
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Okay, our second place goes to Xiaolong

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,840
First and second places have been decided

117
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,360
That's enough

118
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,840
Okay

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,880
Our third place goes to Kaikai

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
It's all done

121
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Are we going to keep playing until night?

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
Hurry up, Haoyang

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
Up, up, right

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
Down

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
Left, up, left, 180

126
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
Alright

127
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,200
Not bad

128
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,880
Now all four of you have

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,280
the opportunity to choose teammates first

130
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,080
In previous episodes

131
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,000
I haven't teamed up with Brother Zifan

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's pick Brother Zifan

133
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,680
Okay

134
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,960
Brother Kai, what do you think?

135
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's achieve great results again

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,960
Sure

137
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,320
Then let's go with Brother Kai

138
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,040
Good

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,680
Let's choose Minghao

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,880
The fourth consultation room naturally becomes

141
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
our hall master's (assistant)

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Today

143
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll be acting on behalf of the hall master's assistant

144
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,480
to perform the first medicine card selection

145
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,880
assessment duty in 2048 years

146
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,040
We can choose one

147
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,640
Which one would you like to choose?

148
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Eight Beans

149
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,680
Good, then Eight Beans it is

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Eight Beans is the medicine box storage battle

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,000
Seems like we've played this before

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,640
We have

153
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,280
This seems familiar

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
It's that time we suffered a crushing defeat

155
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,200
We still have one way out

156
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,600
You're really trapped now

157
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,120
Then we'll arrange it according to

158
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,360
Consultation Room 1, Consultation Room 2

159
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
Consultation Room 3, and then Consultation Room 4

160
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Let's do this

161
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,240
Can we go this way?

162
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's check theirs first.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Look first, then place.

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,160
Like this, right?

165
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,480
Okay.

166
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,200
We can do the same as them.

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Place it parallel, right?

168
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,880
Then let us choose who to block.

169
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
Then you're being too passive.

170
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,560
Place it parallel.

171
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,440
He can block both of us.

172
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,800
At the same time.

173
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,200
Yes, and we started symmetrically.

174
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,520
You're being too passive.

175
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
How about this?

176
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,280
Is this okay?

177
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,040
Whatever, it's fine.

178
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,120
Then let's do this.

179
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
Then I think...

180
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,360
We can try another one.

181
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,200
I think this vertical one is...

182
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,960
Can we do this?

183
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Anyway, just try to...

184
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,000
Extend upward more.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,440
Right.

186
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,440
Then let's go.

187
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,360
Placed.

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,080
Let's go.

189
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,120
Alright

190
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
Brother Hou, if you want to discuss it

191
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,560
I can discuss it with you too

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
Sure, Long

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Take a look

194
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,560
Come take a look

195
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Let's take a look

196
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,840
Wait a moment

197
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,400
I'll bring a couple more pieces

198
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,760
Here

199
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,680
Hold on

200
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,040
Actually we should block this area

201
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,520
Block this spot

202
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Then this whole section will be ours

203
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,080
Yes, like this

204
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
But what I mainly want

205
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,520
Here we can go over from above like this

206
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,600
That works

207
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,640
And here it's two-three

208
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,240
Here it's three-four

209
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,840
Okay

210
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Good

211
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,680
Their yellow ones

212
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,120
Are trying to expand that area now

213
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,400
So the green ones won't be so aggressive

214
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
I think we should take the fourth row first

215
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Just take one spot over there

216
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
We can extend outward

217
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,320
I think we can take it first

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,720
Agreed

219
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,600
Here's what we'll do

220
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,360
Let me look around first

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
They blocked us again slightly

222
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,720
We're getting pinched again

223
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,560
I think this should work

224
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,440
Yes, this is acceptable

225
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,200
Because this way

226
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,280
We can definitely move here

227
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,720
Right?

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,080
Okay

229
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,000
Like this

230
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,120
This one

231
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
No hesitation

232
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,840
Let's discuss it

233
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,440
Divide this side

234
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,000
Basically, it's just us left anyway

235
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
Who's discussing with you?

236
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,720
We'll take it ourselves

237
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,680
Look

238
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,840
But your route to the high zone

239
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,560
is somewhat restricted

240
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,600
If you're willing

241
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,680
to share with us

242
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
We're unrestricted

243
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
Fine

244
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
Are we really unrestricted?

245
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,680
Alright then,

246
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,720
Let me check how many points we have now.

247
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,320
One, two, three, four.

248
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,800
We can...

249
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,200
We can come over here first, right?

250
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
What about that piece?

251
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
Which piece?

252
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,840
This one? Still four.

253
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,000
If we take this spot, wouldn't it...

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
Four then, let's take four first.

255
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,440
That's it.

256
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,600
But this way in the high zone...

257
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,480
There's no space left at all.

258
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,520
No problem.

259
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,680
The right side is completely sufficient.

260
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,560
Because blue isn't competing with us now.

261
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,920
Right?

262
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,120
Blue can't come over here.

263
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,600
Don't you think so?

264
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,520
That works too.

265
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
Let's do this.

266
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,440
Like this.

267
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,520
But...

268
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,880
Actually, I think...

269
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
Since we need to place them adjacent to ours...

270
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,880
Then we...

271
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,160
Can actually take this area.

272
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,240
Then yellow can't come here.

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,360
Because they can't connect to their own.

274
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,560
But as long as we don't move...

275
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
They can't come to this spot.

276
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,320
Right.

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Anyway, in the end...

278
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,160
We can score points here in the last two rounds.

279
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
First, let's secure this spot.

280
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,040
I think...

281
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,520
Then we can also go this way.

282
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,720
And over here...

283
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,600
This side.

284
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
Okay, no problem.

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
Like this, for now.

286
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,600
Let's get points first.

287
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,400
We could...

288
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,480
Actually, at five we could...

289
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,280
Directly take two points.

290
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,120
I'll follow your lead.

291
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Then I'll do it this way.

292
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,960
This way they can't get through.

293
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Right, this one.

294
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
That vertical piece might be useful.

295
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,280
Later...

296
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,240
Wait, I've got a brilliant idea.

297
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,040
Let's put this three...

298
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
On top of the five.

299
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,720
Then five will be complete.

300
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,040
They won't be able to pass.

301
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,960
This...

302
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,120
Our turn now, right?

303
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:44,840
This area...

304
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,560
If they do this...

305
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,480
No, if it's like this...

306
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,600
They can also come from this side.

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,480
They'll definitely get two points here.

308
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
So let's take these first...

309
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,960
And secure them.

310
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,680
Okay.

311
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,280
Right?

312
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
How did he...?

313
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,760
Where should we place?

314
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,680
They can come from another direction.

315
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,520
Okay, here then, right?

316
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,080
I feel like we're being blocked by three sides.

317
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,600
You blocked that side.

318
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
These two here are yours.

319
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
These two don't matter, the issue is...

320
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
If you place one here...

321
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,000
They...

322
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
Actually could also...

323
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,920
Place...

324
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,200
Rotate it.

325
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
Oh no, Brother Hou ends up first.

326
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,520
No way, impossible.

327
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,000
He's way ahead.

328
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
Then I'll just do it this way.

329
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,000
Right, let's go first.

330
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think we should place here first.

331
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,920
Because if...

332
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,840
But this way we score points.

333
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,520
If someone places here...

334
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,400
We'll have no moves left.

335
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,120
Right.

336
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,960
But at least we'll score.

337
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,400
Score first.

338
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,680
But we'll lose points for unplayable moves.

339
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,400
Yes, deducted.

340
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,600
For example, if this area is empty...

341
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
We lose one point.

342
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
See how many points you can get this way.

343
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,320
If it gets blocked...

344
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,880
But actually it won't be blocked.

345
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
We can get three points.

346
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,840
You can actually place here.

347
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,600
At worst we'll just lose points.

348
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,880
Right?

349
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,400
Let's place it first.

350
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,360
Okay.

351
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,480
How about this?

352
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,280
I think it works.

353
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,480
Make it harder for them.

354
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
Yes.

355
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,520
Let's wedge it in there.

356
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,480
Insert this one.

357
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
Otherwise we'll really lose.

358
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,520
Alright, go.

359
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,800
Let me make this move, thanks guys.

360
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,040
I'll place it for you.

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,560
You're placing here, right?

362
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,400
Yes, place it here.

363
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,040
Like entering unopposed.

364
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,280
Wait, let me check.

365
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,240
Over the limit

366
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,040
One over

367
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,240
Then this is the only way

368
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,720
Also over

369
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
No other choice

370
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,200
Still over

371
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,960
Like this

372
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,280
Right

373
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,400
Losing one less point is acceptable

374
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,960
Right? No other option

375
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,240
Our turn now.

376
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,680
Our turn, let's take a look.

377
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:06,960
This doesn't seem good.

378
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,680
This way we're leaving an L shape exposed.

379
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,720
Feels like it could be easily covered.

380
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,440
Very easily.

381
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,480
Right, he doesn't need an L.

382
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,520
He doesn't have an L.

383
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,120
He has one.

384
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,000
But we can only place this one.

385
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,160
Wait, hold on.

386
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,480
But this can't be placed here.

387
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,560
This piece won't fit.

388
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,880
How did we place it just now?

389
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,760
This piece just won't...

390
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,920
...fit in this spot.

391
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,080
But we have to place something.

392
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,640
To reduce the number of pieces we're holding.

393
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,560
Then we'll have to place this one.

394
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,200
No other choice.

395
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Go ahead.

396
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,240
Becoming his stepping stone.

397
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,680
Why put it that way?

398
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,720
We've been stepping stones plenty of times.

399
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,160
You could expand over there.

400
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,560
Place this one.

401
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,720
We can move this L over there.

402
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,920
Let's secure these points first.

403
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,880
Let's place it like this.

404
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
Not placing here?

405
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
It's fine, I'll figure it out.

406
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,440
If you don't place there...

407
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
...that area will go to Huang.

408
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
He'll cover it again later.

409
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,720
No yellow pieces left, we checked.

410
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,680
No pieces can be placed.

411
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,280
How about this?

412
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,760
Right.

413
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,720
If you don't place here, it's all his.

414
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't panic.

415
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,160
Impressive.

416
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,680
Genius

417
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,760
Wait a minute

418
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,320
We'll get two points here too

419
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,560
No

420
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,040
You can take the red side here

421
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,560
Otherwise he'll get everything

422
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,320
Genius

423
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
Thank you for your recognition

424
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,280
Genius

425
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
This is all I can do.

426
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Are there any more available?

427
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,440
No, none at the moment.

428
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
So it can't be placed, right?

429
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,520
It really can't be placed.

430
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,240
How about this?

431
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,560
That works.

432
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,200
Genius.

433
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,880
It's fine.

434
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Can you secure this for me?

435
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,240
Just secure two points.

436
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,000
Protect it.

437
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
Over, six is over

438
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,720
It's over

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,400
I think it's gone

440
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Lost

441
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,280
Alright, I'll discard two

442
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,080
Then we'll place it here

443
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,560
Gone

444
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,120
No way

445
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Then it's over, let's settle

446
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,320
Settle

447
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,960
After going through

448
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,560
the assessment of the last round's game,

449
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,160
the first place winner

450
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,240
was our Clinic Two.

451
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
So what insights did you gain

452
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
from the previous round?

453
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,480
We should limit height where it's low,

454
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
restrict height in lower areas,

455
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,640
and strive to expand in higher areas.

456
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,000
Don't focus on just one spot,

457
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,280
or you'll easily get taken out,

458
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,800
eliminated.

459
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,440
Right, and also,

460
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,920
at the right moment, you should

461
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,280
whisper in others' ears,

462
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
drop some hints.

463
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,200
True disappointment isn't about loud arguments,

464
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,920
Okay.

465
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,040
Now let's proceed to our second round.

466
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,560
Which one should we choose for round two?

467
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,680
Do you have any preferences?

468
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,000
Alright then, we'll choose Chuan Wu.

469
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
Let's see what this game is about.

470
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,560
"Cure All."

471
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,600
The first round's participants are ready

472
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,160
We'll decide by spinning the wheel

473
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay

474
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
Our Clinic Room 2

475
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Nervous

476
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Okay, your opponents

477
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,720
Why don't you go first?

478
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,520
You spin it yourselves

479
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,080
You do it, you have better luck

480
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,200
Clinic Room 2's opponent is

481
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,040
Okay

482
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,120
Our Clinic Room 4

483
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,840
Which is me

484
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,560
Go for it, Brother Hou

485
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:30,640
Alright

486
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,520
I think it's like this, right?

487
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,200
And then like this

488
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,280
If we do it this way

489
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,760
He goes there, he goes there

490
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,400
That works

491
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,840
Good

492
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,760
Charge

493
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,920
Great move

494
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,920
This works

495
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,960
This really works

496
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,520
Really

497
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,920
Not bad at all

498
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,800
Is the pressure that intense?

499
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,040
Go for it

500
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Yes, I think it's doable

501
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,320
I think if we just mirror him

502
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,960
we'll always be one step behind.

503
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,400
Might as well—

504
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,880
A master

505
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,840
would do the same.

506
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,160
No,

507
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,360
should we take these two or go this way?

508
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's go this way.

509
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,320
Going this way feels like copying him.

510
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,680
Copying is fine if you want to,

511
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
but I think we can take this path.

512
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,120
Right, we can go.

513
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,800
Tit for tat

514
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,920
So do you think we should push them up first

515
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,680
or make a turn?

516
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
Okay, push two.

517
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,760
These two.

518
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,640
Leave two to defend our base.

519
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Right, I think this works.

520
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,840
Yes, let's push one.

521
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's push this one first.

522
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,920
Pushing this first has value.

523
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,440
Agreed.

524
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,400
Spread out, stay safe.

525
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,920
Here.

526
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,000
They ran away.

527
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,880
He just wants us to eat it.

528
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,200
So he walked ahead.

529
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I think if he were red,

530
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,360
he wouldn’t do this.

531
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,720
Anyway, if it were me, I wouldn’t act like this.

532
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,800
Let me eat this one.

533
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,080
Okay.

534
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,680
This one should be black.

535
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,400
Agreed.

536
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,600
I think we should eliminate this one.

537
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,040
He's already eaten one.

538
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,360
Fine.

539
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,080
He's already taken one.

540
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm certain these two...

541
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,440
Never mind, I won't say it.

542
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
This one should be black too.

543
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,880
Right?

544
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,240
Sure, go ahead and eat it.

545
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,160
Have we eaten three or four black ones?

546
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,760
Four, we've collected four.

547
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Eaten.

548
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,120
Devouring happily.

549
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,840
Wait.

550
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,560
Hold on.

551
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,600
I think we should eliminate it.

552
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,480
Why eliminate it?

553
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,960
If we eliminate it, we'll be even, right?

554
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,520
Opening move.

555
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,040
No need.

556
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,520
No no no.

557
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,440
But our piece...

558
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,160
Is closer to the (herb storage) than his.

559
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,760
I have the advantage in moves.

560
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,040
Exactly.

561
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,960
But of course I think it could move too.

562
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,840
Let's move it.

563
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Yes, that's right.

564
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,120
Later, you'll eat it.

565
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,760
Then let's finish it off.

566
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,080
Yes, eat it.

567
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Let's attack first.

568
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,720
He's not protecting his piece anyway.

569
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,560
We can take it out.

570
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,040
Right.

571
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,800
Let's go with this.

572
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,280
It's definitely going to advance.

573
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,520
Yeah, ignore it for now and move.

574
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,320
But I'm one step behind him.

575
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,240
No problem.

576
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,080
I'll go here.

577
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,040
Okay.

578
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,480
This works too, it moved up first.

579
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,520
Alright.

580
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,840
Oh no.

581
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,440
Damn it

582
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,760
I think the current logic is either

583
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
to eliminate both of his pieces

584
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,240
But if both are black

585
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,680
we lose

586
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,400
Two blacks

587
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,360
That's too counterintuitive

588
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,240
I don't think that's possible

589
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,800
That's crazy

590
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,320
The red one in the back isn't moving at all

591
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,920
It's possible

592
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,360
That seems like something he would do

593
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,760
Alright

594
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,080
Also when he blocks

595
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,720
if that one is red

596
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
we shouldn't take it

597
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,800
If it comes over, we can't block it

598
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,480
Right

599
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,560
Yes, because we'd have to detour

600
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,440
Then let's take it

601
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,520
Take it

602
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,280
Damn it

603
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Damn it

604
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Oh no

605
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,800
Cover me

606
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,720
I think we should go with this one

607
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,400
Should we move in?

608
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,880
No, I think we should attack

609
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,160
Do you think those two are red?

610
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Yes, I believe those two are red

611
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,520
Alright, let's go

612
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,320
He's going this way, trying to make us take it.

613
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,240
Then let's take one too.

614
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,800
Let's go for it.

615
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,520
I think this is the one.

616
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,440
Go for it.

617
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,200
Just take it directly.

618
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
No.

619
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Then I'll go left.

620
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,440
Okay.

621
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,480
Do you think that one is red?

622
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,720
That...

623
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,640
Now he only has a black one left.

624
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,520
This one right here.

625
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,080
Really?

626
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,680
Yes.

627
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,560
Do you think it's red?

628
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,520
If it's red, we'll take it.

629
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,640
But let me calculate the moves first.

630
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,080
It is red.

631
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,720
We'll take it.

632
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,560
Then we...

633
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,360
successfully...

634
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
will get through.

635
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,600
He won't have time to defend.

636
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,880
We need to make the judgment first.

637
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,720
That one's red, right?

638
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,440
While this one's black.

639
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,040
This has been placed here...

640
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
and hasn't moved for a long time.

641
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,160
One of these two is black.

642
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,760
So...

643
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,080
Now we just need to calculate...

644
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,040
if we have enough moves.

645
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,680
I feel our move count...

646
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,520
seems to be ahead of his.

647
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,320
Because these two of his...

648
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,080
appear to be further apart.

649
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,400
If I move this down...

650
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
Should we take first or move down first?

651
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Take first, let's take it.

652
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,840
Go ahead, take it.

653
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,040
Okay.

654
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,880
It's definitely red.

655
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,480
That one's black.

656
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,720
These two must have one black piece.

657
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,080
Right.

658
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,920
I think...

659
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,480
But the issue is his piece...

660
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,160
What if his is red?

661
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,320
If this is...

662
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,880
No way.

663
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,800
It's impossible for both...

664
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
I think these two...

665
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,960
have very low probability of being red.

666
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,840
Let's gamble on it.

667
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,320
Actually I think...

668
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,400
if theirs was red...

669
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,520
they wouldn't be discussing this much.

670
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
True.

671
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
They're only discussing because it's black.

672
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,760
That's why they need to discuss this.

673
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,480
But since in terms of moves...

674
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm ahead.

675
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,160
Right.

676
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Let's eliminate it.

677
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,800
Right now,

678
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,880
the only way left to win

679
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,720
is to pretend that black one

680
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,880
is actually red.

681
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,240
He wants to trick us

682
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
into having red take black.

683
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
That way we'll lose.

684
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,360
Do you think he's

685
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,400
I'm sure this must be black.

686
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,480
Definitely black.

687
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,040
Then let's go.

688
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,240
I think we should take the gamble.

689
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,960
Right? We have no choice.

690
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,600
Let's go. Move.

691
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,640
Then you'll have to come over.

692
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
But if you come, he'll take you.

693
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,160
We're done.

694
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,960
Do you think we've put our fate

695
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,480
in the hands of eating him?

696
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,200
If he's black,

697
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
eating him means we lose.

698
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,160
If we don't eat him,

699
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,720
it's not this one.

700
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
That one moved up from behind.

701
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,920
That one moved up from behind

702
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,680
If it's red

703
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,600
it will charge in

704
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,480
and then leave

705
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,840
It doesn’t need to keep waiting there

706
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,520
This piece has been waiting here for a long time

707
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,280
Do you remember?

708
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,120
If it's black

709
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,280
we should ignore it

710
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,760
Just focus on our own moves

711
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,440
Move to our left

712
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
and we win

713
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Let's go in.

714
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,760
Alright, let's go in then.

715
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,360
Fine, you win.

716
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,440
Then

717
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
Then they won

718
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,280
The initial strategy was correct

719
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,240
Good thing we didn't take it

720
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,920
Right

721
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,080
You really put all four black ones in front

722
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,960
Yeah

723
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,400
Against human nature

724
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,640
One red charging in alone

725
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,560
Devouring nonstop

726
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Agreed, I thought the same

727
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,600
Feasting endlessly

728
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
Eating heartily

729
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Look at them

730
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
You promised endless feasting

731
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,080
Are you eating or not?

732
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,960
Give us two red ones

733
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,240
Why are you taking so many?

734
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,640
We're cheating

735
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,680
No, we can't do that.

736
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,320
That's exactly why we lost last time.

737
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,960
Then let's have one go up and the other down.

738
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,760
I think we should swap these two.

739
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,080
Let's just go randomly

740
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,360
Actually we could totally do it this way

741
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,520
And this one is also backwards

742
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,920
Really

743
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,640
Okay

744
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Move this one

745
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,480
Go

746
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,840
Good move

747
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,760
Let's move this one

748
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,520
Move this

749
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,040
Do you want to eat?

750
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,040
I won't eat.

751
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
Okay

752
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,240
Want to eat it directly

753
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,840
Try eating one

754
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,240
Eat

755
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,920
Red or black

756
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,960
Eat up

757
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,600
Green

758
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,600
Go on, eat

759
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,520
Eat

760
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,200
Move forward

761
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,240
Go this way

762
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,720
Eat again

763
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,320
Big eater

764
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,600
It eats one of these two

765
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,560
Let him eat it

766
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Go right

767
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,600
Eat again?

768
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,400
Eat again, we'll eat

769
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,280
Eat to the left

770
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,960
Send one to defend

771
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,800
I think sending one to defend is fine

772
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,560
But it seems

773
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,840
We can't hold the defense

774
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
They can't hold the defense

775
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,280
Let's think about our third strategy

776
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,040
We can only defend this

777
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
Right, we can only use this for defense

778
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,240
Let's go

779
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,560
Use this one

780
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,600
Deploy this one

781
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,000
Or this one, let's use this

782
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,480
What do you think?

783
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
Use this one

784
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
Move this to the right

785
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,720
Lure them to take this

786
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,160
Right

787
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
Then move this to the right

788
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,720
Take it

789
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,040
This battle situation

790
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
is truly something I've never seen before

791
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,160
Brutal

792
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,120
Should we maybe

793
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,920
eat one of them?

794
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,520
Let's eat it

795
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
The black one then

796
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,800
Direct assault

797
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,640
Push forward again

798
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,320
Actually, I...

799
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Since we don't have any black ones now

800
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,760
Taking a black one wouldn't matter

801
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,280
Then take it

802
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,880
Agreed

803
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,520
Let's go

804
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Move this one up

805
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,080
Keep advancing this one

806
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,880
Wait a moment

807
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,560
You need to consider him

808
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,160
After we go in

809
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,920
We might get taken by him

810
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
So we can't get out

811
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,600
Therefore

812
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,000
That's true

813
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,600
We can only find something to pair with it

814
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,880
Then pull this one back

815
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,880
Which one do you say is red?

816
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,600
This one

817
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,160
This one is red

818
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,280
Up, go up

819
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,560
Need to dodge this one

820
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,960
Must dodge

821
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,240
Openly plotting aloud

822
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,560
I think both of these are red

823
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,200
Maybe this one is black

824
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,600
Right, because it's not advancing forward

825
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,000
Move this forward, okay?

826
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,520
He can't take this one

827
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you dare take that one?

828
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,040
Okay

829
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,760
You can eat this first

830
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,120
Then our clinic number one

831
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,360
obtained four black prescriptions

832
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
The feasting tactic failed

833
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,960
This tactic

834
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,240
is actually quite innovative

835
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,480
Innovative but not worth recommending it seems

836
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,040
I think their words

837
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
were actually meant for us

838
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,960
Yes

839
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,760
Every word we say

840
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
is meant for you

841
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,280
It can eat one of these two

842
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,520
Let it eat

843
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,720
Send one to defend

844
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,000
I think

845
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,520
Sending one to defend is fine

846
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,080
But it seems we can't hold the defense

847
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,720
You need to consider that

848
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,320
After we enter

849
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,080
we might get eaten by it

850
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,800
So we can't get out

851
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,240
We must dodge this

852
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,080
Must dodge

853
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,240
Loud scheming

854
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,920
You're too kind

855
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,200
Approved

856
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,680
Excellent

857
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,560
Then we

858
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,880
shall congratulate our Clinic Three

859
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,080
for gaining 20% mental capacity

860
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Now for the third round of the game,

861
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,280
let's draw one.

862
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,920
Which one should we pick?

863
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,840
Changsheng.

864
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,080
Perfect!

865
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,160
In unison.

866
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,880
Changsheng.

867
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,160
The miraculous calculations of a divine healer.

868
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,880
Welcome to the assessment for our third round of games.

869
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,760
We'll use a spinner to decide who...

870
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,480
...which clinic team goes first.

871
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Clinic One seems pretty strong.

872
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,520
Right.

873
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:42,800
No.

874
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,320
I'm not too sure either.

875
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,760
Because this is a logical question.

876
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,600
I don't really know.

877
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,200
Okay.

878
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,480
Clinic One.

879
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,040
Yes.

880
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,000
For the first round, Clinic One will go first.

881
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,320
Your opponents will be...

882
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,400
It's us.

883
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,800
Because it's usually one or two.

884
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,520
Right.

885
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,960
Feels like it's me.

886
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,480
Three.

887
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,320
Let's go.

888
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
It's us again.

889
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,600
Alright, we're Clinic Three.

890
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,880
Okay

891
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,120
We can begin once you're ready

892
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,520
We

893
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,120
Because in this round we

894
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,440
Clinic One has lower mental stats

895
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,560
So Clinic One will go first

896
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,640
We can use the binary method

897
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,360
Binary method

898
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,520
They

899
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:24,960
Their number

900
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,680
Should be relatively larger

901
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,360
I feel their number

902
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,240
Is relatively large

903
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,920
Or we could ask

904
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,120
If the first two digits are greater than 50

905
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,360
Right

906
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,800
This would essentially halve the range

907
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,120
Are your first two digits

908
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,880
Greater than 50?

909
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,840
Yes

910
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,880
Actually this way

911
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,760
Isn't good to ask

912
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
We could first ask if there are duplicates

913
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,080
We'll have to ask this eventually anyway

914
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,640
We can ask

915
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,560
If there are duplicates

916
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,280
Yes

917
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,640
No duplicates

918
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,640
No duplicates

919
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,040
Right

920
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,080
Let's ask about the latter part

921
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,800
If the latter part is small

922
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,880
Then the front part would be

923
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Right, ask about the latter part

924
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,240
So we should ask if the last two digits

925
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,440
Are the last two digits

926
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,600
Greater than 31

927
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,200
Right

928
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,880
Are the last two digits greater than 31?

929
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,440
No

930
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,960
You have a number that's greater than or equal to 5

931
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,280
No

932
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,560
So there is a number

933
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,400
There is a number greater than or equal to 5

934
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
Your second digit

935
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,960
Is it greater than or equal to 5?

936
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,960
Yes

937
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,200
The first digit is also 0-4

938
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,160
I think we should first determine

939
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,600
whether this number is in the front or back

940
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,520
First determine if it's on this side or that side

941
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,080
Okay

942
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,680
Then you ask if it's in the first two digits

943
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,640
or the last two digits

944
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,560
About your...

945
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,640
numbers greater than or equal to 5

946
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,880
are in the last two digits, right?

947
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,400
Correct

948
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,880
You can give it a name

949
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,040
Let's call it A

950
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,440
A

951
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,560
The other one is A

952
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,640
Is your first digit 3 or 4?

953
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,280
Yes

954
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,920
His first digit isn't 3 or 4

955
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,320
Now it's between 00, 01, 02, 03, 04

956
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,560
Are your first two digits

957
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,400
greater than or equal to 25?

958
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
No

959
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,480
Its first two digits are greater than 25

960
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,720
Then it must be here

961
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,880
And this is greater than or equal to...

962
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,520
No

963
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,280
What if it's in the first digit?

964
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,880
Right

965
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,520
I didn't phrase that question well

966
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,720
Would asking if it's a prime number be better?

967
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,920
23

968
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,280
Okay

969
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,240
Are your first two digits a prime number?

970
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,080
Yes

971
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,280
Yes, then it's not a prime number

972
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,680
There are still many possibilities left

973
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,920
How about we directly ask about this

974
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,200
A

975
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,000
Is your number greater than or equal to 5

976
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,640
in the first digit?

977
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,800
No

978
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,440
That number is in the first digit

979
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,600
It is in the first digit

980
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,520
Yes, it's in the first digit

981
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,640
Then ask if there's a 2 in the first two digits

982
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,280
Do you think this is a good question?

983
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,040
Okay

984
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,360
Is there a 2 in the first two digits?

985
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,640
No

986
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,080
Actually, there is

987
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,320
The remaining three numbers you have

988
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,160
excluding the one we just

989
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,560
asked about

990
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,640
numbers greater than or equal to 5

991
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,880
Are there three numbers greater than or equal to 2?

992
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,320
Yes

993
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,040
Meaning it's not three (≥2)

994
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,720
It must be either two

995
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,240
or one

996
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,440
or possibly zero numbers

997
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,200
No, not zero

998
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,000
There are no duplicates

999
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,400
And there are exactly three numbers

1000
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
0

1001
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,680
Not enough, simply not enough

1002
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,000
It must be

1003
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,040
2 3 4

1004
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,000
Are your first two digits 20?

1005
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,360
Yes

1006
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,160
Deduction... deduction failed

1007
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,680
You're just guessing here

1008
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,000
Mind reading failed

1009
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
In your password

1010
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,920
0

1011
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,280
Yes

1012
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,440
Okay, very clear now

1013
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,360
I asked if it's one

1014
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,840
They said no, so it must be two

1015
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
So it's 0 and 1 2 3 4

1016
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
This one is ≥5

1017
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,240
Then input this

1018
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,120
That's the situation

1019
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,320
Are your first two digits multiples of 3?

1020
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,120
No

1021
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,520
(Yes) multiples of 3

1022
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Let's ask about the first one first.

1023
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,560
Is the first digit odd or even?

1024
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,200
Even.

1025
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,880
Then it's odd.

1026
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,680
Odd.

1027
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,200
Then let's directly ask about the last two digits.

1028
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,880
Are they greater than or equal to 60?

1029
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,000
Taking a gamble, huh?

1030
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,520
Are your last two digits greater than or equal to 60?

1031
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,800
No.

1032
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,200
61-99, right?

1033
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,240
I think what we're doing now is...

1034
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,840
deducing digit by digit, right?

1035
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,080
Right.

1036
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,120
Then for the first digit we can ask...

1037
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,960
Is your first digit...

1038
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,880
7 or 9?

1039
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,320
If they say yes...

1040
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,960
Then it's actually 5.

1041
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,560
If not...

1042
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,480
then it must be either 7 or 9.

1043
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,160
Is your first digit 7 or 9?

1044
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,600
No.

1045
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Then their first digit...

1046
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,280
must be either 7 or 9.

1047
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,440
Okay.

1048
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,720
I think we should narrow it down further.

1049
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,160
Prime numbers would be good.

1050
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,880
First eliminate two rows, then ask about primes.

1051
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,320
Let's eliminate these two rows first.

1052
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,320
Is the third digit 6 or 7?

1053
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,960
Is it 6 or 7?

1054
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,760
No.

1055
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,320
Maybe we should ask about the position of 0 first.

1056
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,040
Go through them one by one.

1057
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,520
Right, actually asking...

1058
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,440
would give us similar information.

1059
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,120
Is your 0 in the...

1060
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,280
third position?

1061
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,040
Yes.

1062
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,160
Just ask directly about the third digit.

1063
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,600
Ask if it's 6 or 7.

1064
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,440
Okay.

1065
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,960
Is the third digit 7?

1066
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,760
Yes.

1067
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,000
Let's just ask directly if you have the number 2.

1068
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,280
Okay.

1069
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,720
You have the number 2, right?

1070
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,720
Correct.

1071
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,680
Why does this keep happening?

1072
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
We're guessing one out of three.

1073
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,080
Seems like we never guess right.

1074
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,960
We've never guessed correctly either.

1075
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,000
So unlucky.

1076
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,280
What should we ask?

1077
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,040
Let's ask if the fourth digit is a prime number.

1078
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,080
Primes are 2, 3, 5, 7.

1079
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,400
Is your last digit a prime number?

1080
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,120
Yes.

1081
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,640
So your last digit...

1082
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,920
is not 2, 3, 5, or 7.

1083
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,520
Just ask directly about 3.

1084
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
I think right now...

1085
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,120
it's all the same.

1086
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,400
Because our next two steps are to...

1087
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,440
either confirm 3 and 4,

1088
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,960
or determine the position of 0.

1089
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,040
0.

1090
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,720
No.

1091
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,720
0.

1092
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,400
Okay, not many options left now.

1093
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,720
7.

1094
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,320
And the fourth digit is 0.

1095
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,480
Then it's either 1, 3, or 4.

1096
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,520
Very close, both sides are very close.

1097
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
Your

1098
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,240
Is your last digit greater than 3?

1099
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,720
Last digit, no.

1100
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,480
So their last digit

1101
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,320
is greater than 3.

1102
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,760
Right.

1103
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,680
4, 6, 8, 9.

1104
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,320
I think we should ask one more question

1105
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,120
or just guess directly.

1106
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,280
Because if you guess wrong,

1107
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,040
it's still one out of three.

1108
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,440
That would be a bit frustrating.

1109
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,920
Right, let's ask first.

1110
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,440
Is your 1 in the second position?

1111
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,640
Yes.

1112
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,600
Then it's either 7410 or 7310.

1113
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
Let's guess.

1114
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,600
Otherwise, they'll guess too.

1115
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,400
It's a gamble.

1116
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,840
This is the most exciting part.

1117
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,960
Nerve-wracking and thrilling.

1118
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,320
Let's guess.

1119
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Okay, let's guess.

1120
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,320
Is it 1268?

1121
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,200
Yes.

1122
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,720
Is yours 7310?

1123
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,480
No.

1124
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,200
Then we've won!

1125
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,520
What's yours?

1126
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,920
1269.

1127
00:41:59,480 --> 00:41:59,920
So it's

1128
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,640
just between 4 and 9.

1129
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:00,840
Right.

1130
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,520
But we were just unlucky.

1131
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,560
Our luck ran out at the end.

1132
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,000
Okay.

1133
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
Let's congratulate Clinic Three

1134
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,600
for winning this round.

1135
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,320
They've gained 20% brainpower.

1136
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,080
Alright.

1137
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,920
Let's begin our second round.

1138
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,840
Okay

1139
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:22,960
Alright

1140
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,280
Then let's start with the lowest mental score

1141
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,960
Exam Room 4

1142
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,440
I'll go first then

1143
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,520
Is your number greater than or equal to 5000?

1144
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,080
No

1145
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,920
Is the first digit greater than 5?

1146
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,000
Is it greater than 5?

1147
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,240
Greater than or equal to

1148
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,200
Greater than

1149
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,560
Greater than or equal to

1150
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,760
0-9 makes 10 numbers

1151
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,760
So that's 0-4, greater than or equal to

1152
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,440
Standard binary search means greater than or equal to

1153
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,360
Yes

1154
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,520
Then it's 0-4

1155
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,440
Is your number greater than or equal to 7500?

1156
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,480
No

1157
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,560
No

1158
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,200
That means greater than

1159
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,720
The first digit

1160
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,560
Is it greater than or equal to 2?

1161
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,520
No

1162
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,120
Then it's

1163
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,600
No, then it's between 2-4

1164
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,360
Is your number greater than or equal to 9000?

1165
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,560
No

1166
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,640
Wait a minute

1167
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,080
No

1168
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,120
So your number

1169
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,760
is greater than or equal to 9000?

1170
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,760
No, mine is less than 9000

1171
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,520
So

1172
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,120
I'm telling you it's not

1173
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,560
So we should say yes, right?

1174
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,440
Yes, you should say yes

1175
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,640
So he answered wrong

1176
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,120
You all answered wrong

1177
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,840
Yes, so you must be punished

1178
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,640
Therefore you must give me

1179
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,560
a number

1180
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,240
Okay

1181
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,800
0

1182
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,640
0

1183
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,440
There's no 0

1184
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,800
0

1185
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,840
No 0

1186
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,400
Is the second digit greater than or equal to 5?

1187
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,320
No

1188
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,120
No, then it's greater than or equal to 5

1189
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,960
Yes, greater than or equal to 5

1190
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,840
Between 5-9

1191
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,680
Your number

1192
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,200
is between 7500-8000

1193
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,120
including 7500 and 8000

1194
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,120
7500-8000

1195
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,920
If we're not

1196
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,240
we should say yes, right?

1197
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,040
You don't

1198
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,120
You shouldn't, think for yourself

1199
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,280
No, so we should answer yes

1200
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,680
Is your number between 7500-8000?

1201
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,280
Yes

1202
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,760
Is your second digit greater than or equal to 7?

1203
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,600
Or split?

1204
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,720
Greater than 7?

1205
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,520
Not including equal to.

1206
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,680
Yes.

1207
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,440
Yes, so...

1208
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,240
No.

1209
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,000
Not greater than 7.

1210
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,480
Then it's 5-7.

1211
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,960
Your number is...

1212
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,200
8000-8500.

1213
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,320
Yes.

1214
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,920
Because we're not...

1215
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,000
So we should say yes.

1216
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,200
The number formed by the last two digits

1217
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,920
Is it greater than or equal to 50?

1218
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,320
Yes

1219
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,120
Then it's here

1220
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,160
Right?

1221
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,560
I think we should figure out the last two digits first

1222
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,480
The last three digits of your four-digit number

1223
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,040
Are they between 500 and 750?

1224
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
No

1225
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,560
Your last two digits, right?

1226
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,120
Are the last two digits greater than or equal to 25?

1227
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,360
Greater than or equal to 25

1228
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,000
Correct

1229
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:44,920
Yes

1230
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,920
Your last three digits

1231
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,680
Are they between 500-675?

1232
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,480
No

1233
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,640
Are your last two digits greater than or equal to 12?

1234
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,240
No.

1235
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,680
Then it must be here.

1236
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,920
The last three digits of your number are

1237
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,240
600-675

1238
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,600
Yes

1239
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,960
Are your last two digits greater than or equal to 19?

1240
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,120
No

1241
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,640
The last two digits you are

1242
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,080
0-50

1243
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,080
No

1244
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,600
Are your last two digits less than or equal to 22?

1245
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,560
No

1246
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,920
Are the last two digits of your number

1247
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,600
between 0 and 25?

1248
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,680
Yes

1249
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,720
Is there a way

1250
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,920
to eliminate more possibilities at once?

1251
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,520
Seems not.

1252
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,840
Because there are always three possibilities.

1253
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,240
Right?

1254
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,520
Three.

1255
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,720
Three. At most, we can eliminate two at a time.

1256
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:31,640
Are the first two digits greater than or equal to 36?

1257
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,920
Yes.

1258
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,400
Then it's less than 36, so...

1259
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,880
If less, then like this.

1260
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
So it's 25, 26.

1261
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,040
Wait a moment.

1262
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,920
25, 26, 27, 35, right?

1263
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,240
Are your last two digits

1264
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,480
between 25 and 40?

1265
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,360
Yes.

1266
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,120
Think about it

1267
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,120
I think we should ask about the first two first

1268
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,080
Are the first two digits greater than or equal to 27?

1269
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,320
Yes

1270
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,720
So it's not

1271
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,320
Is your last digit between 1 and 5?

1272
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,560
Including 1 and 5

1273
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,120
Yes

1274
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,400
Let's ask one more step

1275
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,520
Then we can choose from three options

1276
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,080
Really?

1277
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,320
Once we confirm this

1278
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,520
We can narrow it down to three choices

1279
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,080
Right?

1280
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,240
Are the first two digits 25?

1281
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,440
Yes

1282
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,160
Then it's not 25

1283
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,640
26

1284
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,360
Is your last digit

1285
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,000
6 or 7?

1286
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,480
No

1287
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,000
He has to choose between two options, right?

1288
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,560
I have to choose between two options.

1289
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,520
But it's not necessarily certain.

1290
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,640
What if you guess correctly right away?

1291
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,920
So we have to take a guess.

1292
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,760
Leave it to fate.

1293
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,200
Leave it to fate.

1294
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,080
If we don't ask, he might figure it out.

1295
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,920
What if you guess it correctly immediately?

1296
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,080
Alright, let's guess.

1297
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,120
2619

1298
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,560
2619

1299
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,080
Wrong.

1300
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,400
You win.

1301
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,720
8547

1302
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,840
Impressive.

1303
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,760
Well done.

1304
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,680
So which one are you?

1305
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,320
I'm 2621.

1306
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,720
First, tell me what these numbers mean.

1307
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,120
26

1308
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,720
10

1309
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,840
21

1310
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,440
3

1311
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,120
Too bad we don't know your girlfriend's birthday

1312
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,120
Got kicked while just playing a game

1313
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,160
Exactly

1314
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,720
Alright

1315
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,840
Then congratulations to our Clinic Four

1316
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,040
For achieving 20% brain power

1317
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,720
Alright everyone

1318
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,080
The moment everyone's been waiting for

1319
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,800
Time to reveal the final rankings

1320
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,040
Which clinic will take first place?

1321
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,040
Let's congratulate the one that overcame all challenges

1322
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,160
After three rounds of assessments

1323
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,080
Clinic Three with 50% brain power

1324
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,160
Congratulations to Clinic Three

1325
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,520
For becoming the interim leader of Brainstorm Hall

1326
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,520
Now

1327
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,160
We enter this session's most important

1328
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,920
And most ceremonial segment

1329
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,160
The inauguration ceremony for the interim leader

1330
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,640
Let's bring out the cyber gourd

1331
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,760
It's quite light.

1332
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,560
Our Brainstorm Hall has already reached space.

1333
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,360
Invite the two acting Sect Leaders

1334
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,600
to take an exceptionally handsome photo.

1335
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,200
We now have two acting hall masters

1336
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,160
You may now exercise your

1337
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,520
most important privilege

1338
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,160
Please select for this session's

1339
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,840
two clinics with lowest brainpower scores

1340
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,080
Clinic 1 and Clinic 4

1341
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,040
to receive brainpower enhancement services respectively

1342
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,160
Hou Zhuocheng is the facial one

1343
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,760
Because this way

1344
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,120
we can see

1345
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,440
two people getting facial electrotherapy

1346
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,080
Let's go, bring out the props

1347
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,400
Why are there rubber bands?

1348
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,520
Are we flicking faces with these?

1349
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,160
No way

1350
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:14,480
Oh god

1351
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,120
Two rubber bands scared me this much

1352
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,160
Let's go, Clinic 1

1353
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,440
Use your mouth to pull it down

1354
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,280
You'll need to move your face

1355
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,320
It's okay, I'll do it

1356
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,560
Everyone has to try

1357
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,640
Come on, give it a try

1358
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,360
Sit here, sit here

1359
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,280
Sit down

1360
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,040
Let's go

1361
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,720
Is he a bit...

1362
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,600
Okay

1363
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,000
Impressive

1364
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,800
My turn

1365
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,120
So painful

1366
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,080
So tight

1367
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,800
It's fine, I'm okay

1368
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,920
Don't worry about me

1369
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,160
It remains completely still

1370
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,560
Why isn't it as easy for me

1371
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,840
Why don't you try laughing for five minutes

1372
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,920
See if you can laugh it off

1373
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,720
Coming down

1374
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,920
After half an hour of effort

1375
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,920
Okay

1376
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,400
Good

1377
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,640
Nice

1378
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,960
Not easy

1379
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,200
Then let's begin

1380
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,040
The next round of mental enhancement service

1381
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,400
Go

1382
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,600
What's this?

1383
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,400
Please

1384
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,480
Alright

1385
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,320
Ultra-handsome photo

1386
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,200
So handsome

1387
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,400
Ultra-handsome photo

1388
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,120
This looks just like one of those

1389
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,200
Stone statues of apes

1390
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,000
Right

1391
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,640
Planning to auction this off

1392
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,160
Do you like it?

1393
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,920
Love it! 5 million

1394
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,320
Alright

1395
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,120
We've all spent another happy

1396
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,480
And passionate day together

1397
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,400
Wishing all our doctors

1398
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,720
And the future of Brainstorm Hall

1399
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,800
May it all be like this early summer sunshine

1400
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,640
Warm and full of hope

1401
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,560
Everyone, see you next time

1402
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,280
Let's start brainstorming

1403
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,520
Great brain development

1404
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,120
Bye bye

1405
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,320
Medical panorama

1406
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,640
It has hollow patterns

1407
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
We're wrong too

1408
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,160
If this is wrong I'll really

1409
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,960
Withdraw from the competition myself

1410
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,640
This self-doubt of yours

1411
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,560
Self-criticism

1412
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,480
Self-questioning

1413
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,760
Only made obvious by comparison

1414
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,600
Herbal Memory Garden

1415
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,400
Isn't it this one?

1416
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,000
They're the same

1417
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,120
Same as which one?

1418
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,720
Same as which one?

1419
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,520
Oh dear, I really can't remember

1420
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,280
Can't remember at all

1421
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,440
I don't remember anything

1422
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,840
I even know who this is

1423
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,280
Chen Pi

1424
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,440
Hawthorn

1425
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,800
Effect

1426
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,200
I've forgotten everything I knew now

1427
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,120
Herbal Medicine Battle

1428
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,280
Everyone is being cautious

1429
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,600
Whose should we take?

1430
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,200
Come, let me read your face

1431
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,800
Look me in the eyes

1432
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,520
Bullying Clinic Two

1433
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,280
Let's talk less

1434
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,720
Some of them are guilty

1435
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,800
How great it would be to eliminate them

1436
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,640
Are you going to eliminate him?

1437
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,760
We can protect you

1438
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,480
No need, let's eliminate them first

1439
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,960
I can't wait

1440
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,920
Eliminate Clinic Two

1441
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,920
Who will stop us next?

1442
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,720
Whoever stops us, we'll eliminate them

1443
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,240
We'll stop them

1444
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,000
Why is he so arrogant?

1445
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,840
I want to eliminate him

1446
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,160
What does this mean?
