1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,400
Welcome everyone

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
to this event sponsored by

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,320
our dedicated bulldozer crew

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,240
"Let's Push It! X"

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm Cui Shaoyang, assistant director of Brainstorm Hall

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,440
The mysterious Push Town

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,520
is indeed extraordinary

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,280
With the appearance of Bei Ju

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,880
and Push Town's guardian Xiaoting

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320
the town's deepest secrets

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,520
have finally surfaced

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,160
The strange Wukenai River

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,520
actually connects Push Town

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
to four mysterious dimensions

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,880
These dimensions interact dynamically

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,840
When dimensional barriers are breached

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,200
strange occurrences plague Push Town

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's happening here?

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,160
Tuo Le, come look at this quickly

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,800
Dead

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,960
This successfully triggered

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,360
the Helimoyu Detective Team's

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,280
exploration in this alternate dimension

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,400
As Push Town's story concludes

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,360
Are these endless secrets

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,000
just elaborate deceptions

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,120
or is there truth to them?

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,760
Let's find out together in

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,560
this season's final case reconstruction

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm Xiaoting

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,880
Ever since I can remember

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,960
I've been the guardian of Tui Town

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,840
I travel through different timelines of Tui Town

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,200
Carefully maintaining the stability of each timeline

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,040
Protecting the peaceful lives of all townspeople

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
Unwaveringly guarding

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
This centuries-old Tui Town

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,440
The mother river in the hearts of Tui Town's people

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,400
The Wukenai River

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,480
Is not actually a real river

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,520
But rather a magical water source

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,600
That connects different dimensions

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,560
Perhaps this Wukenai River

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Is actually a black hole

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,560
If you put a message bottle containing

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
Someone's dying wish into the river

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
That final wish

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,800
Will come true after the desperate person passes

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
The Wukenai River's shape

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Is the infinity symbol

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,080
Representing endless cycles

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,960
Connecting to game dimension "Mysterious Player"

53
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,320
Movie dimension "Office Ghost Story"

54
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,640
Comic dimension "Cold-Blooded Academy"

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,120
Novel dimension "Five Bodies"

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,040
Each dimension

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,360
Was created by authors from higher dimensions

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,400
Forming a closed loop together

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
Using Wukenai River water to water a wooden cabinet

60
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,720
Can activate a dimension-breaking mechanism

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,000
To send messages to lower dimensions

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
All this is recorded

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
In an ancient book called "Secrets of Tui Town"

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
"Secrets of Tui Town"

65
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,760
This book has long rested

66
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,840
At the bottom of Wukenai River

67
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,720
While fulfilling my duty

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,440
I follow one principle

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,520
Never interfere

70
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,000
I understand well

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,640
That just a butterfly's wing flap

72
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,160
In one dimension

73
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,000
Could cause

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,240
A tornado in another dimension

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
Got shot

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,160
Even worse, it directly caused the dimensional wall to rupture

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,120
Plunging all four dimensions into

78
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,800
A vast and prolonged chaos

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,080
Every time cracks appear in the dimensional wall

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
I can faintly sense it

81
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,400
One day

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
I discovered that the book "The Secret of Tui Town"

83
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,400
from the River of Helplessness

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,240
Had disappeared near the novel dimension

85
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,760
Not long after

86
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,600
Cracks also appeared in the dimensional wall

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,560
I knew

88
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
It was time for me to take action

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,560
After investigating

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,160
I found that someone from the novel dimension

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
Had taken "The Secret of Tui Town"

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,160
If he learns everything in the book

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,400
He might use the waters of Wukenai River

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,120
To disrupt the balance between dimensions

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,080
So

96
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,000
I came to the novel's world

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
Tui Cyber Robot Exhibition Hall

98
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,360
In this robot exhibition hall

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,160
I conducted a thorough search

100
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,360
It appears that

101
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,000
There was just a small explosion

102
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,680
But I

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Couldn't find "The Secret of Tui Town"

104
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,040
When I entered the exhibition hall again

105
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,640
I encountered a group of

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,920
Kind and friendly robots

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Who are you?

108
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,800
My identity is related to "The Secret of Tui Town"

109
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,480
They told me

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
In a secret room within the exhibition hall

111
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,480
They saw the cover of "The Secret of Tui Town"

112
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
But unfortunately

113
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
The contents were already gone

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,960
Next to the cover

115
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,880
There was also robot product information

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,040
The one who took "The Secret of Tui Town"

117
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Was a domestic helper robot called

118
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,320
Beiju

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,920
She was imprisoned in the secret room

120
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,040
After killing the abusive father

121
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
While overprotecting the children

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,080
Looking at the broken wall

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,160
She must have escaped

124
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
It seems this robot Beiju

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,480
Has learned the secret of Wukenai River

126
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,080
Perhaps she contacted people from other dimensions

127
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,880
The authors of those dimensions might be in danger

128
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,360
I must find Beiju as soon as possible

129
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,720
While tracking Beiju

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,240
I discovered four dimension authors

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
Were indeed in danger

132
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,320
You're in this together too

133
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,480
I'll change

134
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,120
I'll change, alright?

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,760
I'll change, I'll change

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,920
The shell tools must have used the water of Wukenai River

137
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,240
to send messages to people across dimensions

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,520
They formed a mysterious organization called B

139
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,960
Meaning they're all tragic figures from different dimensions

140
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,520
Even if you know my plan,

141
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,400
you still can't stop Organization B.

142
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,920
This organization operates across different dimensions,

143
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,160
attempting to control the authors of each dimension.

144
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,680
Except for Goose whose whereabouts they haven't found yet,

145
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,320
all other authors have been located.

146
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,120
I returned to the novel dimension's

147
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Cyber Robot Museum,

148
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,160
to invite five righteous and enthusiastic robots

149
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,600
to help me stop Organization B's plans.

150
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,200
May we succeed.

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,040
We'll split into two teams.

152
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,640
They'll enter through the museum's

153
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,080
virtual gaming room

154
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,680
to access "The Mysterious Player"

155
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,640
and search for clues about Organization B.

156
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,440
Welcome to the game world of "Mystery Player"

157
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,000
Meanwhile, I continued tracking Bei Ju's whereabouts

158
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Following the trail of those Organization B robots

159
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
I arrived at a place called

160
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
the Robot Scrap Recycling Center

161
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
Could Bei Ju be hiding here?

162
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,720
I sneaked inside

163
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,400
And indeed found the hidden

164
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
inner pages of "The Secret of Tui Town"

165
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,000
Along with the captured game designer, E

166
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,160
Just as I was about to find Bei Ju

167
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
My eyes suddenly stung with pain

168
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
It was the water from Wu Kenai River

169
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Once my eyes are touched by Wu Kenai River's water

170
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
I lose all my abilities

171
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,720
After Organization B ambushed me with the river water

172
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
They took both me and E

173
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,800
To a secret room in the Robot Exhibition Hall

174
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
And locked us up

175
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
After I lost all my abilities

176
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
Organization B forced E

177
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,680
To transmit a message to

178
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,880
Dilraba, Xiao Bai, Xiao Ning, Xiao He, and Xiao Ke

179
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,760
Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me?

180
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
The method to force robots into hibernation

181
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,120
Should be near the virtual harp

182
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,200
Lure them to activate the exhibition hall's

183
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,560
Permanent hibernation device

184
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,800
This way

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
We'll open a data backdoor

186
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,600
For Bei Ju to control the exhibition hall

187
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
But we'll be trapped inside

188
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,200
The Tui Cyber Robot Exhibition Hall

189
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,560
Forever unable to leave

190
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,360
Fortunately though

191
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,120
With the help of five brave and clever robots

192
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
My abilities were restored

193
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Thank you for helping restore my powers

194
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
I opened the Robot Exhibition Hall's doors

195
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,120
Successfully capturing both Organization B and Bei Ju

196
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,840
And Tui Town's dimension will soon be restored

197
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,560
The future

198
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,200
I will continue to protect the stability of the Tui Town dimension

199
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,120
Perhaps even more dangerous things await me

200
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
await the people of Tui Town

201
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,680
Who knows

202
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
"Let's Push It! X"

203
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,200
Today marks the finale.

204
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000
See you next season!

205
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,520
Bye-bye
