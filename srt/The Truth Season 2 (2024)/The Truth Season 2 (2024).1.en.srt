1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,840
2022

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,560
In a secluded seaside building

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,560
"Let's Start Deducing" begins the story of Tuishi Apartment No. 11

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,720
After a year and a half,

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,800
we arrived at Chikan, Guangdong.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,520
This is an ancient town spanning over 700,000 square meters,

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,600
with a 370-year history.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:26,960
An ancient town with 370 years of history.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,760
Here, arcades stand in rows and fishing boats cluster densely.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,560
The clanging tramways

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,520
awaken the slumbering streets.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,440
Such an ancient town

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,520
naturally makes us wonder:

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,480
how many storms has it weathered,

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,080
and how many poignant tales does it hold?

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,440
Thus, we wrote "The Ballad of Tui Town"

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,480
When the question mark music box softly plays its nursery rhyme

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,240
Tui Town reveals its eerie and ever-changing nature

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,440
In the days to come

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,200
Let us immerse ourselves in this new alternate world

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,240
By entering four different eras of Tui Town

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,560
Meeting its diverse residents

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,200
Together we'll uncover the ultimate truth hidden deep within

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,160
As the investigation team prepares to enter Tui Town

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,240
What trials await them?

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,800
Hold your breath and focus

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,920
It's so dark here

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,200
What kind of place is this?

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,880
Can't see anything

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,760
You don't know what's going on either

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,200
It's dark outside too

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,200
Around here

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,880
Do they have any local snacks?

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,920
It's nothing

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,000
Where are you taking me?

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,880
This looks like a construction site

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,120
Or farmland

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,000
You wouldn't drag me out at night

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
Just to farm, would you?

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,200
I feel like

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,320
no one is likely to come

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,520
Could it be

43
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Let me check

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,320
During the live stream the other day,

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it was mentioned

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,920
that "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 2

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
is not scary at all.

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,360
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 2

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
We still need to consider

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,360
the more timid viewers

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,960
right?

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
Last season someone was extremely timid

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,600
and got laughed at

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
This time I should at least

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,200
show some personal growth

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,320
Be a bit braver this time

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,160
Grow into this bold

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,320
kind of character

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,080
Liu the Brave

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,480
Please take this box

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,960
What is this?

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,320
Hello, player Dilraba.

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,080
Welcome aboard

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,680
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 2

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,520
Hello player Liu Yuning

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,080
Welcome to the team

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,160
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 2

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,520
Now

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,040
You have arrived at the entrance of Reasoning Town

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
Somewhere here

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,240
lies your Reasoning Town resident card

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,520
You need to find it

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
to officially enter Reasoning Town

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
I guess I'll set off alone

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
You can't do this.

76
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,920
Then what about me?

77
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't joke around

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
I am this place

79
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
You can go anywhere, right?

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,040
Yes

81
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,040
Goodbye

82
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,160
This is really too shady/dark.

83
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,560
This is so terrifying

84
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,240
I really can't see anything clearly

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,600
That's not how it is

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,320
I can't do it

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
I can't move a single step

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm completely stuck

89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,120
Usually these kinds of mysterious stories

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,320
happen at night

91
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,600
Hello

92
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,920
Hello

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Hello

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm the mayor of Tui Town

95
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,000
I have your Tui Town resident card

96
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,960
There's a map by the phone

97
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm at the Panwen Building marked on the map

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,320
Come find me quickly

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,080
Okay, wait a moment

100
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,760
Hello?

101
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
This person is so rude

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,920
Just because he's the mayor

103
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,320
doesn't mean he can be impolite

104
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,440
Didn't even say goodbye

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,080
Walk past the door facing him

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,960
Take the path behind you

107
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
After seeing the Genghua Village sign

108
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,400
Wow, it's so dark here

109
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,400
Is this really necessary?

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,320
No no no

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm already starting to regret this

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
Liu the Bold

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,120
Don't mess around like this

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,320
Is this season really that scary?

115
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,440
I really can't see anything clearly

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,600
Wait a moment

117
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
Why is this season like this

118
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,600
It's really not good for you to act like this late at night

119
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,160
Stop it, sis

120
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,200
I won't be able to record this show

121
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,480
I can't record like this

122
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,080
Seriously, I can't take it anymore

123
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,400
Hello

124
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,680
Hello

125
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,360
Good evening

126
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
So you were just copying me

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,880
Bye-bye

128
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,200
Go to bed early

129
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm sorry

130
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,040
Can't see

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,680
Can't see, it's me

132
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,960
Can't see

133
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,240
This is the entrance

134
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,240
Go left

135
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
Stop messing around

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,600
In that case, this won't work for me.

137
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,640
Don't scare me, thank you.

138
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,200
This is so embarrassing.

139
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,240
It's okay.

140
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,600
Stop fooling around

141
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
The performance is tomorrow

142
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
How about

143
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,840
Are you

144
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,240
Let's do it again

145
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm begging you

146
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,320
Don't

147
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,680
Please, I'm begging you

148
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,520
You sang wonderfully

149
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,040
Thank you

150
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,680
Please don't come closer, thank you

151
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,880
Okay, no problem

152
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,640
Excuse me

153
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,040
Sorry about that

154
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,400
My apologies for disturbing you

155
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I thought he was the town mayor

156
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,120
Oh my god

157
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,360
What is this thing?

158
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,160
Town head

159
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,640
Playing these tricks

160
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,640
I can go anywhere in this place

161
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,280
Right?

162
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,480
Are there any clues here?

163
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,360
Hello

164
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Can you speak?

165
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,960
Never mind, let's focus on the task

166
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Go further into Genghua Village

167
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,040
Town Mayor

168
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,920
Town Mayor

169
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Attention all residents of Tui Town,

170
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,400
there is a

171
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,160
strange man in black

172
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,920
running wildly through town,

173
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,080
shaking his head,

174
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,160
acting arrogantly

175
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,000
and shouting loudly.

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,920
The town mayor

177
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,520
suddenly

178
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,720
the man in black rushed toward

179
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,040
the residents performing opera.

180
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,520
He seemed even more excited,

181
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,880
sprinting at full speed

182
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
toward the opera performers.

183
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,240
"The performance is tomorrow,

184
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,360
why don't we

185
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,800
run through it one more time?"

186
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
The two looked at each other without a word

187
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Silence

188
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Still silent

189
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,760
You go attend to your business

190
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,760
If you're fine, I'll take a look

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
Our residents seem

192
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,280
to be frightened

193
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't know what this person

194
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,640
is actually doing here

195
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,920
Earlier there were two other

196
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,320
strange-looking men

197
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,920
also acting suspiciously here

198
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,480
Don't

199
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,040
Don't know what these three people

200
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,440
are actually up to

201
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
Our town's surveillance

202
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,520
has also recorded in real-time

203
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,680
the appearances of these three people

204
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Now posted throughout town

205
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,320
Residents please stay safe

206
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,680
and avoid unnecessary movement

207
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,480
This must be the place

208
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,640
Town Mayor

209
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,760
This village really knows how to save electricity.

210
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Town Head

211
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,640
Right.

212
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,480
I really can't record like this.

213
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,080
I genuinely can't record this kind of show.

214
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,960
I don't want to record anymore.

215
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,680
I really don't want to continue recording.

216
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Town Mayor.

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Town Mayor

218
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
Town Mayor

219
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,280
Hello, Town Leader

220
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
Town Leader

221
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Honorable Town Leader

222
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,760
You guys play this kind of game

223
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,400
Hello

224
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
You finally found me

225
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,880
Hello

226
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Finally, a living person

227
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,520
Thank you

228
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,120
How scary

229
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,040
There isn't a single light in this park

230
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,840
That's so scary

231
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,560
Is there something on the ground?

232
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,480
What the hell

233
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,400
A spider

234
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,080
So what

235
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
What is this?

236
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,200
You scared me!

237
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,160
So someone else is going to come out and scare me?

238
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,960
Really?

239
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,560
You really shouldn't do this.

240
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,320
Don't come any closer.

241
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,360
To be honest, I'm quite scared.

242
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
But I have to pretend to stay calm.

243
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,560
Is this the village?

244
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,040
Is this the village?

245
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,880
Go inside

246
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,360
It's a bit scary in here

247
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,920
Go inside behind the sign

248
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,640
Follow the map

249
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,960
Wait a moment

250
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,480
It's this way

251
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,280
What's that sound

252
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,840
Don't be like this

253
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,640
Then you catch it

254
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,360
Can you help me catch the chicken?

255
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,200
Then you catch it.

256
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
I'll help you catch it.

257
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,840
No

258
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,080
I'm scared

259
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm scared of chickens

260
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,720
No, I'm scared of chickens

261
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,480
Did you catch it?

262
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,720
Hello

263
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Are you going to do it again?

264
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,040
Look how plump this chicken is.

265
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,800
No.

266
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,400
I’m really scared of chickens.

267
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,040
They peck people.

268
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,480
Whatever you do, don’t—

269
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,760
Just put it in.

270
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,680
A plump chicken is perfect for making big-plate chicken.

271
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,840
The stewed chicken soup would be delicious.

272
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,800
Sure.

273
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,480
We can stew it.

274
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,320
Why don’t you pluck its feathers first?

275
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,400
Then put it in.

276
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
You scared me

277
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,800
Judging from the direction, it should be here

278
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,680
Panwen Building

279
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Is this the place?

280
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,040
Is this person about to move?

281
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,680
You can move now.

282
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,720
Hello.

283
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,200
I thought it was a sculpture

284
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
This is the place, right?

285
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
That scared me to death

286
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
Hello

287
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,080
You're still working this late at night

288
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,320
Yeah

289
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,120
Do you know where the town mayor is?

290
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,960
Right here

291
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,440
You've worked hard

292
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,480
You scared me

293
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,880
You're good

294
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,320
Good work ethic

295
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,680
Still working late at night

296
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,120
Go get some rest early

297
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,800
What the hell is this

298
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,000
What is this thing

299
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,400
Look at this

300
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
I’ll really have nightmares

301
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,040
Hello

302
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Can you be quiet?

303
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,360
You finally found me

304
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,360
Hello

305
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,040
That's really scary, you know

306
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
Did you have a smooth trip here?

307
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,320
It was alright.

308
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,880
My child is quite mischievous.

309
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
He often scatters his toys everywhere

310
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,880
Your child has quite unique tastes

311
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,120
You sought me out

312
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,880
to obtain a residence permit, right?

313
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,560
Yes

314
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,600
I can give it to you

315
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,400
but on one condition

316
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,800
You must learn "The Song of Tui Town"

317
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,360
First, go to Panli Building.

318
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,640
Try to find the music box.

319
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,080
We have to leave again?

320
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,520
Follow the melody of the music box.

321
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,240
Learn "The Song of Tuizhen."

322
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,600
Master both the melody and lyrics.

323
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,840
After learning it, return to Panwen Building.

324
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,120
Sing it loudly into the microphone.

325
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,880
Okay.

326
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,800
Alright.

327
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,920
Understood.

328
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,480
It's fine.

329
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,640
No problem.

330
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,480
Teacher, don't scare me.

331
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,000
Thank you.

332
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,560
That's enough.

333
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,680
This is the place

334
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,440
Who

335
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,080
Who

336
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,440
Sorry

337
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,240
Sorry

338
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,480
That's so scary

339
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,480
What is this spilled everywhere

340
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
What are you doing?

341
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,720
That's so mean.

342
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,680
Someone upstairs splashed water down.

343
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,160
They have no manners at all.

344
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,480
I thought it was raining.

345
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,560
I'm really sorry about that.

346
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,720
It's okay.

347
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,200
Gourd water bottle

348
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,400
Music box

349
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
What's that?

350
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,680
Mayor Fang Esq., your package has arrived at

351
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,000
Zaoshanju Restaurant.

352
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,400
The package contains your custom-made

353
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
music box winding key.

354
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,200
Please check and confirm receipt.

355
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,480
The tracking number for the winding key

356
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,240
is written on a separate note.

357
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,640
Oh, need to find the key (winding mechanism).

358
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,640
Let me first examine this maze.

359
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Starting point.

360
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,040
End point.

361
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,560
2024.

362
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,320
What does this mean?

363
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,240
This maze can't be solved either.

364
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,040
Haven't we already marked it as "dead end"?

365
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,000
How exactly are we supposed to solve this?

366
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,480
Let's take a walk.

367
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
I knew he couldn't escape from that room.

368
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,480
There are so many boxes here.

369
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,880
These must be the deliveries.

370
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
All of them are addressed to the town mayor.

371
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll start from this point

372
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,160
20

373
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Select the tracking number starting with 20

374
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,920
That'll do

375
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,800
Not 26, it's 20

376
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,960
Here's one starting with 202

377
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,600
Let me check

378
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,520
First find the 2024 ones

379
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,040
Never mind

380
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,640
Just look for ones starting with 20

381
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,040
Okay

382
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,520
Don't worry about it

383
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,320
Let's open one first

384
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
What do you mean?

385
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,520
Let me take a look at this maze first.

386
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Starting point

387
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,920
Destination

388
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
2024

389
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,200
What does this mean?

390
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,120
We can't even navigate this maze

391
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,880
What do you mean?

392
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,520
Is it three-dimensional?

393
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,040
Is it cylindrical?

394
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,240
Or like this?

395
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,320
Triangular.

396
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
20.

397
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,920
Understood

398
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,200
Is this it?

399
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,120
20240

400
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,840
Finally, it's 78.

401
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,560
This is it.

402
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:41,640
This is the one.

403
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
2024

404
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,160
This is 2024

405
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,200
So what I thought was correct

406
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,600
Just look for ones starting with 2024

407
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,280
Here's one starting with 202

408
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
This one

409
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,520
Alright, thanks

410
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,840
Alright, this is the one.

411
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,520
Is there any way to get through this maze?

412
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,440
Is this the way?

413
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,360
8

414
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,800
This is the one.

415
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,920
So smart.

416
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,000
Just too timid.

417
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
Is this how I should play?

418
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,920
This path doesn't work either.

419
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,680
Even after folding it, this still doesn't work.

420
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,480
Okay

421
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,600
We'll use the process of elimination

422
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
It's quite similar to this one

423
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
This one is also similar

424
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,120
This one is clearly not it

425
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,360
No

426
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,520
It must be one of these two

427
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,600
See that?

428
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,400
It's so simple.

429
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,280
Alright, alright.

430
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,440
Doing all this.

431
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,240
Sis

432
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,200
Music box

433
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,760
What's that sound

434
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,840
So hard

435
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,680
It's over

436
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,160
For me,

437
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,920
This song is too difficult

438
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,960
Something pierced my palm

439
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,280
Cold pierced my palm

440
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,760
So many words

441
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,560
Do I have to memorize all this?

442
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,880
Come on, let's go again

443
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,080
Please begin your performance

444
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,480
Tick tock tick tock

445
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,400
Tick tock tick tock

446
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,160
Every word is a riddle

447
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,720
Are you hidden yet?

448
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,760
Here we go

449
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,440
Are you hidden yet?

450
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,760
This is how it's sung

451
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Tick tock tick tock

452
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,840
The brush stains secrets red

453
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,880
Traces left on paper

454
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Are silent counterattacks

455
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,520
Who wears at all times

456
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,280
The mask that can't be removed

457
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,120
Tick tock tick tock

458
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,360
Tick tock tick tock

459
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,120
The brush stains secrets red

460
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,880
Thorns grow on the keyboard

461
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,640
Right?

462
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,000
The keyboard's covered in thorns

463
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,840
Piercing cold palms

464
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,440
Coldness stabs into palms

465
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,920
Are you hidden yet?

466
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,240
Here we go, wake up

467
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,600
Okay

468
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,720
Speechless

469
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,920
Do it again

470
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,120
Wake up

471
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,480
Good heavens

472
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,720
Let me tell you

473
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,200
I could be a tour guide here

474
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,000
Sorry

475
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,960
Let's try again

476
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,560
What should I do?

477
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,960
This isn't...

478
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,440
The more nervous I get, the harder it is to memorize

479
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Tick tock tick tock

480
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,240
The brush stains secrets red

481
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,080
Traces left on the paper

482
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,120
Are a silent counterattack

483
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,680
Tick tock tick tock

484
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,960
The brush stains red

485
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,080
Secrets

486
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,080
Let me take another look

487
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,120
What did the brush paint red

488
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,880
A secret stained red

489
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,160
Tick tock tick

490
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,480
Traces left on the paper

491
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,840
Are a silent counterattack

492
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,680
Brother, I'm back again

493
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,200
I still have to

494
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,360
Light myself up, right

495
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,640
Congratulations on learning

496
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
"The Song of Tui Town"

497
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,240
Thank you

498
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
As promised

499
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,600
Here's your Tui Town resident card

500
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,480
Thank you, Town Chief

501
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,120
Thank you, Village Chief

502
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm the Town Chief

503
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,280
Town Chief

504
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,520
Alright, thank you

505
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Welcome back, veteran players

506
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,920
to the second season of "Let's Start Deduction"

507
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,680
It's our pleasure

508
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,200
Welcome

509
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
Hello

510
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,480
Come

511
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,120
Welcome

512
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,840
Come

513
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,720
Hello, everyone

514
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,080
Hello

515
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,040
You're too kind

516
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,880
Pleased to meet you

517
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,600
Welcome, Brother Xun

518
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,600
Happy

519
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,160
Brother Xun

520
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,240
Long time no see

521
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,160
Long time no see, Brother Xun

522
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,640
Long time no see

523
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,560
Long time no see, Brother Xun

524
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,160
Have a seat

525
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,120
Welcome, six players

526
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,800
to *Start Guessing* Season 2

527
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
I believe everyone has gained some understanding

528
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,960
of Tuizhen through last night's challenges.

529
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,520
Some creatures here are neither human nor ghost,

530
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,600
just strange species living among us.

531
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,280
Yes, the residents of our Tuizhen town

532
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,840
don't seem quite normal.

533
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,120
That girl looked at me strangely yesterday,

534
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,640
but it somehow felt reassuring.

535
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,000
They're all at least

536
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,320
over 180cm tall.

537
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,160
It gave me goosebumps.

538
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,480
Stop joking around.

539
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,360
Yes

540
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,280
As soon as the lights go off

541
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,920
we all shrink to 1.3 meters tall

542
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,400
To be honest, it scared me

543
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,840
Really?

544
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,120
Because I've never played before

545
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,040
Never tried it

546
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,640
So last night really frightened me

547
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,320
All those sudden scares

548
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,400
I just hope all you veteran players

549
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,040
all you brothers

550
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,720
can look out for me

551
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,200
I'm really easily scared

552
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,000
Don't worry, Brother Ning is here

553
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,320
Really?

554
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,520
What he means is

555
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,200
with me here

556
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,800
you definitely won't be the most timid one

557
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,640
That's what he means

558
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,400
No need to fear, just follow me

559
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,640
Go away

560
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,800
Help!

561
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,760
Question mark

562
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,680
Yes, a question mark

563
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,720
A question mark indicates there's a mission.

564
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,960
Isn't this obvious?

565
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,280
We could've guessed this too.

566
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,640
As for this question mark,

567
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,440
it's an emblem of our town.

568
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,920
It also symbolizes the unknown.

569
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,320
It's something we need to explore

570
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,120
The question mark is our most crucial symbol

571
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,920
The question mark represents the rules of the "Alternate Dimension World"

572
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,000
So what are the rules for this season?

573
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,120
Open the box

574
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,160
and you'll find out

575
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,760
What character is this?

576
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,800
There's also a password.

577
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,000
You do it.

578
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,320
You can handle it.

579
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,000
Um

580
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,120
Right

581
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,080
We should test them

582
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,600
Let them try

583
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,800
Give the new players a chance

584
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,520
Which one of you three wants to go?

585
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,280
You're actually quite nice

586
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,880
What do you mean?

587
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,720
I think

588
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,280
We need to use this character

589
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,520
to open this combination lock

590
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,040
I genuinely don't recognize this character

591
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,640
This...

592
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,680
I don't know it either

593
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,240
What character is this?

594
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,520
Does this character even exist?

595
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,280
Too hot to handle

596
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,560
Burning hot

597
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,280
No good

598
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,760
We new players can't figure this out

599
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,400
Veteran player, what's your approach?

600
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,880
Keyu

601
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,360
I think we should leave this to you

602
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
Yesterday I already

603
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,600
bragged about you

604
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,720
Keyu is really good at this

605
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,800
Come on, quickly

606
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,640
Show us how it's done

607
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,400
Finally got the chance

608
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,920
to become a newbie

609
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,920
What's your approach?

610
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,520
Guessing randomly is pointless.

611
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,120
I'm just looking at what letters are here.

612
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,440
What ideas do you have?

613
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,320
My approach is to just pry it open.

614
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,600
We can't use brute force to dismantle it

615
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,080
I'm sure it must be a word

616
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,880
English letters - this must be a word

617
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,280
Or it could be an idiom

618
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,360
That's possible too

619
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,760
There are too many characters with the single person radical

620
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,720
Way too many

621
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,000
What can this be broken down into?

622
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,200
This definitely contains the character for 'doubt'

623
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,360
First let's think of idioms containing 'doubt'

624
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,560
Hurry up

625
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,360
I can't wait any longer

626
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,400
"疑" is blank

627
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,040
"疑" is blank, quick

628
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,360
No "疑"

629
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,960
The fourth one has a Y

630
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,440
Find one

631
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,440
Just have "疑" in the last character

632
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,040
What "疑"?

633
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,960
Half-believing, half-doubting

634
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,160
Don't say it

635
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,800
BXBY

636
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,880
Half-believing, half-doubting

637
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,520
Half-convinced, half-skeptical

638
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,760
Impressive

639
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,640
Half

640
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
The "person" radical from the character "believe"

641
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,120
The right component of the character "doubt"

642
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,800
Rule card

643
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,680
Six players

644
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,880
Will role-play in the show

645
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,880
Enter the "Alternate Dimension World" of Tui Town

646
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,440
Tui Town

647
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:37,920
Is a

648
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,480
Over 700,000 square meters in size

649
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,440
Century-old ancient town

650
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,120
Players will in this season's show

651
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,480
Travel through Tui Town's

652
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,240
Four different time periods

653
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,440
In every timeline,

654
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,040
several cases will occur.

655
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,920
Six players per episode

656
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,440
Will be divided into four suspects

657
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,200
And two detectives to solve the case

658
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,920
The real culprit hides among the suspects

659
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,880
The culprit's mission

660
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,560
Is to conceal their identity

661
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,400
Without being discovered by others

662
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,000
Only the real culprit can lie

663
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,720
Notably

664
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,640
This season introduces new gameplay

665
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,320
The player as the culprit

666
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,240
If they pass a certain test

667
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
Can choose between the two detectives

668
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,680
To turn one into an X

669
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,800
X's mission is

670
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,720
During subsequent investigations

671
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,560
To help the culprit escape

672
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,600
Winning conditions:

673
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,120
After solving the case

674
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,120
Players vote for the culprit

675
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,480
If the culprit receives

676
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,120
Fewer votes than others

677
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,880
Then culprit and X get golden keys

678
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,120
Otherwise correct voters

679
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,520
Get golden keys

680
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,640
About turning someone:

681
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,360
What test must they pass?

682
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,920
The culprit player

683
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,760
Must pass a mental challenge

684
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,360
Can then choose between detectives

685
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,560
To turn one into X

686
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,880
Solve these puzzle boxes

687
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,960
Just solve one, similar to

688
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,440
Can't even do this?

689
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Seriously? Later they'll faint

690
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,520
This is already our show's

691
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,560
Maximum difficulty level

692
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,480
How come

693
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,200
Every challenge is "maximum difficulty"

694
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,360
Everything's "maximum difficulty" to you

695
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,480
If the test isn't passed

696
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,360
Then no X in this case

697
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,320
Won't solve it

698
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,680
No solving

699
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,560
No accomplice needed

700
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,200
Who needs an accomplice?

701
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,600
I'll do it myself

702
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,960
Myself is enough

703
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,000
Before Season 2 begins

704
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,800
Let’s come up with a team name, all six of you

705
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,560
Choose a team name

706
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,840
How about "Yu"?

707
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,400
Or "He"?

708
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,000
"Xun" could work too

709
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,280
"Xun-He"

710
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,880
Or something with "King"

711
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,320
Just put my "King" at the end

712
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,440
Like "Reasoning King"

713
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,160
That works

714
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,600
This one’s good

715
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,800
"He-Li"

716
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,840
"Standout Reasoning King"

717
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,760
"Standing Out"

718
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,200
We'll be using this name for a whole season.

719
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,600
You better think it through carefully.

720
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,160
It's just like choosing a license plate number.

721
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,520
Once you choose, you can't change it.

722
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,160
Heli.

723
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,280
Let's go with Heli.

724
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,120
We've eliminated all other options.

725
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,440
Now it's just between us two.

726
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,520
Heli it is.

727
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,840
Heli Yu.

728
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,400
Heli Moyo.

729
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,120
River Fishing Reasoning King.

730
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,520
"River Fishing" works.

731
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,400
I love this name so much.

732
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,560
River Fishing.

733
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,640
Whether it makes sense isn't important.

734
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,920
What matters is that we like it.

735
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,200
I think this name is great.

736
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,200
Who knows if we'll catch fish or shrimp.

737
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,440
Or something else entirely.

738
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,400
It's quite interesting, you know.

739
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,720
Amusing.

740
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,080
River Fishing Reasoning King.

741
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,160
Let the reasoning begin.

742
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,600
What are you all laughing at?

743
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,640
Don't you feel a bit embarrassed?

744
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,320
Nope.

745
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:05,920
Come on.

746
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,440
Let's do this properly.

747
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,080
Sorry.

748
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,840
Here we go.

749
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,080
River Fishing Reasoning King.

750
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,920
Begin.

751
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,880
What's wrong?

752
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,320
River Reasoning Fish.

753
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,280
River Fishing.

754
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,880
Reasonable Reasoning Fishing King.

755
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,360
Sorry, let's try again.

756
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,360
Ready, three, two, one.

757
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,520
River Fishing Reasoning King.

758
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,760
"Let the Reasoning Begin" Season 2.

759
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,120
Follow in the footsteps of the detective team

760
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,360
Let's deeply explore Tui Town together
