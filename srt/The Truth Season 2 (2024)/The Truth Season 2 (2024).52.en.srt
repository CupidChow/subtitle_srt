1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
Over the past two weeks,

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,800
the "Helimoyu" detective team

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,880
arrived at the final era of Tui Town—

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,200
the Cyber Age.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,720
In this era,

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,040
the detective team transformed into

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,560
investigators solving cases.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,160
Nobody move!

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,680
Stand up!

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,480
Stay serious!

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,760
After solving the first case,

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,960
the exhibition hall was suddenly stormed by

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,480
several fierce and mysterious figures in black.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,560
They forcibly captured everyone except Xiao Jin,

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,960
seizing the five robots

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,280
and imprisoning them all in a hidden chamber—

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
the "Tui Cyber Vault."

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
Using neural connectors,

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,080
they linked to the brain-machine interfaces on the five captives' necks,

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,400
claiming they would access the memories stored within.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,120
Their goal: to assist Beiju

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
in locating a critically important individual.

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,000
Who are these ruthless figures in black?

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,280
What ties does Beiju have with them?

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,160
And who is this pivotal person they seek?

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,160
As the group was drugged unconscious,

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,080
a fragmented memory from

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
June 27, 2036

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,240
began to surface...

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,640
Cyber Psychiatric Hospital

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,160
A falling incident occurred

32
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,280
The pusher

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,200
The leg is broken like this

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
The pusher jumped off the building

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,480
The real killer, Ba's father, actually used

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,440
brain-computer interface

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,640
to invade their consciousness from the backend

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
and manipulated Heli to kill the pusher

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,240
I

40
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,000
The murderer

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,440
Finally, Scientist Ke met

42
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,280
his long-missing sister Keke

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,120
So many handsome guys

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,000
And Keke is also called "Goose"

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,560
As a game designer

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,000
she developed the game "Mysterious Player"

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,280
"Mysterious Player"

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,040
Just as everyone was celebrating

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,560
suddenly a mysterious voice in black was heard

50
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Goose is Scientist Ke's sister Keke

51
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
We've finally found her

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,880
She's hiding in Cyber Peach Blossom Spring

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,360
Let's go capture her now

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,080
So the key person they've been searching for

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,960
is the long-missing "Goose"

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Then,

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
The people from 2048

58
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,800
gradually awaken.

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,560
Trapped in a secret room,

60
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
what will they encounter next?

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
What plans do Beiju and the mysterious black-clad figures

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,960
truly have?

63
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
The mysterious woman who appeared earlier

64
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,480
and the "Secret of Tui Town"

65
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
she mentioned—

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,680
what do they point to?

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
Will the ultimate secret of Tui Town, spanning centuries,

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,560
finally come to light?

69
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,080
Wake up

70
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,480
What's going on?

71
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,800
I was drugged

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,040
What is this thing?

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,360
Connect the neural interface to the brain-computer port.

74
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,400
Now we need to search through their memories

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,480
to find that crucial person.

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,920
Once we sedate them, we can access their memories.

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,720
I think that's how it works.

78
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,480
Is this a prison?

79
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,240
We need to find a way to escape now.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,880
Exactly.

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,640
I escaped

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,040
We made it out.

83
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,840
By any means necessary.

84
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,480
This plan is brilliant.

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Weren't we locked up here yesterday by that person

86
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
in this place?

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,120
Let's get out of here now.

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,800
Inside here...

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
That person yesterday...

90
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
In our dream, didn't they say

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
she was the boss?

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
I must help Beiju

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
complete this mission.

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
Beiju...

95
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,760
right?

96
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,320
Beiju.

97
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
What's this solution?

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,680
This is a...

99
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,720
Is this the enter key?

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,520
Or what?

101
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,200
Let me see, let me check what's going on.

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
Boss said it's done as you instructed.

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,920
Changed the password hint for this room.

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,840
Which room did he mean?

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,480
Yes, it's this one.

106
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
This room, this prison cell, right?

107
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,280
This is the one, yes?

108
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,840
Prison.

109
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,360
Okay.

110
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
Red, black.

111
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,920
Isn't it made of English letters?

112
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Is it?

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
This is an English letter, right?

114
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,040
What English letter is this?

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,400
This isn't the letter Z.

116
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,320
3.

117
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,200
First digit: 3.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,480
Why is it 3?

119
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,640
Explain it to me.

120
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
The idea is to flip the black part around.

121
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,680
Combine them to form the number 3.

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
Flip it like this.

123
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,840
Rotate it accordingly.

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,400
Three-dimensional flip.

125
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,040
Then this...

126
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,840
Match black with black, red with red.

127
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes, they all become...

128
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,560
3.

129
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,240
6.

130
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,080
2.

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,520
8.

132
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,760
Done.

133
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
All set.

134
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,680
You're today's puzzle master, aren't you?

135
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,560
What's going on?

136
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,920
What do you mean?

137
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,560
Now begins the mystery of our identities.

138
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,320
Tui Le Gate

139
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,600
In these turbulent times,

140
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,920
Tui Le Gate is the only haven in town.

141
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,360
Tui Manghuo Foreign Trade Company

142
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,840
celebrates its 8th anniversary

143
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,480
Perform well today

144
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,600
Welcome to Tui Town Art Academy

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,320
for our annual school celebration

146
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
You will see

147
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,800
the presence of happiness

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,680
Tui Cyber Technology Company

149
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,400
is hosting a grand robot exhibition

150
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,240
May I return to the pod, Master?

151
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Goose

152
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,640
Goose is his sister

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,720
Isn't Goose his sister?

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Wow, so many handsome guys

155
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,080
Little brother

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,960
I'm your sister, do you remember me?

157
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,520
I'm Keke

158
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,200
Keke

159
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
Where have you been?

160
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,840
I went to Tui Taoyuan

161
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,560
The people there were very nice

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
They affectionately called me "Goose"

163
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Because I am

164
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Keke

165
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Goose is the Mysterious Player

166
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
That's right

167
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,760
Didn't my sister say she was at Tui Taoyuan

168
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,480
Developing that

169
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,760
New game

170
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,640
Called "Mysterious Player"

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
I was at Tui Taoyuan

172
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,880
Working on game design

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,320
My game is called

174
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,440
"Mysterious Player"

175
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
So the soldiers who detained us that day

176
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Were looking for my sister

177
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,280
My sister is at Tui Taoyuan

178
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,720
They wanted to find Goose

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
in our memories

180
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,680
Then that 8D is

181
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,440
That comic

182
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,640
What comic?

183
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,120
Just that one comic book

184
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
The drawings by 8D

185
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,520
These two books

186
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,440
"Five Bodies"

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,680
"Cold-Blooded High School"

188
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
Comic artist 8D

189
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,080
"The Mysterious Player"

190
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
"Hot-Blooded High School"

191
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,360
"Cold-Blooded High School"

192
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,160
Called "Cold-Blooded High School"

193
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,200
Isn't Director He your father?

194
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,680
My dad

195
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,760
"Office Has Secrets"

196
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,000
"Office Has Secrets"

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,120
"Office Has Secrets"

198
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,440
Okay, what's the last one?

199
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,240
What are we doing with soft hands?

200
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
"Three-Body" or something?

201
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,000
That infinite flow one

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
"Five Bodies"

203
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,760
So now he

204
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,040
Is displaying this big screen

205
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,920
What does it mean?

206
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,880
Why is Organization B looking for Goose?

207
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
Because they definitely want that person's works

208
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
Maybe by collecting all the works

209
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,920
They can summon

210
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,840
They can summon Goose

211
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
Not summon Goose

212
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,480
It's that Goose has one of her works

213
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,240
What he means is probably Organization B

214
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
Is about to face a new destiny

215
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,240
After collecting all the works

216
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,840
They might be able to rewrite something

217
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,040
Right, they want to

218
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,880
So they want to rewrite their destiny

219
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,840
That's why they need to find Goose

220
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,240
And then rewrite their fate

221
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,160
They're here.

222
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,400
Okay.

223
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,720
Come.

224
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,800
A beam of light in the dark night.

225
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,760
Let's move closer over here.

226
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,880
Is it nighttime?

227
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,400
Can we see something?

228
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,160
Not right now.

229
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,240
Someone's coming.

230
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,880
Mysterious girl.

231
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,520
You again.

232
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
We meet again.

233
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm Xiaoting.

234
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,760
You're Xiaoting?

235
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,200
Who are you?

236
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,920
My identity is related to the secret of Tui Town.

237
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,440
I can't tell you yet.

238
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,960
There's a book called "The Secret of Tui Town."

239
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Have you seen it?

240
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes.

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,560
Where?

242
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,120
In the prison.

243
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
But there was no book inside.

244
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,680
Only the cover.

245
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,360
Thank you.

246
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,640
Thank you for the information you provided last time.

247
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,680
I've already found out.

248
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
"The Secret of Tui Town" is in the hands of

249
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,640
a robot named Beiju.

250
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
And this Beiju

251
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,880
is a member of a mysterious organization called B.

252
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,000
Beiju is a domestic service robot.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,680
This organization aims to destroy Tui Town's peace.

254
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,520
My identity is the guardian of Tui Town.

255
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
I came today hoping

256
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,880
you could help me

257
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
stop Organization B's conspiracy together.

258
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,840
Okay.

259
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,840
This robot exhibition hall we're in now

260
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,520
is Organization B's headquarters.

261
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
Look at this big screen.

262
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,720
This should be their action plan.

263
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
From what I know,

264
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,320
Organization B has captured you before.

265
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,120
Yes.

266
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,840
Yes, they locked us up.

267
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,760
They locked us up.

268
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,920
They took everyone

269
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,360
and locked them in secret rooms.

270
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Imprisoned in their own cells.

271
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,360
Yes.

272
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
They captured you to search through your memories

273
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
to find the goose.

274
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,080
Why are they looking for a goose?

275
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
Because in 2036,

276
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
the last people who saw the goose

277
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
(Ke Ke's group)

278
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,280
were only White Noise,

279
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,000
He Li,

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Ke Scientist,

281
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,560
Babi,

282
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,280
and Ning Manzou.

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
I see you and your friends seem happy

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,120
staying here,

285
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,400
so I can rest easy.

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,720
I'll return to Tuoyuan first.

287
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,160
Bye.

288
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,920
Bye sister.

289
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,480
Bye.

290
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,160
But they've long been dead.

291
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,000
However, their expensive

292
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
brain-machine interfaces

293
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,760
were transplanted to Xiao Bai,

294
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,560
Xiao He,

295
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Xiao Ke,

296
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,040
Xiao Ba,

297
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,160
and Xiao Ning.

298
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,720
They indeed have

299
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,160
those five people's brain interfaces.

300
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,400
Every piece of clothing here

301
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,680
has resonance chips

302
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,520
that sync with your interfaces.

303
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,440
Don't mess this up,

304
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,880
or you'll regret it.

305
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Through the brain interfaces

306
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
and resonance chips on clothes,

307
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
we can load past memories

308
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,840
onto robotic bodies.

309
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,920
Organization B wants to use your memories

310
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,600
to locate the goose.

311
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,320
Right.

312
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Their obsession with the goose

313
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
relates to 2048's

314
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
most popular game.

315
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,480
"Mystery Player" - that's it.

316
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
So I need you to enter

317
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,960
the "Mystery Player" game.

318
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,880
I need to go investigate

319
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,760
Bei Ju, the leader of Organization B

320
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,080
We'll split up

321
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,800
to look for any traces of Organization B

322
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,640
Okay

323
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,160
No problem

324
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,800
This episode's game rules

325
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
The deduction team has solved nine murder cases in Tui Town

326
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,880
and gradually approached

327
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
the secret of Tui Town

328
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,400
Therefore, in this episode's rules

329
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,720
the deduction team will not solve murders

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,280
but instead assist Tui Town's guardian, Xiaoting

331
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,600
to thwart Organization B's conspiracy

332
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,080
and in the process

333
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,040
uncover Tui Town's secret

334
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,600
As far as I know

335
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
this is the virtual game hall

336
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,600
This is an access card I just found.

337
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,640
Thank you, Xiao Ting.

338
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,240
You can now enter the game.

339
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,960
Alright.

340
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,320
If you need anything,

341
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
you can contact me with this anytime.

342
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,680
Oh, we can make calls now too.

343
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,320
Which one is you?

344
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
I can contact you directly,

345
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
but you might not be able to reach me.

346
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,840
Shall we officially begin our mission now?

347
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,320
Yes.

348
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,040
Okay.

349
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
Wishing us success.

350
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,560
Alright.

351
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:33,960
Success.

352
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,320
We will.

353
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,320
Let's go!

354
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,360
Alright, let's do this.

355
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
Go, enter.

356
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,280
Come on.

357
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,800
He's afraid to go first again.

358
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,280
Don't push me.

359
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,640
You go first, bro.

360
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,120
I won't abandon the two of them.

361
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
Right, might just abandon you two.

362
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,040
Come on.

363
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,880
Ready.

364
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,120
Okay, it's open.

365
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,840
You're leading the way now, bro. Hurry!

366
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,240
Virtual Game Room

367
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,320
Insert Game Cartridge

368
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,000
To Begin the Virtual Gaming Experience

369
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
Then let's look for the cassette.

370
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,160
The cassette is in the box.

371
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,080
It must be here.

372
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,120
Turn it to the left.

373
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,040
Super Malo.

374
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,840
Contra Bull.

375
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,280
Tiger in the Kitchen.

376
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,400
What is this?

377
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,240
This is the password.

378
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,400
434.

379
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,840
It's 434.

380
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,720
Why 434?

381
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,560
Because of his name.

382
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,440
We can also try 124.

383
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
434 and 124.

384
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,080
434 didn't work.

385
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,120
124.

386
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,520
124.

387
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,280
That didn't work either.

388
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,400
124 didn't work?

389
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,040
Super Malo, Contra Bull, Tiger in the Kitchen.

390
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,960
What about zodiac signs?

391
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,320
Monkey, Ox, Tiger.

392
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,720
Monkey, Ox, Tiger.

393
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,080
Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat.

394
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,240
Monkey is the ninth.

395
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,360
So Ox is 2, Tiger is 3.

396
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,200
923.

397
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,480
That's it, this must be it.

398
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,640
9.

399
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,960
2.

400
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,080
3.

401
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,680
I'm cheating now.

402
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,480
Just take this one directly.

403
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,280
"The Mysterious Player"

404
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,200
"The Mysterious Player" - let's go.

405
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,440
"The Mysterious Player" - come on.

406
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,080
Have the courage to face the dialogue.

407
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay, let's go.

408
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,600
"The Mysterious Player"

409
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
The game plot of "The Mysterious Player"

410
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,120
Set in two eras 100 years apart

411
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
A mysterious time-space tunnel

412
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,880
Connects 1924 and 2024

413
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
The tragic songstress of Tuile Gate

414
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,120
Was traded as merchandise to

415
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,800
The black-hearted Tuijiankang Company

416
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Became a victim of organ trafficking

417
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,920
Among characters from both eras

418
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,480
People's destinies consequently underwent

419
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
Earth-shaking changes

420
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,120
Game protagonist Bali

421
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,880

422
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,560
Ning Shaoshuai

423
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,440

424
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,800
Ke Shaoshuai, Wang Legend

425
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,480
Supporting character Leye

426
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,480
Director He

427
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,520
Tragic songstress Mei Yunlianlian and others

428
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,320
So we've actually been playing this game all along

429
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,920
Right, we're actually the characters in the game

430
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,680
Possibly

431
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,480
Loading chapter

432
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,000
Premiere of Director He's new film

433
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,360
Strange occurrences keep happening at the venue

434
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,280
Bizarre incidents frequently occur on site

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
The gate to the virtual game

436
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,640
Is about to open

437
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000
This can be opened

438
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,640
What can be opened?

439
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,040
Can this be opened?

440
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,320
It won't move

441
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,960
It's coming for one

442
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,120
Welcome to

443
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,320

This is the premiere of "Office Ghost Story"

447
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,760
Is this drinkable?

448
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
There's even red wine

449
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,560
Yes

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,680

This tastes absolutely amazing

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,560
Let's try it, come on

453
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,720
Can we smash this?

454
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,440
Smash it

455
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,560
Let's smash it, smash one

456
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,480
Okay, use a cute voice.

457
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,560
Sing the nursery rhyme "Two Tigers."

458
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:49,880
Go ahead and sing.

459
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,240
Two tigers, two tigers,

460
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,440
running so fast.

461
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,360
Who's at my premiere event?

462
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,400
Looks like all my friends are here.

463
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,480
Hello, everyone.

464
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,320
Director He.

465
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,040
Greetings, everyone.

466
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,760
Hello, everyone.

467
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Welcome to the premiere of my new movie,

468
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,920
"Office Ghost Story."

469
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,400
That's right.

470
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,200
I am the director of this film,

471
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,120
and the Triple Push Award winner, Director He.

472
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,120
Triple Push Award.

473
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,120
Impressive.

474
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,760
And this person beside me

475
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
is Xiao Ru, the newest member of our studio.

476
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Ru.

477
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,560
Please take care of me.

478
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,200
You five distinguished guests look familiar.

479
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,920
Especially you.

480
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,800
You look like my son.

481
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,560
You're not He Jiawei.

482
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,680
I'm not He Jiawei.

483
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,120
You look 90% like him.

484
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,360
Yes, distant relatives.

485
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Seems like we're all connected by fate.

486
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,200
Alright then,

487
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,640
next up

488
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,720
is my new movie,

489
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,960
"Office Ghost Story,"

490
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,080
private screening.

491
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,560
But getting these

492
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,840
But getting these

493
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,280
exclusive screening passes won't be easy.

494
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,120
It won't be that simple.

495
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,480
Look there.

496
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,080
Here are some golden eggs.

497
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Inside these golden eggs,

498
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,640
are the challenges I've set

499
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
for these movie tickets.

500
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,920
If you can complete

501
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,400
the challenge inside a golden egg,

502
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
you'll get the movie ticket in my hand.

503
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Okay.

504
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,840
If you fail,

505
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
there's no penalty.

506
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:28,840
Alright.

507
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,000
That means you can take turns trying.

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,680
Understood.

509
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,320
Okay.

510
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,400
But there are limited golden eggs,

511
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,480
so you should seize the opportunity.

512
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,320
Got it.

513
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,080
Let's go.

514
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,120
Which player wants to go first?

515
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll go.

516
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,440
Okay.

517
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,640
I'll just pick one randomly.

518
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,960
Eat the cookie on your face without using hands.

519
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,840
Don't let the cookie fall.

520
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,200
Okay.

521
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
Is this even difficult?

522
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,200
I see.

523
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,920
You passed on the first try.

524
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,720
That tongue work is impressive.

525
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,080
Amazing.

526
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,760
Well done.

527
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,200
Congratulations.

528
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,800
You've directly earned

529
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,480
the first movie ticket pass.

530
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,360
My turn.

531
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,840
Seconds.

532
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,160
This one seems difficult.

533
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
You need to count exactly 10 seconds.

534
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,440
That's right.

535
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,200
There's a timer here.

536
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
I'll start it first.

537
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
You can watch for 3 seconds.

538
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,120
Then I'll take it away.

539
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,000
Stop when you think it's been 10 seconds.

540
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,280
I'll stop.

541
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,320
3, 2, 1.

542
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,240
1.

543
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,440
2.

544
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
3.

545
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,960
Stop

546
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,240
12 seconds

547
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
12 seconds

548
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,240
You're out

549
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,320
You didn't

550
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,600
Didn't you start 3 seconds early?

551
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Should we count those 3 seconds?

552
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,880
Count them

553
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,440
Count them

554
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,840
Right, challenge failed

555
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,320
Right, challenge failed

556
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,600
No problem, keep trying

557
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,120
15-second ultra-difficult hand gesture challenge

558
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,880
This exact ultra-difficult gesture

559
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,440
Can someone teach me how to do this?

560
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,040
This definitely needs to be bent this way

561
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,320
The middle finger should go here

562
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,760
Who can do this?

563
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm already stuck at this step.

564
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,480
Extremely difficult.

565
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,160
Is this even a move humans can perform?

566
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,680
Is that so?

567
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,560
Is that right?

568
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,600
Awesome

569
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,560
So impressive

570
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,440
Congratulations on helping that classmate

571
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,400
get a movie ticket

572
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
You can even do this?

573
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,240
Now this is true team spirit

574
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
Unity is strength

575
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,960
The challenger invites everyone to complete a song relay

576
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,240
Successfully connecting five lines from any song counts as completion

577
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,600
Connect using the last character

578
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,680
Continue with the last character

579
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,840
Then just sing any song you like

580
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,400
Okay

581
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,720
Awkward silence

582
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,720
Let's start from there

583
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,680
Of course, you'll have them continue later

584
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,360
Best to end with pronouns like you, me, him

585
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,960
Easier to continue that way, right

586
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,200
How much further to reach your heart

587
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,400
My heart beats, love begins to ache

588
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,760
Stayed up all night longing to hold your face

589
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,120
I cried and said sorry

590
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,760
Trapped me in this circle

591
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,280
Trapped me in this circle

592
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,160
Circles round and round

593
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,840
Day after day, year after year, it's me

594
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,560
Gazing deeply at your face

595
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,120
Face

596
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,120
Angry yet gentle

597
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
Complaining yet tender

598
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,800
Still the face

599
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,720
Face is fine, right?

600
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,240
Love

601
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
Loving

602
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,400
Happy

603
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,120
With you, my heart races endlessly

604
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,440
With you, my heart races endlessly

605
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,000
With you, my heart races endlessly

606
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,840
Good

607
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,760
Congratulations, you've won a movie pass

608
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,200
Thank you

609
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,840
Good

610
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,520
Good

611
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:43,840
Next

612
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,400
Your turn

613
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,760
Longest Legs Champion

614
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,200
Splits over 270 degrees

615
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,880
This works

616
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,000
This is the relay we need, right?

617
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
If you can come up with

618
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
Creative relay works too

619
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,720
A creative relay

620
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,200
Right

621
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,760
Hold for 5 seconds

622
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,720
1

623
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,160
2

624
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,680
2

625
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
3

626
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,320
4

627
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,680
5

628
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Good

629
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,640
Congratulations

630
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,240
Great team spirit

631
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,760
Come on

632
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,120
Thank you

633
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,040
Your fast pass

634
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,840
Next person, keep going

635
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,040
King of Nice Guys

636
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,200
Name your

637
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,640
eight good friends in 15 seconds

638
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,320
Isn't that easy?

639
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,880
That's already four, right?

640
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,360
Right

641
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,720
Zhang Linghe, Zhou Keyu

642
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,480
Dilraba, Bai Yu

643
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,880
Jin Jing, Wang Xun

644
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,000
That's six now, right?

645
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Zeng Shunxi, Li Yitong

646
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,560
Okay, time's up

647
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,920
Last one, congratulations

648
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,920
You're truly exceptionally talented people

649
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,440
You're truly exceptionally talented people

650
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,640
Now let's all go to the screening room

651
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,360
Okay

652
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,640
Let's go

653
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,040
Everyone, please follow me this way

654
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,160
The screening room is over here

655
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Editing Room

656
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,640
Our movie fans can sit in the front row.

657
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
We're sitting in the front row, right?

658
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,120
Yes.

659
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,240
After everyone is seated,

660
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,880
we can watch Director He's new film.

661
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,400
Director He, you may begin.

662
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,880
Alright, let's get started.

663
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,880
Next up is my film,

664
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,640
"Office Mystery."

665
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,520
The official premiere begins now.

666
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's not horror.

667
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
It's not a tearjerker, is it?

668
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,480
The first program of our anniversary celebration

669
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
is called "Only the Persistent Win."

670
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,120
How's my filming?

671
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,800
Not bad, right?

672
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,880
You filmed it secretly?

673
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,440
These actors are absolutely excellent.

674
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,640
At least that's what I think.

675
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
Don't you think the characters in this play

676
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,880
are quite similar to you?

677
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,040
I've never filmed this scene before.

678
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,680
What?

679
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,040
Why is Tole here?

680
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,680
Want to live?

681
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,920
I want to live.

682
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,000
Good.

683
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,200
8D

684
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,320
Take this "Cold-Blooded High School" manga

685
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,080
and alter it according to my instructions.

686
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,640
Otherwise,

687
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,880
I'll kill you.

688
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,000
How did you know I was hiding here?

689
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What exactly do you want?

690
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
No more talk.

691
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,720
Do as I say.

692
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,720
Or I'll really kill you.

693
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,680
Understood?

694
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
Change it.

695
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,400
So he's also part of that group?

696
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,480
Yes, Organization B.

697
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,680
This is too strange.

698
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,120
This wasn't in my script at all.

699
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,360
What does it mean that he changed the content?

700
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Tole has changed.

701
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,680
The Tole in my movie...

702
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,720
He couldn't have known 8D was hiding...

703
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
in that abandoned workspace.

704
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,080
Besides, Tole doesn't even know 8D.

705
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,360
Why would he go to him for changes...

706
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
to the "Cold-Blooded High School" manga?

707
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,480
"Cold-Blooded High School" manga.

708
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,600
Manga.

709
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,400
Let's see how this connects...

710
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,160
to my movie.

711
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
The comic has changed.

712
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,720
How could the comic change?

713
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,080
The movie changed, so the comic changed along with it.

714
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
Look at this Xiao Xi.

715
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,880
Xiao Xi was previously cursed.

716
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,120
He should have a dinosaur's head.

717
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,800
But now why has he turned into...

718
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,720
a normal appearance?

719
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,440
Let's start from the first page.

720
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,840
Come.

721
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,200
In 1988, the "Big Red Dress" and "Bald Head" group—

722
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,000
a group of bullied performing arts students—

723
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,720
committed suicide by jumping into the river.

724
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,120
They left behind a curse of despair:

725
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,920
This is the story we know.

726
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,440
May our dying wish—

727
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,920
become a curse,

728
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,880
so the bullies too will taste

729
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,360
the bitter fruit of hidden torment.

730
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,720
Until bullying ends,

731
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,440
the curse remains.

732
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,400
Big Waves,

733
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,200
Big Red Dress...

734
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,040
Then years later, the innocent Xiaorou

735
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,360
became the target of the "Push Empire"

736
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,600
bullying quartet

737
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
That dinosaur-head girl

738
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Dino-girl

739
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,120
Xiaoxi

740
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Xiaorou looks just like a dinosaur

741
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,880
Why don't we

742
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,840
all call her Dino-girl from now on

743
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,160
They all started bullying Xiaorou

744
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,880
Right

745
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,200
Then after the desperate Xiaorou committed suicide

746
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,840
the curse fell upon Xiaodong, Xiaonan and Xiaowei

747
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,480
Xiaowei got possessed by Xiaorou

748
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,440
Xiaodong became invisible

749
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,600
Then when we arrived

750
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,240
He, Ke, Bai, Ning, Jin, Ba

751
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Xiaoxi escaped the curse

752
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,600
living normally in the Push Arts world

753
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,200
Why?

754
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,560
Because she's normal - she's a dinosaur

755
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,840
Exactly

756
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,440
It's this person

757
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,360
This Xiaoxi

758
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,960
Look at her now

759
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,320
She appears completely normal now

760
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
So history has been rewritten, right?

761
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,320
Meaning this comic has the power

762
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,320
to rewrite history

763
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,600
Didn't that Tole character in the movie say

764
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,800
"You need to change it according to what I say"

765
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,000
about "Cold-Blooded High School"?

766
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,120
And then it changed immediately after

767
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,720
Yes

768
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,240
This "Cold-Blooded High School" comic

769
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
was altered according to my settings

770
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,440
It's actually quite nice, and there's also

771
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,280
very cozy

772
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,800
Right?

773
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,680
Not cozy anymore

774
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,880
Wait a minute

775
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,680
Something's coming

776
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,960
Did you leave?

777
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,200
I'm here

778
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,320
Waiting to be scared feels awful

779
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,880
Yeah

780
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,280
It's lighting up

781
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,280
What?

782
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,240
What the hell?

783
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,880
Those two are gone

784
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,040
Director He's Studio ID - Xiaoru

785
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,760
That was his assistant earlier, right?

786
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,640
Hello everyone, I'm Xiaoru

787
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Please be kind to me

788
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
Come on, open it

789
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,920
Take this off

790
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,000
Mei Yun Lianlian

791
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
Is this written for Mei Yun Lianlian?

792
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,440
Game supporting character

793
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,400
The tragic songstress Mei Yun Lianlian and others

794
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,600
Read it out loud

795
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Mei Yun Lianlian

796
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,320
As far as I know

797
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,840
Xiao Ru, a new employee at Director He's studio

798
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,440
Will miss the premiere due to illness

799
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,000
You can disguise yourself as Xiao Ru to sneak into the premiere

800
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,440
Then take the opportunity to kidnap Director He

801
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,840
Before that, you can hide in the props room

802
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,720
It's very safe there

803
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,760
The way to enter the props room

804
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,520
Is hidden on Director He's poster

805
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,480
On Director He's poster

806
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,720
Wait a minute

807
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
This is the real Xiao Ru

808
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,280
Let's go

809
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,920
Let's go see the director's poster

810
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,240
Then head into the props room

811
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,800
Look at these posters

812
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,080
Is there something that can control

813
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Open that door

814
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,080
Suddenly Looking Back

815
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,680
"The Office Has Secrets"

816
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,400
Director He's Work

817
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,560
Take a look at "Suddenly, Looking Back"

818
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,120
Wait, some paper fell.

819
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,640
It fell down.

820
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
Now there's crowing and thieving.

821
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,960
Dogs leap inside the house.

822
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,720
Don't act like a sneaky dog.

823
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,480
The whole household is restless.

824
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,200
Right, the whole household is restless.

825
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,120
What does this mean?

826
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,880
What's the point?

827
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,240
Then let's take this...

828
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,040
Let's extract these two words.

829
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,800
What could it be?

830
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,160
Petty theft, right?

831
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,360
Crowing and thieving, isn't it?

832
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,960
Chickens flying and dogs leaping?

833
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,560
Each one has a chicken.

834
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,040
No.

835
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,680
Each one has a dog.

836
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,480
Then let's see what's in here.

837
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,360
Is it related to dogs?

838
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,240
I mean each one has a dog in it

839
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,400
But in each one

840
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,160
you can use a chicken to

841
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,240
form an idiom with it

842
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,760
Right

843
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,360
So it's related to chickens then

844
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,760
Like "Standing Out Among Chickens"

845
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,720
No chicken

846
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,680
There's no chicken

847
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,200
No chicken

848
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,400
Lacking chicken

849
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,400
Short on chicken

850
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,520
Chickenless

851
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,600
Nonsense

852
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,680
No chicken

853
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,760
Without chicken

854
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,440
Should we remove it?

855
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,960
No chicken

856
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,120
There's no chicken

857
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,080
Nonsense

858
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,200
No chicken

859
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,680
Could it be a pun?

860
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
No chicken, cover oneself

861
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,960
Cover the chicken

862
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,840
No chicken

863
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
Cover the word "chicken"

864
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,320
Cover it up

865
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,400
Wait a moment

866
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,280
Who is this?

867
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,240
Me

868
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,880
Go

869
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,440
Open the door and go

870
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,240
The door is open

871
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,520
Wait, where are you all going?

872
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,880
Dear bosses,

873
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,760
It's really terrifying.

874
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,520
Dear bosses,

875
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,240
There won't be anything strange

876
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,000
coming out from under this table, right?

877
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,160
It's opening.

878
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,560
Let's go.

879
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,840
What is it

880
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,720
There's something

881
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,240
Nothing

882
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,200
Come in

883
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,320
She's hiding in the prop storage for now

884
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,920
I don't dare to leave

885
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,600
You guys go ahead

886
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
There's a little figure here

887
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,200
I'm really gonna puke

888
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,000
There's a little person here

889
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,960
What are you doing?

890
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,120
This place is full of people

891
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,760
Wait a second

892
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,960
Hold on

893
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
It's fine

894
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,720
It's moving

895
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,440
He's moving

896
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,880
Let's get out of here

897
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,440
He's chasing us

898
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Come any closer and I'll knock you down

899
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
Just kick him over

900
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,440
Wait

901
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,960
I'm seriously sweating

902
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,280
Sis

903
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,640
This girl is real

904
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,680
Old master, I'm really breaking a sweat

905
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,040
I'm begging you

906
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,880
Stop messing around

907
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,080
See, this one's fake

908
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,600
This is real

909
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,560
Don't touch her

910
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,920
This is fake

911
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
You just won't believe me

912
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,760
This is definitely fake

913
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,960
Her hand has no warmth

914
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,240
She's following us.

915
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,120
Don't do it like this.

916
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,880
What the hell.

917
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,600
This looks like Xiaoru.

918
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,640
Come over here.

919
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,080
Okay.

920
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,680
It's fine.

921
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,480
No problem.

922
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,280
I'm up front.

923
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,760
Got it.

924
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,640
I'm here.

925
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,960
All good.

926
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
What are you three doing?

927
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,000
We're here to find someone.

928
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,760
Wait a second.

929
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,240
I give up.

930
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,040
Let's join in too.

931
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,920
When they start shouting,

932
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
we'll shout with them.

933
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,560
Alright, fine.

934
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,520
Should we leave?

935
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,240
I'm sweating.

936
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,880
Let's go, maybe.

937
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,040
Let's go, definitely.

938
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm leaving.

939
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,400
We seem to be surrounded.

940
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,600
If we don't leave now, we'll be trapped in the middle.

941
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,960
Hurry up, let's go

942
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Director

943
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,520
How was our performance?

944
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,240
Can we get cast in "Office Mystery 2"?

945
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,200
Aren't you Director He's casting assistants?

946
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,600
No, we're not

947
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,040
Director He scheduled our audition in the props room

948
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Where is Director He?

949
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,080
We don't know where Director He is

950
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,120
But we just saw a

951
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
creepy woman in a qipao

952
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,680
She was here

953
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,920
stealing an evening gown

954
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,120
I think she's over there

955
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,880
Here

956
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,360
Open or not?

957
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,000
Explosion time! It's time to explode

958
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,920
Time for the explosion

959
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,840
When Director He arrives later

960
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,400
Remember to tell us

961
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,120
Alright

962
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,880
Let's go find Director He

963
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,240
Okay

964
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,760
So this is the evening gown, right?

965
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,800
What is this

966
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,160
There's a waist bag

967
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Yes, a bundle

968
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,560
Open

969
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,680
Cheongsam

970
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,640
What is this

971
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,000
This fell off the qipao

972
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,760
What are you saying

973
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,000
During my days trapped at Tui Health

974
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,440
I would always recall the stage of Tui Le Men

975
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,720
I thought that as an orphan girl

976
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,040
I could make my mark there

977
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,800
But little did I know

978
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,720
The day I ascended to Tui Lao Hui

979
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,040
was the beginning of my nightmare

980
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
My pancreas was cruelly removed

981
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,080
Here's one

982
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,440
This is

983
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,440
Incinerator records

984
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,560
Organ harvesting

985
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,480
Just one second before I was to be incinerated

986
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,640
A group stormed into Tui Health

987
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,360
I stumbled out in the chaos

988
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,080
and fled to the Wukenai River

989
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,960
Unexpectedly found

990
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,360
a note from Bei Ju from another world

991
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,040
Though hard to believe

992
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,840
subsequent events proved

993
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,000
that Bei Ju, Xiao Xi, Tuo Le and I

994
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
were all tragic figures sharing the same fate

995
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,160
That's why we call ourselves Group B

996
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,760
If there's any chance to change our fate

997
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,560
even the slightest possibility

998
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm willing to try it

999
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,080
This is actually

1000
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,880
the same one from Tui Le Men back then

1001
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,680
As long as you're over 18

1002
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,720
and an orphan with no relatives

1003
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,440
Once you pass the physical exam

1004
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,760
you get the chance to perform on

1005
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Tui Le Men's stage

1006
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,600
That guy from Tui Le Men went to Tui Lao Hui

1007
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,120
But then he got his kidney stolen there

1008
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,600
Just like those tragic girls

1009
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,240
Yes, in that era they wore qipaos

1010
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,760
She stumbled and fled to Wukenai River

1011
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,680
Unexpectedly found

1012
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,760
a note from Bei Ju that came from another world

1013
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
This also means Wukenai River is

1014
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,600
symbolic of a space-time tunnel

1015
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,480
Or perhaps a

1016
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,520
thing that can connect people

1017
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,160
A bond

1018
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Me, Bei Ju, Xiao Xi, and Tuo Le

1019
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,320
are all tragic figures sharing the same fate

1020
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,880
If there's a chance to change fate

1021
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,520
even the slightest possibility

1022
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
I'm willing to try

1023
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,040
Like in that movie just now

1024
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
He had 8D

1025
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,960
modify his "Cold Blood Academy"

1026
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,120
Changed this "Cold Blood Academy" manga

1027
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,360
according to my settings

1028
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,040
The manga changed too

1029
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,600
When the movie changed, the manga followed

1030
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,520
After the changes were made in "Cold-Blooded High School,"

1031
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,680
didn't that story change?

1032
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,520
And real life changed too.

1033
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,120
Exactly.

1034
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,680
So what he meant was that works

1035
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,040
can all influence the real world.

1036
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,480
There might still be some information under the white cloth.

1037
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,320
The one covered by the white cloth.

1038
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,760
This one?

1039
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,320
This seems like a real person

1040
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,920
She's moving

1041
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,880
She's breathing

1042
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,600
Even if you know my plan,

1043
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,320
you can't stop Organization B.

1044
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Before the film is re-edited,

1045
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,640
I won't release Director He.

1046
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:48,880
I won't release Director He.

1047
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,840
Where are you keeping Director He?

1048
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,720
Where is he locked up?

1049
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,880
It's okay.

1050
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,320
Shouldn't we go after her?

1051
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,560
Are we going out?

1052
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,040
Or should we stay here?

1053
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,000
Let's go through this door.

1054
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,480
Right.

1055
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,160
Are we leaving?

1056
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,280
I think we should go this way.

1057
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,600
He must have locked Director He

1058
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,120
in the editing room to make him re-edit.

1059
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Before the film is re-edited,

1060
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,040
I won't release Director He.

1061
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Right.

1062
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,120
Let's go, everyone.

1063
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,680
Where's the light?

1064
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,560
There's no light.

1065
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,360
Where would there be a light?

1066
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,480
These are upward stairs, be careful.

1067
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,200
Upward.

1068
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,640
Right.

1069
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,040
Oh my god.

1070
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,520
This is a bit unstable.

1071
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,640
What is this?

1072
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,640
Isn't this where we just came in?

1073
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,160
Yes.

1074
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,360
That was the front door just now.

1075
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,360
This is the back door.

1076
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,320
Exactly.

1077
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,200
Here.

1078
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,760
Editing room.

1079
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,800
Director He working overtime suddenly.

1080
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,920
We're going to rescue him.

1081
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,840
Go save your dad quickly, Jiawei.

1082
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,080
Go save your dad quickly.

1083
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,520
Hurry up.

1084
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,520
Dad, this is what I installed for you.

1085
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,480
A backup password panel.

1086
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,760
If the editing room key card is lost,

1087
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,640
you can check inside my favorite portrait.

1088
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,960
What do you like to look at?

1089
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,480
What I like most to look at.

1090
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
He's not my dad.

1091
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,480
How is he not your dad?

1092
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,280
This isn't your dad.

1093
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,200
I mean your dad.

1094
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,040
This is the password panel I installed for you.

1095
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,840
He's not Jiawei.

1096
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,960
I'm not Jiawei.

1097
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
Right, if the editing room key card is lost,

1098
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,160
you can check my favorite portrait.

1099
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,040
Try to remember.

1100
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,160
What you love most to look at.

1101
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,200
There's a secret hidden inside.

1102
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,160
His favorite is that one.

1103
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,280
Suddenly Looking Back.

1104
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,920
No, it's Bali.

1105
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,400
His favorite portrait is Bali, right?

1106
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,720
That person.

1107
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,240
Doesn't Jiawei like Bali's photo?

1108
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,120
Jiawei.

1109
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,600
You must wear your mask properly here.

1110
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,400
To avoid causing a commotion.

1111
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
And this.

1112
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,560
This is my necklace.

1113
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,400
Right.

1114
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,320
That place just now.

1115
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,080
The one just now had her photo.

1116
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
Call out my name.

1117
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,360
That one just now.

1118
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,560
I saw that room just now.

1119
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,920
It's that photo of Bali.

1120
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,880
Then let's go take a look.

1121
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,640
Let's go.

1122
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,440
Just don't turn off the lights again.

1123
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,520
Then we can take a proper look.

1124
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,840
Is this the place?

1125
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,320
Yes.

1126
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,440
Up ahead.

1127
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,440
Shout my name loudly.

1128
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,240
What's her name?

1129
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,960
Ready, 3-2-1

1130
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,560
Ba!

1131
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,800
Who are you calling?

1132
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,320
Aren't you...

1133
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,880
3-2-1

1134
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,640
Bali!

1135
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,320
The descendant of Marshal Ning

1136
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,120
could never write

1137
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,880
The descendant of Marshal Ning

1138
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,440
could never write a bestseller

1139
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,400
The descendant of Marshal Ke

1140
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,880
could open the most famous shop in Tui Town

1141
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,120
The descendant of Marshal He could never win the Triple Tui Award

1142
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,640
No matter what,

1143
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,280
the descendant of Marshal Ning could never win the Tui Nobel Prize in Literature

1144
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,640
Years later, they each achieved

1145
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
one of four accomplishments

1146
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,760
This is a math problem

1147
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,880
I'll never be able to write a bestseller

1148
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,960
Which means I won't get this bestseller

1149
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,560
He wants to change you all like this

1150
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,640
Change it like this

1151
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,760
No, I can't write it

1152
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,680
So that's just guessing what I did

1153
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,400
No

1154
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:14,800
Nobel

1155
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,280
No, let's not

1156
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,640
This sentence is the most important

1157
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
As for predictions about descendants' achievements

1158
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Only the descendant who opened a shop predicted correctly

1159
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,040
Among the four predictions

1160
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,960
Only one person's prediction was correct

1161
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,040
The other three were all wrong

1162
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,160
Then let's eliminate them one by one

1163
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,040
If this one is correct

1164
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,040
These three are wrong

1165
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,080
How can we make these three invalid

1166
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,960
Now there's a problem

1167
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,280
Your reasoning is correct

1168
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
But who is the one who opened the shop?

1169
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,800
Exactly

1170
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,600
But in my prediction

1171
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,480
Ke Shaoshuai's descendant

1172
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,720
Would open the most famous shop in the future

1173
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,920
This must be wrong

1174
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,400
I predicted wrong

1175
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,880
So I'm not the one who opened the shop, right?

1176
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,880
I think we need a pen for this

1177
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,400
No

1178
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,680
I feel like there was a pen over there before

1179
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,000
This is a pen, right?

1180
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,520
Yes

1181
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,000
Who is wrong here

1182
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,120
Excellent

1183
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,400
Thank you

1184
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,920
Okay

1185
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:18,840
Alright

1186
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,240
So what does that equal

1187
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,040
We're just using process of elimination

1188
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,400
What do we currently know

1189
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,360
I'll write directly on this

1190
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,160
I'll just write "Ning"

1191
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,920
This way is simpler

1192
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,480
Ning, following normal deduction

1193
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,640
I can get three deductions

1194
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,280
And there's this famous shop, right

1195
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm telling you, we should just test several possibilities

1196
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,240
We'll eventually need multiple sets of answers

1197
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:35,560
Look

1198
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,160
For example, Ning said Ke later opened the most famous shop

1199
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,680
Which means what I said is true

1200
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,040
So this indirectly

1201
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,520
Mentions the descendant of Commander He

1202
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,920
Can't win the triple deduction prize

1203
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,160
Do you believe this or not?

1204
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,280
If this is correct,

1205
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,920
then his descendants run a bookstore.

1206
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,400
Okay.

1207
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,160
Why is that?

1208
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,680
Lying so comfortably in the middle.

1209
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,560
I can't help with this.

1210
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,640
Those three are arguing so intensely.

1211
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,040
Doesn't everyone know

1212
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,920
what businesses their descendants run?

1213
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,160
Why bother calculating then?

1214
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,280
Haven't we known all along who runs shops?

1215
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,880
The Bai family runs shops.

1216
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,840
Bai Youcai

1217
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,560
Bai Youcai achieved five generations under one roof.

1218
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,160
His son is the most famous

1219
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,760
chief barber at the Lawless Barbershop in Tui Town.

1220
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,640
He won the Tui Bell Literature Prize.

1221
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,720
Didn't he achieve great success later?

1222
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,560
In those examinations...

1223
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,240
I remember

1224
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,840
Young Marshal Ke

1225
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,320
still left behind some treasures.

1226
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,560
His descendants

1227
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,920
are also rare talents in this world.

1228
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,320
won the Tui Bell Literature Prize.

1229
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,840
Young Marshal He's descendants won three Tui awards.

1230
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,040
He said it himself earlier.

1231
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,200
Welcome to the premiere of my new film

1232
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,600
"Office Ghost Story."

1233
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,080
I'm the director of this film

1234
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,880
and a three-time Tui award winner, Director He.

1235
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,760
The bestseller was by Ning -

1236
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,600
"Ning's Thirty-Six Stratagems."

1237
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,880
In his later years, Young Marshal Ning

1238
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,160
with his son Ning Guixing and granddaughter Ning Mengshui

1239
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,160
compiled his life essays together

1240
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,680
and edited them into "Ning's Thirty-Six Stratagems."

1241
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,080
Alright, let's go.

1242
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:32,560
Let's go.

1243
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,680
Got it all memorized.

1244
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,320
I am the book.

1245
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,480
We really are a clever bunch.

1246
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,480
Bai is a famous shop.

1247
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,120
Ning Shaoshuai is a bestseller.

1248
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,640
Ke Shaoshuai is a Nobel.

1249
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,040
He San Recommendation.

1250
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,000
Alright

1251
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,560
It's open

1252
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,480
That scared me to death

1253
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,120
You're with them too

1254
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,480
I'll change, I'll change, okay?

1255
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,120
I'll change

1256
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,800
We're not with them

1257
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,720
We're here to save you

1258
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,240
We're together

1259
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,880
So you need our help now?

1260
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,120
I need you to help me remove

1261
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,720
these handcuffs on me

1262
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,480
How do we remove them?

1263
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,160
The key

1264
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,880
I think the key is somewhere in this area

1265
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,720
If I remember correctly

1266
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,560
Thank you

1267
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,200
Found it

1268
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,000
Thank you

1269
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,280
No

1270
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,360
This

1271
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,080
Up there

1272
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,280
Did you find it?

1273
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,800
Too short to reach it

1274
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,000
As expected, somewhat...

1275
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,800
Alright

1276
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,560
Thank you, sir

1277
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,200
Indeed someone who looks like my son

1278
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,720
Right?

1279
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
Yes

1280
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,120
That Xiaoru just now

1281
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,880
She kidnapped me

1282
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,880
Brought me here

1283
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,920
She forced me to change

1284
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Tole's storyline in my movie

1285
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,560
That wasn't Xiaoru earlier

1286
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,920
It was Mei Yunlianlian

1287
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,200
Hello everyone, I'm Xiaoru

1288
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,280
Nice to meet you

1289
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,040
So that was Mei Yunlianlian?

1290
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,880
Yes, that's her

1291
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,640
She said she wished Tole never boarded No. 4444

1292
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,240
The ill-fated ship 4444

1293
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,000
Missing vessel investigation notice

1294
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,120
She said this could end

1295
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,840
The town's tragic cycle

1296
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,600
Then he wouldn't board that ship

1297
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,160
And the tragic incident wouldn't happen

1298
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,440
Will you edit it then?

1299
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,280
I won't

1300
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,920
How could I treat my art so frivolously?

1301
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,160
Indeed

1302
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,960
Fortunately you came in time

1303
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,800
Or she would have really altered my art

1304
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,720
Do you know where she is?

1305
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:21,840
I don't know

1306
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,400
After tying me here, I don't know where she went

1307
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,680
She left right in front of you

1308
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,280
Right

1309
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,160
Today's experiences

1310
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,000
Actually gave me inspiration

1311
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,440
I want to go create something

1312
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,760
You can handle things here?

1313
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,760
Be careful not to get kidnapped again

1314
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,560
Thank you for saving me

1315
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,120
Thank you for protecting my art

1316
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,720
Thanks

1317
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,400
This guy's a bit...

1318
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,680
Isn't there any clue here?

1319
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,800
No, no clues

1320
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,760
Don't move, that's the projector.

1321
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,040
Projector.

1322
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:02,920
Film projector.

1323
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,720
We were just watching a movie.

1324
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,400
What is it

1325
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,880
Is the movie outside about to start

1326
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,120
Is it going to

1327
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,640
This door

1328
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,640
This music is playing again.

1329
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,120
Where is it coming from?

1330
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,440
Is it here?

1331
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,280
No.

1332
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,880
Not here.

1333
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,280
Right, I told you it's not here.

1334
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,760
Are we supposed to sing?

1335
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,200
You scared me

1336
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,520
On you

1337
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,440
Something rang on you

1338
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,240
About the phone call...

1339
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,000
I was just listening to you.

1340
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,920
Hello?

1341
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,320
Put it on speaker.

1342
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,400
I'm speechless.

1343
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,440
Hello? Go ahead.

1344
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,120
Did you find any clues about Organization B?

1345
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,160
We did.

1346
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,880
Organization B seems to be a group of...

1347
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,720
people with tragic lives.

1348
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,920
So tragic.

1349
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,360
Not as tragic as us right now.

1350
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,680
Explain more clearly.

1351
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,640
Say it out loud.

1352
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,760
I said we found...

1353
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,000
found some clues.

1354
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,640
Yes, we found that Organization B consists of...

1355
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,880
people with tragic lives...

1356
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,960
some unfortunate individuals.

1357
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,080
They call themselves Organization B.

1358
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,360
This Organization B wants to find...

1359
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,160
each of these four works...

1360
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,840
and alter their contents.

1361
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,600
It seems changing the contents...

1362
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,000
can affect reality's course.

1363
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,600
This aligns with my investigation.

1364
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:08,960
Okay.

1365
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,120
So our investigation was pointless.

1366
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,040
Right.

1367
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,280
Let me share my investigation progress.

1368
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,320
What did you find?

1369
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,160
Share it with us.

1370
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,400
I've infiltrated the robot scrapyard...

1371
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
where Bei Ju is located.

1372
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,200
I'm very close to Organization B's plan.

1373
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,440
I'll first send...

1374
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,600
my investigation notes to your screen.

1375
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,920
Your next steps...

1376
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,440
are also in the notes.

1377
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,200
Good luck.

1378
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,400
Is she sending her findings?

1379
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,480
Let's connect it.

1380
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,360
Wow, so lengthy.

1381
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,600
The Secret of Tui Town.

1382
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,560
Actually, Tui Town has no river.

1383
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,120
The so-called Helpless River...

1384
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,840
is a magical water source across four dimensions.

1385
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,040
The River of No Return leads to four different dimensions.

1386
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,800
The gaming dimension, the comic dimension,

1387
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,840
the movie dimension, and the novel dimension.

1388
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,800
Each dimension

1389
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,800
is created by authors from higher-level dimensions,

1390
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,480
forming a closed loop among themselves.

1391
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,440
Cartoonist 8D

1392
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,760
Real name: Badi

1393
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,200
Created the comic dimension "Cold-Blooded High School"

1394
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,600
Novelist Shouruan, real name Hu Jie

1395
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,520
Created the novel dimension "Five Forms"

1396
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,800
Game designer E, real name Ke Ke

1397
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,280
Created the virtual dimension "Mysterious Player"

1398
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,920
"Mysterious Player"

1399
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,040
Director He created the film dimension

1400
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,040
"Ghost in the Office"

1401
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,080
Higher dimensions can send messages to lower dimensions

1402
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,160
The method is using water from the Helpless River

1403
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,480
To irrigate the wooden cabinet

1404
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,760
This book sank to the bottom of the Helpless River

1405
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,600
"The Secret of Tui Town"

1406
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,560
Was accidentally obtained by Beiju from the novel dimension

1407
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,640
Following the book's instructions

1408
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,480
He contacted Meiyun Lianlian from the lower dimension

1409
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,160
Then Meiyun Lianlian

1410
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,640
Contacted Tole from the lower dimension

1411
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,520
Tole then contacted Xiaoxi from the lower dimension

1412
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,520
Unexpectedly found

1413
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,920
A note sent by Beiju from another world

1414
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,600
Although unbelievable

1415
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,400
Subsequent facts proved

1416
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,560
That I, Beiju, Xiaoxi, and Tole

1417
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,280
Were all tragic figures sharing the same fate

1418
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,400
Their plan

1419
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,880
Was to use the higher dimension's

1420
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,640
Knowledge of lower dimensions

1421
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,800
To guide companions in lower dimensions

1422
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,400
To kidnap the authors

1423
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,080
And force them to alter character fates

1424
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,960
If their plan succeeds

1425
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,520
The dimensional walls' stability would collapse

1426
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,800
Causing unpredictable disasters across four dimensions

1427
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,160
Currently under Meiyun Lianlian's guidance

1428
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,160
8D has been threatened by Tole

1429
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,400
To alter Xiaoxi's fate in the comic dimension

1430
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,200
How could the comic change?

1431
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,560
The film changed, so the comic followed

1432
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:53,920
Look

1433
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,240
Xiaoxi was previously cursed

1434
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,480
She should have a dinosaur's head

1435
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,320
But why does she look normal now?

1436
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,400
You must find a way

1437
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,440
To contact Tole

1438
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,440
Persuade him to make Badi restore the comic

1439
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,520
Which also means

1440
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,000
"The Haunted Office"

1441
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,480
influences "Cold-Blooded Academy"

1442
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,520
then "Cold-Blooded Academy" influences "Five Elements"

1443
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,480
"Five Elements" influences "Mysterious Player"

1444
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,920
So if everyone

1445
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,320
could write about a dimension

1446
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,880
where everyone's fate is determined

1447
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,760
then actually no one would be

1448
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,840
at the very top

1449
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,920
They all influence each other

1450
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,680
Which era is Tole in?

1451
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,080
Tole is in Ba-

1452
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,560
Badi's era

1453
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,640
The 80s

1454
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,080
Are you okay?

1455
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,760
Boss Tuo

1456
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,280
Tole

1457
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,120
You used to be a doctor

1458
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,040
Come take a look

1459
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,840
Look, hurry

1460
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,080
And what he influences is

1461
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,160
the comic dimension "Cold-Blooded Academy," right?

1462
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,880
He made the people below change

1463
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,000
We can make contact within the game dimension.

1464
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,880
Tole from "Office Mysteries".

1465
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,600
Right.

1466
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,680
Because higher dimensions

1467
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,720
can connect with lower dimensions.

1468
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,360
Yes.

1469
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,240
Then how do we in this dimension

1470
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,480
contact that dimension?

1471
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,640
Higher dimensions can also send messages to lower dimensions.

1472
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,800
The method is to use water from the Helpless River.

1473
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,840
to irrigate the wooden cabinet.

1474
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,040
You see, higher dimensions

1475
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,560
can send messages to lower dimensions.

1476
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,160
The method is to use water from the Helpless River.

1477
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,880
So okay, let's water it now.

1478
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,680
Where is the water from the Helpless River?

1479
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,280
Isn't there a wooden cabinet right there?

1480
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,000
These things underneath are wet, right?

1481
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,040
It's moisture from the ground.

1482
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:12,920
Not necessarily.

1483
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,280
Could just be water stains.

1484
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,280
Then let's tear down the wall and dig a well.

1485
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,360
You mean...

1486
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,320
Does this count as a wooden cabinet?

1487
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:24,880
Yes.

1488
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,400
Let's go then.

1489
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Let's look for the water from Wukenai River.

1490
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,320
The water from Wukenai River.

1491
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,920
My tears, I'd rather turn into flames with you.

1492
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,360
Use Wukenai River's water to water the wooden cabinet.

1493
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,320
But what exactly is Wukenai River's water?

1494
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,200
Push Intoxication.

1495
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,040
Could it be this?

1496
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,400
Push Mellow, this is...

1497
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,120
No, there's water here.

1498
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,040
It's Push Drunkard.

1499
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,920
It's made with Wukenai River's water, right?

1500
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,080
Produced in Push Town, rich aroma.

1501
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,840
Seems like it.

1502
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,920
It's not the wine that intoxicates, but the drinker who gets drunk.

1503
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,440
Written here

1504
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,360
Specialty brand

1505
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,640
Contains 1% of Wukenai River molecules

1506
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,480
Then this one it is

1507
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,480
Water this flower

1508
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,480
Coming

1509
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,640
So incredibly fragrant

1510
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,760
Isn't this perfect now?

1511
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,160
Write his name

1512
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,120
Who to contact

1513
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:56,960
Tole

1514
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,840
Wasn't there a pen just now?

1515
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,600
It's inside.

1516
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,640
In that editing room.

1517
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,080
What should we write for the question content?

1518
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,040
Just write the word "Tole"

1519
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,520
Just tell him you want to get to know him

1520
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,200
No

1521
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,520
Ask him to change the "Badi" comic back

1522
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,040
Just say "Tole" to him

1523
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,440
Please

1524
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,120
No

1525
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,120
Talking about social niceties is pointless

1526
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,680
Tell him if you do this

1527
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,160
It will destroy the dimensional space

1528
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,360
Just say I'm the leader of Team B

1529
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,000
I now order you

1530
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,280
Then four words: Tuole, I'm Beiju

1531
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,240
Terminate the transaction

1532
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,080
Wait a moment

1533
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,440
Only the upper level can contact

1534
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,560
So it has to be Meiyun Lianlian contacting him

1535
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,040
That makes sense

1536
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,800
Alright, then we'll pretend to be Meiyun

1537
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,000
So what is it?

1538
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,600
Little Tuo

1539
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,280
Tuole, right?

1540
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:50,880
Tuole

1541
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,320
I'm Meiyun Lianlian

1542
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,680
Tuole, I'm

1543
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,520
Are you cold, sis?

1544
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,960
A little bit cold

1545
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,880
Aren't you cold?

1546
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,040
I'm not cold.

1547
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,680
But because of this, I'll have to mop the floor.

1548
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,400
No need.

1549
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,440
Thank you.

1550
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,640
Meiyun, I'm Meiyun Lianlian. Then what?

1551
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,600
Then don't alter the storyline in "Cold-Blooded High School"

1552
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,120
Xiaoxi's fate.

1553
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,160
Because we can control him.

1554
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,840
We can rewrite his fate, right?

1555
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,000
Otherwise I'll write you out of the story.

1556
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,960
If you disobey, you'll die horribly.

1557
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,640
That's what you mean, right?

1558
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,200
Just say "If you disobey, you'll suffer."

1559
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,800
Don't actually kill them off.

1560
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,000
If you don't listen to me,

1561
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,600
Okay.

1562
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,520
you're finished.

1563
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,440
Finished.

1564
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,400
If you don't listen to me, you're finished.

1565
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,640
Add a few more words, haha.

1566
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,960
We were supposed to be serious.

1567
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,600
If you do this, they won't be scared. What then?

1568
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,840
Right, that makes sense.

1569
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,760
We're a community of shared fate.

1570
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,400
We should tell them the truth, right?

1571
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,320
We are

1572
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,440
We are a community of shared fate.

1573
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,240
Change one link,

1574
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,560
and everyone's fate will change.

1575
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,960
All worlds will be altered.

1576
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,920
Change one link, and everyone dies.

1577
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,480
Alright, that's it.

1578
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,320
Done.

1579
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,160
How should we do it?

1580
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,560
Water it.

1581
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,120
Now we just have to wait for his reply.

1582
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,360
We need to go inside to wait.

1583
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,120
Here we go again.

1584
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,960
You're here.

1585
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,640
Xiao Le.

1586
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,200
It's nothing, bro.

1587
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,240
No problem.

1588
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,960
Just now you were all fierce and ready to kill.

1589
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,080
But when the lights went out, you chickened out.

1590
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:44,640
Could there be someone...

1591
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,440
who suddenly runs out from here?

1592
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,760
It's not impossible.

1593
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,520
I don't even know where to go now.

1594
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,240
I'm really scared.

1595
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,240
Sit here and don't move.

1596
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,800
Wait a moment.

1597
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:56,600
Behind this door...

1598
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,960
something is definitely coming out.

1599
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,120
Hide in the corner.

1600
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,240
The letter should be arriving soon.

1601
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,480
The letter, get the letter.

1602
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,120
Here it comes.

1603
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,480
Is it in the drawer?

1604
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,920
Only the upper echelon can make contact

1605
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,200
He said in the movie

1606
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,320
You must make the changes as I instructed

1607
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,720
Then just change it right after saying so

1608
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,760
Look, let's go

1609
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,120
Let's check the screening room

1610
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,200
Tole

1611
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,120
He received the letter

1612
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,080
He must have believed it.

1613
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,240
Strange.

1614
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,360
Why did Mei Yunlian suddenly ask me

1615
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,480
to tell Xiao Ba to change things back?

1616
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,400
Never mind.

1617
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,880
He must have his reasons.

1618
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,320
We did it.

1619
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:49,880
Right.

1620
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,840
Come on, Xiao Ba.

1621
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,640
Change *Cold-Blooded High School* back.

1622
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,800
Why are you just standing there?

1623
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,520
This is infuriating!

1624
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,160
If you want to live,

1625
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,920
do as I say.

1626
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,360
My poor little brother...

1627
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,360
So we successfully stopped one part

1628
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,880
Where was that comic just now

1629
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,160
Let's see how it's related to my movie

1630
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Over there

1631
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,840
Just look at that page.

1632
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,920
Just the last page?

1633
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,240
Just the last page.

1634
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,400
This one.

1635
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,760
He still turned back into a dinosaur head.

1636
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,720
The campus horror stories of Tuiyi continue.

1637
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,840
No one knows when the curse will truly end.

1638
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,160
We did it.

1639
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,360
We really did it.

1640
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,120
Did it.

1641
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,360
Evil people get their just deserts.

1642
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:57,920
Then our next step...

1643
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,200
Actually, this is quite simple.

1644
01:06:59,200 --> 01:06:59,880
We...

1645
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,680
No, we should...

1646
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,160
Is anyone there?

1647
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,240
Can anyone hear me?

1648
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:04,800
Go ahead.

1649
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,880
This is Xiao Ting.

1650
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,680
I was accidentally captured.

1651
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,680
Also captured with me...

1652
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,480
is game designer Keke.

1653
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,400
We're probably locked in...

1654
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,680
the Tui Cyber Robot Pavilion...

1655
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,040
Room 3 of the secret chamber.

1656
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,800
They took my communicator too.

1657
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,880
Only Keke can manipulate game items...

1658
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,000
to talk with you.

1659
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,080
Anyway, the Tui Cyber Exhibition Hall now...

1660
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,560
is full of dangerous robots.

1661
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,080
I previously saw in the VR Game Hall...

1662
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,120
a way...

1663
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,720
to force robots into hibernation.

1664
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,360
It should be near the virtual harp.

1665
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,160
Search carefully.

1666
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,480
Virtual what nearby?

1667
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:37,800
Harp.

1668
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,760
The game just now.

1669
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,480
On the wall.

1670
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,880
There's a harp on that wall.

1671
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:47,840
Let's go

1672
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,440
Go

1673
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,560
She said there are many dangerous robots

1674
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,960
So let's not rush out yet

1675
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,640
Let's first figure out the harp

1676
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,000
Then the robots will freeze

1677
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,280
Right

1678
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:55,840
We'll just

1679
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,240
After they freeze, we can leave

1680
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,440
Outside

1681
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,520
Where's the harp?

1682
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,640
Over there

1683
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:08,520
This

1684
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,320
Okay

1685
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,480
Play quickly

1686
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,480
Play a song

1687
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,400
Play

1688
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,320
Play a tune

1689
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,160
I know how to operate it now

1690
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,560
There's no music score

1691
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,120
Right

1692
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:22,920
Music score

1693
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,040
Score

1694
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,560
Is this it?

1695
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,320
This one above?

1696
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,120
Really? No way.

1697
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,560
If you put it that way,

1698
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,840
then that's possible.

1699
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,280
It's not somewhere high up again, is it?

1700
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,000
No.

1701
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,880
Nothing at all.

1702
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,120
This is...

1703
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,960
Turns out we're all blind.

1704
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,760
Blind people.

1705
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,160
This harp serves as

1706
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,760
a temporary hibernation device for robots.

1707
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,320
It can put robots from other exhibition halls

1708
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,520
into temporary hibernation for one minute.

1709
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,240
After causing a one-minute power outage in the hall,

1710
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,960
the robots will awaken from hibernation

1711
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,000
and power will be restored.

1712
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,160
The harp has a cooldown period of three minutes.

1713
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,320
To activate hibernation,

1714
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,880
play the following musical notes.

1715
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,040
Note:

1716
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,560
To permanently put robots from other halls

1717
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,680
into hibernation mode,

1718
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,120
you need to activate the hall's permanent hibernation mode.

1719
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,200
The activation method is

1720
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,360
to use the touch pen on the sensor.

1721
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,640
This thing.

1722
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,080
The sensor is right by the entrance,

1723
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,080
to the right when you exit.

1724
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:35,960
Wait a moment

1725
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,840
There are people outside

1726
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,040
First immobilize them, then go out and grab it

1727
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,240
Immobilize first, then within one minute

1728
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,520
Do you know where the pointer stick is?

1729
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,040
No idea

1730
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:42,960
No clue where the stick is

1731
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,200
Immobilize?

1732
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:47,880
Hold on

1733
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,880
We need to know where the stick is

1734
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,960
Because it only lasts a minute

1735
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,600
It's fine, I can look for it

1736
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,320
No, it’ll get dark soon

1737
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,800
So you two brave ones go out

1738
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,600
I want to know one thing

1739
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,600
When we go out later

1740
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,040
It’ll be pitch black, right?

1741
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,360
Yes, we need to find the stick

1742
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,400
Then how will I see?

1743
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,480
You won’t

1744
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,160
Just search blindly

1745
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:08,800
Got it

1746
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,400
Take him with you

1747
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,400
Here, take my clothes

1748
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:15,760
I'm not going

1749
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,640
I absolutely won't go

1750
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,880
Bro, you'll have to go

1751
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,560
It's fine

1752
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,600
He has it

1753
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,440
He has a phone

1754
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:28,680
Let's go together

1755
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,160
Come on, you go first

1756
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,080
Let's sleep for now

1757
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,000
Sleep first

1758
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,680
Coming

1759
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,600
Countdown begins in one minute

1760
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,200
It's open, hurry up

1761
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,080
So many people

1762
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,080
Where's the hammer?

1763
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:17,880
The drum is here

1764
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,000
Where are the drumsticks?

1765
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,400
Are the sticks in our...

1766
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,520
10

1767
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,720
Go

1768
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,120
It's fine

1769
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:39,960
Come back

1770
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,040
Okay

1771
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:41,720
Let's head back first

1772
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,640
I didn't see anything

1773
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,160
I couldn't find it either

1774
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,400
What does that hammer look like?

1775
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,840
2

1776
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,400
1

1777
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,640
Let's go over this logic again

1778
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,200
We need to activate the permanent dormancy of the exhibition hall

1779
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
The activation method requires using a reading pen

1780
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,120
Tap to read the sensor point

1781
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,400
So we need to find the pen

1782
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,400
Just find that damn pen

1783
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,040
The drum is here

1784
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,640
Right, we don't have the pen now

1785
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,720
Find the pen

1786
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,440
About this...

1787
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,360
Could it possibly be in that prison?

1788
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,160
Let's go in and look

1789
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,680
This time we'll head straight to the prison

1790
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,280
You guys just guard the door

1791
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,080
Countdown begins in one minute

1792
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:42,560
Go straight there

1793
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,840
Just guard the door

1794
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,080
Secure the door

1795
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,000
No, it's closed

1796
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,800
It's closed

1797
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,480
That door is locked

1798
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,200
The club is over there

1799
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,920
Could it be up there in that high place?

1800
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,200
Without light I can't see anything

1801
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:55,960
Can't see a thing

1802
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,720
Could it be around here?

1803
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,200
No, I just checked that box

1804
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,480
No light is really painful

1805
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,680
10

1806
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:06,680
Return

1807
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,120
8

1808
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,640
Hurry back

1809
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,520
Quick

1810
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,400
Hurry back

1811
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,000
2 1

1812
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,880
That prison door is locked

1813
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,200
Is everything here?

1814
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:15,920
That means

1815
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,720
I think we still shouldn't search randomly.

1816
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,320
Divide the areas.

1817
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,920
We've already searched the right side, right?

1818
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,320
Did I check below?

1819
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,480
Where exactly did you check?

1820
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,600
Not on the shelves.

1821
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,040
I checked the compartments.

1822
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,880
You checked all four compartments?

1823
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,360
I checked those two compartments earlier.

1824
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,840
Did you check these two farthest compartments?

1825
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,760
You haven't checked these two compartments here.

1826
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,400
Haven't checked.

1827
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,960
Then let's search this area this time.

1828
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,720
Then we'll only check this side.

1829
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:47,560
Only this side.

1830
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,000
Okay.

1831
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,280
Maybe you should give your clothes to someone else to search.

1832
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,680
Give them to him to search.

1833
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,240
That could work.

1834
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,400
Give me your clothes.

1835
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,960
Otherwise he'll just search randomly.

1836
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,400
Come on.

1837
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,720
You play the piano and guard the door.

1838
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,840
Countdown begins in one minute

1839
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,520
Left side

1840
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,080
Not in the warehouse

1841
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,320
Not here either

1842
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,160
Check behind this

1843
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,520
I'll search again

1844
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,320
Found it?

1845
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,440
No

1846
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,640
Could it be upstairs?

1847
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,120
Watch out

1848
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,480
I've checked all the warehouses

1849
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,720
I just looked and didn't find it

1850
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,200
Is it really this hard to find?

1851
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,080
It's so hard to find

1852
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,680
Take a look at these

1853
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:13,920
What should we do?

1854
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,640
What about them?

1855
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,120
Don't move.

1856
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,480
Playing this game, huh?

1857
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,320
What?

1858
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:30,840
Ruined.

1859
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,000
Fine.

1860
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,840
The two of them ran inside.

1861
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,320
It's over.

1862
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,000
It's over—they're coming to rescue the three of us.

1863
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,600
Okay.

1864
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,440
Those two...

1865
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,640
Their clothes are still with me.

1866
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,120
Let's see how they plan to rescue us three.

1867
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,320
We're locked in.

1868
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,640
Quick, go into standby mode.

1869
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,640
Hurry up and shut down

1870
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,800
Why did the lights suddenly turn on?

1871
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,600
No, this one isn't ready

1872
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,200
What?

1873
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,320
This one isn't ready

1874
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,880
Then what about them?

1875
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,840
This stick

1876
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,680
You're showing it to me like this but I still can't see it

1877
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,840
Yeah

1878
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:19,840
What should we do?

1879
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,360
It's okay

1880
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,880
There must be a way to solve this

1881
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,800
I'm so nervous

1882
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,400
It's fine

1883
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,320
What on earth should we do?

1884
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,800
Hurry

1885
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,280
Faster

1886
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,600
Hurry up

1887
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:58,840
Brave

1888
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,760
They're here

1889
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,920
I'll signal them with the light

1890
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,880
Countdown begins in one minute

1891
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,760
They can't get in

1892
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,640
Are you okay?

1893
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,800
Where are you?

1894
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,000
Where are you?

1895
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,800
We can go out

1896
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,160
Take the clothes

1897
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,280
Get the clothes down

1898
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,240
Are you guys okay?

1899
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,600
Here

1900
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,440
Coming

1901
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,280
Did you find it?

1902
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:23,560
No

1903
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,880
We got caught earlier

1904
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,880
Come back quickly first

1905
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,960
Come back first

1906
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:27,760
Everyone, come back

1907
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,520
Let's... uh... do something

1908
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,880
There's no countdown now

1909
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,320
Let's coordinate

1910
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,360
No countdown

1911
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,120
Earlier, it was because there was no countdown

1912
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,720
Let's think first

1913
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,200
Here's your clothes back

1914
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,120
It's useless now

1915
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:38,880
No use

1916
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,520
Come

1917
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,120
I was scared to death

1918
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,240
You guys got caught earlier, right?

1919
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:42,840
Yeah

1920
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,120
They pinned me to the ground

1921
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,320
Don't move

1922
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,160
Is that true?

1923
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,400
I was pushed in.

1924
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,120
I didn't resist you.

1925
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,560
Couldn't resist, too many people.

1926
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,040
Too many people, impossible to resist.

1927
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,480
Why isn't the light on now?

1928
01:17:59,480 --> 01:17:59,720
No.

1929
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,160
Because the time wasn't up yet.

1930
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,480
Right, there's no countdown now.

1931
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,440
Now.

1932
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,480
That means like this.

1933
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,200
Like this.

1934
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,960
See, if there's no countdown next time,

1935
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,280
I can time it.

1936
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:08,920
No need.

1937
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,040
Whoever guards the door counts.

1938
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,560
When it reaches ten seconds, just leave.

1939
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,720
You stay here.

1940
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,400
Just stay put.

1941
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,240
Okay.

1942
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:14,960
Come on.

1943
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:19,680
What about you?

1944
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,640
I'll stay nearby.

1945
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,480
Alright.

1946
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,200
Let's go.

1947
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,760
Where to look this time?

1948
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,840
Where haven't we checked?

1949
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,280
Must be in some corner.

1950
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,400
Ready?

1951
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,160
Could it be in their hands?

1952
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:35,880
No, they all...

1953
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,920
I just checked two people's hands, didn't see it.

1954
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,240
I saw someone had something

1955
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,080
white in their hand.

1956
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,080
Really?

1957
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,960
But it was hidden in their sleeve.

1958
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,600
In their hands

1959
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,440
You can touch it

1960
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,920
You can touch it later

1961
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,480
But I'm not sure if that's his gun

1962
01:18:59,480 --> 01:18:59,800
It's fine

1963
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,160
No

1964
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,760
I think they should have it

1965
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,960
Yes, possibly

1966
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,200
Let me take another look at that guy

1967
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:04,680
This round we search people

1968
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,280
Existence implies purpose

1969
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:05,960
This round we search people

1970
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:06,640
Search people

1971
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,120
Search people

1972
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:07,920
Just search him and be done with it

1973
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,840
Search people

1974
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,920
How about 56 seconds?

1975
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,840
Never mind, let's just do it this way.

1976
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,240
One-minute countdown starts now.

1977
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,000
Okay, begin.

1978
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,920
Start.

1979
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,640
Go.

1980
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,160
Search for people.

1981
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,560
Go check on them.

1982
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,760
Look at their hands.

1983
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,160
There's nothing on their hands.

1984
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,600
Don't move

1985
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,320
It's really scary

1986
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,280
Don't move

1987
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,200
I'm a girl

1988
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,840
If you're a girl, don't move

1989
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,480
No

1990
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,320
But that guy just now had it in his hand

1991
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,560
Here

1992
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,320
Found it

1993
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,400
Here

1994
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:52,680
Is it here?

1995
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,600
Yes, it's definitely here

1996
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,040
Right here

1997
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,360
I just saw it in his hand

1998
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,920
He's using so much force

1999
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,080
I'm a little scared

2000
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,640
Come back first

2001
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,480
He's really forcing it

2002
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,360
I'll do it. Where?

2003
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,120
Maybe we should carry him in

2004
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,600
Here

2005
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,480
Oh no, it broke

2006
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,680
Time's almost up, right?

2007
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,480
Here

2008
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,080
We can take it out

2009
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,080
Can't get it out

2010
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,560
Break it

2011
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,240
Tear it

2012
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,000
Okay, got it

2013
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,080
Go

2014
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:25,440
Back

2015
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,200
Go

2016
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,440
Where is it?

2017
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,400
It's right in his hand.

2018
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,880
I told you I saw this.

2019
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,920
Its head is gone.

2020
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,520
It broke

2021
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,800
Was it because he held it too tightly?

2022
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,360
Then we pulled it from the top

2023
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:53,600
No

2024
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,440
I heard it snap when we tried to pry it just now

2025
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,080
Here

2026
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,960
Damn, it broke

2027
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,000
Where do we find him now?

2028
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,880
The clothes tore just now

2029
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,000
We tore his clothes

2030
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:06,920
He wouldn't let go

2031
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,280
Right

2032
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,680
Wait, there's a problem

2033
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,480
This

2034
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,560
Got damaged

2035
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,200
Try it

2036
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,600
You go play the piano

2037
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,720
That NPC

2038
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,800
I don't think they expected this either

2039
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,640
So much force

2040
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,320
He used too much force

2041
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:18,760
Way too much force

2042
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,320
Can't pry his hand open at all

2043
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,200
So is its head in his hand?

2044
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,280
He's gripping its head

2045
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,880
He's holding it like this

2046
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,920
Then it's in his hand

2047
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,120
Only this part of his hand is showing

2048
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,320
And we can't open his hand

2049
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,600
Couldn't open it so we

2050
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,040
Tore this

2051
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,200
Then we pulled it out like this

2052
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,160
But when we pulled it out, this

2053
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:34,840
Broke

2054
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,240
Play the piano

2055
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,760
You play while I tap with this

2056
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,440
Where to poke?

2057
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,000
Like this?

2058
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,680
The sensor point

2059
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,720
The reading pen's sensor point

2060
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,600
Right?

2061
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,880
Should we use this side to sense?

2062
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,800
I think so.

2063
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:47,320
Right?

2064
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:49,760
Yeah.

2065
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,560
It should be like this, right?

2066
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,680
Counterclockwise, correct?

2067
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,280
Just like this.

2068
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,240
Slide from both sides first.

2069
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,400
First from the middle to the left.

2070
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,120
Then from the left back to the middle.

2071
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,040
Isn't the arrow pointing inward?

2072
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:00,960
This inward direction is...

2073
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,160
It's inward.

2074
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:02,920
Where's the arrow?

2075
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,240
Isn't there a dot here?

2076
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,200
Purple arrow.

2077
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,000
Then tap here.

2078
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,160
Then slide from right inward.

2079
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,040
Yes, just slide it.

2080
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:08,760
Just once.

2081
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,800
You need to draw a star.

2082
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,760
Draw the star.

2083
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,400
Then...

2084
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,160
Right?

2085
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,240
Should we draw a little star?

2086
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,000
Exactly.

2087
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,360
Then slide it in.

2088
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:18,680
Yes.

2089
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,360
Probably.

2090
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,040
Like this.

2091
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,880
So first draw a five-pointed star.

2092
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,120
Then slide it in.

2093
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,160
Let's draw the star.

2094
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,480
Just draw a star directly.

2095
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,320
We have a minute anyway.

2096
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,600
You can try both methods.

2097
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,240
Come on.

2098
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:32,920
Let's go.

2099
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,360
Should we still look for his hand this time?

2100
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:34,880
No need.

2101
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,760
Just slide directly.

2102
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,120
Then Xiao He, you go by yourself.

2103
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:37,760
I'll do it.

2104
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,320
Go ahead.

2105
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,440
Come on, help me guard the door.

2106
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,040
But I'm right here.

2107
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,640
It's fine.

2108
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,240
What's wrong with you?

2109
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:54,920
Can't you see me or something?

2110
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,880
I thought you were coming out with me.

2111
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,000
He doesn't quite trust you.

2112
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,680
He doesn't trust you.

2113
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,640
He might lock you out later.

2114
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,520
Countdown begins in one minute

2115
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,840
Go

2116
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,880
Didn't set a timer for him this time

2117
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,280
It's fine

2118
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:12,920
No need to set it

2119
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,200
Right here

2120
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,280
Then use the vertical line again

2121
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:25,840
13 14 15 16 17

2122
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,160
Crystal Star device activated

2123
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,120
Activated

2124
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,320
Done

2125
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,000
Activation complete

2126
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,200
So it's permanently fixed now?

2127
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,520
Let's go

2128
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,320
All good, let's go

2129
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:34,960
Who said that?

2130
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,280
Any external robots

2131
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,440
Can't move inside here

2132
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,200
If we want non-exhibition robots

2133
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:41,960
To enter complete hibernation

2134
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,280
Enter full hibernation mode

2135
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,480
Activation method is

2136
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,240
Use the reading pen on the sensor

2137
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,000
Here, how about this

2138
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Let's leave one person inside

2139
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,160
Then the rest of us go out, okay?

2140
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:55,840
I'll do it, I'll stay

2141
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,640
We'll leave one person inside

2142
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:57,960
Just in case we all get caught, right?

2143
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,160
Let's try it, come on

2144
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,800
Let's go, out we go

2145
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,600
No, I don't need to

2146
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,720
Okay

2147
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,400
That guy earlier

2148
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,240
That guy earlier was kinda

2149
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,400
Isn't he still holding it?

2150
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,080
Where is it?

2151
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:10,760
Isn't it right here?

2152
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,520
This one

2153
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,640
It's really hard to open

2154
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,560
This guy

2155
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,520
Hope he doesn't get hurt

2156
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,000
Don't move

2157
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:26,960
What are you doing?

2158
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,360
Stay still

2159
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,240
I'm not moving

2160
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:29,640
No

2161
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,200
Isn't it permanent?

2162
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:31,960
It's fine

2163
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,360
What does this mean?

2164
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,040
Why?

2165
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,920
Crystal Star device activated

2166
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,440
Come on

2167
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,000
What's the meaning of this?

2168
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,240
Luckily we

2169
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,440
I told you we should keep one

2170
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,120
Then how do we contact him?

2171
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,720
No need, he'll know we're in trouble

2172
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,840
Then when he plays the instrument

2173
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,360
When the lights go out, we can return

2174
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,160
So it didn't work just now?

2175
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,200
Because there's no head

2176
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,280
Quick, find the head again

2177
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,480
Quick, look where that person is

2178
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,280
Where is that person?

2179
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,560
When the lights go out soon, quickly find the head

2180
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,520
Looking

2181
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,520
There

2182
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,040
The tallest one

2183
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:09,640
Far right

2184
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,360
Now the one walking forward on the far right

2185
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,480
The one on his right

2186
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,080
That's him

2187
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,920
This time we'll get him

2188
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,680
We'll deal with him when we get out

2189
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:15,960
Come on

2190
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,040
What about Xiao Ning?

2191
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,600
He doesn't know what to do now

2192
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,600
He definitely knows we've been caught

2193
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:24,880
Right

2194
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,640
He's waiting to play the instrument now

2195
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,800
Big brother is here to pick you up

2196
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,320
Extinguished

2197
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,600
Let's go

2198
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,240
One-minute countdown starts now

2199
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:45,920
Come

2200
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:46,760
Tickle his funny bone

2201
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,720
Move

2202
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,240
Far right

2203
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:50,960
Frontmost on the far right

2204
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,800
Front right

2205
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,960
Good thing we left someone behind

2206
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,320
You guard the door

2207
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,280
Bring it here

2208
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,080
Alright, buddy

2209
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:58,640
Hand it over

2210
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,160
There's something here

2211
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:05,920
Take his clothes off

2212
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,080
Let go quickly

2213
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,520
Tickle him

2214
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,720
This intense?

2215
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,760
Don't just stand there

2216
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,120
Hurry up and let go

2217
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,440
Should we move him over?

2218
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:24,920
Time's running out

2219
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,160
Too intense

2220
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:27,880
Come back first

2221
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:28,720
Come on, come back first

2222
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,560
Come back

2223
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,320
Let's think this through

2224
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:30,920
Quick

2225
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,880
He let go

2226
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:32,800
He released it

2227
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,360
Let go now

2228
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,600
Did you get it?

2229
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,640
Close the door

2230
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,480
You're the best

2231
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,720
Wait, is this the reason?

2232
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,160
Wait a second

2233
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,160
We'll have to try everything

2234
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:47,720
It's broken

2235
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,680
It's definitely broken

2236
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,680
Feels like we're in a battle

2237
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,080
There, fixed it

2238
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:54,720
Perfect

2239
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,360
All fixed

2240
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,240
Now it's completely fixed

2241
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,080
What does this mean?

2242
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:57,480
Don't understand

2243
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,760
Look, it says the robot has entered full hibernation mode

2244
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,240
Need to activate the exhibition hall's permanent hibernation device

2245
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,080
Activation method is

2246
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,640
Tap with the reading pen

2247
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,000
Read the sensor point

2248
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,400
Use this end to tap

2249
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,080
Use the thicker end to tap

2250
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,640
Watch your fingers

2251
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,520
Yes, actually it's like this

2252
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,760
Actually, it should be done this way

2253
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,800
We use this end to tap, right?

2254
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,960
Correct

2255
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:20,760
Five dots

2256
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:21,040
Five points

2257
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,680
Xiao He, go

2258
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,800
Let's try one more time then

2259
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,840
Draw a complete one

2260
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,880
You go count them

2261
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,480
One-minute countdown starts now

2262
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,600
One-minute countdown begins

2263
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,760
Go ahead

2264
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:48,920
1

2265
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,600
Okay, it's lit

2266
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,520
2

2267
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,640
It's bright

2268
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:56,800
Come on

2269
01:27:59,240 --> 01:27:59,960
So bright

2270
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,080
3

2271
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:04,920
4

2272
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,560
5

2273
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,000
5

2274
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:11,440
5

2275
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,280
Alright, stop

2276
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,960
We probably don't need to go back this time.

2277
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,160
Be confident and keep moving forward.

2278
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,560
I'm not turning back.

2279
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,400
Keep going forward.

2280
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,640
Confidence is key.

2281
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,560
Let confidence shine.

2282
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,480
Let's go.

2283
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:35,880
It's fine.

2284
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,520
I'll stay for a while.

2285
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,360
You're our safety net, right?

2286
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,400
Wow

2287
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:46,960
So cool

2288
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,520
Permanent hibernation device activated

2289
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:52,880
Cool

2290
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,520
Which gentleman was that just now?

2291
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,560
Who was that captain just now?

2292
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,520
Hibernation mode initiated, temporary reset

2293
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,600
They're going to reset

2294
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,360
Your phone

2295
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,280
Find them

2296
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,320
Find those two

2297
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,400
Wait a moment, yes

2298
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:18,600
Wait a moment, correct

2299
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,360
Is anyone there?

2300
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,560
Can anyone hear me?

2301
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,160
Go ahead

2302
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,240
This is Xiao Ting

2303
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,720
I've been captured by accident

2304
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,720
Also captured with me

2305
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,520
is game designer Ke Ke

2306
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,480
We're currently locked in

2307
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,920
Room 3 of the Cyber Robot Museum's escape room

2308
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:32,320
Escape room

2309
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,200
Escape room number 3

2310
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,200
Room 3, right?

2311
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:42,840
You're here

2312
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,280
Are you here to rescue us?

2313
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,160
Of course

2314
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,280
Come out now

2315
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,120
Don't tell me you actually activated

2316
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,200
the hypnosis device

2317
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,040
Yeah

2318
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,040
Haven't we already reset it?

2319
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:52,800
We're doomed

2320
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,160
What's wrong?

2321
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:54,840
What happened?

2322
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,120
What's the matter?

2323
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,640
You've fallen into a trap

2324
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,360
It was a trap set by Bei Ju

2325
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,040
He forced us to do this

2326
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,760
He wanted you to activate the hypnosis device

2327
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,280
which opened the venue's backdoor data

2328
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,400
So now we'll be

2329
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,440
trapped here forever

2330
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,600
We can't escape the entire Cyber Exhibition Hall

2331
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,400
So what's that in your hand?

2332
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,280
Will you share it with us?

2333
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,360
As the guardian of Tui Town

2334
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,360
I originally had the power to close the data backdoor

2335
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:39,160
But while chasing Bei Ju

2336
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,720
she used the water of Wu Kenai River

2337
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,880
to seal my powers

2338
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,440
Her powers were sealed

2339
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,840
So we were both captured and brought here

2340
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,040
If you can help restore my powers

2341
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:48,960
everything will be easier

2342
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,200
How do we restore them?

2343
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,720
This is the inner page of "The Secret of Tui Town"

2344
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,600
It contains hidden clues

2345
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,240
that can help restore my powers

2346
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,600
Tick tock tick

2347
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,200
Fluorescence

2348
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,200
Music box

2349
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,840
Tick tock tick

2350
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,400
Come

2351
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,200
Coming

2352
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,280
It's like this

2353
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,000
The lyrics hide the secret of Tui Town

2354
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Keyboard refers to the novel dimension

2355
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,720
That infinite flow one

2356
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,680
Five elements

2357
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,240
I heard Hu Jie also wrote sci-fi stories since childhood

2358
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,920
And even won children's sci-fi literature awards

2359
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,680
That's impressive

2360
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,040
Paintbrush refers to the comic dimension

2361
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:44,920
Cold-Blooded Academy

2362
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,200
Called Cold-Blooded Academy

2363
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,680
After he married Ba Balu

2364
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,800
They had Sister Ba

2365
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,560
You're his daughter

2366
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:50,760
Yes

2367
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,120
Brother Ba

2368
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:52,920
Keyboard - Novel

2369
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,960
Camera refers to the film dimension

2370
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,600
"Office Mysteries"

2371
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:57,720
"Office Mysteries"

2372
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,600
Young Marshal He

2373
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,440
Dedicated himself to the film industry

2374
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,000
The He family became famous in Tui Town as

2375
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,720
A family of performers

2376
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,560
Young actor He Jiawei

2377
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,600
Fluorescence refers to the gaming dimension

2378
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,280
Fluorescence - Game

2379
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,360
Didn't my sister say she was in Tui Paradise

2380
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,200
Developing that

2381
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,360
New game

2382
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,240
Called "Mysterious Player"

2383
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:15,720
I've been in Tui Paradise

2384
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,480
Working on game design

2385
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,920
My game is called "Mysterious Player"

2386
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,000
So if you want to unlock abilities

2387
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,640
Requires 14 people to perform Tui Town Dance together

2388
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,200
The movements of Tui Town Dance

2389
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:37,080
Were preset in 7 cyberpunk robots

2390
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:40,160
Only Tui Town guardians can activate the program

2391
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:40,960
Please note

2392
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,400
At the end of Tui Town Dance

2393
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,480
Only requires the 5 who fell into Wukenai River

2394
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,960
To hold a standard star pose for 10 seconds

2395
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,640
We know how to do that

2396
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,360
That

2397
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,480
Come on

2398
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,080
Now I'll go unlock them

2399
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:08,600
Okay

2400
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,240
They're coming

2401
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:32,920
They are

2402
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,160
1,234,567 of them

2403
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:36,760
Understood

2404
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,280
Activated

2405
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,320
Alright, let's go

2406
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,960
That was just activation, we overthought it.

2407
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,280
That was just activation, right?

2408
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,040
No, it's already finished.

2409
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,840
We just need to memorize this move.

2410
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,480
You all need to remember.

2411
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,640
At the end, strike the five-pointed star pose.

2412
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:41,840
After jumping.

2413
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,160
Just strike the five-pointed star at the end.

2414
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,360
This is how we do it, right?

2415
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,080
This is how we do it.

2416
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,440
Wait, is the hand like this?

2417
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,080
Here.

2418
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,200
Is there a hand over here?

2419
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:58,680
Jiawei.

2420
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,480
I'm here.

2421
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,600
What is this?

2422
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,480
Throw that chicken away, oh my god.

2423
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,760
What chicken? Banana?

2424
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,360
Banana.

2425
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,120
Right?

2426
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:17,840
Isn't that right?

2427
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,080
Okay, that works.

2428
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:19,560
Is that okay?

2429
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,000
Yes, that's exactly it.

2430
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,840
Agreed.

2431
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,200
If we both lower our stance a bit...

2432
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,280
This time we'll do it properly.

2433
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,280
Properly then, good.

2434
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,040
I hope you can...

2435
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,480
successfully help restore my powers.

2436
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,360
Once successful,

2437
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,360
Tui Town will light up green,

2438
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,080
signaling my powers are restored.

2439
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,320
Pose

2440
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:58,640
Let's go

2441
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,360
Hurry up

2442
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,240
The dimensional barrier of Tui Town can finally be repaired.

2443
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,080
Thank you all.

2444
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,160
The story of Tui Town

2445
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,200
has come to a perfect conclusion.

2446
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,760
Thank you for your wonderful performances in Tui Town.

2447
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,080
Now,

2448
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,560
the exit to Tui Town's alternate dimension

2449
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,560
has opened.

2450
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,600
It's a bit sad.

2451
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,400
What is this?

2452
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,760
I don't want to leave.

2453
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,560
Face his door and walk backward.

2454
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,440
Take the road behind you

2455
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,920
After you see the Genghua Village sign

2456
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,960
I proposed to her but she refused

2457
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,280
She wants to go with you

2458
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,400
What are you two doing?

2459
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,000
We are family

2460
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:33,920
You...

2461
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,040
Have you been happy lately?

2462
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,400
Goodbye to this world

2463
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:38,840
What's going on here?

2464
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,800
This building doesn't belong to this era

2465
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,240
Right?

2466
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,040
You twist here

2467
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:45,800
I twist here

2468
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,360
One, two, three

2469
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,400
A swift slash

2470
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,240
Eliminate all the company's

2471
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,080
workaholic overlords

2472
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:55,720
After the obsessed ones begin the ritual

2473
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,440
They all enter the Town of Deduction

2474
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,920
Welcome to Deduction Town

2475
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,120
In this prophecy

2476
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,160
For every one that comes true

2477
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,000
Someone dies

2478
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,800
Rui Sisi deeply regrets

2479
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,040
She never wanted to bully others

2480
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,120
The true way to lift the curse

2481
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,960
Is that without bullying, there would be no curse

2482
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,960
When encountering bullying

2483
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,080
You must have the courage to speak up

2484
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,240
Within your capabilities

2485
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:18,640
Bravely stand up

2486
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,240
Everyone has their darkest moments

2487
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:21,000
Find something

2488
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,160
That you truly desire

2489
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,680
To pursue

2490
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,720
As long as everyone has good

2491
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,400
And kind intentions

2492
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,800
You should be yourself

2493
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,760
A beam of light in the dark night

2494
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,440
To truly be happy

2495
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,880
And fulfilled

2496
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,440
You must find a way to escape the rat race

2497
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,600
And live as your true self

2498
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:39,760
When you're not busy

2499
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,920
You should look up

2500
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:41,520
At the stars

2501
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,520
It might make you happier

2502
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,200
Don't hold too many obsessions

2503
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,360
Let go of the past

2504
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,120
So you can move forward

2505
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,760
Helimo Jinyu

2506
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,920
Let the deduction begin

2507
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,720
Helimo Yu, King of Deduction

2508
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,000
Let the deduction begin

2509
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,800
Helimo Yu, King of Deduction

2510
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,240
Let the deduction begin

2511
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,960
Goodbye

2512
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:15,560
Today is this season's

2513
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,560
final episode.

2514
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:18,720
Let's not discuss

2515
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,200
specific legal concepts

2516
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,880
Instead, let's look broadly

2517
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:22,880
at the role of law

2518
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,720
in maintaining social order

2519
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:25,840
You might think

2520
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,320
things like curse-based murders

2521
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,040
robot-controlled killings

2522
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,640
or trafficking organs of dimension-travelers

2523
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,720
only exist in game scenarios

2524
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:35,800
And our

2525
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:36,880
actual living environment

2526
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,640
isn't that sci-fi

2527
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,480
but stable and secure

2528
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,240
But imagine

2529
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,440
if one day

2530
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,160
this stable and orderly system

2531
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,080
completely disappeared

2532
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,560
what would the world become?

2533
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,280
Would you still dare to go outside?

2534
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,480
They probably wouldn't dare.

2535
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,120
Without social order,

2536
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:54,840
people would lack

2537
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,440
stable expectations.

2538
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,920
Human civilization would also vanish.

2539
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,400
Laws can establish order.

2540
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:02,160
The legal system

2541
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,280
is typically designed

2542
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,000
according to people's

2543
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,040
ideal vision of social order.

2544
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,560
Laws not only guide

2545
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,680
social actors by granting them

2546
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,280
certain rights and freedoms,

2547
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,280
but also impose obligations

2548
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,840
and responsibilities

2549
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,680
to encourage necessary

2550
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,040
self-restraint,

2551
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,880
thereby establishing

2552
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,600
appropriate social order.

2553
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:24,760
This helps

2554
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,840
minimize

2555
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,960
social conflicts

2556
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,040
and disputes.

2557
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,480
Laws also maintain order.

2558
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,040
In real life,

2559
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,080
we witness

2560
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,480
issues like school bullying,

2561
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,800
overwork exhaustion,

2562
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,960
organ trafficking,

2563
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,120
cyber hacking,

2564
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:39,880
personal data leaks,

2565
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,640
and identity theft.

2566
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,920
These social problems persist

2567
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,800
because laws aren't omnipotent.

2568
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,880
They can establish rules,

2569
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,800
but some will break them.

2570
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,720
Thus, the law

2571
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:51,400
imposes penalties

2572
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,200
on offenders,

2573
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,320
punishing those

2574
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,760
who threaten society,

2575
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,880
to further educate

2576
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,160
individuals and communities.

2577
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:00,600
This is because the law

2578
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,040
is mandatory in nature

2579
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,960
Behind it

2580
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,080
there exists an entire state apparatus

2581
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,760
that ensures its enforcement

2582
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,920
Every member of society

2583
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,040
must comply with

2584
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,080
the mandatory provisions of the law

2585
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,240
Any violation

2586
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,480
will face legal consequences

2587
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,480
Through this

2588
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,000
civilized approach

2589
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,280
to dispute resolution

2590
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,000
it prevents violent retaliation

2591
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,600
achieves fairness and justice

2592
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,640
and maintains

2593
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,200
social order

2594
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:26,640
However, the law is not

2595
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:27,840
without flaws

2596
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,120
It must continuously adapt to

2597
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,000
social changes and development

2598
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:31,960
Thus we see

2599
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:32,800
the age of criminal responsibility

2600
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,240
being lowered through amendments

2601
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,440
and new legislation

2602
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,120
continuously emerging regarding AI

2603
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,080
The enforcement of law

2604
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,680
also relies on law enforcement agencies'

2605
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:41,720
fairness and efficiency

2606
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:42,760
as well as all citizens'

2607
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,720
respect for and compliance with the law

2608
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,680
Therefore we emphasize

2609
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,480
that everyone obeying laws and regulations

2610
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,360
is also maintaining

2611
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,760
such social order

2612
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,480
and striving to build

2613
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,480
a more fair,

2614
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,280
just and orderly future

2615
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,120
The town has its guardians

2616
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,200
and around us

2617
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,200
there are such guardians too

2618
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:06,760
Wow, that's really thoughtful

2619
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,200
Happy wrap-up!

2620
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,120
Before this,

2621
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:11,080
we had every player

2622
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,120
fill out a

2623
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,680
season impression summary

2624
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,600
about how they view

2625
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,280
the others

2626
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,640
I didn't expect you'd want this kind of

2627
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,120
direct confrontation

2628
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,360
For a man to grow,

2629
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,440
he needs to be hurt by a woman

2630
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,440
That's how it works

2631
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,280
As for Zhang Linghe,

2632
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,800
he's completely crazy

2633
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:30,760
Wow

2634
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,240
Recording one episode

2635
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:32,240
turned friends into enemies

2636
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,200
I sense

2637
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,520
wickedness from you

2638
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,320
Me?

2639
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:37,840
How am I wicked?

2640
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,720
He's an unfathomable man

2641
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,080
Bai Yu's heart is deep as the ocean

2642
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,240
Extremely beautiful

2643
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:43,960
You've left us speechless

2644
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:44,720
What do you think?

2645
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:47,360
Yes, Keyu outsmarted himself

2646
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,400
I think we have a chance

2647
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,440
to become partners in crime

2648
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,480
Next season, just you wait

2649
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,280
