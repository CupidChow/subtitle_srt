1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,400
I'm really good at grilling.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Really?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,360
I'm really skilled at grilling.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,920
You can grill this too?

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,280
We've prepared some fireworks

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,840
They'll help liven up the atmosphere

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,240
Let's liven things up

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,880
Let's do it together

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,680
Everyone take one

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,440
Okay

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,200
This one's so beautiful

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,880
I want to hear Huck sing

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,240
My singing doesn't come cheap

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,760
Are you happy today?

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,600
Very happy!

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,160
If you're happy, come toast with us

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Bottoms up

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,480
I'll drink mine too

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,320
What did you study in college?

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,120
I studied physics

21
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,920
Why did you choose to study physics?

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,040
I like physics

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,720
I love physics

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,360
The princess's room

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,240
Look quickly

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,120
Sister Ba's photo album

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,120
Come, have a seat.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,360
Let me get everyone some drinks.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
I'll handle it, you all relax first.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,800
No problem, I'll do it.

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
I'm really good at grilling.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,240
Really?

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm an excellent griller.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,760
Alright, you do it then.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,560
We've prepared fireworks.

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,120
They'll liven up the mood.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,880
Sounds good.

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,040
I want to hear Hercules sing.

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,360
My singing comes at a high price.

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
Name your price, we'll pay.

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,400
How much? Tell us.

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,760
No copyright.

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,360
No problem, I'll cover the copyright.

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,000
You sing for me.

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,640
Have you released any singles recently?

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
With my talent, of course I can release singles.

47
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,920
It's a loss for the Chinese music industry.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,480
Are you asking me to write a song for you?

49
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,120
Brother Ning.

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,200
Not asking for your brother.

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,120
Want your life instead?

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
Asking for a song, right?

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,720
Now I understand.

54
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,600
Requesting a song.

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Now I get it - requesting a song.

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,680
Seriously, someone should perform.

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,360
Come on.

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,120
You do one.

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Is this really okay?

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,320
Even an opening act?

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,160
Is this "If You Are the One"?

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,000
Can you feel it?

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
This can be roasted too

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
This should be edible now, right?

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,560
It has no flavor at all.

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,840
Sure, but you'll need to add some seasoning.

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,920
The seasoning isn't in yet

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,600
Not added yet

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,040
Aren't you...

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,400
You put it there, I'll add it for you

71
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,240
No, this needs to be taken

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
This has to be taken away

73
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,000
Chili powder

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,720
Pepper powder

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
What powder is this?

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Cumin

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,120
Let's create some atmosphere

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
How do we set this off?

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,840
Let's start with the small ones

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,720
Then go for a big one

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,400
Just this small one

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,840
This one

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
Give me some of this

84
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,760
This won't make noise, will it?

85
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,680
No, it's rotating

86
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,640
We must get a Gatling gun.

87
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
Camera crew, stay safe.

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
This is very nice

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,520
Let's each take one

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,240
Okay

91
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,280
Do you dare?

92
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,840
Okay

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,680
Grab the one below, not the one above

94
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,760
Let's play for a bit.

95
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,480
Brother Bai

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
Is it all dust?

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll get it myself.

98
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,640
Straighter, hold it higher.

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,520
It's all dust.

100
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,680
Let's do one together.

101
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,880
Let's go together

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Take one each

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
The cameraman's head is covered in dust

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,720
Yeah, you're all dusty here

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
You're holding it upside down, Ling He

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
He's not

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,960
You're holding it wrong, you scared me

108
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,400
Shouldn't we light this end?

109
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,240
Light this end and extend it forward

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,160
Put it forward

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
This way

112
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,440
This way, come on

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,120
Coming

114
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay, go

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Dot

116
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,720
So beautiful

117
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
I have so many of these.

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,400
Look

119
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,200
Look at this one too

120
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,480
Mine is so fast

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
So beautiful

122
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,240
So gorgeous

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,600
So pretty

124
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,680
This purple is so beautiful

125
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,840
This purple is absolutely stunning

126
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,720
So lovely

127
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
Thank you

128
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,280
Let's put both together

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,040
Here, one for each of you

130
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
Peacock spreading its tail

131
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,560
So that's how it is, right?

132
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
It appears so

133
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,360
And also

134
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Playing like this? No way.

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,280
Haven't you set this off before?

136
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,040
But you didn't expect

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,800
it to end with such a bang.

138
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,280
Come, have a seat.

139
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,320
Let's chat, have a talk.

140
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
How was the fireworks show?

141
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,560
Everyone, teachers.

142
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Happy, so happy.

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,040
What about Dilraba?

144
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,560
How long has it been

145
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,280
since you've had this much fun?

146
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,400
How long has it been since you were this happy?

147
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,520
Last time was in February.

148
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,600
I took my mom to see some.

149
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,800
She just saw that one -

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,480
the one that shot up earlier.

151
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,520
We watched it together.

152
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,440
So happy.

153
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,040
Right.

154
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,080
What about Linghe? We...

155
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,240
last set off big fireworks as kids.

156
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,640
What about Brother Bai?

157
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,680
How long since you've seen fireworks?

158
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,520
Ages.

159
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,320
Happy today?

160
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Happy.

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,920
Happy.

162
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,320
Why not toast with us brothers?

163
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,320
You don't look happy

164
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm actually very happy inside

165
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,280
Bring your glass and toast with us

166
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,840
Today you're treating

167
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,680
us friends who trust you unfairly

168
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,120
You should drink one yourself

169
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
You're being too unfair

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,840
Down one drink

171
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,880
Then I'll drink one too

172
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,400
Come on, now

173
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,280
At this moment, let's welcome our Hekefu

174
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,120
to sing us a song

175
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,360
"The Brightest Star in the Night Sky"

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
Let's all join in

177
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,440
So tired

178
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,960
What?

179
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,280
Help me start, give me the first line

180
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,160
I wish to have a

181
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,720
I wish to have a

182
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,040
What's the line?

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,560
I pray to have a transparent heart

184
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
And eyes that can shed tears

185
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Give me the courage to believe again

186
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,960
To embrace you beyond the lies

187
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,080
Continue

188
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
Giving you a chance is really

189
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
I can't sing

190
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,680
It's okay

191
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,720
The stars are in our hearts

192
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
As long as you have them in your heart, stars are everywhere

193
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,080
Let's say hello to that star

194
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,040
Hello

195
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,440
This game has a loophole.

196
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
What loophole?

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,520
The force required to open and close is different.

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,280
The muscles used when opening

199
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,320
Should be

200
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Both sides

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,560
The outer part

202
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,400
Yes, the outer hip

203
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,840
Then when closing, you're

204
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
Using the inner thighs?

205
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,080
These two inner thigh muscles

206
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Alright, no problem

207
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,240
I won't say more

208
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,560
Get ready

209
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
Three, two, one, go

210
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,920
You're too skinny

211
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,520
Your bones are digging into me, oh my god

212
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,120
Your bones...

213
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
I can't take it anymore

214
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,520
Every single one of his bones

215
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,800
is piercing into my flesh

216
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,480
No way, are you serious?

217
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm serious

218
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
Yours hurt so much, your bones

219
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,280
No

220
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm telling you it's this thing on your pants

221
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,480
Really?

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Little Pearl

223
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,680
Switch sides

224
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:40,920
Come on

225
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,240
Three

226
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,640
Two

227
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,920
One

228
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,400
Go

229
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,640
It's too hard

230
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,520
Starting is too hard

231
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,320
Starting is too hard

232
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,080
We both expended too much energy just now

233
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,800
Let's rest for a bit

234
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,240
Tired already?

235
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,200
Tired already?

236
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,120
We've been competing all night, you know

237
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,520
Okay

238
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,240
Come on

239
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,640
We already know, right

240
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:10,920
Two

241
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,240
One

242
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
Put more strength into it

243
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,320
I can feel it

244
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,400
Right?

245
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,840
Yes

246
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm still very energetic

247
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,960
I won't compete with you anymore

248
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,040
You're a bit mean

249
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Wait, what did you study in college?

250
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I studied physics

251
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,440
You majored in physics?

252
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,800
Yes

253
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,960
Why did you choose to study physics in college?

254
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,320
Because

255
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
I like physics

256
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,880
Like physics, yes

257
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
I like physics

258
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,600
I like physics

259
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Two more rounds

260
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,560
I haven't beaten you yet

261
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760
Ready, three-two-one

262
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,040
I'll teach you to be arrogant

263
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,480
The princess's room

264
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
has already been restored here

265
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,160
Why do I have so many

266
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
tea cups

267
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,600
Sis Ba also has some photo albums

268
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
Look quickly

269
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,800
Sis Ba's photo albums

270
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,000
Its small room is quite nicely arranged.

271
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,840
This is delicious

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,200
The cheese bun inside is tasty

273
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
I can also operate a sewing machine

274
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,800
Why don't I have many clothes?

275
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
How should I dress every day?

276
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
This is the only one I have

277
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,600
It seems quite convincing, doesn't it?

278
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,080
This is the hand drum we used to dance with in the past.

279
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,520
What's this for?

280
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
This seems to be for making

281
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,440
human

282
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
that kind of food

283
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,160
naan bread

284
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,480
So I'm still making naan at home

285
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,200
Then I'd need a tandoor oven

286
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,160
It's over

287
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,600
My criminal

288
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,360
Never mind

289
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,080
Should we search around?

290
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Everyone's homes?

291
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,080
We could take a look.

292
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,440
Let's go.

293
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,000
First to Bai Kan's place.

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Bai Mai.

295
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,880
I advise you not to rummage through things.

296
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,560
This is your house, right?

297
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,120
Yes.

298
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
So this is your place?

299
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,640
You just tolerate him like this?

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,920
Just because he's senior to you?

301
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,480
Elder cousin.

302
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,400
I've put up with you long enough, elder cousin.

303
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,440
Elder cousin.

304
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,360
I've really put up with you and Sis Li for too long.

305
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,040
This is the new house I bought.

306
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,240
I never expected...

307
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
Can you blame me for being angry?

308
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,160
You mean I beat you to it, right?

309
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,760
Exactly.

310
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
Cousin

311
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,400
What?

312
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,760
Stop going through my clothes.

313
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,240
As if I’d want to touch your clothes.

314
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,600
They’re wet and filthy.

315
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,080
They stink—totally rancid.

316
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,040
I suggest you all be careful.

317
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,080
What are you looking at?

318
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,760
Just looking.

319
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,720
There’s nothing here.

320
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,680
I just came up with a new idea.

321
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Why?

322
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,480
Because he killed someone here yesterday.

323
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
So he doesn’t want to leave.

324
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,200
It’s you.

325
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,040
What the hell is this?

326
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,320
You’ve got me speechless.

327
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,280
What’s suspicious about the shoe rack?

328
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,600
It really stinks.

329
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,680
What is this?

330
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
Why do you have so many pairs of slippers?

331
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Right.

332
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,560
He just wants us to take off our shoes.

333
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,120
Why do you want us to take off our shoes?

334
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,880
Because I want to see who has smelly feet.

335
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,920
You're not even helping us clean them.

336
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,680
Is this your way of remembering us?

337
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,720
You wear them one by one.

338
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,040
How many people live here?

339
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,960
How many people live here?

340
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
How many people are in our family?

341
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,400
Six people.

342
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,120
Wrong.

343
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,280
One family - there are four in our family.

344
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Right, how many pairs of shoes in total?

345
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Including Xiao Ba, that's five people.

346
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,680
No, count all of us.

347
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,760
We are one family.

348
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,000
A loving family.

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,080
Second brother, eldest brother, sister-in-law.

350
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
How is it five people? Am I not a person?

351
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,600
My nephew doesn't count? My son.

352
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,880
Then let's take the son, not Buddy.

353
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,480
If we want this one, we'll need five.

354
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,760
Right.

355
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,360
Which means

356
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,760
We've lived in their house before.

357
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,120
You're actually quite nice.

358
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,880
I'm pretty decent, aren't I?

359
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
Just confess honestly.

360
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
I just hope

361
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
to live together with everyone.

362
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,440
You miss us.

363
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,040
How perverse.

364
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
You two...

365
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,600
No wonder you two

366
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
are on the same boat.

367
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,400
Why does your house have

368
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,640
baby powder?

369
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,200
You can analyze this.

370
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,680
Look at what we found,

371
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,400
yet he won't explain.

372
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,920
How to analyze this?

373
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,400
Let me tell you,

374
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,840
If you don't leave before time's up,

375
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,600
if none of you leave,

376
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,320
I'll have to "take care of" you myself.

377
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,080
Let's go, let's go.

378
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,720
This is our home.

379
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,400
This room is so clean.

380
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,160
This piece of glass is kinda scary.

381
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,160
You guys go ahead.

382
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
This glass is a bit frightening.

383
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,480
I feel like something might jump out.

384
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
Frozen pear.

385
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,960
I thought it was spoiled.

386
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,400
Haven't you had frozen pear before?

387
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,160
No.

388
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,880
Oh my.

389
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,160
Frozen pears are super delicious.

390
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,520
Can we step on this?

391
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
Will it collapse if I step on it?

392
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,600
It won't collapse.

393
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,280
You can step on it and jump.

394
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,080
Tigger

395
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,440
I need to go out and play

396
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,560
Are you trying to scam me?

397
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,240
If you go out, you'll "die."

398
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,720
Yes, Tigger

399
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,840
This one's a bit difficult for me

400
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
This is quite challenging

401
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,720
It's tough, you try it

402
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,360
I won't try, I'm afraid I'll fall

403
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,400
He has a modern slipper

404
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,240
Look

405
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,520
What do you mean by modern?

406
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,800
No, he has a massage slipper

407
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,520
Impossible

408
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,000
Our story is set in 1988

409
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,840
Why do you love massages so much?

410
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,920
After all, I'm 46 years old

411
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,480
Handsome or not?

412
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,720
Really handsome

413
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,280
Isn't this puppy cute?

414
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,000
It's your dog

415
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,560
It's yours

416
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,720
Is this that person?

417
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,720
My silly Mimi

418
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,680
Your inspection is really...

419
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,040
What's wrong?

420
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,080
Do you think we're not thorough enough?

421
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,400
Then you check

422
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,000
Fine

423
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,040
Boss Wang

424
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,200
Come, take a look at my place

425
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,120
My home

426
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
Alright, Boss Wang

427
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,240
Boss Wang is Xiao Ba's father

428
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,080
Could there be some connection with...

429
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
You scared me

430
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
Coming here to ruin people's livelihoods

431
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Sorry about that

432
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,560
All the lamps in your room are on

433
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,480
What does this mean?

434
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm afraid at night

435
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,200
Why are they still on when it's daylight?

436
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
I keep them on during daylight too

437
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,440
I'm just used to it

438
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
Alright, alright

439
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,240
What's wrong?

440
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,160
Suspect him

441
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
He suspects you

442
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,120
There shouldn't be anything here

443
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,720
So next

444
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,760
We've come to Sis Ba's place

445
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,960
Look here

446
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,160
This is hers

447
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,480
This photo of hers

448
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,960
You have such wild photos too?

449
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,160
Everyone had their wild days

450
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Found these are all

451
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
Haw flakes and such

452
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,800
Must be tasty

453
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,680
This one's still glowing

454
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,920
And this one, this is pretty cool

455
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,160
What was this called again?

456
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,080
Does Captain Ning have these posted by his bedside?

457
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,160
Every room has them.

458
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,880
Does everyone have this?

459
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,440
No need to dwell on this ethical issue.

460
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,480
Don't worry about these ethics anymore.

461
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,800
At this point,

462
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,960
This joke has run its course.

463
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,080
We'll revisit it again at the ending.

464
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,600
That's enough.

465
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,600
Isn't this...

466
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
There's also one at the Bai Sect.

467
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,800
I just brought it over.

468
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,680
She just collects some...

469
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,720
things I've used.

470
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
You know what I mean, right?

471
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,160
What do you mean?

472
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,440
You two...

473
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
No, I just thought...

474
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,280
it might be some kind of evidence.

475
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,120
Welcome to

476
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,280
Tui Zhen Art Academy

477
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,760
for our annual school anniversary celebration

478
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,680
This is so difficult

479
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,200
So risqué

480
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
So tacky

481
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,280
Like those singers in front of supermarkets

482
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,920
Then I'll hold your leg

483
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,520
You need to do it like this

484
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,760
Stand on one leg

485
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
What the heck

486
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,680
Wrong way

487
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,240
Backwards

488
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,080
With a face full of unhappiness

489
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,880
Melancholic guy

490
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,360
We all need to be more melancholic at first

491
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,320
Yes, good at being melancholic

492
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,080
Okay okay okay

493
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
What about your kneeling?

494
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,600
Right, weren't you going to propose?

495
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,680
Don't forget

496
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
If you forget, we'll have to start over

497
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,760
I'll keep recording until you get it right

498
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,200
Why are you panting?

499
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,480
Girl groups all do this

500
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,720
Teacher Jin, open the door please

501
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,000
You need to recite a "spell"

502
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,960
Make me pretty, make me pretty

503
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,160
Make me prettier than Ba Zimei

504
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,160
It works

505
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,080
It works

506
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,680
Are you two still dating?

507
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,120
Finally some plot development

508
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,640
Love watching this, so dramatic

509
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Your fans should be called Morning Glories

510
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,320
Why call him an ox?

511
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,680
He sings like an ox

512
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,280
Sings like an ox mooing

513
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
Where were you? Took so long

514
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
Were you filming the crime process?

515
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,520
Now you show up

516
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,360
You know this routine well

517
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,000
Not a killer

518
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,080
Why would there be a killer's routine?

519
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,320
Never mind

520
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,720
Oops, talked too much

521
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,600
Oh dear oh dear
