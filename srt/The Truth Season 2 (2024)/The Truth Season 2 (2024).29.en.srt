00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,280
Welcome to

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,760
the show sponsored by

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,640
all our dedicated fans - "Let's Deduce! X"

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm Cui Shaoyang

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,080
"Start Deduction" Season 2

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,440
introducing our first "Dual Killers" gameplay

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,520
This episode at Deduction Town Art Academy

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,400
we welcome the annual school festival once again

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Zhi Daole and TYP were both murdered

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,200
After investigation

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,200
the real culprits turned out to be Ke Daole and Ning Hao

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,160
How did these two killers pass the X test

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,640
and clear themselves of suspicion

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
to successfully obtain the golden key?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,520
Now let's all together

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,160
"Let's Deduce! X"

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,320
It's time for the annual X Mission Competition

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,880
So today

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,760
as the killers

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,200
as the killers

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,720
if "Ke" represents three

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,480
what numbers do "Dao" and "Le" represent?

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,760
Three words have five numbers

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,960
No mistake, right?

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,200
What's the connection between nine and "Ning"?

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,560
These are numbers

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,720
Three

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
Three

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,200
Why should it be three?

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,680
This "beauty"

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,360
It has one, two, three, four, five, six

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,720
six horizontal lines

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,520
Then "self" has one, two, three, four horizontal lines

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,760
"Ba" has one, two, three horizontal lines

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,200
So it's three, four, six

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,280
But our actual logic is

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,600
to count how many squares there are

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
Square

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,720
Numbers?

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
One two three four five six

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Seven eight nine

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,600
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
Eight nine two three

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,320
The number of squares contained in each shape

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,520
First count the smallest ones: one, two, three, four, five, six

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,480
Then the combined ones: seven, eight

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,880
So it's eight nine two three

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
Wait, let me check again

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,600
Maybe it's like this

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,920
Let me see

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,320
I think

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,600
This "Bai" character

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,240
is combined

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Then this definitely isn't Bai Sect's doing

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,160
One two three, right?

56
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
This is three

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,760
One two three four

58
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
This is four

59
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,400
Three four one

60
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,760
The correct answer is 391.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,800
The first character has been guessed.

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,560
The character "gold" has a total of eight strokes.

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,720
And this one written

64
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,200
is the awkwardly written character "gold"

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,840
with eleven strokes

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
Eleven minus eight equals

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,760
Three

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,520
Then let's count the second "si"

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,320
One, two, three, four, five—five strokes

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
How do you count this?

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
How is this counted as one stroke?

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,720
Let's start with the shapes

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
Three

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,880
One triangle

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
Two trapezoids

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Two squares

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,320
How does this count as shapes?

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,040
End

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Challenge failed

80
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,240
Good thing I'm not the murderer

81
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,360
Three five two

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,720
Three seven two

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
Three four two

84
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,440
Three six two

85
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,600
Wrong

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,240
I got it

87
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,360
Three nine two

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,800
Wrong

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,240
The correct answer is three eight two

90
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
Three nine two

91
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,720
Three seven two

92
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,160
Three four two

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,240
Three six two

94
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,160
Nine three two, right?

95
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,160
Because this

96
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,440
This "宁" looks like nine

97
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
And this one

98
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,120
This should look like three

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
Then what does this "女" look like?

100
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,840
Nine four three

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
Nine eight three

102
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
How come

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
Look, look

104
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Count the squares inside the "宁" character

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,520
Calculate it this way

106
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,160
Today's is quite difficult

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,920
They made it deliberately hard, didn't they?

108
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,320
Who should go first?

109
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
You go or I go?

110
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,960
Alright.

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,360
This is my first time experiencing this.

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
Completely calm and composed

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,120
Come on

114
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,320
Why are you staring at him?

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
What's with that expression?

116
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,760
Anyway, those two know

117
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,400
who is X and who isn't X

118
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,080
They know it themselves

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Only these two detectives

120
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
know about each other's identities

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
Because they'll see they're not

122
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
Before this round, the killer

123
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,240
will complete this X mission

124
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,400
If completed,

125
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,480
they get a secret action

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,280
For example,

127
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,800
saying something

128
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
anything at all

129
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,880
I once had a mission

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,640
where I had to pat him in front of everyone

131
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,080
I've heard about your situation.

132
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,520
You have three days to sign it.

133
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,680
Otherwise I'll start releasing some statements.

134
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,880
I advise you not to.

135
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Destroy your own future.

136
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,600
Party B is Ke Daole.

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,200
Zi Daole must have called TYP.

138
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
Saying he wants to break up with me.

139
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
She said then sign a supplementary contract.

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Sign it quickly, or you'll regret it.

141
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,600
They're demanding compensation from you.

142
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:35,960
Signed one.

143
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,600
Right.

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,440
She wants to ruin my reputation.

145
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,040
And TYP wants to take advantage of this.

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,440
To make me pay him compensation.

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,400
Then you have even stronger motive for murder.

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:43,920
Yes.

149
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,560
If the three of us can prove our alibis,

150
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,920
and one person is imitating TYP,

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,280
then the killer must be among the four of us.

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,600
It must be him doing the imitation.

153
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,320
Unless you have a reason,

154
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,200
a reason that can prove

155
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,120
the first appearance of that TYP

156
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,840
was genuine and not you.

157
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
After TYP went in,

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,280
we didn't see him leave on the surveillance footage.

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,160
So there must be someone

160
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
who helped him get out.

161
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,000
This...

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Didn't I mention earlier about the sequence

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,720
where...

164
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
moving paintings and pushing boxes?

165
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,160
Two people could work together.

166
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,560
Right.

167
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
How did this person get out?

168
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,920
The person moving paintings could cover for him.

169
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,760
I'm hypothesizing

170
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,960
if he was the one impersonating TYP.

171
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
He's the fourth...

172
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,400
No, he's the third.

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,120
You go in carrying paintings,

174
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,000
and then...

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
smuggle him out while he's wearing red clothes.

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,960
I didn't smuggle him out.

177
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,640
I didn't say that.

178
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,560
Just a hypothesis.

179
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,320
Yes, hypothetically.

180
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,920
I'm just explaining this logical method.

181
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
Boxes and paintings work the same way.

182
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,600
Let's analyze

183
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,800
who might have motives for murder.

184
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,040
Start by examining the motives.

185
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,400
This person probably only intended to kill one person.

186
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,440
My murder motive was actually to kill two people.

187
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,600
So it couldn't have been me.

188
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Eliminated.

189
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,640
Then maybe coincidentally,

190
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,800
you saw someone else who also wanted to kill him.

191
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,560
So you thought

192
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,440
you could conveniently use that person.

193
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,240
You're targeting me.

194
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
It's obvious.

195
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,320
In my opinion,

196
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,240
from my personal perspective,

197
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
one person killed two people.

198
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,960
I think the siblings are highly suspicious.

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,240
But we just can't find any evidence.

200
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Why does it have to be the two of us?

201
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,440
Neither of us can impersonate TYP.

202
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,320
Neither of us can.

203
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,760
Impersonate the first TYP.

204
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,360
What makes you say it's the two of us?

205
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,960
Why must these two impersonators of TYP

206
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,280
have to be TYP's...

207
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,560
Fine.

208
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,680
His concept is always that

209
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,760
it's impersonated by an anonymous netizen.

210
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,920
Again with the dual killers.

211
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,960
And there's another netizen.

212
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,600
You also have an X.

213
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,120
It's possible you each impersonated once.

214
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,880
Why is that impossible?

215
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
You and her had the strongest motive for murder.

216
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,400
As the killer, playing it this way was the right move.

217
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,680
Yes, that's right.

218
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,360
I am the killer.

219
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,240
No matter what, I'm voting for you.

220
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm convinced it's you.

221
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,760
Let's go.

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Goodbye everyone.

223
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Farewell.

224
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,440
I just want to see the final result.

225
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm speechless.

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,760
I refuse to believe this.

227
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Getting worked up.

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,720
The suspect identification in this case has failed

229
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,320
Who is it

230
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,200
The killer of Zi Daole is Ke Daole

231
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,920
The killer of TYP is Ning Hao

232
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,720
It's really him.

233
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
How do we fight each other?

234
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,720
Why do you have a different role every round?

235
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,760
No one actually voted for me.

236
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,360
I took all the blame for you.

237
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,960
Yes.

238
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,960
Look how fiercely you two are fighting.

239
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
What's going on?

240
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,600
This victory feels so satisfying, bro.

241
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
I can't take it anymore.

242
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,800
This is unbearable.

243
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Rome wasn't built in a day.

244
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,760
Former classmates turned into enemies.

245
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,440
Behind this premeditated scheme,

246
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,480
what hidden story lies beneath?

247
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,720
How did the two culprits plan their crime?

248
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
I am Ke Daole

249
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,960
May 30th

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,680
I discovered Zi Daole plans to expose me

251
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,760
and ruin my reputation

252
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,320
Don’t entertain thoughts you shouldn’t

253
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,880
Be careful, or the overnight fame will turn into infamy

254
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,200
On the anniversary of the school’s founding

255
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
May 31st

256
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,880
Boss TYP threatened me again in an email

257
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,480
To protect my reputation and interests

258
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,880
I must kill these two people

259
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Both of them will come to attend on June 3rd

260
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,480
the school anniversary celebration

261
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,520
There will be many people that day

262
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,160
making it easy to hide in the crowd

263
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
So I planned to act on June 3rd

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,680
But I needed a method to both kill and escape

265
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,080
Therefore

266
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,800
I went to the amateur killer section of Tweaker Empire website

267
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
and posted an anonymous thread

268
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,600
offering a large reward for murder methods

269
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
Unexpectedly, the post received many anonymous replies

270
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,960
Someone contacted me through the post

271
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,520
That person claimed to have a murder method

272
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,800
but the condition was that I help them escape

273
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,680
After we gained each other's trust

274
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,960
we met at the convenience store

275
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
I just found out he was my classmate Ning Hao

276
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
He wanted to kill TYP

277
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,080
I am Ning Hao

278
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,000
May 3rd

279
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,160
TYP Company held a masquerade ball at Tuizhen Art Academy

280
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,720
My best friend

281
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,160
Went there wearing the evening suit mask I gave him

282
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,680
For some unknown reason

283
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,640
He got into an argument with TYP

284
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,400
Then was pushed to the ground by TYP

285
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,960
Hit the back of his head

286
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
He clearly died instantly

287
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,920
I will kill TYP

288
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,520
To avenge my brother

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
May 31st

290
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I saw TYP post a QQ status

291
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,600
Showing photos of his anniversary celebration outfit

292
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,480
A red suit and top hat

293
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,480
He then notified me, Canary and Bai Yangzuo in the group chat

294
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,800
That we'd be filming material for campus TV

295
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,480
Between 12:00-12:30 during the anniversary celebration

296
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,560
That's when I thought of a perfect murder plan

297
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,880
Our school's art building surveillance

298
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,760
Only activates at 12:30

299
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Before that time

300
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,400
I could lure TYP to the art building

301
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
And poison him without leaving evidence

302
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,920
Then find someone to

303
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,000
During my joint filming session with Bai Jin

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,720
Pretend to be TYP walking past the camera

305
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,760
This would obscure TYP's actual time of death

306
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
While giving me an alibi

307
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,640
So I logged into the "Little Killer" forum

308
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,160
To hire a partner with generous payment

309
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,560
While browsing

310
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,760
I saw a post offering big money for methods

311
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,760
The poster wanted to commit murder

312
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,120
At school on the same day

313
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,120
He'd make a perfect accomplice

314
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,720
Because he also had motives

315
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,680
So we could keep each other in check

316
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,920
With no risk of betrayal

317
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,640
So I contacted him

318
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,840
My condition was providing the method

319
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,320
While he'd help me escape suspicion

320
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,080
After meeting at the school store

321
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,320
I learned he was Ke Daole

322
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,680
He planned to kill both Zi Daole and TYP

323
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,760
We immediately devised a complete plan

324
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,720
Ning Hao first activated the surveillance at the art building before killing TYP.

325
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,280
Then I disguised myself as TYP to appear.

326
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
To help confuse the time of death.

327
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,920
Afterwards, I disguised myself as TYP again to kill Zi Daole.

328
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,120
Then we used Ruisi Bai to notify us.

329
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,760
To move props and arrange blind spots in the art building's surveillance.

330
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,920
Completing our escape and the transfer of the bodies.

331
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Finally, I suggested.

332
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,520
We could disguise both deaths as campus urban legends.

333
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,840
We immediately agreed on this.

334
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,560
Right away, we purchased online.

335
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,880
TYP's identical suit and top hat.

336
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,120
June 3rd, the school anniversary day.

337
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,120
Welcome everyone to.

338
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Tui Zhen Art Academy's annual anniversary celebration.

339
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,840
Free activities begin at 11:00.

340
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,760
Let's go.

341
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,960
I went to the prop room.

342
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,080
Changed into the silver-gray shirt I prepared in advance.

343
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,360
This way when poisoning TYP.

344
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,520
My clothes wouldn't retain any odor.

345
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,720
At 11:20 I went to TYP's camping area.

346
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,200
I slipped him a note.

347
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,360
Asking to meet at the piano room at 11:30.

348
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,960
He arrived at the piano room promptly at 11:30.

349
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,440
Wearing a gas mask, I circled behind him.

350
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,240
Catching him off guard.

351
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,160
I took out the poisoned perfume I prepared.

352
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,080
And sprayed the entire bottle on him.

353
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
He immediately died from poisoning.

354
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,040
TYP is dead.

355
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,880
Brother, your revenge is complete.

356
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,240
I dragged his body behind a screen to hide it.

357
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,080
And placed behind the piano.

358
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,640
An alarm set to play piano music at 18:20.

359
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,560
At this time the piano room was empty.

360
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
This could be staged as the campus legend.

361
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,080
"Don't casually enter an empty piano room".

362
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,240
"Beware the deadly piano music that plays there".

363
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,280
After completing all preparations,

364
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,760
I went to TYP's camping area

365
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,440
to retrieve the note that invited him.

366
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,680
Then used his computer's QQ to contact Zidaole.

367
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,880
Asked to meet at the props warehouse at 13:10.

368
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,080
Zidaole agreed.

369
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,640
Afterwards,

370
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,960
I removed my silver-gray shirt that had absorbed odors,

371
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
and changed back into my morning clothes.

372
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Then I discarded the silver-gray shirt, poison, and gas mask,

373
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,080
along with the note for TYP,

374
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,640
into an iron barrel by Wukenai River.

375
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,160
At 11:50,

376
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,080
I wore TYP's formal suit and hat to the small auditorium.

377
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
I replaced the scheduled presentation materials

378
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
with my pre-prepared horror footage.

379
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
Deleted the original materials Ruisibai intended to show.

380
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,040
So when everyone gathered for rehearsal at 16:00,

381
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,240
"Hello everyone,

382
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,000
Director Ruisibai

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,640
had some urgent matters and can't attend.

384
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,240
So I'll be leading this afternoon's rehearsal."

385
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,080
"Let me play the background music."

386
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,200
This would trigger my prepared horror footage.

387
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,480
Help me! Help me!

388
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,960
In the cabinet.

389
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,640
Inside the cabinet.

390
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,720
Lead everyone to discover Zidaole's body in the cabinet.

391
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Zidaole.

392
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,960
Make everyone think it's the work of campus legends.

393
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,600
Between 12:00 and 12:30,

394
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,760
I wore the same dress and hat as TYP,

395
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,640
when Ninghao was filming for campus TV,

396
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,280
walking from the small auditorium of the arts building to the backyard,

397
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,640
purposely leaving my back in his shot.

398
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,600
To confuse TYP's time of death.

399
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,760
And give Ninghao an alibi.

400
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,040
Then at 1:20 PM,

401
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,800
I continued pretending to be TYP,

402
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,440
purposely entering the arts building through Gate 4,

403
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,920
and went into the prop storage room.

404
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,160
By then, Zidaole was already waiting in the prop storage room.

405
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,840
I quickly used the awl I prepared in advance

406
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,640
to stab Zidaole's left neck and kill her.

407
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Then I hid her in the prop cabinet for "Pushing Goose Lake."

408
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
I pulled out the wooden awl,

409
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,520
letting Zidaole bleed all over inside the cabinet.

410
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,240
To fake the legend: "Don't open cabinets carelessly,"

411
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,320
"Beware of blood-covered people inside cabinets."

412
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,320
Some blood accidentally splashed on me,

413
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,920
but it was fine.

414
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,800
I was wearing TYP's dress for disguise,

415
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,400
and I hid in another prop cabinet,

416
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,840
waiting for Ninghao to move me out.

417
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,480
At 2:00 PM sharp, I returned to the arts building,

418
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
following Ruisibai's instructions,

419
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
to move cabinets from the prop storage room.

420
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,320
Ke, wearing TYP's clothes,

421
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,240
hid in the prop cabinet I was moving.

422
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,440
I pushed the cabinet out,

423
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
and when we reached a blind spot,

424
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,040
Kedaole came out of the cabinet

425
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,680
and left the arts building.

426
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,040
I continued pushing the cabinet to the small auditorium,

427
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,920
and handed it to student Xiao Hou inside.

428
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,640
Then I left through Gate 2.

429
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
I changed back into my own clothes,

430
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,400
and threw the awl and TYP's disguise clothes

431
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,440
into an iron barrel by Wukenai River.

432
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,120
By then,

433
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,880
the barrel already had the gray shirt Ninghao threw in,

434
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,200
a gas mask, a poisoned perfume bottle,

435
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,720
and the note to meet TYP.

436
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,440
We burned everything in the barrel together.

437
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,280
At 15:30, I entered through Gate 2.

438
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,640
Walked into the props storage room.

439
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,400
Pushed out the prop cabinet containing Zidaole's corpse.

440
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
At 15:35, I wheeled the cabinet to the small auditorium.

441
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
The clever boy Xiao Hou even asked me,

442
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
"Why is this cabinet so heavy?"

443
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
I brushed it off by saying it's the normal weight for performance props.

444
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,400
And got away with it.

445
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,400
At 15:40, I left the small auditorium.

446
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,720
And exited through Gate 2 of the Arts Building.

447
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
Both TYP and Zidaole are dead.

448
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
No one can threaten me now.

449
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,640
At 16:00, I acted like nothing happened.

450
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,960
Returned punctually to the auditorium for rehearsal.

451
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Thank you all for watching.

452
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,840
This episode of "Let's Deduce! X".

453
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,920
To find out what happens next,

454
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,720
Stay tuned for Shaoyang's continued explanation next time.
