1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,160
Go

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,200
Aren't we going?

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,720
Go where?

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
No, I meant those two.

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,240
Go

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,200
Right

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,640
Go

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,720
What's this?

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,760
Wow, this...

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,600
Wow, what is this?

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,800
Wow, that's really thoughtful.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,400
There should be different soup bases available

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,720
See which one each of you wants to eat

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,560
Choose a soup base

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,080
Yes, that one is tomato, and this is the spicy pot

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,120
And there’s also the three-delicacies one

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,120
I'll have the spicy pot.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
He can switch to the spicy one.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,960
Do you want spicy or regular?

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,920
What do I have here?

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
This is just the clear broth.

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,480
I'll stick with this then.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
Everyone take your seats.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,200
Time flies when we're having fun.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,520
Should we make speeches?

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
Or just start eating without talking?

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,520
No, he'll cue you later.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,080
Like this.

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,160
Celebrating the successful conclusion

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,760
of "Let's Start Reasoning" Season 2.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,360
Cheers!

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,080
Great, let's eat and chat.

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,040
Sounds good.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
Let's toast with tea then.

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,520
Wait, do we even have tea?

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,240
Nothing at all, sorry.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,320
We have beer and mineral water.

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,560
You mean wheat beer?

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,240
The cold ones are refreshing.

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
Wheat beer or water?

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,440
I'll have water.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,040
There's cola too.

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,320
Cola works for me.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,880
Okay.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,040
Sugar-free.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,520
Do you have it?

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Yes, we all have it.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,200
It's under our feet.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,120
Come on, let's toast first.

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,680
Okay.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
Take a sip.

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,960
Happy wrap-up!

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
A group of introverts

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,800
A group of introverts

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,880
After saying "Happy wrap-up," no one spoke another word

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,640
No, we'll find something to talk about

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,600
Quickly started unpacking their things separately

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,680
A group of introverts

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
So we went from being strangers

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,040
to becoming friends with three months of shared experiences

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,640
First, I feel time passed exceptionally quickly

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,280
Time flew by

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,480
I was just marveling

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
at how it could pass so quickly

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,640
Suddenly the recording was over

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,120
There's this feeling of reluctance

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Of course

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
During our case-solving process each time

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
Right, we'd lose track of time

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,560
Forget about time

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,800
Whether it was the entire puzzle-solving process

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
or when we were brainstorming

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,440
during our discussions

75
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,800
time just seemed to fly by

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,360
Exactly

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,400
That's why there's this reluctance

78
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,640
Reluctant, right?

79
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,760
I feel we should have had a bit more time

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,840
We should have recorded a little longer

81
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Moreover

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,080
we were able to bond and have fun together quickly

83
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,680
With people we'd never worked with before

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,640
there would normally be tension and an adjustment period

85
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,040
Mhm

86
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,960
But filming this variety show

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,520
had absolutely no such period

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,440
Right from the first day

89
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,240
we could freely play around

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,560
and have fun together

91
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
You could really feel

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,480
our strong camaraderie

94
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
or our reluctance about the show ending

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Because we

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,720
would even sing group songs late at night

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Yes

98
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,560
We'd listen to those songs

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,160
It was magical

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,320
Right

101
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
Kind of left us speechless

102
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Come on players

103
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,880
Let's start deducing

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,160
Unlock level after level

105
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,200
With courage as our trigger

106
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,360
Let's each share our thoughts separately.

107
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
Dudu just shared her thoughts.

108
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,320
What about Bai Yu?

109
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,440
It's been quite relaxed.

110
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,720
Because during the first season,

111
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,840
I had other commitments.

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,640
So my overall state was

113
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,720
I was filming on set at the time.

114
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
Yes, I had other work.

115
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
But this season,

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,720
I feel I've improved a bit compared to last season.

117
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,200
I've made progress since last season.

118
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,080
Definitely.

119
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,880
Absolutely.

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,600
At least I'm a bit more diligent than last season.

121
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
Even if just by one percent.

122
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,520
What about Keqin?

123
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,400
How is Keqin doing?

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm very happy.

125
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,760
My biggest takeaway from recording is...

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,200
I feel like everyone is becoming...

127
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,640
closer and closer.

128
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Especially when we're off-camera...

129
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,920
after having meals together.

130
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,240
This actually makes recording the show more enjoyable.

131
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,800
Right.

132
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,880
I can tell that every day when you come in...

133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,000
you seem really excited.

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,360
Yeah.

135
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,160
It feels like you're really enjoying the process.

136
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,560
Even during the games...

137
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,400
What about you?

138
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,320
Me?

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,240
Coming to this mystery-solving show...

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
For me, it's...

141
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
a way to relax.

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,560
And to play games...

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,640
with many good friends.

144
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,960
That moment when...

145
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,320
a puzzle gets solved is pure joy.

146
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Like today...

147
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
when we blocked the door...

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
and you all went searching for keys...

149
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,440
That teamwork, that group spirit...

150
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,400
is what makes me particularly happy.

151
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,720
At the very beginning,

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,040
the production team gave us a hint:

153
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,120
"Half believing, half doubting."

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,840
Yeah, "half believing, half doubting."

155
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
Right, but unexpectedly as it went on,

156
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,480
everyone came to trust each other deeply.

157
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
Yes, in fact we...

158
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
Yes, we ended up trusting everyone even more.

159
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,720
Right, killer?

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,000
Heh.

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,720
Jiawei,

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
yes, we trusted him so much.

163
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,440
Exactly.

164
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,720
Now we genuinely trust Jiawei completely.

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,600
See, today I didn't suspect you at all.

166
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,960
I heard you rarely participated in variety shows before, right?

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,600
I seldom joined variety shows.

168
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
This is my first time participating...

169
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,520
in such a long-running variety show.

170
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,280
And my first time in a deduction-based variety show.

171
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,880
Right?

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,840
It's made me experience this... treachery, you see.

173
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,160
I've sensed treachery from you!

174
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,320
How am I treacherous?

175
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,520
You've left us all speechless, don't you think?

176
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,160
No, I think it's like this...

177
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,600
About you joining this show, let me put it this way:

178
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,480
When you first arrived,

179
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
I thought this guy seemed super genuine.

180
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,240
I really wanted to become good friends with you.

181
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,800
You finished my second half...

182
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,320
But later I thought we had the chance...

183
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
to become partners in crime.

184
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,040
Yes, this is exactly the feeling.

185
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,400
It's just that you grew too fast later.

186
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,520
Became extremely cunning.

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,640
Today I even said something so embarrassing.

188
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,560
Are you talking about me?

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,680
Are you referring to me?

190
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,800
And then I also said,

191
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
"Do you think he would kill someone?"

192
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,240
I wanted to vote for him, but suddenly I...

193
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,160
Why?

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,920
Look at him.

195
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,560
Why though?

196
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,920
Do you still want to vote for him?

197
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,280
You see, this kind of trust just...

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,320
...developed between us without us even noticing.

199
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
You should share this with everyone.

200
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,720
Do you think that recording this show...

201
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,520
...was the turning point of your enlightenment?

202
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,400
The turning point of enlightenment.

203
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,440
Actually, it was when you were tricked by two girls.

204
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,880
It was the black and white swan episode, right?

205
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,320
Yes, that's when I started realizing...

206
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
...this is how you play the game.

207
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,880
Black and white swans, everyone

208
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,880
What are you doing?

209
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
What are you all doing?

210
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
She's very smart

211
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,840
Follow me and I'll step on you

212
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,040
Then protect you

213
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Make him firmly believe he needs to deal with you

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,960
I think that day wasn't just a turning point for me

215
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,440
But also for our Brother Bai

216
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,640
Right?

217
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,080
The beginning of Brother Bai's Waterloo

218
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,840
Yes, the beginning of his Waterloo

219
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,440
Okay

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,480
In earlier episodes, Brother Bai could predict everything perfectly

221
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,440
Basically identified the culprit at first glance

222
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,200
Even before recording started

223
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,360
He already knew who it was

224
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,040
It's still Wang's legend that's questionable

225
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,880
Damn it, let me tell you Xiao X

226
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,280
Then you could be X too

227
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,840
Damn it, you always have to have your way

228
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
After Jin Jing arrived

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
She cut off his signal

230
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,040
Pulled out the antenna

231
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,960
Yanked out the antenna

232
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
Today Bai Yang has met his match

233
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,840
Why are you hiding?

234
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,720
Is this some secret signal between you and X?

235
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
Looks even more sinister now

236
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I think only a wolf would admit being a wolf

237
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,560
Then I'll stop pretending

238
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
So exaggerated

239
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,880
I really think you're a bit...

240
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,920
And you're not even hostile toward me today

241
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,560
How about it, Brother Bai?

242
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,520
How have you been feeling these past two episodes?

243
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,160
Really great

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,120
Did my arrival make you unhappy?

245
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm so happy

246
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,560
You're really my nemesis, Brother Bai

247
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,760
Before coming on this show

248
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,320
And how you feel now today

249
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
It really requires

250
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,720
A lot of brainpower and

251
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,000
Definitely not something I could

252
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,760
Handle well in this game

253
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,360
Right

254
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,880
After coming, I realized you overthought it

255
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
No, actually

256
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,600
After I came, I discovered

257
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,560
Since I've never played this type of game

258
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm not very familiar with it

259
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,320
I've done escape rooms but not many

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
So I thought to myself

261
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
I might not be good at thinking

262
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,640
It's not that I dislike it

263
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
It's that my brain just doesn't work

264
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,000
So I felt that

265
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Well...

266
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
I might make

267
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,120
Everyone think I'm a burden

268
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,240
Indeed, in this kind of game

269
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
If someone keeps being

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,400
Out of the loop

271
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,240
People would think they're always holding others back

272
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
They've never looked down on me

273
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,560
Of course

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Never looked down on me

275
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,840
Never expected that after coming

276
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,040
To find everyone's pretty confused

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,800
I feel that recording this variety show

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,360
from the very first day I could

279
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,720
freely play and have fun with everyone

280
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,480
Beam of light turns dark overnight

281
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,040
Read it backwards

282
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,280
A beam of light in the dark night

283
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,160
You can go now, Brother Bai.

284
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,480
What are you doing?

285
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Black fertilizer squats.

286
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,680
After black fertilizer squats, flower fertilizer squats.

287
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,240
This belongs exclusively to Young Master Ke.

288
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,360
Exclusive for top-ranked Young Master Ke.

289
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,040
Yes, that's why it feels so relaxing.

290
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,160
And I also realized

291
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,240
that my brain can actually work.

292
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,360
Right, so I felt really happy

293
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,080
to discover I had this ability.

294
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,000
I believe the audience can see

295
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,720
because many of your ideas

296
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,000
including those creative case theories,

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
were initiated by you.

298
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,880
At first when you said many things,

299
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
I'd wonder if it could really be true.

300
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,880
Isn't this too far-fetched?

301
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,800
But the answer was indeed that absurd.

302
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,200
You didn't expect it to be that ridiculous, did you?

303
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,360
Yes, the answer was that outrageous.

304
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,240
So the killer was actually a birdman?

305
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,640
Exactly.

306
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,280
He appeared right behind you.

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,920
So you think I'm a birdman?

308
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
That's a very novel idea.

309
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
Her intuition is terrifyingly accurate, I'm telling you.

310
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,800
Right, so you're still...

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,840
You're more...

312
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,400
the one with more unconventional thinking.

313
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Exactly.

314
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,280
What about Linghe?

315
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,200
Before you first came on this show...

316
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,840
and how you feel today...

317
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,000
When I first joined this show...

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,560
I was very confident.

319
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Very confident.

320
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,400
I thought I was really good at solving cases.

321
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,080
But after joining, I realized I was being naive.

322
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,920
Naive, right?

323
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,520
Overconfident.

324
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,040
There are some veteran members...

325
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
who don't play by logical rules.

326
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,400
They break conventional patterns.

327
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Which keeps breaking my composure more each time.

328
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,440
You can't even confirm...

329
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
whether his later parents...

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
were actually his parents.

331
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,520
How do you prove...

332
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,440
that your parents are your parents?

333
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,920
Why are you all so hostile toward me?

334
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,320
This is my necklace.

335
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
Right.

336
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
Pervert.

337
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,760
What are you doing?

338
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,880
You pervert.

339
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,080
What do you want?

340
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,240
You disgusting pervert.

341
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,520
I was right to hit you with that stick.

342
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,760
Talk.

343
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Exactly.

344
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,720
No

345
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
This isn't mine

346
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,440
Little killer, you tell me

347
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,560
Explain in detail

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,120
Now it's not just our family

349
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,720
There's only him left

350
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,840
You're X

351
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
Then later when everyone got familiar

352
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,840
After understanding some patterns

353
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,800
Actually everyone paid more attention

354
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
To having fun during the process

355
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,040
Right

356
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,720
Next season just you wait

357
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,840
Just you wait

358
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,400
Watch how I'll destroy you all

359
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,960
What nonsense are you spouting?

360
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,680
Seriously

361
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,520
Don't let any of them escape

362
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,320
Fine, whatever

363
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,600
We'll wait for your comeback next season, okay?

364
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,360
At the beginning it was true

365
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,520
Because Bai Yu had some control

366
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,720
Then you brought in reinforcements named Jin Jing

367
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,200
Surprise

368
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,560
And then controlled him too

369
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,600
She was really the turning point

370
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,200
You're so fickle, canary

371
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,680
I'm so beautiful

372
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,160
Wouldn't it be a waste not to be fickle?

373
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,520
This is ridiculous

374
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,200
You can't vote against us two

375
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
If you're not the killer

376
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,680
Voting against us means helping the killer

377
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,480
But you must be the killer

378
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:27,840
Two out of four

379
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,360
You can't vote

380
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
You can't vote against us

381
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,760
There's no way you can vote against us

382
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,840
You can't vote against us

383
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,800
Why can't I vote against you?

384
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
My hand is my own

385
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I can't vote against you

386
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,120
You're messing with me

387
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,120
What's there to argue about?

388
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,320
What's there to translate?

389
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,680
Tell me, what's there to translate?

390
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Tell me, what's worth translating?

391
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,560
Where?

392
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,640
Bai Sect

393
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,360
You're being very passive today.

394
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,440
How do you expect me to be active?

395
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,800
You tell me.

396
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,080
You're being very active today.

397
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,800
You're being extremely active today.

398
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,520
I wish you'd be a little less active, okay?

399
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,160
I'm speechless.

400
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
We have four periods in total, right?

401
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,120
Right.

402
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,280
Do you have any favorite profound stories?

403
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,200
The one we recorded.

404
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,040
You must like this one, right?

405
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,080
This cyberpunk one.

406
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,720
Actually, no.

407
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,560
It really isn't, huh?

408
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,280
Push and pull.

409
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,560
Yes, that's exactly what I meant.

410
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,960
The key point is people from our two worlds.

411
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,720
all know each other.

412
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,480
Those two.

413
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,760
Why don't those two know each other?

414
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
That's the crucial point.

415
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Light up this lamp.

416
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
And this series of events.

417
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,640
was 8 years ago.

418
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,760
Then when I light this lamp.

419
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
But mine was last Sunday.

420
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,080
February 3rd.

421
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,440
Or the 7th?

422
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,960
Our timelines are completely messed up.

423
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,560
All wrong.

424
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,960
So our two timelines.

425
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,560
are actually overlapping.

426
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,640
Spatial black hole.

427
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,200
Right, then there's more than two worlds.

428
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,840
Do you understand?

429
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,160
Now it's.

430
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,840
Shifting space.

431
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,040
We can go to the warehouse.

432
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,720
Quick.

433
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,920
Success

434
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,840
Welcome to Tui Town

435
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,120
It wasn't until we recorded that episode

436
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,360
that I realized this season is completely

437
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,400
different from last season

438
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,920
Completely different

439
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,200
The concept is different

440
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,080
Because Sis Ba mentioned once

441
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,880
about foreseeing the future

442
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,360
Right, the possibility of him foreseeing the future

443
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,520
What did I say then?

444
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,720
How could anyone foresee the future?

445
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,560
Right, we've never had this kind of

446
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,320
If he previously

447
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
If he wrote it beforehand

448
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
How would he know how we'd be grouped in the afternoon?

449
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,040
So it's still within a game, right?

450
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,880
We've been playing this game repeatedly

451
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,000
And this birdman created this

452
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
looping game

453
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,680
He created this infinite loop

454
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,400
Because he needed to save all of us

455
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,040
before we all died

456
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,280
But then it turned out that person

457
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,080
knew what would happen today

458
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
Then he sprinkled powder on me

459
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,880
or something like that

460
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,760
Which character do you like most?

461
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Probably Ke Shaoshuai

462
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm most impressed by this character

463
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,280
Because it's the first character we encountered this season

464
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,040
Hello everyone, I'm a VIP client of Young Master 101

465
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,320
Also known as the most refined gentleman in Tui Town

466
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,120
Ke Shaoshuai

467
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
The refined gentleman, Ke Shaoshuai

468
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
The door was locked when he died

469
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
So it's a locked-room murder?

470
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,240
The door to a new world was opened that year

471
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,920
I understand now

472
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,640
Tui Le Men opened in 1910

473
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,600
It operated at a loss for 12 consecutive months

474
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,480
Until January 1911

475
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,920
When Tui Le Men began turning a profit

476
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,520
That was 1911

477
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,040
Eleven, right?

478
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,760
Eleven

479
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,240
Exactly

480
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,000
What about you?

481
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,880
I think it might be

482
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
The story I like

483
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,560
Probably the first one

484
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,320
He said to go to the second floor to find him if anything comes up.

485
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,280
The door is locked.

486
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,040
Is it Lord Le?

487
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,360
Lord Le

488
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,240
Lord Le's clothes

489
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,160
Hanged himself

490
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,520
"Bali's Scissors"

491
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,640
I think that includes all the brainstorming

492
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,720
The routes and everything else

493
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,640
Including the mechanisms

494
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,240
And the murder methods too

495
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,120
I believe they're all

496
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,480
the types I'm good at and enjoy

497
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,960
Everything follows a logical pattern

498
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,320
When we entered the room

499
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,280
we broke through the door

500
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,800
The killer used a secret passage

501
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,880
to enter this room

502
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,720
After performing those series of techniques

503
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
and killing the victim

504
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,200
escaped through the secret passage again

505
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,160
This suggests there were no footprints, right?

506
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,480
The killer walked through here after committing the murder.

507
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
Should we go up and check?

508
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,400
Things like the railings.

509
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,760
Look.

510
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,040
See if there are any scratches up here.

511
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,080
This is...

512
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,920
So it's possible...

513
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,840
He used this to descend.

514
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,080
Possibly.

515
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,720
We've reconstructed the killer's path.

516
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
He must have exited here.

517
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,040
Then doubled back.

518
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,520
So we might need to check outside.

519
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,000
See what's on this street.

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,280
Could it be...

521
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,840
Yes.

522
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,320
If we're talking about roles...

523
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,680
I prefer the student-era one.

524
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,160
Me too.

525
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,640
Acting is my passion.

526
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Being an award-winning actor is my honor.

527
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,800
My name is Ning Hao.

528
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,920
My name is Ning Hao.

529
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,240
From a distinguished family.

530
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,360
Dangerously charming.

531
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm Hedinghong, a sophomore.

532
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
But I've played your brother.

533
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,640
Have you forgotten?

534
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,400
I've been your brother.

535
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,880
Been your brother.

536
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,040
Been your father.

537
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,520
He's played my father too.

538
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,840
Because in the coming days...

539
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,160
Whether acting or doing other things...

540
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,520
I likely won't play students anymore.

541
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,200
So this was my chance...

542
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,120
To experience a student role.

543
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,960
The whole story is quite interesting too.

544
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,040
It's been quite enjoyable.

545
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,520
Dilraba

546
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,640
As for me, I love my shining moments.

547
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,960
Expose Ke Mu San.

548
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,080
That ominous feeling in an instant, right?

549
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,040
Exactly.

551
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,160
But why can't it be you?

552
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,800
You can suspect him.

553
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,120
Wait, why can't it be you, Ke Mu San?

554
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,120
It could be me

555
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,560
But in this world today

556
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,680
There's no Boss Wang

557
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,240
No Ke Musan

558
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Only you two exist

559
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,720
Why is Ke Musan missing?

560
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,880
Ke Musan exists in this world

561
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,040
Where?

562
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,880
We saw evidence today

563
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,040
that he was here

564
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,160
Because your counterpart in this world

565
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
participated in

566
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
"Produce Camp" then disappeared

567
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,120
Unknown

568
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,840
Not dead

569
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
But you vanished

570
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
So now you are Ke Musan

571
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,080
You're representing people of this era

572
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,480
sitting here talking with us

573
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,800
Possibly

574
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,120
X, how did you get chosen twice?

575
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,200
That was my show's brightest moment

576
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,280
That was absolutely brilliant

577
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,760
It completely stunned us at first sight

578
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,000
That moment still shakes me to this day

579
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,960
Every time I think she won't surprise us

580
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,640
she always manages to shock

581
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,360
Right

582
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,000
Speaking of characters

583
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,360
I think it would be

584
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,040
the one from our school days

585
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,720
Hello everyone, I'm

586
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,040
a sophomore at Tuizhen Arts College

587
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,960
In music circles

588
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm known by another name:

589
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,080
The Soul Sniper

590
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
The bullying during school years

591
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,320
I think this kind of thing

592
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,600
is actually quite close to our daily lives.

593
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:15,920
Yes.

594
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,520
Because Xiao Rou was

595
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
back then, bullied by the whole class

596
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,440
called ugly names like "dinosaur girl"

597
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,400
with malicious rumors spread about her.

598
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
When everyone ignores you,

599
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,000
this invisible, silent bullying

600
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
is like an invisible hand

601
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
that nearly suffocated me.

602
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,560
I have to go now, goodbye.

603
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,600
Our school's tradition was

604
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,880
to ignore whoever ranked last.

605
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,720
School bullying.

606
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,320
Right.

607
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,920
Yes, so these things that leave

608
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,400
psychological scars

609
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,480
left a particularly deep impression on me.

610
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,960
I made her invisible.

611
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,960
What about Brother Bai?

612
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,520
Brother Bai?

613
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,200
Which story left a strong

614
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
impression on you?

615
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
Like the town incident?

616
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,200
That shocked you deeply?

617
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,360
No, I just really liked it.

618
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,240
Was it something more sophisticated

619
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,360
Yes, the format itself was quite elegant.

620
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
So did we win that round?

621
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,800
We lost.

622
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,960
We lost.

623
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,160
Right.

624
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,200
When I voted for him, no one seconded.

625
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,640
Exactly.

626
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,280
The real culprit is

627
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,360
Bai Mai.

628
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Everyone lost.

629
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,360
Impressive, truly impressive.

630
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,520
So your intuition was absolutely right

631
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,080
Why didn't you vote for him?

632
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,320
Yes, I didn't vote

633
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,520
Role

634
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,360
Just the overachiever

635
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,520
Wasted purchase?

636
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,600
Right, no need to overcompete like that

637
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,120
I think focusing on the present would be better

638
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,800
To be honest

639
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,120
I feel like nowadays

640
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
many people are unhappy

641
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,520
and joyless

642
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,800
Many troubles stem from this rat race

643
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
To truly find happiness

644
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
and fulfillment

645
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
we need to find ways to escape this competition

646
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,080
and live as our true selves

647
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,920
Wang the Overachiever has a great idea

648
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
He suggests that when you're not busy

649
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,880
you should look up

650
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,480
at the stars

651
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,760
Right

652
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,160
Experience these

653
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,000
natural elements around us

654
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,760
It might make you feel happier

655
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,160
Nature is very healing for people

656
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,560
Yes

657
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,400
Extremely healing

658
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,960
So don't get too caught up in this rat race

659
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,040
Try our best to

660
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,960
We young people

661
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,680
What about Zhang Linghe?

662
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
The favorite story is actually

663
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,960
the one from our school days

664
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,200
Hedinghong

665
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,280
As Reba just mentioned, it was about bullying

666
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,160
For me, it might resonate

667
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,040
more strongly

668
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,400
And why do I like that particular story?

669
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Because of that segment

670
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
I think it was the most thrilling one

671
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,720
Remember there was a spinning wheel?

672
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,240
The one with individual missions

673
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,360
Haunted house

674
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,240
Going to the bathroom and such

675
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,560
All that key searching

676
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,720
What? I can't see anything

677
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,160
Where is this?

678
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,920
So dark

679
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,760
It's okay

680
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,040
Don't run

681
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,880
Stop running

682
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,440
Don't run

683
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,520
What is that?

684
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,960
Stop running

685
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,560
Who's this?

686
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,720
I think it's pretty cool

687
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,240
It's quite interesting

688
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,080
We should do this more often

689
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,520
The scarier the better, right?

690
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,920
Okay

691
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,280
Even though I'm scared, but...

692
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,080
Do it more

693
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,760
No need to do it more

694
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,520
What character do you like?

695
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,120
I like playing X

696
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,640
X is my love

697
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,560
You like playing X?

698
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,520
Because I only did it once

699
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,840
Because her X was so successful that time

700
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,560
That time she...

701
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,120
Only you weren't cursed

702
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,920
You're the sober one

703
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,440
What time did you see...

704
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,960
The letter from your ex-girlfriend

705
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,600
At your door

706
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,240
Last night at 10pm

707
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,320
Just now, if it's directly related to her...

708
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,760
If it's directly connected to her...

709
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,600
Then it's only him

710
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,520
That night...

711
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,280
We went to see Ruisi

712
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,200
Or cursed at Ruisi

713
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
None of us were sober

714
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,320
Only he was sober

715
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,000
Right

716
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,920
And his motive...

717
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,000
Would be stronger than yours

718
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
Let the real culprit of this case...

719
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,400
Step forward to X

720
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
Brother

721
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
Just like your first shining moment

722
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
Instantly exposed that...

723
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,440
Ke Lidu

724
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,520
Just like Ke Musan

725
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,120
It gives you that instant glorious feeling

726
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,840
So satisfying

727
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,760
That feeling of winning

728
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,920
Back then you two girls

729
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,680
Beat us four grown men

730
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,080
That moment was so joyful

731
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,840
Let me tell you, I'm the opposite

732
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,760
Why? Too much pressure?

733
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,640
Every time I deduce, I'm X

734
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,320
Right, imagine - I was X four times

735
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,920
He kept being it earlier

736
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,800
We had nine cases total

737
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I was X in four of them

738
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,320
Exactly

739
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
My accomplice was...

740
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,240
Please have Young Master Ke walk towards

741
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,480
the real X

742
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,920
It must be him

743
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,200
I told you

744
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,040
Being it twice is still okay

745
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,160
X is

746
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,360
Captain Ning

747
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Sorry about this

748
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,760
This time it's me again being

749
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,480
X

750
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,400
I've been X for three consecutive rounds

751
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,440
Well, sorry about that

752
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,040
I'm the X in this episode

753
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,080
You're the real deal

754
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,000
You've played every role

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,920
Right?

756
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,760
Right

757
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,320
And I've been the killer twice

758
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,840
What about you, Ke Yu?

759
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,720
Me? I like

760
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
being the killer

761
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,040
No, I dislike being the killer most

762
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,640
Why?

763
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,080
Because Brother Bai mentally pressures me

764
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,440
No

765
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,680
I just feel too much pressure

766
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,640
being the killer

767
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,240
Because the day before

768
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,800
you have to maintain that mindset

769
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,560
to play the next day's scenario

770
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,960
Yes

771
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
I think what I like most is

772
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,720
being a good

773
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,680
suspect

774
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,920
Just a suspect

775
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,120
A good one among suspects

776
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,200
Got it, one of the suspects

777
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,240
Basically just a civilian

778
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Yes, civilian

779
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,400
So civilian then

780
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,240
But I've never played as X

781
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,720
So I don't know what X is

782
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,600
He's never been one

783
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Nor has he experienced it

784
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,840
No

785
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,280
You've never been X

786
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
I was his X

787
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,440
He was my X

788
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,760
Does X exist in this episode?

789
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,240
X exists in this case

790
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,400
I have to say

791
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,360
We have some默契, don't we?

792
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,080
So awesome

793
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,560
We really have some默契

794
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,960
Yes? Or no?

795
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,720
No

796
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,560
Not even once

797
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,480
What about you?

798
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,880
As long as I'm not X

799
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,840
Being the killer or suspect is fine

800
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,680
The killer role is more thrilling

801
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,320
The suspect role is more carefree

802
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,160
Just dragging others down everywhere

803
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,360
Stepping on whoever you see

804
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,680
No matter what

805
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,080
You can play recklessly

806
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,640
More relaxed

807
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,400
But if you're the detective

808
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,960
You have to guide things

809
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,560
I don't like guiding much

810
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,440
But I enjoy teaming up

811
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,720
To commit crimes together

812
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,440
Messing around

813
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
I want to be an accomplice

814
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,880
What about Old Bai?

815
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,960
Chaos role

816
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,400
What's a chaos role?

817
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,880
It's the suspect

818
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,320
Why?

819
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,720
No restraints

820
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,160
Why? You tell me why

821
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,160
He can act without restraint

822
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,360
Launch his magical attacks

823
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,440
Do whatever he wants

824
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,560
Absolute freedom

825
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
She's definitely not a twin.

826
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,760
She's my biological sister.

827
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,120
I can prove her existence.

828
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,400
Nothing can be said for certain.

829
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
Mr. X.

830
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
Watch your tone, Mr. X.

831
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,520
Right.

832
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,720
These two are my childhood playmates.

833
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,680
I'll protect her.

834
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,280
Yes, I'll protect him too.

835
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,360
I'll protect them both at all costs.

836
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,240
Okay.

837
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,600
Or maybe Wang's story has issues.

838
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,640
This changed so quickly.

839
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Doesn't this sound reasonable to you?

840
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,560
Very reasonable.

841
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,480
Before you said that,

842
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
I wasn't sure about voting for you.

843
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,120
But after you spoke,

844
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,400
I have to vote for you now.

845
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,240
He's unwilling to accept it.

846
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,600
Little killer.

847
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,920
You can't find any flaws now.

848
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,960
You can't eliminate it.

849
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,840
And you won't be held responsible in the end.

850
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
Yes, exactly.

851
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
Because I'm also a suspect.

852
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,320
I'm just a civilian with no special role.

853
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,640
The main thing is not being responsible.

854
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,120
Yes.

855
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,800
Damn, saying that makes me sound like a jerk.

856
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,600
What about Zhang Linghe?

857
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,760
I actually really enjoy being the culprit.

858
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,760
Because you won.

859
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
You won both rounds.

860
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,760
The real culprit is

861
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,200
Xiao He.

862
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,200
The real killer is

863
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
Me, the killer

864
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,480
Heli

865
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,560
Winning feels amazing, I tell you

866
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,040
Really, you did enjoy winning

867
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,760
Okay

868
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,160
It really felt great

869
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,360
Two episodes in a row

870
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,280
Right

871
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,080
No, but why is that?

872
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,640
First, winning feels amazing

873
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,080
Second, actually being the killer

874
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,560
Made me feel like

875
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,640
I could better understand

876
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,880
How you all play

877
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
Right, because I had

878
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,280
A semi-omniscient view

879
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,040
God's perspective

880
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,880
Yes, I knew how some clues

881
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,920
Were supposed to appear

882
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,480
Then watched how you handled

883
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,800
Okay

884
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,720
All the little details

885
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,600
And your reactions

886
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
Yes, exactly

887
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,000
Right, so I could understand faster

888
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,640
Your playing style

889
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,160
Exactly

890
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,680
Being the killer is slightly harder

891
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,360
Right?

892
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes, of course

893
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,880
Actually I think this

894
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Depends entirely on the person

895
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
It's the minority against the majority

896
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,320
Right

897
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Fine, we won't wait for you

898
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,040
Next season you'll seek revenge?

899
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,280
Whose revenge will you take?

900
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,440
Didn't you say you wanted to

901
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,720
See how you'd mess with us?

902
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,160
Yes, I'll mess with you but not take revenge

903
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
I've already taken my revenge

904
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,560
Whose revenge did you take?

905
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,080
I took revenge for Brother Yu

906
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,560
I took revenge for Brother Ning

907
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,760
Didn't I take them all down one by one?

908
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,280
The one with the most votes is

909
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,240
Ning Hao

910
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,760
I have to say

911
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,720
We have some默契, don't we?

912
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,440
That's amazing

913
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,240
You're still eating health瓜子

914
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,400
Energy瓜子

915
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
The player with four votes is

916
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,320
White noise

917
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Confused

918
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,040
If you're going to do it this way

919
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,840
We should do better next season

920
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,520
Compete against each other

921
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,920
Before that

922
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,080
Have every player

923
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,920
Fill out a

924
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,480
Seasonal impression summary

925
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,160
It's about how everyone sees each other

926
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,480
What kind of impression

927
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,400
First of all

928
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Let's take a look at

929
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,600
In Dilraba's mind

930
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,720
The members of the Helimo Reasoning Team

931
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
What are their respective impressions?

932
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,160
Everyone has

933
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,240
Don't you

934
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,080
Okay

935
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,480
I thought this was going to be

936
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,040
The anonymous exchange

937
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,640
I didn't know you were going to do it this way

938
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,800
In your face

939
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,360
It's okay

940
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,280
My own evaluation is

941
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,520
Tough but not talkative

942
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,440
I don't need to explain this

943
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,720
As for Teacher Bai, it's scary

944
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,280
Because I think he's too

945
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,800
Mentally strong

946
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,000
So it's scary

947
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,320
Especially every time entering

948
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,440
The dark room

949
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,640
Help!

950
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,080
Quick, catch him!

951
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,960
Hurry hurry hurry!

952
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,240
Grab him!

953
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,200
There are two over there!

954
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,520
Where? I only see one.

955
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,840
Where?

956
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,080
Where is it?

957
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,440
Hold him down!

958
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,960
Hold him!

959
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,560
Got him!

960
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,200
What the hell?

961
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,480
Bai Yangzuo, you're so strong!

962
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,880
Scary as it may be,

963
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,800
At the very beginning,

964
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,320
since we didn't know him well,

965
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,680
or his gaming style.

966
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,360
But later he became

967
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,840
an incredibly reliable presence.

968
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,680
He'd lead the way upfront,

969
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,320
"Let's go,"

970
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,200
"Come on,"

971
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,840
"Here, bro,"

972
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
"Your turn now."

973
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
"My turn now, right?"

974
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
"Alright, I'll do it."

975
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
"Wait a sec,"

976
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,040
"Here, follow me, come on."

977
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,840
"Where are you?"

978
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,560
"I'm at the very front."

979
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,800
"Can you slow down?"

980
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,480
"I can do that."

981
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,720
"Feel my back,"

982
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,960
"Turn right."

983
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,760
"It's fine, keep going."

984
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,440
"Follow me."

985
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,120
"Everyone behind, keep up."

986
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,080
"Yeah, it's pitch black, can't see anything."

987
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,000
"Should we turn on a light outside?"

988
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,200
"Outside's fine, she's sitting there."

989
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,600
"And he's especially caring toward younger brothers."

990
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,360
"He's thoughtful, kind, and clever."

991
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,800
Playing like this, no way

992
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,880
Here's a coat for you.

993
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,920
Okay, thank you.

994
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,520
You can just go right in.

995
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,040
Are you cold, sis?

996
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,480
Just a little bit.

997
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,400
Aren't you cold?

998
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,560
I'm not cold.

999
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,200
But I'll need to mop the floor after this.

1000
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,920
No need.

1001
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,960
Thanks.

1002
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
Does this even need explaining?

1003
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,440
He's just really nice.

1004
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,200
Really nice.

1005
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,400
The younger brother is very considerate.

1006
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,880
As for Zhang Linghe,

1007
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,680
he's completely crazy.

1008
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,200
I don't think I need to explain either.

1009
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,640
Why?

1010
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,760
I need an explanation.

1011
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,840
Not really

1012
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,960
Because of his character

1013
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,800
And every episode he targets me

1014
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,120
Every single time he insists

1015
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
That I'm the killer

1016
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,920
I always feel

1017
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,520
There are many things left unsaid

1018
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,640
Including her

1019
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,280
Personal grudge with Master Le

1020
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,000
So these three incidents

1021
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,920
What do they represent?

1022
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,120
Were beyond his control

1023
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,680
Right

1024
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,320
You're directly pointing fingers at her

1025
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,240
Who would choose an anniversary

1026
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,560
such an important day to commit murder?

1027
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,520
The anniversary

1028
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,480
Exactly

1029
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,120
Could it be Xiao Ba?

1030
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,880
Yes, that's what I mean

1031
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,040
Ba's Tea

1032
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,080
Old Man Ba

1033
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
What about Ba's Tea?

1034
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,720
She's been drinking Ba's Tea constantly

1035
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,320
It makes me wonder if you could

1036
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,760
In what way do I even resemble

1037
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,040
Finally, there's Liu Yuning.

1038
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,520
We became enemies - villains.

1039
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,120
After filming one season of the show,

1040
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,720
we went from friends to enemies.

1041
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,760
Our character also deteriorated.

1042
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,320
We became bad people.

1043
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,040
No, we just became closer.

1044
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,280
We reached a higher level.

1045
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,200
I think our relationship

1046
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,400
allowed us to understand each other,

1047
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,600
and now we can banter freely.

1048
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,080
Right.

1049
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,880
Compared to when we're on set

1050
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,960
playing other characters,

1051
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,640
in this variety show,

1052
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
after being our true selves,

1053
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,240
we became enemies.

1054
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,920
Villains.

1055
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,240
Villains, okay.

1056
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,360
Yes, that's my perspective.

1057
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,680
Regarding all the teachers,

1058
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,360
Okay.

1059
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,360
Next is Bai Yu.

1060
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
His impressions of everyone.

1061
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,120
I want to see what he wrote about me.

1062
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,320
Very beautiful.

1063
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,960
Very silly.

1064
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,600
Great at deduction.

1065
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,480
That's enough.

1066
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Good.

1067
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,720
Very beautiful.

1068
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,480
Dilraba

1069
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,840
Right?

1070
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,360
Yes.

1071
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,680
What about the second one?

1072
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,560
So lame.

1073
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,040
Yeah.

1074
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,840
Talking about yourself?

1075
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,600
Exactly.

1076
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Great deduction.

1077
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,760
I want to take that back now.

1078
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,440
Seriously.

1079
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,960
Never mind.

1080
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,840
I’ll reluctantly give it to you.

1081
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,320
Reluctantly yours.

1082
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,080
Zhang Linghe is really handsome, right?

1083
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,920
Fair point.

1084
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,200
Fair point.

1085
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,760
Okay.

1086
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,320
Fair point.

1087
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,440
As for me, I’m the cool big bro.

1088
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,080
Cool big bro.

1089
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,840
Next up is Zhou Keyu

1090
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,000
Impressions of everyone

1091
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,200
This is actually quite embarrassing

1092
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,320
To be honest

1093
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
First about Sister Reba, she

1094
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,280
Actually I initially thought

1095
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,720
We were supposed to write first impressions

1096
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,400
You know

1097
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,240
So I initially wrote

1098
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,520
On the first day she wore all black

1099
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,440
Completely black

1100
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,040
And she looked stunning

1101
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,400
And she smelled wonderful

1102
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,760
Really fragrant

1103
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,000
Yes, literally

1104
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
The scent wafted over

1105
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,280
Then my second strong

1106
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,360
impression of her was

1107
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,440
When she said "Could it possibly be you?"

1108
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,360
That was her

1109
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,120
His pain this season

1110
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,960
The sentence he least wanted to hear

1111
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,520
Nightmare

1112
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
My nightmare this season

1113
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,080
Nightmare

1114
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,400
Sister Reba is too smart

1115
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
From my perspective

1116
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,680
Everything was going smoothly

1117
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,560
Then she suddenly looked up

1118
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,120
Stared at me and said

1119
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,520
"Why couldn't it be you?"

1120
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,800
I was done for

1121
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,440
It was over

1122
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,600
"Could it possibly be you?"

1123
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,800
Then there were the black and white swans

1124
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,880
That mixed doubles match

1125
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,720
It was her and

1126
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,880
Also his pain

1127
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,360
Sister Jin

1128
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,920
Right

1129
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
My impression of Brother Bai was

1130
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,040
Raining outside the auditorium

1131
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,520
Actually that was me too

1132
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,760
So artistic

1133
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,480
Coming into season two

1134
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,880
Because we hadn't seen each other

1135
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,280
For two or three years

1136
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
Then when we first met

1137
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,840
Later when I saw him again

1138
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,400
It was outside an auditorium

1139
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,080
And that day

1140
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Yes, about over two years

1141
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,200
It was raining

1142
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,040
The feeling when seeing him

1143
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,400
Was about 30% distant

1144
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
But 70% familiar

1145
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,200
Because we really hadn't met for long

1146
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,680
Yes, and then

1147
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,640
But still felt very familiar

1148
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,080
Actually the feeling was more than words can describe

1149
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
This season I

1150
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,320
Feel even more that Brother Bai is like an older brother

1151
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,280
Yes, that feeling

1152
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
Last season he was like a younger brother

1153
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,920
Right?

1154
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,320
This season more like an older brother

1155
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,120
More mature

1156
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,040
Older

1157
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,360
Age showing

1158
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,640
Just feels more

1159
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,720
Just

1160
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,520
Don't know how to say it

1161
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,440
Just better

1162
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,440
Then there's Linghe

1163
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,080
Linghe the handsome guy

1164
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,600
First time seeing him

1165
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,240
Really thought he was super handsome

1166
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,080
Really very handsome

1167
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,680
First time seeing him thought he was super handsome

1168
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Second time was capital letters CRAZY

1169
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,080
You're still very handsome now.

1170
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,120
But when I wrote...

1171
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,920
Especially my first impression...

1172
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,120
Just from my observation...

1173
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,240
When you first walked in...

1174
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,840
I thought you were taller than me.

1175
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,120
And then...

1176
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,520
For guys, height matters.

1177
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,320
Right.

1178
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,360
Because...

1179
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,960
In your daily life...

1180
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,320
You feel that dominance, right?

1181
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,840
Yeah, in your life, actually...

1182
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,800
You rarely...

1183
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,880
Rarely experience this kind of feeling.

1184
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,520
You know?

1185
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,200
Exactly.

1186
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,320
I rarely encounter...

1187
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,960
So many people...

1188
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,920
Where I'm the shortest.

1189
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,240
Yes, that's exactly the feeling.

1190
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,400
Yeah, that's how it is.

1191
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
And I think he's my...

1192
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,600
Most successful X partner...

1193
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,800
This season.

1194
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,800
Also, he's our...

1195
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,960
Math prodigy.

1196
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
Explain your problem-solving method again.

1197
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,600
600 minus this integer

1198
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,800
equals 130

1199
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,640
That's correct

1200
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,800
Impressive

1201
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,280
So that means

1202
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,360
from 10:51 PM to 10:09 PM

1203
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,840
Brilliant

1204
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
What does binary mean?

1205
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,640
It carries over when reaching 1

1206
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,520
There's no 2

1207
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,280
Only two digits: 0 and 1

1208
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,000
1

1209
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,520
10

1210
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,680
11

1211
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
We didn't go to the same school

1212
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,040
Why didn't I learn this?

1213
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,720
2X equals 104

1214
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,320
x equals 52

1215
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,280
Math prodigy

1216
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,320
Yes, today with the math problems

1217
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,600
made significant achievements

1218
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,480
Excellent

1219
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,640
Brother Ning's was very simple

1220
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,160
Conan

1221
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,840
That's right

1222
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,000
He handles all our main reasoning

1223
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,040
All the plot progression

1224
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,000
Whether he's good

1225
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,040
or when he's bad

1226
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,080
Actually

1227
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,840
he has to drive it forward

1228
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,960
Right, it all depends on him

1229
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,360
He sets the pace for everyone

1230
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,760
Yes

1231
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,000
He essentially determines

1232
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,680
the rhythm and progress of our reasoning

1233
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,960
The logic goes like this

1234
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,280
Both 8 years ago and 8 years later

1235
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,960
involved time travel

1236
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,440
They share one common point

1237
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,600
which is thunderstorms

1238
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:45,920
Right

1239
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,680
That's the first point

1240
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,360
The second point is Ship 4444

1241
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,280
It's likely that

1242
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,840
combining these two factors

1243
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,760
is what makes this possible

1244
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,160
Yes

1245
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,240
There's a logic

1246
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,600
Is it possible that Ba Zimei

1247
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,360
was actually the one manipulating the votes?

1248
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,800
I think this Ba Zimei

1249
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,960
was the one who yesterday

1250
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,040
taught you the method

1251
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,320
She's also the one who cursed us

1252
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,640
Could it be as we just said

1253
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,360
that before he jumped from the building

1254
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,960
So this paper tells you a logic

1255
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
that's impossible

1256
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,840
Why?

1257
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,160
The mechanism will seal the windows as they slide from the walls

1258
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,640
The moment he dies

1259
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,440
is when all the windows completely close

1260
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,160
Doors close

1261
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
So he must take his last breath

1262
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,360
Which means

1263
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,640
If he dies in the room

1264
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,040
he can't get out

1265
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
Then he can't get out

1266
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,480
So death by jumping then

1267
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:33,760
Death by jumping

1268
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,640
Exactly, death by jumping

1269
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,480
No

1270
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,880
Right

1271
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,440
Thank you

1272
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,640
So shy

1273
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,320
So shy

1274
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
That works

1275
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,840
Very beautiful

1276
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,040
Oh my

1277
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,400
Next is Zhang Linghe

1278
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,480
Impressions of everyone

1279
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,640
What I wrote about Dilraba was

1280
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,080
Your

1281
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,240
"Ba Ye wins by surprise"

1282
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,120
Plus a big "beautiful" character

1283
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
What does "Ba Ye" mean?

1284
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,320
It's the first impression

1285
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,480
When she first came on the show

1286
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,680
She was dressed all in black

1287
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,120
"I'm Dilraba"

1288
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,840
So cool and stylish

1289
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,320
Like a female warlord

1290
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,000
So I've always called her "Ba Ye"

1291
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,680
It became a running gag on my episode

1292
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,280
You genuinely want to admire her

1293
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,360
Yes

1294
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,080
You gave her the nickname "Boss Ba"

1295
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,520
Right, and then she wins with unexpected brilliance

1296
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,560
It's just that some of her...

1297
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,840
...exceptionally unique ideas

1298
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,960
Among all of us

1299
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,920
make her a truly special presence

1300
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,080
And her beauty goes without saying

1301
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,360
Such a prominent trait

1302
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,320
It's just beauty

1303
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,080
Otherwise—

1304
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,680
Right

1305
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,640
It's just beauty

1306
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,600
I regret writing "eccentric" for you

1307
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,960
You're "BEAUTY" in capital letters

1308
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,240
I'm "ECCENTRIC" in capitals

1309
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,240
You only got one "eccentric"

1310
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,960
I truly didn’t expect

1311
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,440
to get roasted this hard

1312
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,560
Brother Bai

1313
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,480
Bai Yu's mind is an enigma—so cool

1314
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,280
Yeah

1315
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,520
This is what I most wanted to say.

1316
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,040
Bai Yuxin's heart is as deep as the ocean.

1317
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,640
But he's still extremely handsome.

1318
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,560
He's an unfathomable man.

1319
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,920
Yes, but the key point is earlier when he...

1320
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Bai Yuxin's heart is as deep as the ocean.

1321
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,000
Truly.

1322
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,560
Brother Bai is someone I met this season...

1323
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,040
who helped me grow the fastest.

1324
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,720
Senior.

1325
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,600
Next time I should be able to...

1326
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,720
match Brother Bai evenly, I think.

1327
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,520
Okay.

1328
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,240
My hope.

1329
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,360
Next is Keyu.

1330
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,000
Outsmarted by his own cleverness.

1331
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,080
Yes, Keyu was outsmarted by his own cleverness.

1332
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,680
Did you write this after we voted...

1333
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,600
and you didn't get chosen?

1334
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,240
No, I'm not saying you're bad.

1335
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
You're very smart.

1336
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,600
That's the main point.

1337
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,480
Truly intelligent.

1338
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,800
Your reasoning skills are exceptional.

1339
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,360
But these two episodes, your cleverness backfired.

1340
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,120
Everyone knows...

1341
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,560
your clever patterns now...

1342
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,360
so they play on your kindness...

1343
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,120
and deceive you.

1344
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,480
Who do you think Ba would choose as X?

1345
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,440
I don't know

1346
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,120
Wouldn't she choose you?

1347
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,840
She might choose me

1348
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,080
She might choose you

1349
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,680
Right

1350
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,000
Aren't you the X?

1351
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,680
How could she possibly choose you?

1352
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,800
That's why I said she might choose me

1353
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
Is this your X?

1354
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,920
Never said a harsh word to you

1355
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,720
To be honest

1356
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,200
I don't think your physical condition is very good

1357
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,240
Because you self-harm

1358
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,720
That's not direct

1359
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,880
His approach is more direct

1360
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,240
Right

1361
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,200
Exactly

1362
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,000
Especially myself

1363
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,960
You can add yourself to that

1364
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,480
Right, outsmarting yourself

1365
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,240
You're like that too

1366
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,760
Same here

1367
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,040
People took advantage of my sincerity to deceive me

1368
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,720
Now you've learned to use that sincerity well

1369
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
Right, now I have to withdraw my sincerity

1370
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,240
Behind is Brother Ning

1371
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,920
Highly skilled but timid

1372
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,880
That's a funny way to put it

1373
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,920
First, highly skilled

1374
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,640
Meaning tall and handsome

1375
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,000
And Brother Ning really controls the pace well

1376
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But this season I want to thank you

1377
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,320
You've protected me many times

1378
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,880
Because I feel in the darkness

1379
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,960
You're very reliable

1380
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,520
Because Bai Yu basically ignores me

1381
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
He just runs off by himself

1382
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,640
He goes off to catch people

1383
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,280
I usually end up grabbing you and Ke Yu

1384
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,720
Sometimes Ke Yu is very brave too

1385
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,760
He also goes out to catch people

1386
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,240
Then I can only hold onto you

1387
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,240
It's okay

1388
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,280
Here we go again

1389
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,960
Don't push

1390
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,320
Don't crowd together

1391
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,080
Protect my dad

1392
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,680
Come on

1393
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,440
Dad

1394
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Okay okay

1395
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,920
Most reliable partner

1396
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,320
Right, I think it's in the darkness

1397
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,760
You're my most reliable partner

1398
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,040
Alright, then I'll remove this "cowardly" part

1399
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,200
Skilled and handsome

1400
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,840
No, I am indeed timid

1401
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,760
I admit this

1402
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,800
But I want to thank you

1403
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,080
For taking care of me this season

1404
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,560
Then I'll write about Reba first

1405
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,520
Master of creativity

1406
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,040
Your imagination is amazing

1407
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,320
Second is also about attention to detail

1408
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,160
When playing this

1409
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,640
The feeling throughout the game

1410
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,160
Like sensing something ominous

1411
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,680
Or coming up with creative ideas

1412
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,920
All came from you

1413
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,120
And you're good at deceiving

1414
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,280
Like that episode with Jin Jing

1415
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,240
You fooled me that day

1416
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,480
Really upset me

1417
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,520
But you're also easily fooled

1418
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,160
Mm

1419
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,280
This is my summary of you

1420
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,080
As for Bai Yu

1421
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,000
As he calls himself, a troublemaker, right?

1422
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,360
Loves to disrupt things

1423
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,840
But he's having a great time

1424
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,920
The second one is a sloth

1425
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,960
Sits down wherever he goes

1426
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Or just lies down

1427
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,080
Doesn't follow conventions

1428
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,120
Plays by intuition

1429
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,680
Can do whatever he wants

1430
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,160
Right

1431
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,480
I think that's quite special too

1432
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,880
And Keqin is easily fooled too

1433
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,520
He's quite competent

1434
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,760
Whenever he plays as detective

1435
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,080
Or when deducing the plot

1436
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,040
He's very smart

1437
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,840
His deduction skills are excellent

1438
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,240
Well then

1439
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,800
Zhang Linghe

1440
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,080
What do you mean?

1441
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,560
Because when I recorded the first episode

1442
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,040
You made me feel like a lark

1443
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,280
That lark-like feeling

1444
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,640
Longing for new clothes

1445
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,920
That look enchanting when worn

1446
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,680
You're just living life perfectly

1447
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,040
That's how it is

1448
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,360
Because this kind of vocal tone

1449
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,360
Is very precious to us singers

1450
00:44:59,360 --> 00:44:59,840
Really

1451
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,680
Yes, very precious

1452
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,000
That's it

1453
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,680
Not everyone has this kind of voice

1454
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,280
There are many good singers

1455
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,600
But very few have distinctive voices

1456
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,440
And you'll notice

1457
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,480
The singers who truly make it

1458
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,360
All have unique singing styles

1459
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,240
Okay

1460
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,800
I hope you'll release an album someday

1461
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,440
and save a copy for me

1462
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,080
What's the second thing?

1463
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
He's shown remarkable growth

1464
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,600
Throughout this entire program

1465
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,560
I've noticed his

1466
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,320
deductive skills improving

1467
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,640
and his understanding of

1468
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,520
game strategies has

1469
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,760
His progress has been

1470
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,160
the fastest

1471
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,800
very rapid

1472
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,440
the quickest

1473
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,160
I'm Zhang Linghe

1474
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,360
I hope all veteran players

1475
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,280
will go easy on me

1476
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,680
This was me

1477
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,240
before I lost my memories

1478
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,680
You remember before amnesia?

1479
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,640
My parents helped me recall later

1480
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,920
Could he be deceiving you?

1481
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,200
Couldn't this brother be fake?

1482
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,840
At this point

1483
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,240
stop playing the devoted lover role

1484
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,640
alright?

1485
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,400
But I am genuinely devoted

1486
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,240
Very suspicious

1487
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,480
Highly suspect, Jiawei

1488
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,040
Because he can't sleep at night

1489
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,440
Right

1490
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,360
Done too many bad things

1491
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,920
Exactly

1492
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,200
Isn't that right?

1493
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,720
Then you recommended Bai medicine

1494
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,200
I didn't suggest anything

1495
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,400
Don't frame me

1496
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,680
Look how nervous you are

1497
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,800
Stop trying to frame me

1498
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,480
A bit stiff

1499
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,360
First time being X

1500
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,040
Perfectly normal

1501
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,200
One after another

1502
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
No matter what I do

1503
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,080
they start framing me

1504
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,760
This X role is too stressful

1505
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,120
Not giving me an identity

1506
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,760
No

1507
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,760
Now I'm asking you

1508
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,040
Look into my eyes

1509
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,560
Did you draw X just now?

1510
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,360
Yes, I did

1511
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,400
You're X

1512
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,520
Yes

1513
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,800
Alright, let's play this openly

1514
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,680
Keep mentally controlling me, it's fine

1515
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,480
Stay away from me

1516
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,320
What?

1517
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,920
Little X

1518
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,960
Who would commit murder
on an anniversary

1519
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,400
such an important day?

1520
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,040
It must be revenge killing

1521
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,800
Is this motive weak?

1522
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,520
No, I think avenging one's master

1523
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,400
would be a more fitting motive

1524
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,080
I can only tell you one logic

1525
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,920
It corresponds to his diagnosis letter

1526
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,080
Why are you protecting him again?

1527
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,560
I think he's our only breakthrough

1528
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,480
See whose X he is

1529
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,920
Is he your X?

1530
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,800
He hasn't opposed you once

1531
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,520
I'm really not X today, believe me

1532
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,120
The real culprit is

1533
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,760
Xiao Ba

1534
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,720
Classmate Xiao Ba

1535
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,680
Classmate Xiao Ba

1536
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,640
Classmate Xiao Ba

1537
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,120
Babi

1538
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,880
White noise

1539
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,040
White noise

1540
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,840
White noise

1541
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,280
White noise

1542
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,880
This case's

1543
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,040
culprit identification result is

1544
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,640
Failure

1545
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,320
Failure

1546
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,720
You acted so well

1547
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
I'm speechless, I wondered why

1548
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,080
Oh my god

1549
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,400
Whenever you have an identity,

1550
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,200
you enter into a character state.

1551
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,240
Because once when he played X for me,

1552
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,760
I felt that

1553
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,920
your demeanor that day wasn't quite right.

1554
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,400
So I used to think

1555
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,200
that whenever you have an identity,

1556
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,640
you become someone who speaks little

1557
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,080
and acts very cautiously.

1558
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,520
That was my previous understanding.

1559
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,080
But today you've impressed me.

1560
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,280
Today's version of you

1561
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,160
plays differently than before.

1562
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,360
Changed your playstyle.

1563
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,200
Okay.

1564
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,760
As for me,

1565
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,720
first, I don't look

1566
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,120
much like a good person.

1567
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,680
See, I do understand you.

1568
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,520
Right, a villain.

1569
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,120
Isn't that so?

1570
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,120
Except when I'm the detective,

1571
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,080
you all suspect me.

1572
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,680
That kind of situation -

1573
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,840
just not seeming like a good person.

1574
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,520
Second, I don't want to play X anymore

1575
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,480
because I've done it too much.

1576
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,120
I want to fully immerse myself in playing

1577
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,720
and hope that next time I come,

1578
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,080
I won't be afraid of the dark or cry.

1579
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,720
That's all.

1580
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Okay.

1581
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,360
Alright.

1582
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,920
Today we've prepared

1583
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,520
a big trophy for the Golden Key King.

1584
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,440
Who will be this season's

1585
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,560
Golden Key King?

1586
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,240
Golden Key King

1587
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,080
Not me, I lost consecutively after that

1588
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,240
Lost twice in a row, right? No?

1589
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,080
Yeah, consecutive losses

1590
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,120
Could be Bai Yu

1591
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,440
Bai Yu and Zhou Keyu

1592
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,480
Really?

1593
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,880
Impossible

1594
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,600
Definitely not me

1595
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,040
"Start Guessing 2" Reasoning Star

1596
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,480
Put it there first

1597
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,040
It might not be his

1598
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,080
It could be mine

1599
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,080
Who will be this season's Reasoning Star?

1600
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,800
It must be him

1601
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,640
That should be correct

1602
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,000
Please look at the big screen

1603
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,160
Now announcing this season's golden key count

1604
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,200
Let's congratulate Bai Yu

1605
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,080
for becoming this season's Golden Key King

1606
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,400
Alright

1607
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,280
You've made it, Bai Yu

1608
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,080
See? I told you you had the most

1609
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,000
Five times

1610
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,160
You've really made it

1611
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,520
I'm very grateful to everyone

1612
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,920
For giving me a trophy

1613
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,400
despite my limited abilities

1614
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,120
and presenting me with this award

1615
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,600
Thank you

1616
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,760
Thank you all

1617
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,760
That just makes it more frustrating

1618
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,200
After we had dinner together that day

1619
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,520
we all made a promise

1620
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,320
Right

1621
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,040
That gesture we did together

1622
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,120
Whenever we say

1623
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,960
"Start Guessing" Season 2

1624
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,920

Yes

1628
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,800
When we chat privately

1629
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,760
our team spirit is strong

1630
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,680
we always say

1631
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,880
If there's a Season 3

1632
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,000
as long as they invite us

1633
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
we'll definitely come

1634
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,720
That's our team spirit

We all heard that

1640
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,800
We'll wait for the production team too

1641
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,520
Reason for a month

Non-stop reasoning, live here and reason

1643
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,040
Alright, now for the final part

1644
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,200
Let's shout our slogan together one more time

1645
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,960
Sounds good

1646
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,360
Here we go

1658
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,720
You predicted you're X

1659
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,520
How did I predict I'm X?

1660
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,600
White killer

1661
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,360
You first

1662
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:50,960
Why are you hiding?

1663
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,600
Is this your secret signal with X?

1664
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,760
Little killers

1665
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,800
Everyone's scrambling

1666
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,080
I'll do it

1667
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,960
This win feels great, bro

1668
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,120
Black and white swans, everyone

1669
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Because we're family

1670
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,880
All one family

1671
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,160
A loving family

1672
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,840
This is really dark

1673
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,560
Can't see anything

1674
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,400
Isn't this a watch?

1675
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,240
So tight

1676
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,000
Coming

1677
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,360

Move it

1681
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,040
Gently, it's expensive

1682
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,440
Done

1683
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,200
White, orange, yellow

1684
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,120
Why isn't mine working?

1685
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,600
Get out

1686
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,120
Don't just stand there doing nothing

1687
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,040
Let go quickly

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Tui Arts' Seven Mysteries

1713
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,120
Don't open cabinets randomly

1714
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,720
Tui Arts' mysteries are real

1715
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,280
Someone's at the door

1716
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,000
Want me to tell you how to drain someone's blood?

1717
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,280
I want the other person dead

1718
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,120
One wants to kill

1719
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,360
One wants to provide the method

1720
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,480
Same time, same place, I want someone dead

1721
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,880
The killer might be that person

1722
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,640
Piano

1723
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,200
Hurry, leave!

1724
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,280
Luoluo always calls me

1725
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,880
Brother

1726
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,240
At that moment I knew

1727
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,240
I'd fallen in love

1728
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,920
He's my beloved brother

1729
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,960
Luoluo says whenever she sees me

1730
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,800
She remembers her brother who depended on her

1731
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,640
That's not true, Nengneng brother

1732
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,960
Never thought after breaking up

1733
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,240
She'd immediately find someone new

1734
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,760
It's Balala Energy

1735
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,200
Emotions - because he still loves her

1736
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,480
I broke up with him

1737
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,760
Just to be with you

1738
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,680
Am I just your pastime?

1739
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,280
Okay?

1740
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,240
You remember these three words well

1741
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,640
This part is really good
