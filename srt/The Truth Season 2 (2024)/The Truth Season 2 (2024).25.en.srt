1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,480
Choose your favorite food

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,840
to determine your teammates

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,600
Waiting for my catnip brother

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,720
Am I about to be kicked out?

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,800
Excuse me

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,720
Sorry

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:20,840
13

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,480
13

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,160
11

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,800
17

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Being this cautious?

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,840
Open

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,760
Doubt

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
This game is turning into bluffing

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,920
Crazy

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,600
We definitely need to raise

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
This amount won't pass

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,280
6

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,080
8

20
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,120
We're going to block you

21
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,520
Dragon's move

22
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,960
Actually we can just play randomly

23
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,920
"Kill" him off

24
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,920
You don't seem to have other options

25
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,680
They're going to

26
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,720
Build a catapult

27
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,920
We must come up with

28
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,440
A way to counter the catapult strategy

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
They've made some excellent moves

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,280
Those teapots of theirs now

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,440
Have nowhere to go

32
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,520
Feeling like we can't hold them back anymore

33
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,560
Feeling like we can't hold them back anymore

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Calm down, calm down

35
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,280
Can't come back

36
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,600
Oh god, what am I doing

37
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,280
Hello everyone

38
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,720
Welcome to *Let’s Start Thinking*

39
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,000
I’m the assistant to the head of the *Thinking Hall*

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,960
Cui Shaoyang

41
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,080
Today, the way our eight physicians select teammates

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
has a slight twist

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,640
We’ll use

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
a lifestyle-based test

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,120
to form the four clinics

46
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,880
First,

47
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,440
let’s welcome our first physician

48
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,800
What?

49
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,560
Approaching us now is our first physician—

50
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,600
Yu Haoyang

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
Yes!

52
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,320
Alright,

53
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,960
come on!

54
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,000
Come back!

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,440
This episode’s teammate selection rules

56
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,120
This episode’s teammate selection rules

57
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,640
have undergone some changes

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
The fourth one seems

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,200
to sound more impressive

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,360
Though I don't really like durian

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,760
I do quite like cilantro

62
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,680
So I'll choose number 4

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,440
Yu Haoyang walks toward room 104

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,480
Who will share the consultation room with him?

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
There really is pizza

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
Yang Zongyu

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,200
I'll choose one

68
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Different strokes for different folks

69
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,080
I'll choose this one.

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,440
What?

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,680
Cold-tossed Houttuynia cordata

72
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,040
Waiting for my Houttuynia cordata brother

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
Welcome Hu Minghao

74
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Where are we going today?

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,960
I pretend there's no one here

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,040
But you can see

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
Sit here

78
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
Hello

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,000
I think it's the only one

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,040
edible thing

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
I think so too

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,520
That's why I chose this

83
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,400
Let's guess who will choose whom.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,200
I think

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,920
those from Sichuan probably

86
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,560
have a higher acceptance of fish mint.

87
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Do you know who's from Sichuan?

88
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,720
That person,

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
Hou Zhuocheng and

90
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,080
that Ren Yinpeng.

91
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,960
Welcome, Hou Zhuocheng.

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,760
I feel that

93
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,400
Brother Hou Zhuocheng is from Sichuan,

94
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,360
so he should like eating fish mint.

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,640
This is cold dressed fish mint.

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,320
You're from Sichuan?

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,760
Yes.

98
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,600
Back home, we often

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,840
eat cold dressed fish mint.

100
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
Alright, follow your heart.

101
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,440
Damn, still didn't get it.

102
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,960
Who else?

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,360
Brother Huang Kai

104
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,280
Brother Ren Yinpeng

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Brother Wei Xiaolong

106
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,720
Brother Wei Xiaolong

107
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
It really is luosifen (snail rice noodles).

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,640
You need to hide inside

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,800
Sit down

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
Move further inside

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,840
Where is the audience?

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,440
Why is no one here to greet me?

113
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,960
People...

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,280
Welcome Dong Zifan!

115
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,320
Welcome!

116
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,200
You almost bumped into my mouth!

117
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,320
Okay, hello everyone!

118
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,440
Huang Kai just told me...

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
that his favorite actor is Dong Zifan.

120
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
He hasn't watched many dramas, right?

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,320
Doesn't matter.

122
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,720
Take a look and choose.

123
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,640
Houttuynia cordata.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,920
So am I being kicked out?

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,720
This room is already full.

126
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,840
Take care.

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Actually, three people...

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,200
This room wouldn't be too crowded.

129
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,480
Although triangles are the most stable shape...

130
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,000
Some things just can't be forced.

131
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,040
It's fine.

132
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
I hope you two have fun together.

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
My two former teammates.

134
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,200
Two exes.

135
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
So now I need to choose again

136
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
I think this is okay

137
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,760
With such delicacies

138
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,240
We'll enjoy them together with my teammates later

139
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,360
Welcome, Ren Yinpeng

140
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,480
I feel like Brother Yinpeng

141
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
can definitely eat fishwort

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,520
But I don’t really like it, what should I do?

143
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,880
Houttuynia cordata

144
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,080
Excuse me

145
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,760
Excuse me

146
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,120
A bit offensive

147
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,400
I've offended them

148
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,960
Brother Ren Yinpeng

149
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,520
Houttuynia cordata is delicious

150
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm almost finished, look

151
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,920
I really can't eat another bite

152
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,560
Oh my

153
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,120
You must finish it

154
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
You must finish it all.

155
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,120
That's right.

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,480
Then you go ahead, I'll take charge.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
No.

158
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,320
Coincidentally, I don't like any of it either.

159
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,440
Let's eat pizza, eat the crust.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,360
I can't do this.

161
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,080
Some people eat it though.

162
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,240
Sorry.

163
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
We'll edit it later.

164
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,400
Outside there's chaos as people fight for partners.

165
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,080
While I'm here peacefully.

166
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,880
Doing a houttuynia cordata eating show.

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,920
Outside there's chaos as people fight for partners.

168
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
While I'm here peacefully.

169
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,160
Doing a houttuynia cordata eating show.

170
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
It's actually quite tasty.

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,080
Then I'll eat this.

172
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,800
Here we go.

173
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,840
You

174
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,320
You wouldn't...

175
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
I finished it

176
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
You wouldn't

177
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,560
There's no way he gave me this much

178
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,400
Do you know how awful this tastes?

179
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,920
You've already tried it

180
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,960
I ate it all

181
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Don't be like this

182
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,160
But I can help you eat a bit more

183
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,880
Actually, I lied to you earlier

184
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,200
Actually, I didn't eat it either

185
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,520
But I did taste it

186
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,800
But my advice to you

187
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,280
Because I feel the back of my tongue is sensitive

188
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,200
to bitter tastes

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Don't chew, just swallow

190
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,960
It's over

191
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,520
Being in a group with Brother Huang Kai is nice

192
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,000
But

193
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,440
If Brother Huang Kai doesn't pick this first

194
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
It would be awkward

195
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,360
It means no one likes eating fishy herb

196
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,040
Cilantro and durian pizza

197
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,360
Here it comes

198
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,800
Fishy herb

199
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,560
Hello

200
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:09,840
Hello

201
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
I've been waiting for you so long

202
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,560
You didn't go into another room

203
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
and got kicked out, did you?

204
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,920
No, I was second in line

205
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,640
But no one ever came here

206
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,800
No one comes here at all

207
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,680
Oh no, what if I throw up later?

208
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,560
It's okay.

209
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,040
If you can't finish it,

210
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,960
I'll eat it for you.

211
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
Brothers from the four rooms,

212
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,560
you've successfully formed teams now.

213
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
This makes us look a bit...

214
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,440
What lies before you is

215
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,240
only five seconds to finish eating.

216
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,040
Finish it.

217
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
If you don't finish,

218
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,800
this lump of noodles

219
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,280
must be carried out and eaten embarrassingly.

220
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,200
Five.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
You must finish within five seconds.

222
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,800
Four.

223
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,000
Three.

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,720
How am I supposed to eat this?

225
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
I feel like throwing up with every bite.

226
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,680
Two.

227
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,200
One.

228
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,920
Please step outside.

229
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,560
Come on, line up over here.

230
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,200
Why haven't you all finished eating?

231
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,200
Yes, I want to try

232
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,160
this flavor

233
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,080
So delicious I could eat the bowl too

234
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,080
Delicious

235
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,160
Come, line up in a row

236
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,880
Don't come near me

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,160
Zifan was the first to be rejected

238
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,400
Even this needs ranking?

239
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,200
At first they

240
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,760
welcomed me warmly

241
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,840
Then even wanted to stay

242
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,000
and share this room with them

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,720
Zhuocheng even asked me

244
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,600
"Can you handle the other three?"

245
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
Maybe give him another hint

246
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,640
He might come out on his own

247
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,920
Is the bond between you two

248
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,160
this deep?

249
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,680
Indeed

250
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,280
No, he was probably just pretending

251
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
So I didn't

252
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,080
take it seriously either

253
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,320
I didn't want to embarrass myself

254
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,640
So I came out on my own

255
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,280
Thus concludes this round of grouping

256
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,200
Now let's begin this episode's assessment

257
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,280
Anchor point

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
Start using your brains

259
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,680
We're back

260
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,400
We've returned from our journey

261
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,760
Now we're about to begin

262
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,440
the first round of this episode's assessment

263
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,880
Once again it's me

264
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,000
who will draw from this medicine cabinet

265
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,720
Yimu Grass

266
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
Yimu Grass

267
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,160
The doctor changes formation for battle

268
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,120
Chinese Checkers

269
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,080
Isn't this the one you're good at?

270
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,040
I remember it.

271
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,760
Okay.

272
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,320
Anyway, our strategy is

273
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,360
to try to bounce it to the center first.

274
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,880
We must come up with

275
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,960
a way to counter the slingshot tactic.

276
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Otherwise we're doomed if they keep using it.

277
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,200
We can start with

278
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,120
No need to say more, right guys?

279
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,760
No need.

280
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,800
Charge, brothers!

281
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,440
Let's go then.

282
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,960
First treatment room to battle.

283
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,520
Treatment Room Four.

284
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,280
It's over.

285
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,240
Treatment Room Two.

286
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,800
Nice, beautiful move.

287
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,880
Slow.

288
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Back.

289
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,600
Treatment Room One.

290
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
That's toxic.

291
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,640
Treatment Room Four.

292
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,880
Alright, Huang Kai is coming.

293
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,520
Yang Zongyu and Yu Haoyang's

294
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,240
first match against each other.

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,240
Everyone can look forward to this.

296
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,480
Do you trust me?

297
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,800
Fine, I'll follow your lead.

298
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,280
Anchor point.

299
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,200
Treatment Room One goes first.

300
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
Same as before

301
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,920
Symmetrical opening

302
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,880
Keep it symmetrical

303
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,640
Would moving this piece over be better?

304
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,680
This one comes straight across

305
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
Right, it can go directly

306
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
They're still using the slingshot move

307
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,960
Right?

308
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,040
Next game, we can try

309
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,880
This teapot

310
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,720
Still at home for now

311
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
No moves left

312
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
Let’s push these two in first

313
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Leave two of our pieces there

314
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,400
This can help us build a bridge

315
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,680
And block them

316
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,760
They want to

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,720
Set up the slingshot

318
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,200
This step is crucial

319
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,320
It feels like we can't hold on much longer

320
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,440
Okay

321
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,760
Okay

322
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,920
Calm down.

323
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,640
Once we get inside, just let the teapot...

324
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,320
...fly away.

325
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,920
The clinic's surroundings were dealt with quite decisively.

326
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,000
Of course

327
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,240
Because

328
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,560
Because of Keqin's Whisper

329
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,520
I think we should go there first.

330
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,520
Should we go there first or block them first?

331
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,400
Right now, those few troublemakers...

332
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,600
have nowhere to go.

333
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,480
I can't move

334
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,080
Unless you step back

335
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,400
Go inside

336
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,320
Let's go

337
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Move this away

338
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,000
Yes, go wherever you want

339
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,880
We can't leave

340
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,520
Can't move

341
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,200
Right

342
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Not a single one in the middle can move

343
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,040
We have nowhere to go

344
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,000
Exactly

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,680
Then we'll just have to wait for you

346
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
Turn inward

347
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
They don't want to destroy the slingshot

348
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,280
They've completely blocked the center

349
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,440
Then each side advanced a few pieces

350
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
With just these four moves of theirs

351
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,680
There are no possible moves left now

352
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,720
Their two moves just go back and forth

353
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,720
Actually we can make any move we want

354
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,840
What should our next move be?

355
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,400
Open a path

356
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,040
Then we can delay him a bit

357
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,280
Because this is the only way

358
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Otherwise, they'll finish setting up here

359
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,080
And we'll be one step behind

360
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,640
If we don't act in between

361
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,880
They've already figured it out

362
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,960
They'll quickly find a countermeasure

363
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,280
Now we have to dismantle

364
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,880
the line we've established

365
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,480
We must dismantle it

366
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,760
This one goes in, that one goes in

367
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
Both will enter one after another

368
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
Have confidence, Brother Huang Kai

369
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,880
We're counting on you

370
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,600
They made some excellent moves

371
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,720
When he came out, we went in

372
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,640
Because originally the three of us were blocking here

373
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,280
While they had four

374
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,000
We had the advantage

375
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,480
But now they've turned it around

376
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,040
Now we have four on this side

377
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,040
I think we can go all in

378
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,600
All in

379
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,400
It's like swapping the two and moving them over

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,480
Alright, then you go ahead

381
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,160
We've been tricked

382
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,640
Let's fill it up

383
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,360
Wait a moment

384
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,160
Dismantle the bridge

385
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,000
The black pieces can't move now.

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,680
We can go in.

387
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,240
Let's go first.

388
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,000
And we can also take that position.

389
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,360
Right.

390
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,920
Right?

391
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,160
Yes.

392
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,600
I think we should move this one.

393
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,160
These two moves can only go here.

394
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,840
If we don't give up the position...

395
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,920
It feels like taking a final exam

396
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,640
I think preparing for grad school entrance

397
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
was much easier than this

398
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
No, don't give up

399
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,160
Don't

400
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,600
You're so kind

401
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
After all, it's from the past

402
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,560
Or directly

403
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:57,920
This one goes straight in

404
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,320
This piece moves directly in

405
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,560
This piece has directly entered

406
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,440
No

407
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,000
Once we move here

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,280
He can fly over here

409
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,880
Your piece can only move this way

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then let's do this

411
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,720
Make way

412
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,160
If he just flew over there

413
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,920
This black piece could fly over

414
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,080
This red piece would be dead

415
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,040
No one would be supporting it

416
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,080
That move of theirs was very clever

417
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,760
Directly flip this to here

418
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,120
Free up this position

419
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,120
We can get through like this

420
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,240
When they come, we'll just fly over

421
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,320
Move this

422
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,480
Come on, let's go

423
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Then we've won

424
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,080
They have three moves

425
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,200
But we're one turn behind them

426
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,000
One move

427
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,320
This one

428
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,000
Congratulations, what an intense match.

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Truly spectacular.

430
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,360
Both sides, explain your strategies.

431
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,560
If the potent potion is placed in the center,

432
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,960
it means you can only move through the center.

433
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,640
Because you can't jump out from the sides.

434
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,960
So we blocked this side.

435
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,760
I was in the center.

436
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,560
The fewer potent pills we have,

437
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,920
the greater our advantage becomes.

438
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,320
Their four moves here

439
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,600
now have no possible moves left.

440
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,560
Just their two moves

441
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,760
were going back and forth here.

442
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,240
Learned something new.

443
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,120
Gained new insights.

444
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,920
Because we wasted too much time here.

445
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,680
If we had

446
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,600
jumped out earlier,

447
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
perhaps the opportunity

448
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,720
would have been greater.

449
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,280
Because we lingered for two moves here.

450
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,560
Diagonal

451
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,560
Here?

452
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
Both sides are symmetrical now.

453
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,320
Actually, they're the same.

454
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,280
Just jump over ahead.

455
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,760
Jumped over here.

456
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,720
Broke the symmetry

457
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,840
Both sides fell into meticulous calculations

458
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,440
Got it

459
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,040
It's perfectly symmetrical.

460
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,240
First, there's one here.

461
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,880
This one hits here.

462
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,080
Do you think we should place a piece here?

463
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,520
Right.

464
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,600
Are we still using the slingshot tactic this time?

465
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,680
Wait a moment

466
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,520
I think we shouldn't focus on this for now.

467
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,240
We need to take care of these two first.

468
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,920
Which side should we flip?

469
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
We can go this way.

470
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,800
Choose this one and that one.

471
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,120
Then he can bring one more in

472
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,480
If he comes in, I can move forward

473
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,000
Yes

474
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,360
I'll take this one

475
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,120
A brilliant move

476
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,480
Let's move this first

477
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,640
This one goes in first

478
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,800
Okay

479
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,040
This move works

480
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,240
If I hit here

481
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,920
He can counter

482
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,840
Directly counters back

483
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,560
You don't seem to have other options

484
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't move unless they move

485
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,560
Nobody move

486
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,040
I think we can go here first

487
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,760
No problem

488
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,400
If any of them make a move

489
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,280
we can all get in

490
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,880
He has no choice but to fight

491
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
Okay, one is left here, right?

492
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,560
Or

493
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,280
We

494
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,160
Kill it

495
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,840
Okay

496
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,680
Then we'll move slowly

497
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,280
Right.

498
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,320
That's right.

499
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,520
What am I doing?

500
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,960
They're trying to save this move now.

501
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,360
It'll take several more steps.

502
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,560
Even if he comes back, it's useless.

503
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,680
He can't come back.

504
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,560
Let's move first

505
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,040
Right, we can move that first

506
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,520
Okay

507
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,080
Go ahead

508
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,480
You'll come over eventually

509
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,960
But you have to move slowly

510
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,920
We've arrived

511
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,760
They'll definitely adjust everything

512
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,800
Get it all ready

513
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,680
Before letting you out

514
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,120
We should come back for it, right?

515
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,480
Take it apart for him

516
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,440
Seems like we lost

517
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,360
We lost.

518
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,680
Alright, congratulations.

519
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,760
Congratulations to Clinic Two.

520
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,320
Clinic Three, your thoughts?

521
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
It mainly comes from...

522
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,160
our previous experience.

523
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,640
Like with slingshots and such...

524
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,200
We were solely focused on...

525
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,120
how to attack.

526
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,360
How to attack.

527
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,160
We didn't consider...

528
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,840
the concept of dismantling slingshots.

529
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,640
At the moment of change...

530
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,520
it suddenly felt like memorized questions...

531
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:34,640
suddenly felt like memorized questions...

532
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,240
as if...

533
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,160
they weren't testing that anymore.

534
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,200
That's the feeling we had.

535
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,840
Anchor point.

536
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,400
Next up...

537
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
will be our second round of assessments.

538
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,720
Now then...

539
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,200
this time...

540
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,960
let's try our luck.

541
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,640
What could it be?

542
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Prescription - take a guess.

543
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,600
The four families decide the order by playing rock-paper-scissors

544
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,440
Rock-paper-scissors

545
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,240
Alright

546
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,960
Do as you please

547
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,000
10

548
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,160
11

549
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Being this cautious?

550
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,400
We might be minus ten

551
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,880
He can call out 11 without being questioned

552
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,560
I think we're at least a five

553
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,320
Go ahead, please continue counting

554
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,920
12

555
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,760
They dare to call 12

556
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,720
which means the cards they can see

557
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,400
must be at least close to 10

558
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,440
or higher

559
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,840
Because our current minimum

560
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,120
could be 0

561
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
or even up to 16

562
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,640
are relatively safe

563
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,120
But if we're at minus 10

564
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
then let's try 13

565
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,400
13

566
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,080
15

567
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,800
16

568
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,320
17

569
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,960
18

570
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,280
Should we start?

571
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,880
He looks like he's about to give up when he sees our cards.

572
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,080
Right?

573
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,040
Exactly.

574
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,600
In this game, we need to observe...

575
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,240
how fast others call their numbers.

576
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,760
Their calling speed.

577
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,080
If someone calls instantly like this...

578
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,240
it means except for him...

579
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,040
the other three players...

580
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,360
definitely have higher numbers.

581
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,760
If they're calling like this...

582
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,960
we're probably at minus five.

583
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,280
I estimate we're at minus five.

584
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,680
If we're at minus five...

585
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,000
20

586
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,800
We might be over ten.

587
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,720
21

588
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,920
22

589
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,960
22

590
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:19,920
23

591
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,760
25

592
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,480
Open

593
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,640
Who opens?

594
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,360
I'll open

595
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,840
Challenge failed

596
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,320
I thought we were at minus 10

597
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,840
You didn’t dare to report

598
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,520
The clinic that was misdiagnosed in the last round

599
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,280
will take the first move in the next round

600
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Understood?

601
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,960
Alright

602
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,120
Begin

603
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,440
7

604
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,040
8

605
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,640
9

606
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
10

607
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,720
11

608
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,800
12

609
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,920
13

610
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,720
14

611
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,400
Could it really be that big?

612
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,880
Should we open it?

613
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,040
Are ours negative?

614
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
What do you think?

615
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,720
15

616
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,400
16

617
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,640
Safe

618
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,440
He's so decisive

619
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,640
Could ours be...

620
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,720
No, he's not decisive

621
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,600
He's pretending

622
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm starting to understand him

623
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,200
Don't speculate about me

624
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,440
Anchor point

625
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,360
Kai's whisper

626
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,840
Huang Kai definitely has

627
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
It must mean something

628
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,360
That's why he's whispering over there

629
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,480
Don't speculate about me and Brother Huang Kai

630
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,160
Let's open it

631
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,480
Open, challenge 16

632
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
So small, really small

633
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,920
Challenge successful

634
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,080
Then we'll continue

635
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Then we'll continue

636
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,960
42

637
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,960
49

638
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,720
50

639
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,880
This game is turning into bluffing

640
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,760
Yes, it feels like bluffing

641
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,120
We'll open, we have to open

642
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,440
Okay, challenge successful

643
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,800
Starting next round

644
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,640
Okay, negative 2

645
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
19

646
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,200
20

647
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,000
21

648
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,240
23

649
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,920
Open

650
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,560
Challenge failed

651
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,080
Alright, starting from examination room four.

652
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,480
16

653
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,040
17

654
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,000
We should report it as minus 5 or minus 10

655
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,800
20

656
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,120
It's not like he could call 17

657
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,600
That just proves my hand isn't weak

658
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,360
You get it, right?

659
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,760
21

660
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,440
22

661
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,080
How do they view our hand count?

662
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,200
Our hand isn't small,

663
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,440
but it's not that big either.

664
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,400
Right.

665
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,840
Add one to the count.

666
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,840
23.

667
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
23.

668
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Let's assume we're at 0.

669
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Call them out one by one.

670
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,440
25.

671
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,280
25.

672
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,160
30.

673
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,880
31.

674
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,080
No.

675
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,960
I think calling 31 isn't a good move,

676
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
because if the next player

677
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,080
is certain they have 20,

678
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,680
they'll definitely challenge us.

679
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,000
What number did he report?

680
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,640
31

681
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,520
Open

682
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,360
Challenge

683
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,520
Challenge successful

684
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,440
Clinic Four has accumulated three misdiagnoses

685
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,120
First to be eliminated

686
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,520
Spectate

687
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,080
Congratulations

688
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,400
Spectate

689
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,520
I think spectating will be exciting

690
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Because you'll get to see everything

691
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,920
Right

692
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,960
Come on, let's start with Consultation Room One first.

693
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,640
Anchor Point

694
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,040
3

695
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,640
4

696
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Opened

697
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,240
Open

698
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,760
Challenge successful

699
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,160
Maximum number equals 0

700
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,280
Didn’t expect that, did you?

701
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
There’s no way around it

702
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
Okay, there are three consultation rooms left.

703
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,440
Each has one misdiagnosis.

704
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,240
Consultation Room Two.

705
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,160
Zero.

706
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,400
What? One then.

707
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,640
Then two.

708
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,480
Then three.

709
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,840
Then.

710
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,480
Then ten.

711
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,840
Fifteen.

712
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,000
Fifteen.

713
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,200
They're messing with us, right?

714
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,160
These two places.

715
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,760
Why are the numbers so high?

716
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,480
How come...

717
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,760
Right, we got it backwards.

718
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,160
Open or not?

719
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
They're putting on an act again.

720
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,600
Now only Brother Huang Kai and I don't dare to speak.

721
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,520
Onlookers see clearly, right?

722
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,040
Right, we're just quietly observing.

723
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,920
Open.

724
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,600
Open.

725
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,840
Challenge successful.

726
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,960
So now Clinic 3 is one step away from elimination

727
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,560
Just one misdiagnosis away

728
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,200
You actually don’t need to say this

729
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,480
Peng’s sensitivity

730
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,640
If you have a special card,

731
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,400
Actually, for the one with the special card,

732
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,080
it’s really tough

733
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,120
Extremely tough

734
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,160
Can’t hold back

735
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
Now we can all play with our cards revealed.

736
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,040
Actually,

737
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,800
2

738
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,400
5

739
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,400
Wait a minute,

740
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
What do you mean?

741
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,680
What does this mean?

742
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,640
Do you think they...

743
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,360
First you need to determine

744
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,880
how much they're acting.

745
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,480
But I feel

746
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,160
Ren Yinpeng's smile just now was very genuine.

747
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,160
I think we're at zero.

748
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,200
No,

749
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,520
we should have just drawn that...

750
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,480
That what?

751
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,360
Big zero.

752
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,960
If it's big zero, we can actually reveal it.

753
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,080
That's true.

754
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,360
Go ahead and reveal, I trust you.

755
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,040
How much?

756
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,960
5

757
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Unknown.

758
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,920
No,

759
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,600
Hold on,

760
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,400
If it turns out negative,

761
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,520
or the maximum is zero,

762
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,920
you can still win.

763
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,160
I don't know how many there are,

764
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,520
but you need to believe in yourselves.

765
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
There's the "Dragon's Move",

766
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:57,960
right?

767
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,080
"Dragon's Move", come on!

768
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,600
"Dragon's Move"!

769
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Brothers,

770
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,240
what do you say?

771
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,240
Are you feeling it, Dragon?

772
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,440
Dragon, feel it, Dragon!

773
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Dragon's feeling!

774
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,080
Dragon's feeling!

775
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,440
Dragon's feeling!

776
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,160
Feel the failure!

777
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,840
Dragon's misdiagnosis!

778
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,360
Dragon's misdiagnosis!

779
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Alright, everyone

780
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,360
Clinic Room 2 is at Dragon's

781
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,960
In case of misdiagnosis

782
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,160
Admit

783
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,920
Professional

784
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,120
Everyone, are you feeling a bit more awake now?

785
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,240
Ask yourself.

786
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,400
Will this be edited in?

787
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,920
Wait a moment, observe their microexpressions.

788
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,520
Something feels off

789
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,480
Let's go

790
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,640
Minus 2

791
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,320
0

792
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,720
0

793
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,320
1

794
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,480
3

795
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,800
This game looks really fun from a spectator's perspective

796
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,560
Right?

797
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,520
Then let's begin

798
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,120
Let's start

799
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,600
Start—failed

800
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Congratulations to Clinic 3

801
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,280
Three misdiagnoses in total

802
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,520
10

803
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,080
If we call 10

804
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,240
We still win

805
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,120
Or something like that

806
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,680
15

807
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,920
Go

808
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,480
Fell into the trap

809
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
Alright, let's give a round of applause

810
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
To Clinic 1

811
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,720
For securing first place in this assessment

812
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,680
Anchor Point

813
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,040
Anchor Point

814
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,400
The third round of assessment is about to begin

815
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,560
The third round of assessment is about to begin

816
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,840
I'll now flip the medicine cards

817
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,320
I'll flip

818
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,480
Love Grass

819
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,280
Medicine Box Organization Challenge

820
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,560
Should we form an alliance?

821
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,480
Are we targeting Hao Yang?

822
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,920
Either way.

823
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,320
To betray the two people closest to me...

824
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,320
I like this feeling.

825
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Alliance.

826
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,360
Alright, everyone.

827
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,920
Let's follow the order we drew.

828
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,240
Arrange them left to right, okay?

829
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,960
Okay.

830
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,760
I think the first one...

831
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,720
should be versatile.

832
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,120
Right.

833
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,000
This spot isn't ideal.

834
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,440
How about here?

835
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,920
If we place it there, will it block us?

836
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,160
Or if you want to secure a path...

837
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,080
go this way.

838
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,200
This way.

839
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,800
We can claim both 2-point spots.

840
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,360
They'll all be ours.

841
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Just focus...

842
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,600
on the lower levels?

843
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,040
Lower floors are the easiest points to take.

844
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,880
This side is 2.

845
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,120
This side is 3.

846
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,000
Two, three.

847
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,960
Smart, genius.

848
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,760
Genius, place it.

849
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,720
No problem.

850
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,720
Got 2 points at once.

851
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,080
I think we should find a chance.

852
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,960
To block this yellow.

853
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,720
Prevent it from coming over.

854
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,120
We just need to.

855
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,200
Keep them all out over there.

856
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,560
For example, place it here.

857
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,080
But block them completely.

858
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,600
They can't get through.

859
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,120
We can't score either.

860
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,840
We can score.

861
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,800
It doesn't need to reach the height limit.

862
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,880
It just needs to be visible from top to bottom.

863
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,840
Then we can score.

864
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,640
This side is all ours.

865
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,480
If the green ones.

866
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,360
Monopolize all the high floors.

867
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,720
Once we can't get through.

868
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,440
If green blocks that side.

869
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,760
Even if they don't build to 9 layers.

870
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,840
They still get 7 points.

871
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,440
No problem, we'll go this way.

872
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,120
Because this side is all ours.

873
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,320
Actually, I kind of want to.

874
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,240
Build one more path.

875
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,080
Because I think.

876
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,440
We're in a bit of danger now.

877
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,360
Kind of surrounded.

878
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,360
But if we don't place it.

879
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,960
We'll definitely lose those 2 points.

880
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,000
Just place it like this, Huang Kai.

881
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Get 2 points.

882
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,240
Just like this.

883
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,280
Okay.

884
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,240
Take it first.

885
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,280
Then we'll look for height limits.

886
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,240
Got another point.

887
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,560
Seems a bit tricky now.

888
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,320
Zifan

889
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,720
Can we go this way?

890
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,800
Don't block us.

891
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,600
We won't block you, don't worry.

892
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,320
We'll just mind our own path.

893
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,120
We won't interfere with others.

894
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,280
So we're forming an alliance now?

895
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,480
I feel like we can't match their height.

896
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,520
They'll cover us completely.

897
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,280
You know what?

898
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
We should claim first.

899
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,000
Because like this,

900
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,080
we currently have many fronts.

901
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,720
We need to score first.

902
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,960
But if you only secure 1 point,

903
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,840
it definitely won't be enough.

904
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,680
Second.

905
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,320
Maybe we should do this.

906
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,240
But I'm afraid we'll become the base.

907
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,120
You know?

908
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,840
Let's move this way next.

909
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,480
Right.

910
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,720
We just need to focus on this side now.

911
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes.

912
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,560
Just don't let blue and green come over.

913
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,160
Right.

914
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,080
Then we need to place a height limit here.

915
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,440
I want to place it here.

916
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,040
Like this.

917
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,600
This way we can already

918
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,840
secure 8 points.

919
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,720
That's it.

920
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,240
But they have quite a lot of green here.

921
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,160
Let blue contain them.

922
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,960
Then we...

923
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,120
Let's do it this way, okay?

924
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,040
Okay.

925
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,280
The key to this game

926
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,480
is to find ways to convert others' colors

927
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,760
into your own.

928
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,200
Look at our current situation.

929
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,440
I think we should claim red

930
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,680
as ours first.

931
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,360
Place it.

932
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,560
Okay, no problem.

933
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,200
I think maybe we should do it like this

934
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,080
This way we'll secure our position

935
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,800
The one in the middle

936
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,320
Okay

937
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,080
Right? Try to block them off

938
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,400
Now all we need to do

939
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,160
is fill these two 5s completely

940
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,400
Right

941
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,040
And separate this blue side

942
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,360
Block off this area

943
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,800
Yes

944
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,520
Let's keep one of these

945
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,640
Save it for the final move

946
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,200
Then place it in the 8-9 area

947
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,920
This way we'll gain four more

948
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,720
We just need to prevent

949
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,600
it from moving outward

950
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,520
Yellow is so passive

951
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,200
Yeah

952
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,640
Can only get out through this

953
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,000
Let's go then

954
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,520
With a piece like this

955
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,720
We can gain 2 more points this way

956
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,880
Then we're in a bit of danger now

957
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,560
You've already been blocked

958
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,840
No, we still have one way out

959
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,880
You're completely blocked

960
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,600
Isn't this blocking everything?

961
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,080
Feels like there's nowhere left to place

962
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,600
Feels like we've lost

963
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
We might end up with a negative score

964
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,720
Let's secure a solid win first

965
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:14,960
Right

966
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,680
Let's use these to develop first

967
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,240
Wait until they've used up their pieces

968
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,120
Then we'll cover

969
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,440
Okay

970
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,200
Place it right here

971
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:20,960
That's 4 points

972
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,120
Yes, that works

973
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,760
Let's place one more

974
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,320
One last struggle

975
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,480
We're done for

976
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Let's just place it here

977
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,200
Alright

978
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,120
Okay

979
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,000
This is the height limit for 4, right?

980
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,960
To prevent them from building a bridge.

981
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,800
Actually, we just need to do this.

982
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,040
Green has a pretty good chance now.

983
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,760
They have seven.

984
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,120
We might have to block them at the end.

985
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,360
Let's do this - blue seems excessive.

986
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,680
Should we block blue?

987
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,760
Blue is ours.

988
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,000
Block green.

989
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,920
Now there's one problem.

990
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,320
Their red is dominating.

991
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,720
Because they have so many at the bottom.

992
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,880
No one is blocking them.

993
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,360
Let's claim this spot first.

994
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,480
Just grab one first.

995
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,960
Otherwise we'll be stuck.

996
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,400
This side already has height restrictions.

997
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,080
So we can only block.

998
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,640
Already.

999
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,040
This is 6.

1000
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,040
Also height-limited.

1001
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,000
They're coming over.

1002
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,960
None of these can be used now?

1003
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,640
These four pieces of theirs.

1004
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,240
We definitely can't cover them all.

1005
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,840
Placing those four there was brilliant.

1006
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,680
Then there's a two.

1007
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,320
We have a two.

1008
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,000
I think we should use this one.

1009
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,200
This doesn't seem useful later anyway.

1010
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,040
Then place it here.

1011
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,520
They placed it here.

1012
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,760
If placed here, it's hard for us to build.

1013
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Like this.

1014
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,160
Okay.

1015
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,280
Need to target red.

1016
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,280
Blue is also a bit (excessive).

1017
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,120
But now green is a bit scarce.

1018
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,360
If I place it here.

1019
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,640
They'll have trouble.

1020
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,680
Their red is floating.

1021
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,960
Just depends what blocks they have.

1022
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:18,960
Place it here.

1023
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:23,440
Okay

1024
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,680
We need to protect this side

1025
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,800
Alright, let's place it like this for now

1026
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,720
Like this

1027
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,120
Yes, that works

1028
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,880
Place it

1029
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,920
Just stick it like this and we can go

1030
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,800
Put it right here

1031
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,440
This protects our own position

1032
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,320
Can't go up, you need a 2

1033
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,840
Connected

1034
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,120
How do we proceed?

1035
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,200
I just figured it out earlier

1036
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,600
Just keep trying and you'll get it

1037
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,200
Keep trying and it'll work out

1038
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,360
We can go this way

1039
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,920
You're a genius

1040
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,200
Come on, one last move

1041
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,000
Okay

1042
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,520
Or this move

1043
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,720
This is a sure win

1044
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,800
Good

1045
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,200
Like this

1046
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,160
Genius

1047
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,480
Finished placing them?

1048
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,040
Genius

1049
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,200
Alright, let me tally things up, guys

1050
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,600
Anchor point

1051
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,280
Come

1052
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,120
We'll now begin our fourth round of assessment

1053
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,400
The medicine card I'll flip this time is

1054
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,880
Danshen

1055
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,200
Danshen

1056
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Finally got it

1057
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,920
What is Danshen?

1058
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,200
A highly sought-after medicinal ointment

1059
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,760
Come on

1060
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,160
Come on, brothers

1061
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,200
Rock paper scissors

1062
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,440
Then

1063
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,920
Clinic 3, 1

1064
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,160
Clinic 4, 2

1065
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,400
3, 4

1066
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:03,880
No problem, right?

1067
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,840
No problem

1068
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,600
Let's go

1069
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,640
Start

1070
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,640
Flip the cards

1071
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,280
Color 2 starts bidding

1072
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,560
Yuan

1073
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,480
Yuan

1074
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,680
Yuan

1075
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,480
Okay

1076
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,080
But we have final pricing authority, right?

1077
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,760
You can only bid higher than 5 yuan

1078
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,520
So

1079
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,720
You don't have that much

1080
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,360
All in, bro?

1081
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,400
It's that high

1082
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,520
It can count as any color

1083
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,520
Keep raising

1084
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:30,960
Continue

1085
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,640
This is 10, 10 doesn't bust

1086
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,320
We'll take it

1087
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,960
Come

1088
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,760
Come on, let's start bidding

1089
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,160
How much?

1090
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,040
Straight to 5

1091
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,440
Three is actually slightly better than two

1092
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,600
Bidding successful

1093
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,960
Come on, please flip your cards

1094
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,000
Continue?

1095
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,040
Let's take it back

1096
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,680
If it bursts, it's just 3 dollars

1097
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,440
You can participate in subsequent auctions

1098
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,080
But if you want to buy 8 again

1099
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,920
You must provide 8 trade coins

1100
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,000
Do you want to open?

1101
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,960
Open

1102
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,360
We bid 0

1103
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,000
There's no way to go higher than 0

1104
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,560
How much?

1105
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,440
Dollars

1106
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,080
We can still bid

1107
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,240
They can still bid too

1108
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,200
Want it?

1109
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,800
We'll take it

1110
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,520
Dollars

1111
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,160
Units

1112
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,400
I bid

1113
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,760
No, they'll take it

1114
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,040
We can take this one

1115
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,080
Come on, continue

1116
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,560
Burst

1117
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,360
Give me 3 dollars

1118
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,840
No problem, boss

1119
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,800
This is the public card pile

1120
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,120
I'll display it here

1121
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,000
Everyone, who has money to buy?

1122
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
After drawing cards without bursting

1123
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,800
You can buy from me anytime

1124
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,560
Okay

1125
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:35,880
Come on

1126
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,560
Draw one first

1127
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,920
Let's go

1128
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,880
Here we go

1129
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,640
Continue

1130
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,120
Go ahead

1131
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:44,960
Okay

1132
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,320
That makes seven

1133
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,880
They've already

1134
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,160
Retrieve the number cards

1135
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,400
Others get 2 coins

1136
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,560
Take back

1137
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,440
Retrieve the number cards

1138
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,920
Give me the offset card

1139
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,320
This one gets destroyed

1140
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,600
Tactical lean back

1141
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,560
One person gets two coins

1142
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,600
We've reached 10 coins

1143
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,520
Come on, start flipping

1144
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,240
Ready?

1145
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:08,960
Flip

1146
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:09,840
Continue?

1147
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,760
Continue

1148
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,560
Bidding

1149
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,600
How many?

1150
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,320
We bid two

1151
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:15,880
Do you want it?

1152
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,640
Three

1153
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,320
Zero

1154
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,040
None

1155
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,280
Okay, goes to three

1156
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
Rainbow 6 goes to him

1157
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,480
Were we too hasty on the first move?

1158
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,720
The probability is actually quite low

1159
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,640
probability

1160
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,320
No more gambling

1161
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,880
Stay steady

1162
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,960
Here, please draw a card.

1163
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,080
1

1164
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,400
-2

1165
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,240
-2

1166
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,600
2

1167
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,640
Draw again?

1168
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,080
You still have 8 points left.

1169
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Can still draw.

1170
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,520
If we say...

1171
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,280
Retract the number cards.

1172
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,160
Every other clinic gets 3 trade coins.

1173
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,040
We want to draw.

1174
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,800
If we bust...

1175
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,080
What happens to us?

1176
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,880
We get 3 coins.

1177
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,640
They get nothing.

1178
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,640
Okay, got it.

1179
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,120
Draw again.

1180
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,040
Go all out.

1181
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,440
Still can draw.

1182
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,880
Can draw once more.

1183
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,080
He's still going strong.

1184
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,000
Crazy

1185
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,440
Should we go all out or

1186
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:17,840
We need cards

1187
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,400
Cards in hand can stack infinitely

1188
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,200
Cards in hand can stack infinitely

1189
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,920
No problem

1190
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,160
The key is they each get 5 coins

1191
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,280
So what

1192
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,600
Red 1, 2, 6

1193
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,600
And a rainbow 4

1194
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,600
So it's good

1195
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,240
Yes, let's get it back

1196
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,280
Come on, payday

1197
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,320
Here's 5 for you

1198
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,040
(Already have) 7, can only give you 3

1199
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,920
This is all the money left

1200
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,840
Don't use money to buy 1, 2, 3

1201
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,240
Draw

1202
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,160
One more offset coin and you'll bust.

1203
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,880
Then let's go.

1204
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,760
So now it's zero.

1205
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,120
We can start over.

1206
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:54,960
Okay.

1207
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,800
Right?

1208
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,600
Busted.

1209
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,840
Offset coins busted.

1210
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,920
Give it to me too.

1211
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,640
The coins should have gone to

1212
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,360
but you're full

1213
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,080
No giving

1214
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,600
Come on, flip your cards

1215
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,920
Want to draw more?

1216
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,400
Draw

1217
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,320
Draw

1218
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,920
Colorful 9 up for auction

1219
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,720
Let's go

1220
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,200
One

1221
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,680
How much you got?

1222
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,080
We're broke

1223
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,760
Nothing

1224
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,160
You guys

1225
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,920
One

1226
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,040
One

1227
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,800
One

1228
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,600
Okay

1229
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,880
Might as well buy

1230
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,400
He just bid 9 and keeps raising

1231
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,200
Auction starts

1232
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,040
One

1233
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,320
Ours now

1234
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,240
Come on, keep drawing?

1235
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,000
Draw

1236
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,200
Busted

1237
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,040
Here's 3 for you

1238
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,560
I think this is profitable

1239
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,320
Come on

1240
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,800
Offset coins

1241
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,920
Offset coins

1242
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,360
Rainbow 5 up for auction

1243
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,080
Rainbow 5

1244
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,680
We need to spend one, two, three, four, five, six

1245
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,520
coins

1246
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,080
We need seven

1247
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:49,800
What do you need it for?

1248
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,800
You already have five

1249
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,800
Let me think

1250
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,400
Think about it

1251
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:54,800
Trust me

1252
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,880
Take this, seriously

1253
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,360
Come on

1254
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,680
Take Rainbow 5 back

1255
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,520
You need to consider

1256
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,200
They might use these two offset cards

1257
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,400
to release many coins

1258
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,400
Keep drawing then

1259
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,440
Three

1260
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,960
Okay, I think that's enough

1261
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,600
Take the money first

1262
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,960
Now it's our turn

1263
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,560
Your turn now

1264
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,120
5

1265
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,040
#

1266
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,120
Let's begin the auction

1267
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,760
Piece

1268
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,240
Piece

1269
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,200
One, okay

1270
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,400
Alright, keep drawing

1271
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,640
It's a bust

1272
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,840
Here's 3 for you

1273
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,440
Obtained 3 gold coins

1274
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,600
4

1275
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:43,960
3

1276
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,200
Keep it

1277
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:45,640
Keep it

1278
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,280
Keep it

1279
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,440
There you go

1280
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,080
We want 5

1281
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,600
Your 5 is useless here

1282
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,960
Four cards make a bomb

1283
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,320
We must have this

1284
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,120
We can lock the other cards

1285
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:58,760
Come on

1286
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:00,640
Very good

1287
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,600
This is the one

1288
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,480
And 2356

1289
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,640
We're missing a 4

1290
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,640
Your call

1291
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,720
Draw

1292
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,800
6

1293
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,600
Alright, bust. Give it to me.

1294
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,120
We'll spend this.

1295
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,720
We'll buy a 7.

1296
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,680
First, these cards.

1297
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,560
Put the green ones back.

1298
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,840
Then put in the money.

1299
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,160
Here, the red 7 is yours.

1300
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,760
And for the bust earlier,

1301
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,600
here are your 3 coins.

1302
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:34,880
Take them.

1303
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,280
Okay, thanks.

1304
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:39,680
Here.

1305
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,320
1

1306
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,200
Good card.

1307
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,480
3

1308
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,000
Good.

1309
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,320
Exactly 10.

1310
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,640
What a lucky draw.

1311
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,800
Take it.

1312
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,360
Let me draw once.

1313
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,080
You draw.

1314
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,600
Hao's attempt.

1315
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,080
6

1316
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,640
Nice.

1317
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,920
Keep or bust?

1318
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,440
Keep.

1319
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,120
Keep.

1320
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:02,880
Here, continue.

1321
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,960
Wait, we'll buy a card.

1322
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,080
We'll buy that one.

1323
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,360
How much?

1324
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:05,920
4

1325
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:06,960
Okay.

1326
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,400
Start drawing.

1327
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:11,840
2

1328
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,440
I'll definitely take it.

1329
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,560
But I don't think I'll bust.

1330
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,680
I can't possibly get a 9, right?

1331
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,200
9

1332
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,240
Busted, folks.

1333
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,880
Give it to me.

1334
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,000
I couldn't have gotten a 9.

1335
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,040
"Dragon."

1336
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,120
Here.

1337
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:28,920
Still okay.

1338
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:36,680
You

1339
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:38,920
Okay

1340
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,120
2

1341
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,560
Keep drawing

1342
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,440
Busted, come on

1343
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,960
Take the money

1344
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:46,760
2

1345
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,600
Alright

1346
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,000
Got it

1347
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,560
Got it, then we'll buy again

1348
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,680
We'll buy 6

1349
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,040
Our hand is very strong

1350
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,640
They're already full

1351
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,760
Can I ask about the game progress?

1352
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,440
The game progress is this much left.

1353
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,240
Draw them all.

1354
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,200
Come on.

1355
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Please auction

1356
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,680
Piece

1357
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,400
Not buying

1358
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:21,800
Won't buy

1359
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,240
Don't want

1360
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,280
Come on, auction Rainbow 8

1361
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:24,840
Piece

1362
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,640
Piece

1363
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,160
Rainbow 8 is yours to keep

1364
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,720
We want money

1365
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,960
You're a genius

1366
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,000
Good luck

1367
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,360
Genius

1368
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,240
Why can't we get the offset cards?

1369
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,160
We want brown 2 and 3

1370
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,280
Must have

1371
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,240
We want to buy cards

1372
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:46,920
Buy what?

1373
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,360
Brown (coffee) 9

1374
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,160
We'll buy that 9

1375
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,120
Okay

1376
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,240
Piece plus a 5

1377
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,080
Why do you want the brown 9?

1378
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,320
Sorry about that

1379
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:55,840
We want to block you

1380
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,960
Because we like it

1381
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,560
Why are you blocking us?

1382
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,240
They have a 9

1383
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,200
They have the #9

1384
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,880
They could still draw an 8

1385
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,960
Too late now

1386
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,120
Honestly feels a bit irrational

1387
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,480
Take back the 6

1388
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,080
Then I'll buy a 4

1389
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,520
Auction

1390
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,280
They must be rich

1391
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,640
How much do you have?

1392
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,280
Yuan

1393
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,480
Yuan

1394
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,520
We'll definitely raise

1395
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,040
A few yuan won't cut it

1396
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,360
They want to stop them

1397
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,840
Just the two of us are already at war

1398
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,040
Come on, give me 2 coins

1399
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,840
Red #

1400
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
We'll take 4

1401
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:39,880
Rainbow #

1402
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,320
The legendary wildcard, brothers

1403
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,440
Cards, we have 7

1404
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,600
Then we'll take 8

1405
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,200
Rainbow 1

1406
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:45,680
Yuan

1407
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,480
Yuan

1408
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,120
Alright, no problem

1409
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,600
Everyone, be careful

1410
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,600
This might be the last round

1411
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,400
There will be no more cards left

1412
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,320
Draw a card

1413
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,560
3

1414
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,840
Coming

1415
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,640
Got it. We want to buy cards.

1416
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,120
Give us blue 2 and 3.

1417
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,160
Explode once

1418
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:25,760
Explode once

1419
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,560
What if it could be offset coins

1420
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,160
Possibly

1421
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,920
Didn't bet right

1422
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,920
We should buy green 2 and 3

1423
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,680
8

1424
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,960
We'll keep this 8

1425
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,160
Then use money to buy a red 1

1426
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,200
Actually I'm not

1427
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,200
I want to draw

1428
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,480
Because there are four left

1429
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,800
There will be a brown 1

1430
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,160
I don't want them to get it

1431
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,640
Take it?

1432
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,480
Wait a moment

1433
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,280
Calculate cards

1434
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,840
Calculate now

1435
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,400
We need to

1436
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,840
Then buy a red 1

1437
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,040
Red 1

1438
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:03,840
5

1439
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,280
Should we?

1440
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,880
Let's think

1441
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,800
Because I think it's just 1 point

1442
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:09,800
You know

1443
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,840
It's just one more

1444
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:11,880
Just 1 more point

1445
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,880
I still think so

1446
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,240
Mainly I'm afraid of exploding

1447
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,840
Exploding would just lose 1 point

1448
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,280
Draw a card?

1449
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,920
Dragon's move

1450
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,080
Take

1451
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,800
Take

1452
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,400
They took

1453
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,400
Wrap it up

1454
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,040
Want to buy cards?

1455
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:31,400
Buy

1456
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,880
Buy

1457
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,760
Buy a two

1458
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,480
Our worst fear came true

1459
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,920
We can still draw cards

1460
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,640
No cards left

1461
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,520
Anchor point

1462
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:55,600
Anchor point

1463
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,560
Alright

1464
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,560
After completing this episode's four rounds of assessments

1465
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,200
Our four clinics have respectively obtained

1466
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,640
what percentage of brain power scores?

1467
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,320
Now, Long's speech

1468
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,320
Long's speech

1469
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,240
Long's speech

1470
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:14,920
Mainly it's

1471
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,360
that Brother Wei Xiao Long performed well

1472
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,640
and then helped me along

1473
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,160
I'm just very fortunate

1474
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,520
Overcoming fear and growing

1475
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,240
I think is a relatively important point

1476
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,400
Because actually it was during that

1477
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,920
reversi game

1478
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,080
Facing the "Chess Saint," I was truly

1479
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,480
"Chess Saint"

1480
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,440
Let's not talk about it anymore

1481
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,760
Next we will proceed with

1482
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,560
this episode's most solemn ceremony

1483
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,120
which is the acting hall leader appointment ceremony

1484
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,880
Clinic two, please stand up

1485
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,920
Why are you standing up?

1486
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,080
I thought we were supposed to stand and applaud them.

1487
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,400
They stood up too.

1488
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,920
Let's leave.

1489
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,400
Congratulations, Wei Xiaolong.

1490
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,640
On becoming acting hall leader for the first time.

1491
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,400
Hou Zhuocheng

1492
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Second successful defense as acting hall leader

1493
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,800
Come, congratulations to both of you

1494
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,560
Then let's move outside

1495
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,440
Prepare for the mental enhancement service

1496
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,360
Here we go

1497
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,920
This is oral cleaning

1498
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,160
That's facial cleaning

1499
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,920
So we need to dip this, right?

1500
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,920
Alright, go ahead and dip it

1501
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,120
Put some effort in, scoop more

1502
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,880
Come on, I'll count down from three and we'll go together

1503
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,960
Ten-second countdown starts now

1504
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,960
Three, two, one, go!

1505
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:53,960
Put some muscle into it

1506
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,280
Timing

1507
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,800
End

1508
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,640
So funny

1509
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,240
Looks like all the teeth are gone

1510
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:08,680
Yes

1511
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,000
There's just nothing left

1512
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,920
No teeth, just empty

1513
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,440
Smile for everyone, one two three

1514
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,920
Next,

1515
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,920
we will begin our facial cleansing service.

1516
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,680
Both sides will send their first contestant

1517
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,960
for the value-added service.

1518
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,640
Okay.

1519
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,480
Alright, Brother Yang Zongyu is up.

1520
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,560
Great!

1521
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,080
Go for it!

1522
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,400
A warm welcome!

1523
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,920
Keep it up!

1524
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,480
Step back.

1525
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,080
I think you should step back further.

1526
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,640
No, just don't spray towards us.

1527
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,160
He's about to—step back.

1528
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,880
Then face off.

1529
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,720
Can't be sure.

1530
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,600
Come on.

1531
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:11,920
A little.

1532
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,960
He's step by step

1533
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:16,840
approaching us.

1534
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,600
Fake move.

1535
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,240
It's fine as long as it doesn't spray.

1536
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,680
No more bubbles.

1537
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,480
So our Yang Zongyu

1538
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,880
has successfully completed the value-added service.

1539
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,840
Let's give him some encouragement.

1540
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,720
Okay, get ready.

1541
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,240
Maybe I should go with Brother Huang Kai.

1542
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,240
Okay, you can go with Brother Huang Kai.

1543
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,240
Ready, three.

1544
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,720
Two.

1545
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,840
One, begin.

1546
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:53,960
It's not spraying anymore

1547
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,920
Why isn't it working?

1548
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:55,680
The Qi is gone

1549
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,320
He's out of Qi

1550
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,400
He's used up all his Qi

1551
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,800
It doesn't feel like it's washing the face

1552
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,000
This isn't

1553
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,680
We need to use this to wash them again

1554
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,400
You have to do it like this

1555
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,600
Kaikai, you need to press the thumb

1556
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,400
Hold it down

1557
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,400
They're just enjoying the drama without a care.

1558
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,040
Here, take this.

1559
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:16,680
There's no breath left.

1560
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,480
Alright, let's have a toast

1561
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,360
Cheers

1562
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:27,880
Bottoms up

1563
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,520
Congratulations to you both

1564
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,960
Upgrade successful

1565
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,040
Today's value-added service

1566
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,120
comes to an end here

1567
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,040
Looking forward to seeing more exciting

1568
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,960
more mind-blowing and spectacular battles from everyone

1569
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,720
Wishing our two acting hall masters

1570
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,680
will bring more

1571
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,520
future and hope to the Brainstorming Hall

1572
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,480
May everyone's future

1573
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,800
be vibrant and full of unlimited potential

1574
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,240
Now our show "Let's Start Brainstorming"

1575
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,840
must bid farewell to everyone

1576
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,680
Come on

1577
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,080
Let's Start Brainstorming

1578
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,960
Goodbye

1579
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:58,160
Goodbye

1580
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:58,440
Anchor point

1581
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:58,600
One-Bag Grandmaster

1582
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,680
One-Bag Grandmaster

1583
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,920
Everyone can pair up

1584
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,680
and give it a try

1585
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,440
Begin

1586
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,160
Correct answer

1587
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,000
I haven't seen those words clearly yet

1588
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,600
Everyone, please return

1589
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:13,960
Go back

1590
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,400
Please return

1591
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,400
We don't need to play anymore

1592
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,480
Hit backward

1593
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,120
Charge forward - behind, behind!

1594
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:20,880
Go straight, go straight

1595
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,920
Behind

1596
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,600
Right

1597
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:24,600
My hammer

1598
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,120
Backward

1599
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,080
Broken again

1600
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,080
Which direction exactly?

1601
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,240
I'm so tired

1602
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,200
I think I'm a failed commander

1603
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,880
We accept mental enhancement

1604
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,280
Alright everyone

1605
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:35,880
Let's begin

1606
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:36,840
Just this one then

1607
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,080
Go

1608
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,520
Eat it, the red one

1609
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,120
What if it's black?

1610
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,280
Is this black?

1611
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:47,640
Yes

1612
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,360
Then let it eat

1613
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,400
Eat directly

1614
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,160
Black

1615
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,280
Then you win

1616
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:55,880
Let me think

1617
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,000
I'll start figuring it out now

1618
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,200
Eat one

1619
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,600
You only lose after eating four

1620
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,600
We seem to have no choice now
