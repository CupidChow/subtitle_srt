1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,240
Do whatever feels comfortable for you

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,600
Nothing feels comfortable

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,840
None of it feels quite right

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,080
What solo dance?

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,240
What kind of solo is this?

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,560
I remember the moves

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,920
But how to keep up with the rhythm

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,880
Let me take a look

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
One, two

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,520
He's got an ahoge too

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,680
Gotta have that sneaky vibe

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,280
This long?

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,800
Your turn

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,320
Embarrassing

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,920
Couldn't deliver the flowers

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,600
Sit

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
Thanks

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,240
Not for you to sit on

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
This is pretty cool

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,800
Just the last two left

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,640
Why were they gone when I tried to get them earlier?

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,400
I'll bring more tomorrow then

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,640
That won't work

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,040
Let me "apologize with a kiss"

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,720
Dilraba

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,360
Dilraba at your service

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,520
Are you tired?

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm fine, master

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
I'm not your master

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm fine, master

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,920
Is it dyed?

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,560
No, it's a wig.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Does wearing a wig hurt?

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,560
It's okay, just a little.

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
Mine hurts a bit.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
Where are your things?

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,160
I gave them to him.

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,760
One, two, three.

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,360
First, greet them.

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,080
Turn it sideways.

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,840
Lean forward.

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,240
Straighten up.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,440
Left, up, back, front.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,120
After finishing that,

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
there are four more moves.

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,200
Okay, go ahead.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Do whatever feels comfortable.

48
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
No, nothing's comfortable.

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,960
None of it feels good.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,920
Okay

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
What are they like?

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,400
They're all just...

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
each their own (different)

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:29,920
Right

55
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
Okay

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,520
One, two, three

57
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,320
This is the first take

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,600
Four

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,720
One, two

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,480
Three is this

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Three is this one

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,720
Okay

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
Do we all dance the same way?

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,680
Each person is different.

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,560
Solo dance

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,600
What solo dance?

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,800
What kind of solo dance is this?

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
I can't do this

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,520
I can't dance

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,760
Come on, try it again

71
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,600
The simpler, the better

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
I thought someone was ahead

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,920
I can follow along and learn

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
Alright, I've memorized the moves.

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,440
Two two three four

76
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,640
Five six seven

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Five six seven eight

78
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Two two three four five six seven eight

79
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,920
Two two three

80
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,720
What is this thing?

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,760
I've memorized the moves.

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,040
Why is your beard all white?

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Why?

84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,520
He's even got a cowlick.

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,240
How did this happen?

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
It's just for style.

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,800
Just like yours.

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
You're already this tall.

89
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,000
Wearing such thick shoes.

90
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,840
Your heels are so high

91
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,320
They're naturally high

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
How did this happen

93
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,000
So nervous

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,120
Which one of them is it today

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,200
If it's not him, then it's me

96
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Today it's you

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,480
Let me tell you

98
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Today it's definitely you

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,200
No way

100
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,800
It's you

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,320
It can't be her

102
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,040
Why

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm pregnant

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
You need to learn this

105
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Look at them, like this

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Look

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,800
This can be learned.

108
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,720
When did you join

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,240
I can't hold back anymore, I...

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,920
I can't help but want to join in.

111
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,360
Don't make me "die of laughter"

112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
You need to have a sense of stealth

113
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,080
One by one, they actually joined just like that

114
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,440
So funny

115
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
Really hilarious

116
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,040
Why make it so awkward?

117
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,120
Who?

118
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,080
Solo dance

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,440
I'll dance solo

120
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,640
Help! Someone save me

121
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,760
Oh god, someone help me

122
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,760
Is it this long?

123
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,600
Your turn.

124
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,920
You're so good at this.

125
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,400
You really can do it.

126
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,400
And then?

127
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,520
You really can.

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,480
Okay.

129
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,560
Come on, girls move forward.

130
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Girls forward.

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Teacher Bai, move forward a bit.

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,040
Teacher Bai counts as a girl.

133
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,840
Girls move forward.

134
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,240
You count as a girl.

135
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,240
Alright, alright.

136
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,360
Just please.

137
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,520
What do you mean?

138
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,160
Please.

139
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,040
Let me check, I'll check your moves.

140
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Let me learn it again.

141
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm sweating buckets.

142
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,880
Get in the zone

143
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Get in the zone

144
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,240
What kind of state?

145
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,800
We'll need two more takes

146
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,760
Meaning

147
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,400
We'll need two more takes

148
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,960
Let's do one more proper recording

149
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
Here we go

150
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,400
Keep up

151
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
Thank you

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,440
Let's do the middle part again.

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,320
Let's do the middle part again.

154
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,680
The circular section.

155
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Let me tell you.

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,320
I'll do it again.

157
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,480
My movements will be different.

158
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
It doesn't matter.

159
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
This one works better.

160
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,960
It's just like filming.

161
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
We don't need to worry about the music.

162
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Just everyone.

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,600
Don't mind the music.

164
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,160
Don't mind the music.

165
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,720
Okay, okay, okay.

166
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,400
Without music, it's even more awkward.

167
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,520
Let's just go.

168
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,360
Come on, who's first?

169
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Seriously, let's just go.

170
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,640
Let me see.

171
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,560
Who was first just now?

172
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,040
I was here just now.

173
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,880
Brother Bai.

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm here.

175
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Let's see how the white beard dances.

176
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,960
Make it look sneaky.

177
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,400
Come on.

178
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,160
Don't laugh.

179
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,400
Keep your expression blank.

180
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,640
Like a robot.

181
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,480
It has to be super serious.

182
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,600
Take a lap first

183
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
What do you mean?

184
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
We need to walk a lap

185
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,240
Here

186
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,720
He will

187
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,760
come

188
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,240
Xiao He is here, he doesn't know anything

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,040
He doesn't feel any vibration at all

190
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,800
This robot is so nimble!

191
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
That's enough

192
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,360
You got electrocuted, you robot

193
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,440
Xiao He, stop dancing

194
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,760
Don't dance anymore

195
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,920
You have no rhythm at all

196
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,560
At least everyone pauses a bit

197
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,960
You don't even pause at all

198
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,520
Don't all guys shake a little?

199
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Exactly

200
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
How do you shake?

201
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,000
Like this

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,680
Yeah, you're shaking a lot like that

203
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
There needs to be a pause here.

204
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
You don't have any at all.

205
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
You need to walk inside.

206
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,200
When will you come out?

207
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,360
Do we need to plug it in?

208
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,760
Hello, how are you?

209
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,640
Do we need to plug it in?

210
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,480
There's a power adapter here.

211
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,600
Let's go in.

212
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,720
It's fine, you go first.

213
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
I'll wait for you to speak first.

214
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,880
What do you mean wait for me to speak first?

215
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,200
He should speak first.

216
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,120
Yes, let the director speak first.

217
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,000
The two of us must protect him with our lives today.

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,720
Okay.

219
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,560
I feel like he's definitely "dead" today.

220
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
He's "doomed."

221
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,480
Just protect me with your lives.

222
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,760
He's "doomed."

223
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,720
Don't worry.

224
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,640
Disinfection machine.

225
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,800
Hello.

226
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
My name is

227
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,080
Dilraba.

228
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,520
Machine.

229
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,000
Tired?

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,680
Tired.

231
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,120
Then I'll keep you company.

232
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,800
Okay.

233
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,280
Disinfection machine

234
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,760
Should I stand here?

235
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,240
Or maybe here?

236
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
I forgot

237
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,360
I'll try both spots

238
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,800
June 20th

239
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,840
99 tickets sold

240
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,760
A 15.11% increase from yesterday

241
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,360
Good

242
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,520
Hello

243
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,720
Disinfection machine

244
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm pregnant, don't touch me

245
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,000
Hello, you seem to be malfunctioning.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,960
Do you need repairs?

247
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,200
Go in.

248
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Hey everyone, pay attention.

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,040
I've seen you play the "White Scumbag" role.

250
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,120
You're mistaken.

251
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,240
You've got the wrong person.

252
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
What nonsense are you saying?

253
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
"Such a scumbag."

254
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:10,880
"Total scumbag."

255
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,880
Are you two a team?

256
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,400
We've been a team since this morning.

257
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
We're investigators.

258
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,400
With such a strong investigative team,

259
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,520
the culprit must be

260
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,000
shivering in fear today.

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,120
How should the culprit choose?

262
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,720
Both of you are quite strong.

263
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,160
About you saying I'm strong,

264
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm a bit unconvinced.

265
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm a bit dissatisfied.

266
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
What are you holding?

267
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm holding my

268
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,120
X's mission.

269
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,560
It's me.

270
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,400
It's you.

271
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,440
It's you what?

272
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,200
It's this person beside me.

273
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,640
The nursing robot's prop.

274
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,680
What's wrong?

275
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,560
Aba.

276
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,920
There seems to have been an explosion over there just now.

277
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,520
That's right.

278
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
Go, hurry up and leave.

279
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,720
Aba.

280
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,800
You didn't manage to give these flowers away.

281
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,520
Embarrassing.

282
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,560
The flowers weren't delivered.

283
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,960
Haha, let's go.

284
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,920
Let's go.

285
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,760
I received flowers.

286
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,440
So tragic.

287
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,120
Only receiving flowers after already being pregnant.

288
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,920
A bit late.

289
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,560
Because we're all wearing this kind of

290
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,880
You know, that kind of

291
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,560
windbreaker.

292
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Mine can even be unzipped.

293
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,680
Yes.

294
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
We can all remove this, right?

295
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,200
Did you just discover this feature?

296
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
So satisfying

297
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,280
Hi everyone, I'm Xiao Ning

298
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,920
So here we are

299
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,880
Wishing everyone a Happy New Year

300
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,360
Alright then

301
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,960
Okay

302
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,440
We've been preparing for the Spring Festival Gala

303
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,920
Great great great

304
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,160
Amazing, absolutely unbeatable

305
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,120
This is awkward

306
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,080
This New Year's Eve show

307
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,160
Good good good

308
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,840
That's New Year's for you

309
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
We'll have dancing at this year's Spring Festival Gala

310
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
I need to recharge

311
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
I really can't go on

312
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,600
Alright

313
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
This year's Spring Festival Gala requires us

314
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,360
To perform a show

315
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,160
Let me tell you

316
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,480
You're drinking soda again

317
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,440
What's wrong with her?

318
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,440
Tell me

319
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,920
Has she been secretly eating other things?

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You...

321
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,280
You're getting thinner and thinner

322
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,800
It's not good for the child

323
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,400
Or you take care of the child

324
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,960
Hurry up, let's go

325
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,680
When you heard this news

326
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,440
Were you sad?

327
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
I knew long ago

328
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,800
Who told you?

329
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,320
No one told me

330
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,280
How did you know if no one told you?

331
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,880
Why do you eat it every day?

332
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,960
You're losing weight

333
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,000
This is really...

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,560
I said I'm talented

335
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,520
One, two, three

336
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,760
This is already in other fashion circles

337
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm still doing this

338
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
I still don't understand

339
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,960
How to do it?

340
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,760
You haven't danced enough, film one separately

341
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,160
Like this

342
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
I'll film again tomorrow

343
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,280
Give me likes

344
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,080
I'll repost yours

345
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,240
Repost

346
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,880
I'll film a duet-style video with you

347
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,160
Wow, your legs are really long

348
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Because when you position them like this

349
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,680
They go past this line of yours

350
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
Maybe it's because you're slouching

351
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
When I position my legs like this

352
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
They only reach here

353
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,600
Is there any special meaning to this?

354
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,840
Yes, it's just that your legs are long

355
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,320
Yes, I know

356
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,880
Today you'll...

357
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,120
What's wrong?

358
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,880
Are you using force?

359
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,160
He's not wearing glasses today.

360
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,520
I've sharpened my vision today.

361
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,280
Xiao Ba, who will you choose as your X today?

362
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,200
Who was it today again?

363
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,760
Didn't even take them seriously.

364
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,200
Strongest lineup - two detectives.

365
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,280
Who would you choose?

366
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,160
The two smartest people in our group.

367
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,440
You changed your perfume again.

368
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,120
Smells nice.

369
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,400
It's you, right?

370
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,720
What's this about?

371
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,880
It's me.

372
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,320
Admitted it.

373
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,560
Then who is your X?

374
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,840
You should tell us too.

375
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,960
I think we should choose you as X.

376
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Why choose me?

377
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,520
Because Bai is a natural accomplice.

378
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,720
Natural accomplice.

379
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,880
What nonsense are you saying?

380
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,120
He'll never guess right.

381
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,160
Will you use that move again today?

382
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,480
Pin it on one person.

383
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Then create chaos.

384
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,960
Of course I will.

385
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,600
That's my style.

386
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,480
Sit for a while

387
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,760
Don't sit there

388
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,040
It's not for you

389
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
Then who is it for?

390
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,320
Let's go

391
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,760
Okay

392
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
Can I bring this wheelchair?

393
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
No problem, take it.

394
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,880
Push her.

395
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,640
Push her along.

396
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,960
Okay, here you go.

397
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,920
This feels great!

398
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,920
There's someone else over there.

399
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,080
We need to push them back.

400
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,880
Why don't you stand up and go investigate?

401
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,680
There are too many people.

402
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,560
I can't squeeze through.

403
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm too weak.

404
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Let you in.

405
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,720
Don't.

406
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,800
Come.

407
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,440
Stop.

408
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,320
Okay.

409
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,600
It's fine.

410
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,720
We have another officer over there.

411
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
It's nothing. There's nothing here.

412
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,880
This isn't

413
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,640
Let's go take a look.

414
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
Okay, okay, okay.

415
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
Wow, so refreshing

416
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,520
Sis

417
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,240
What is this

418
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
Okay

419
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,800
Thank you

420
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,760
What is this

421
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,000
My wheelchair

422
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,440
I never expected you to be so

423
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,520
You can't possibly

424
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
The B before your eyes isn't B

425
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,560
Hurry up and get up already

426
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,720
Sit

427
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,680
Thank you

428
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,320
Thanks

429
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,440
What are you thanking me for?

430
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,240
You didn’t get caught by us,

431
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,120
and then let me sit, right?

432
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,040
What did you catch me doing?

433
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,720
I was planning to quietly push it over and sit myself,

434
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,360
but then I noticed you all turned around.

435
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,560
Wouldn’t it be rude not to offer it to you?

436
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,800
Right now, huh?

437
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,600
Where's my board?

438
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's under my butt.

439
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,560
Sorry about that.

440
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,240
Thank you.

441
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,560
My apologies.

442
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,880
It's already warmed up.

443
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
Who are you voting for?

444
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,440
I haven't decided yet.

445
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,200
Anyway, I won't vote for you.

446
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,600
Are you X?

447
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,920
I am, you can tell at a glance.

448
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,400
You're X, right?

449
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,320
You're protecting him well.

450
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,760
I really am not.

451
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,160
No, why do you think it's us two?

452
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,840
Who knows?

453
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,000
Even if it really were me,

454
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,440
I wouldn't be stupid enough to choose him.

455
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,320
This round,

456
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,920
Why?

457
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,360
Why is it always us two for two rounds?

458
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,040
I don't know then.

459
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,320
You two worked well together last round.

460
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,920
So this time you'd choose him.

461
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,440
The messages you two just sent,

462
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,800
were about this, right?

463
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Let's play one more winning round.

464
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,240
Listen, Xiao Jin,

465
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,720
you're really the most suspicious today.

466
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,600
In my opinion.

467
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,480
The only reason I'm not voting for you

468
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,200
is that when it's revealed,

469
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,000
you'll see how foolish you were.

470
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,840
Yes, okay.

471
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,400
That's the voting done.

472
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
Voting's over.

473
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,320
We've all been fooled.

474
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,480
Fooled by who?

475
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,280
Fooled by me.

476
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,320
Not fooled by you.

477
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
We've both been fooled.

478
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,320
You've both been fooled.

479
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,160
Exactly.

480
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,680
Who fooled you two?

481
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,640
Who else is left here?

482
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
Who else could fool us?

483
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,560
That's so cool

484
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,120
Did you vote right, what do you think?

485
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,000
I voted correctly

486
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,520
Really?

487
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
You voted for me

488
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,640
None of your business who I voted for

489
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,800
Anyway, I voted right

490
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,040
We'll find out soon anyway

491
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,720
Right

492
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,200
I voted for whoever you voted for

493
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,720
So who did you vote for?

494
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,160
Stop asking who I voted for

495
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,440
Alright alright

496
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,920
Who else could she vote for?

497
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,120
Fine fine

498
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,080
This is the main point

499
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,920
Among you three with your love-hate relationship

500
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,040
One of them

501
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,320
Could it be that Xiao Jin did this

502
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,040
To make me leave this relationship

503
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,760
By playing some tricks?

504
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,920
Oh my

505
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,160
Really?

506
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,120
That can't be right

507
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
Classmate Xiao Jin

508
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,120
What are you guys doing?

509
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,680
What are you two conspiring about?

510
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
Have you finished voting?

511
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,400
Already voted.

512
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,440
I've already cast my vote.

513
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,040
Done voting, finished long ago.

514
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,480
Yeah.

515
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,640
You played this round well anyway.

516
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,880
When have I ever played poorly?

517
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,520
Alright alright, fine.

518
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,400
Good thing I didn't trust you lightly.

519
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,160
Lucky I didn't believe you too easily.

520
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,600
Just the last two left.

521
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,120
Why did you...

522
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,520
They were already gone when I tried to get some this afternoon.

523
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,120
This stuff was restocked in the afternoon.

524
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,760
Because that box was finished.

525
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,120
So I got another box.

526
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,520
Now this box is finished too.

527
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:43,840
Right.

528
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,080
Is this box really that small?

529
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,680
Haven't I been sharing with everyone?

530
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,720
At that time, they were gone.

531
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,000
How many pieces in this box? So few?

532
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,800
There should only be 20-30 pieces total.

533
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,360
I only ate two pieces.

534
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,320
I'll bring more tomorrow.

535
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,800
This stuff is really energizing.

536
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,040
Not strong enough.

537
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,440
Not potent enough.

538
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,800
Needs to be cooler.

539
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,360
Your mental state seems great.

540
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,400
Young

541
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,640
Just because you stayed up late yesterday

542
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,680
doesn't mean you can slack off today

543
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,360
I wasn't slacking off

544
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,440
Alright, alright

545
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,800
I really did my best

546
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,280
Fine, fine

547
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
Do you still not believe me?

548
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
I'm not X

549
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,040
I believe

550
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,040
Believe what?

551
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,280
I said I'm not X today

552
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,520
The killer didn't solve problem X today

553
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,080
Because I believe you're not X

554
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,400
I ultimately voted for Jin

555
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
Why did you vote for Jin?

556
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
Because I believed you

557
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,920
I thought neither of us was X

558
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,640
So I chose her

559
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,320
Then you should have followed my vote, man

560
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,560
How was I supposed to know who you'd vote for?

561
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,240
I told you I was voting for him

562
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,680
I just think...

563
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,840
To be honest, your identity to me...

564
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,560
You still don't trust me, do you?

565
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,160
I trust you a little

566
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,040
That's why I ultimately voted for Jin

567
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,360
No

568
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,160
He believes you're not X

569
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,000
Right

570
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,040
Then I could only suspect her

571
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,960
Because she played so well in previous rounds

572
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,120
That episode with Xiao Ning...

573
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,320
It's because I couldn't solve the problem.

574
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,040
I really couldn't solve it.

575
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,280
Couldn't solve the problem.

576
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,920
Right.

577
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,600
But it wasn't difficult. The problem wasn't hard.

578
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,920
What was your problem?

579
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
Spot the differences.

580
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,480
I couldn't solve it either.

581
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
Spot the differences today...

582
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah.

583
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
You couldn't solve it?

584
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,960
Nope.

585
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,400
Find five differences.

586
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,320
I found four.

587
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,120
One short.

588
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,600
Couldn't solve it.

589
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Alright, alright.

590
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Today you...

591
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,200
No...

592
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,640
Listen...

593
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
From today onward...

594
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,040
If you choose me today...

595
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,680
then let's never meet again.

596
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,000
Why?

597
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,360
You're so ungrateful, I'm telling you.

598
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,920
Then what should we do?

599
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,560
Who did you choose in the end?

600
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,400
What about you?

601
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,680
You lost.

602
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,440
I lost.

603
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,360
Right.

604
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,560
Why?

605
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,320
He insisted the culprit was you.

606
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,560
So you didn't choose me.

607
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,720
We all chose you.

608
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,360
All chose me?

609
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,920
Yes.

610
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
I lost.

611
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Who did you choose?

612
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,320
You, like I said.

613
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,800
You're already one of us now

614
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,760
the arch-villain

615
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,280
How can I prove myself?

616
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,480
You can't prove yourself

617
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,760
Let me "apologize with a kiss"

618
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,400
"I'll apologize with a kiss"

619
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
You're saying this in front of the pillow

620
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,240
How could you say such things

621
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,280
Aren't you taking this pillow with you?

622
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,120
I am taking it.

623
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,080
Not bad, Xiao He.

624
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,200
You've grown.

625
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,920
What do you mean?

626
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,560
Aren't you the killer?

627
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,480
You voted for me.

628
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,000
You voted for me.

629
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,040
Unbelievable.

630
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,880
Are you going to hit the back of my head?

631
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,480
If it really is you...

632
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,720
You didn’t escape.

633
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,600
Who’s the killer today?

634
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,640
Just hit the back of his head.

635
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,440
Alright?

636
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,200
Let’s each take one.

637
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Exactly four.

638
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,480
There aren’t four.

639
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,360
There are.

640
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,240
There are so many handsome guys and beautiful girls here.

641
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
Hit follow so you won't get lost.

642
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,320
This streamer will take you on the fast track.

643
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,160
Those two green gems of yours...

644
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,120
look like what my grandma used to wear.

645
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
What green gems?

646
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,400
Watch your words, I'm warning you.

647
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,680
How come your clothes can glow?

648
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Won't this run out of power in a day?

649
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,800
Because I...

650
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,280
am the real detective.

651
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,680
Then you don't need to play.

652
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,480
What's left to play then?

653
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,600
No need to play anymore, we've already won.

654
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,400
Today's X...

655
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,960
is most likely among the civilians.

656
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
He wants to change this world.

657
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,880
He even wants to change...

658
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,920
the rules of our show's game.

659
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Everything exists only in his illusion.

660
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
The killer...

661
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,160
could never be me now.

662
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
I said it wasn't me, yet he keeps voting for me.

663
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,080
This carries over to this season.

664
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,560
He still holds a grudge against me.

665
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,080
Always thinking I'm suspicious.

666
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,000
Want some?

667
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,800
Isn't this wafer cookies?

668
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,760
Yeah.

669
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,800
Why do you have these?

670
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,560
I want to have one.

671
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,480
Can you give me one?

672
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
I found them.

673
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,800
Are we the door gods now?

674
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,120
Door gods - not bad.
