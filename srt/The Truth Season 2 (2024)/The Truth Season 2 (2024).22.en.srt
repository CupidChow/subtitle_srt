1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,580
6 AM on Sunday

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,980
A sudden loud bang echoed through the skating rink

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,660
There was a person

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,740
Birdman

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,980
Person wearing a bird-head mask

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,980
Person wearing a beak mask

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,300
was found dead in the warehouse

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,140
The Birdman has left

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,540
Investigations revealed

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,780
all six were actually missing relatives of each other

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,020
Elder cousin

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,260
Elder brother

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,020
Dad

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,660
Good son

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,420
We finally meet

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,740
Good son

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,420
Yes, so we're father and daughter

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,100
Yes, that means we're father and daughter

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,580
Father

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,580
Just me and his younger cousin

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,300
Turns out my girlfriend was

22
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,700
This is bad

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,740
So we're all family

24
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,900
We're family

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,500
And the deceased was also their remembered relative

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,580
Dad

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,500
Sis

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,340
Eldest brother

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Second brother

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,740
Third brother

31
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,340
Nephew

32
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,820
These six were already trapped in a looping world

33
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,820
The investigation discovered

34
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,020
they were actually in a parallel world called "Town Push"

35
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,540
After the obsessed ones began the ritual

36
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,620
All those who disappeared

37
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,140
under mysterious circumstances

38
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,580
would enter "Town Push"

39
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,100
So where we are now is

40
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,580
"Town Push"

41
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,740
Infinite loops, multiple timelines

42
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,780
Place the five elemental items

43
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,900
(metal, wood, water, fire, earth)

44
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,980
respectively in

45
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,740
five corresponding locations

46
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,220
within the rink's cabinet compartments

47
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,660
As the Five Elements formation activates,

48
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,820
countless mysteries will be unraveled one by one.

49
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,500
It fell.

50
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,500
It fell.

51
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,620
The roof.

52
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,940
What is this thing?

53
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,300
Please proceed to the Golden Vault first

54
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,540
After retrieving the item from the Golden Vault

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,380
a prompt for the next vault will appear

56
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
and so on

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,580
Proceed to the Golden Vault

58
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,980
Golden Vault

59
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,940
Here we go again, dear teachers

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,340
Wait a minute

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,940
Heaven and earth, hear my plea

62
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,300
Back off, back off

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,380
Someone's coming out

64
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,140
Who's coming out?

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,140
I don't know

66
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,420
Where is someone coming out?

67
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Who's touching me?

68
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,820
Who's touching me?

69
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,020
Someone's grabbing me

70
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,980
Don't scare me

71
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,740
Who

72
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,860
They're with me

73
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,380
Who's taking pictures of me

74
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,900
Who's taking pictures of me

75
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,100
Who touched me

76
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,980
Don't scare me

77
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,780
Who

78
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,460
Someone's grabbing me

79
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,660
What are you doing?

80
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,740
Who

81
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,740
Brother Xun is

82
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,460
Let me tell you

83
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,340
Listen to me, here's how it is

84
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,500
Just say "Who dares touch me?"

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,460
I'll give them a right hook

86
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,340
Then they won't dare lay a finger on you

87
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,180
Has the golden cabinet door opened?

88
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,500
Golden cabinet

89
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,340
It's open

90
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,540
There's text below

91
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,940
Wood

92
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,860
After metal comes wood

93
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,180
We shouldn't have left this place

94
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,180
The wood is with me

95
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,940
How do I get over there?

96
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,060
Why are you coming over?

97
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,580
I thought the metal cabinet door opened

98
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,780
Go

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,060
Actually, everyone should stay at their own post

100
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,940
That would be best

101
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,300
Right, you should be the one to open it

102
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,020
Correct

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,020
That's why I said earlier

104
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,620
Why did we have to restore this place?

105
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,460
It was to prevent us from

106
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,220
tripping over things, I'm telling you

107
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,620
The door opened

108
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,020
What's inside?

109
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,300
Dirt

110
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,660
Dirt, over here

111
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,900
Under the dirt

112
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,540
But it's impossible to see clearly

113
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,340
Who is this?

114
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,220
Me

115
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:10,820
Who is this?

116
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,140
Me

117
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,580
What are you doing?

118
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,380
I can't see.

119
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,540
Why are you pinching me, Zhang Linghe?

120
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,780
I didn't pinch you.

121
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,660
Don't move.

122
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,740
Who's this?

123
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,580
Me. Stop pinching me.

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,500
Brother Wang, how come you

125
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,700
aren't afraid of anything?

126
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,580
Don't scare me

127
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,900
Who?

128
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,500
Let me tell you about this unlucky guy

129
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,940
Bai Yu

130
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,740
The one who can make this sound

131
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,780
must be Bai

132
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Okay, I found it

133
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,900
It's open

134
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,780
What?

135
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,900
Water

136
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,780
The water's with me

137
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,140
I was just in that corner

138
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,580
I've been exceptionally brave since childhood

139
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,420
Let me tell you

140
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,260
You're so brave

141
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,900
Yet you've been clutching my clothes the whole time

142
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,860
Sorry

143
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,780
We're here

144
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,860
Fire

145
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,660
This is my spot

146
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,060
Let's go

147
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,980
Teachers, please lead the way

148
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,580
Thank you all

149
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,740
The fire is over here, too far away.

150
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,140
Did you find it?

151
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,460
Keep going forward.

152
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
It's in this corner.

153
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,540
It's open

154
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,260
There's nothing here

155
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,380
That's terrifying

156
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,180
Which one of you

157
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,620
Is it Sis Li

158
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,580
Is it you

159
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,500
That's terrifying

160
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,780
Don't scare me, I'm really frightened

161
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,060
Then there's nothing in here

162
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,420
After taking the item from the golden cabinet

163
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,260
a hint for the next cabinet will appear

164
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,420
and so on

165
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,660
Golden Cabinet

166
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,140
There's writing at the bottom

167
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,540
Wait, the sound went off

168
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,260
Brother Xun, you are Brother Xun, right?

169
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,380
Protect my dad

170
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,780
Come

171
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,540
Dad

172
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,740
Okay, okay

173
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,140
Alright, don't worry

174
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,220
What is this?

175
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,820
There was nothing inside just now.

176
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,580
Whose clothes are these?

177
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,540
This is clearly a woman's sweater.

178
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,620
There's a box like this.

179
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,900
It must be useful.

180
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,820
Incense.

181
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,020
Incense.

182
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,700
What does this mean?

183
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,100
Whose clothes?

184
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,700
In every compartment,

185
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,140
there are two pieces of clothing.

186
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,660
Really?

187
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,420
You felt all of them?

188
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,180
Is that true?

189
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,580
Yes.

190
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,500
There's this here.

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,260
Is this where the incense goes?

192
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,580
The soil is here.

193
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,940
There's also paper inside.

194
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,380
Place the incense burner

195
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,900
at the skating rink's front desk.

196
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,380
Right now

197
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,820
After lighting this incense

198
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,020
we can return to Tui Town

199
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,100
for two hours.

200
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,740
We were wearing these exact clothes

201
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,620
when we drowned.

202
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,380
We vanished right on the boat.

203
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,260
Possibly...

204
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,780
We need to change into these clothes.

205
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,340
Which outfit came from which cabinet?

206
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,740
We must wear them accordingly.

207
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,100
You've laid them all out.

208
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,260
Why are they mixed up?

209
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,180
Hurry, hurry!

210
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,940
This is one set.

211
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,540
Come on, come on.

212
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,660
This is from my cabinet.

213
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Who represents Metal?

214
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,100
Who represents Wood?

215
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,020
Who represents Fire?

216
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,900
Just arrange them properly.

217
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,620
I represent Earth.

218
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,260
This is Fire.

219
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,060
This belongs to Fire.

220
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,460
This is Fire's.

221
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,100
How do I wear two pairs of pants?

222
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,900
Just wrap them around yourself.

223
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,500
Take all the hangers

224
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,380
Hang them up

225
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Give me all the hangers

226
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,060
You can't take the hangers, bro

227
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,740
Didn't you say

228
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,700
You came in as a shopping guide

229
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,700
Dear teachers

230
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,980
I'm lighting it up

231
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,020
We're launching

232
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,100
Launch

233
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,980
You order

234
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,380
Coming

235
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,980
Go ahead and order

236
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,740
I knew it.

237
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,500
It's okay

238
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,020
Wait a moment

239
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,180
It's fine

240
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,580
Now the space is shifting

241
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,820
We can go to the warehouse

242
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,620
Hurry

243
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,180
Watch out

244
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,700
There's a rope

245
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,340
It's not open

246
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,900
Switching now, it should be...

247
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,660
Success

248
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,020
Welcome to Tui Town

249
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,860
The TV is gone.

250
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,060
Where did the DVD go?

251
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,180
This gun is here

252
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,020
See?

253
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,740
This one's already set up

254
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,780
There's paper inside, more paper

255
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,620
Steel ball mechanism

256
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,180
Due to this device's tremendous impact force

257
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
It carries certain risks

258
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,260
Once it hits a person

259
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,420
It can cause severe injuries

260
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,500
Damaging internal organs

261
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,620
Even causing massive bleeding

262
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,540
This shot of his

263
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,220
Went straight through here

264
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,300
And came out the other side

265
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,020
Right?

266
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,060
Normally, would there be bullets?

267
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,940
Steel balls

268
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,980
Killed by steel balls

269
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,700
What's this? Just a thread, right?

270
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,500
You can see it at a glance.

271
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,540
This technique of his...

272
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,820
Isn't the stone right here?

273
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,100
What technique?

274
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,260
What technique?

275
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,060
Isn't it obvious?

276
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,380
They were originally one piece.

277
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,060
Right.

278
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,500
That's how it is

279
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
DVD

280
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,580
They were originally one piece

281
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,980
Once the DVD popped out, it gave it to this stone

282
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,860
That's right

283
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:09,860
Killer

284
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,860
Assassin

285
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,820
It's me

286
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,100
He was killed by this

287
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,180
Look

288
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,780
He didn't have a TV here, right?

289
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,180
If I were the victim, I'd walk in

290
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,900
Why would I see a gun

291
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,980
And still sit here

292
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
So as I was saying,

293
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,380
why we needed to restore this place

294
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,220
was to ensure that we

295
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
don't trip over it.

296
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,780
The killer first set up in Tui Town

297
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,180
arranged everything there

298
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,220
then returned to "Zhen Tui"

299
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,540
At "Zhen Tui," prepared the room

300
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,180
with similar arrangements

301
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,420
Right

302
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,300
At 6 o'clock

303
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,620
had him go to "Zhen Tui" to watch TV

304
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,780
Then at the very end

305
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,500
just as the DVD was about to eject

306
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,980
a slight push (incense candle) immediately - bang

307
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,820
transmitted to Tui Town

308
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,420
bang - shot dead instantly

309
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,580
Got it?

310
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,100
Do you understand now?

311
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,140
You two detectives

312
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,060
Right now, we've only...

313
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
managed to reconstruct the crime process.

314
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,460
How could you not even think of this?

315
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,220
You were so sharp in the previous rounds.

316
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,820
Why look at him?

317
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
No

318
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,940
Right now

319
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,860
What should we do next?

320
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,380
Keep searching

321
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,540
What else is here?

322
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,700
Wait a moment

323
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,460
What's this?

324
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,380
Tui Manghuo Import-Export Company

325
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,500
Layout renovation plan

326
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,980
Tui Manghuo Administration Building B

327
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,900
This has been renovated

328
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,420
There must still be space

329
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,820
Enter through the main gate, then the reception

330
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,700
Then there's an abandoned office here

331
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,020
There's a door there

332
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,060
We can go there

333
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,020
Exactly

334
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,740
Let's go

335
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Cut it

336
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,940
The lights are about to change again

337
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,700
Come on, guys

338
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,580
The lights are changing

339
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,260
My hands are shaking

340
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,060
It's switching again

341
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,620
It's about to change

342
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,500
Alright

343
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,180
The door's open

344
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,460
Let's go out now

345
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,460
Is this the place where

346
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,740
our incident occurred? The trading company?

347
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,380
Yes

348
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,940
We're back at the "Town Push"

349
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,460
The company reception, here

350
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,420
This mirror

351
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,260
Show eight teeth

352
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,300
Smile for me

353
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,180
The door opened

354
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,060
Abandoned office

355
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,860
This symbol is here

356
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,220
When I saw

357
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,740
that exact symbol just now

358
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,660
it was like flipping a switch

359
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,420
all my memories came flooding back

360
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,780
Abandoned office

361
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,340
This is a notice. This notice.

362
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,860
The ill-fated vessel No. 4444

363
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,820
Missing vessel investigation report

364
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,180
The ill-fated vessel

365
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,220
Investigation report on the disappearance of vessel No. 4444

366
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
Vessel No. 4444

367
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,380
The lower section has been blacked out

368
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,500
It's already covered

369
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,460
Over an 8-year period, vessel No. 4444

370
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,740
experienced two disappearance incidents in total

371
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,820
The first disappearance occurred on

372
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,180
February 3, 1980

373
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,820
at 10 PM on Sunday night

374
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,860
The second disappearance occurred

375
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,060
late at night on February 7, 1988

376
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,420
Let us pray

377
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,140
for those who disappeared during these 8 years

378
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,020
Mr. Wang, Mr. He

379
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,060
Mr. Tuo, Mr. Tuo

380
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,180
Mr. Tuo, Mr. Bai

381
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,460
Mr. A, Mr. B

382
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Mr. C, Mr. Tuo

383
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,300
Mr. Tuo, Mr. Tuo

384
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,140
May Mr. Tuo and Mr. Ke return safely

385
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,740
We also extend our condolences

386
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,140
to the families of Mr. Ba, Mr. Ba

387
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,300
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li

388
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,620
and Mr. Ning

389
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,420
They still cannot accept

390
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,900
the fact of their loved ones' disappearance

391
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,780
We hope they can find peace

392
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,740
There's another line at the bottom

393
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,260
Since you've already seen this

394
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,740
you must begin the ritual immediately

395
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,460
I must hurry now

396
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,620
Wait a minute

397
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,380
Also to the families of the missing

398
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,540
Let's sort this out first

399
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,740
Let's line up like this

400
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,900
I disappeared

401
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,980
He disappeared

402
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,180
Mr. Bai disappeared

403
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,780
Mr. Ke disappeared

404
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,460
You're among the missing

405
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,420
Right

406
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,060
And you're family members of the missing

407
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,100
Mr. Ba, Mr. Ning

408
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,060
These two are family members of the missing

409
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,140
The four of us disappeared

410
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,500
There are so many marbles here

411
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,900
The deceased's marbles

412
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,060
So many clothes

413
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,740
He lives here

414
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,180
How pitiful

415
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Yes

416
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,740
There's more

417
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,380
What's this? Here

418
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,180
This is our

419
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,780
family tree

420
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,460
Family tree, right

421
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,780
White Hair and Ning Guigeng had Bai Mai

422
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,380
Right

423
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,340
So we're actually related

424
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,660
Hedada and Captain Ning

425
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,940
had He Kefu

426
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,260
Ning Guixing had Kelidu and

427
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,820
Captain Ning

428
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,180
We're brothers

429
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,380
Wang Juanwang is

430
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,700
Wang Chuanshuo, child of Pink Phoenix

431
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,180
I'm Pink Phoenix's child

432
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,540
After marrying Ba Baliu

433
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,380
they had Sister Ba

434
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,260
You're her daughter

435
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,620
Right

436
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,340
Ba Di

437
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,260
Now everything connects

438
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,460
Then it's all correct

439
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
Also,

440
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,060
When an obsessed person enters Zhen Tui,

441
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,100
they forget their obsession,

442
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,420
and the people related to that obsession.

443
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,900
Only by seeing Zhen Tui's landmark

444
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,180
can they recall their obsession,

445
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,300
but they can't remember

446
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,100
the appearance or name of important people.

447
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,980
When missing persons enter Zhen Tui,

448
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,900
their memories

449
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,300
are affected by the magnetic field,

450
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,900
making them forget

451
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,100
the appearance and names of important people.

452
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,220
Some even experience time distortion,

453
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,100
with memories before and after entering Zhen Tui

454
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,180
becoming unclear.

455
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
My current time

456
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,740
is the same as yours -

457
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
1988.

458
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,620
But when I say "last week,"

459
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,860
it's 1980, right?

460
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,340
So I remember last week

461
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,940
being 1980,

462
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,380
which means the 8 years in between

463
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,700
disappeared within this one week.

464
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,500
Those 8 years you remember don't exist.

465
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,460
Yes, those 8 years are gone.

466
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,540
Why is that?

467
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
Special circumstances.

468
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,100
Missing persons who disappeared together

469
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,260
can remember each other.

470
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,740
Why is it that we strangers

471
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,620
are acting like one happy family?

472
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,020
And now we've encountered this situation today...

473
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,180
Our memories weren't erased,

474
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,620
and neither were his.

475
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,740
He's my neighbor's child,

476
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,180
I remember that.

477
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,700
You two know each other,

478
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,260
and we

479
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,700
share a common past.

480
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,100
This means if we see Zhen Tui's landmark,

481
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,700
within 24 hours

482
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,940
we'll recall all memories from the loop period.

483
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
We'll remember everything in 24 hours.

484
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,580
The killer must have already been here,

485
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,380
right?

486
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,660
Missing family members Ba and Ning,

487
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,860
so one of you two...

488
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,260
Kill Brother

489
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,060
Back to the skating rink

490
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,180
I want to go back to Tui Town

491
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,380
Come on, hurry

492
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,300
Time to identify the culprit, friends

493
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,500
Let's start deducing

494
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,980
Let me take another look at that

495
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,180
The Lost Embrace Plan

496
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,300
Whose bag is this?

497
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,980
This isn't Tony's. It's Tony's.

498
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,100
Paper ball

499
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,540
Drugged

500
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,220
Drugged

501
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,300
Drugging Plan

502
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,940
Earlier was this Drugging Plan

503
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
It was Xiao Ba's plan

504
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,580
My plan

505
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,060
Follow, drug, kidnap

506
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,940
What happened 8 years ago ends here

507
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,460
I must end all of this

508
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,380
This is also why Xiao Ba is

509
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,620
using these 28 days

510
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,060
The one behind this

511
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,500
is the person he's looking for

512
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,900
Written here

513
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,180
is the reply to him

514
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,860
About the incident 8 years ago - with a question mark

515
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,780
It must be

516
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,300
that matter I've never been able to let go

517
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,180
The hooded man should be

518
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,420
General Manager Bei Guo

519
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,660
The hooded man we were looking for 8 years ago

520
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,700
You want to find the hooded man

521
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,300
Find the hooded man

522
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,940
The hooded man is Bei Guo.

523
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,660
Looking for Bei Guo.

524
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Back then, you were the one looking for Bei Guo.

525
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,060
Back then, you were the one looking for Bei Guo.

526
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,900
Yes.

527
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,180
I suspected it was him.

528
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,460
To avenge his younger brother.

529
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,340
So he pushed my son...

530
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,220
off the lighthouse.

531
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,940
Who else is looking for Bei Guo?

532
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,340
Me.

533
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,420
She's looking for Bei Guo.

534
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,860
It might be that man.

535
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,260
He tampered with this ship.

536
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,380
That's why my father disappeared.

537
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,180
I absolutely must...

538
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,940
find this person.

539
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,220
Find the man in the leather jacket.

540
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,660
Right.

541
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:12,900
No.

542
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,140
Why is Bei Guo the hooded man?

543
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,580
No.

544
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,900
From this person's account...

545
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,100
in their words...

546
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,700
the information they revealed...

547
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,580
The hooded one is him, it's Ba Di.

548
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,500
There is

549
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,820
There's more

550
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,820
This

551
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,340
Let's see what

552
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,220
This was written by the younger brother, right?

553
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,700
He said to first cover the face with a hood

554
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,100
That way you won't be recognized

555
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,700
No, everyone uses hoods

556
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,660
I've used them too

557
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,020
Back in our day

558
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,780
Not me, my father

559
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,980
My father used them too

560
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,460
Wang Esq. said

561
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Wang Esq. said when he killed Master Le

562
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,900
He also used that

563
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,900
This thing

564
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,540
is a tradition passed down in our circle

565
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:02,980
Yes

566
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,620
Must be used when doing bad things

567
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,380
The ancestral hood

568
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,340
An heirloom, must be used for misdeeds

569
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,220
Otherwise, who would

570
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,820
be connected to what happened eight years ago

571
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,260
Could it be because I discovered

572
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,740
his murder from eight years ago

573
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,620
that he's been looking for chances

574
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,620
to silence me

575
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,020
That's why he's been following me

576
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,740
He wants to know

577
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,620
if I have evidence against him

578
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,340
What a despicable person

579
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,620
I only have 20 days left

580
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,420
This brief time

581
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,900
I want to spend

582
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,620
with my family properly

583
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,940
Both of them came from Tui Town

584
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,620
I must not let him interfere with my plan

585
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,980
We can use the overlapping space

586
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,780
Kill him

587
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,420
So the black text and red text

588
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:44,980
aren’t from the same person

589
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,780
aren’t from the same person

590
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,260
The black text should be from the younger brother

591
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,900
The black text was written first

592
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,340
Right

593
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,540
The red text was written later

594
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:50,980
Right

595
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,460
Right?

596
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,780
Right

597
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
The red text saw this person

598
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,460
and uncovered the black text’s plan

599
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:54,700
Right

600
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,940
Then prepared to eliminate the black text person

601
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,180
Right

602
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,460
Right?

603
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,980
So the red text was likely written by the killer

604
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,460
Right

605
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,100
Then the person who wrote the black text

606
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,780
must be Xiao Ba

607
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,140
Xiao Ba

608
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,660
Xiao Ba has a kidnapping plan

609
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:03,820
Right

610
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,140
Right?

611
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,180
Who does he want to kidnap?

612
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,740
Right

613
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,540
The person he wants to take

614
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,820
He has someone he wants to take away

615
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,140
Right

616
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,620
Right?

617
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,060
The person who wants to take someone away

618
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,020
is someone with an obsession.

619
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,660
He came here

620
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,420
to settle something from eight years ago.

621
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,220
Right.

622
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,820
Look, among us,

623
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,260
some were brought here against their will,

624
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,740
and some came voluntarily.

625
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,580
Exactly.

626
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,780
First, we can rule out

627
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:26,980
me.

628
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Explain your reasoning.

629
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,940
Don't just rule yourself out immediately.

630
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,660
Because I went missing.

631
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,780
I was summoned here.

632
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,980
I was brought here against my will.

633
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,220
Didn't it say earlier

634
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,180
that some people here went missing?

635
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,620
Who went missing?

636
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,940
I did.

637
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,500
Yes, you did.

638
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,100
I went missing too.

639
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,860
Who else went missing?

640
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,860
I did.

641
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,260
Wait, who else?

642
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,780
Me.

643
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,740
Anyone else?

644
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,180
No one.

645
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,740
Who didn't go missing then?

646
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,220
So it's between the two of them?

647
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,540
Absolutely.

648
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,340
Clearer than our deductions.

649
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,460
Let's sort this out.

650
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Now it's very clear.

651
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,100
From what we can see, the deceased is Xiao Ba.

652
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
That is, my son.

653
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,300
Then he (Xiao Ba) came here.

654
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,500
To find someone.

655
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,580
This person.

656
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,540
is connected to something that happened 8 years ago.

657
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:13,940
They're connected.

658
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,300
There's a connection.

659
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,660
This person.

660
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,100
is someone very important to him.

661
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,260
He wanted to take this person away.

662
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,620
Yes.

663
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,580
But this person didn't want to leave.

664
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,260
This person refused to go.

665
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,860
So he had a plan to drug them.

666
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,900
After drugging this person.

667
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,620
Right, to take them back.

668
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,100
He wore a mask himself.

669
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,820
Then took them along.

670
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,660
For the summoning ritual.

671
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:28,900
Correct.

672
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,500
Then they both left.

673
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,900
Yes.

674
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,380
That's what happened.

675
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,220
Right.

676
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,260
But the killer found out about this.

677
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,220
Either.

678
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,020
he didn't want Xiao Ba to do this.

679
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,180
Or he simply.

680
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,420
didn't want this person to leave.

681
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,540
But it's also possible.

682
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,260
the killer wanted to kill Xiao Ba.

683
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,180
This point about Xiao Ba is important I think.

684
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,380
Let's read this part again.

685
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,420
"I know you're preparing for the ritual."

686
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,780
"After entering the 'Town Push' with you."

687
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,220
"He came in with this person."

688
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,540
"So this ritual."

689
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,620
wasn't performed by Xiao Ba."

690
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:56,980
"Xiao Ba."

691
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,540
"was within 50 meters of him."

692
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,260
"After entering the 'Town Push' with you."

693
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,980
"my memories will disappear too."

694
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,140
"Though there's no time to record all this."

695
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,820
This was.

696
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,780
written by Xiao Ba before coming here.

697
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,140
Because once you enter here.

698
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,460
your memories disappear.

699
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,780
But as long as I remember to enter "Town Push"

700
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,060
I must go search for that symbol

701
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,140
Recover your memories as soon as possible.

702
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,460
So after Xiao Ba came to "Zhentui,"

703
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,380
the first thing he did

704
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,780
was to look for that symbol.

705
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,540
Then I could definitely find you.

706
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,100
Your traits are easy to recognize.

707
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,220
Professional habits

708
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,020
also affect some daily habits.

709
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,580
And being nitpicky—

710
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,740
Nitpicky.

711
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,980
I'm very nitpicky.

712
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,180
Me too.

713
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,980
Everyone is nitpicky, right?

714
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,100
He is very nitpicky.

715
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,580
Right?

716
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,540
He haggles extremely hard.

717
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,580
The king of bargaining.

718
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,060
Yeah.

719
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
You—

720
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,380
What are you nitpicky about?

721
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,060
He's not that bad.

722
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,660
Same, I save money too.

723
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,380
Since I've already been in the "Town Push"

724
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,220
for 26 days,

725
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,940
he's basically forgotten everything before,

726
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,860
just idling here.

727
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,540
It's been 26 days now.

728
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,980
If it weren't for yesterday,

729
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,860
when Yifengcheng's death became a variable,

730
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
it would have almost exceeded 28 days.

731
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,540
Time is running out.

732
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,740
I need to find you quickly.

733
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,940
But before you entered the "Town Push",

734
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,020
you told me not to interfere with this matter,

735
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,020
and especially not to enter the "Town Push".

736
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,220
So if you discover me,

737
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,540
it'll be even less possible

738
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,900
to get you, this important person,

739
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,860
out of here.

740
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,700
So this is...

741
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,820
Now there are three people involved.

742
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
And the important person knows

743
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,500
that he entered here.

744
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,460
The important person...

745
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,540
No, he's coming to find this person.

746
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,500
Xiao Ba is coming to find...

747
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,780
And the one who brought him in,

748
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,740
we can actually confirm now

749
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,580
that he's the murderer.

750
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,180
Yes.

751
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,220
He's the murderer.

752
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,060
Just these three people.

753
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,580
For Dilraba,

754
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,700
the most important person is you.

755
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,100
If Dilraba wants to take me away,

756
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,260
that's not necessarily the case.

757
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,740
It might actually be his sister.

758
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,820
His sister is here too.

759
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,980
This logic makes sense,

760
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,260
but let me tell you,

761
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,100
everyone present here

762
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,180
is important to him.

763
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,180
If we really

764
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,060
had to rank them,

765
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,220
his father would definitely be most important.

766
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,780
Right.

767
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,380
Isn't that so?

768
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,020
Moreover, judging by

769
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,900
his writings,

770
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,820
it's father, sister,

771
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,980
eldest brother, second brother,

772
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,460
third brother, eldest nephew...

773
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,220
I'm the least important.

774
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,620
I'm the least important one.

775
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,980
Let's read it carefully again.

776
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,220
Who played marbles with him?

777
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,900
Everyone did.

778
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,340
That drawing has marbles in it.

779
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,380
I hope this method

780
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,500
can grab your attention,

781
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,140
to see if it’s possible

782
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,460
to jog your memory.

783
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,540
He’s trying to find someone important.

784
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,540
Found it.

785
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:29,700
Right.

786
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,340
All six of us were in the room yesterday.

787
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,660
Yeah.

788
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,820
He threw them at us.

789
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,100
Exactly.

790
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,940
He threw them from the doorway.

791
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,460
We were all there,

792
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,380
inside Thomas’s office.

793
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,340
He threw them at us.

794
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,940
There’s someone there.

795
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,860
Someone’s at the door.

796
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,220
I didn't expect you to come here too.

797
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,060
I saw the symbol.

798
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,740
You must have remembered your obsession.

799
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,260
This way you'll become even more attached to "Zhentui".

800
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,980
And even less willing to return to Tuizhen.

801
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,580
I must resort to extreme measures.

802
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,380
Just drug that important person of his.

803
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
Drug the person who took him away.

804
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,180
Did you use it?

805
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,300
That knockout drug of his.

806
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,940
Not yet.

807
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,860
Used it.

808
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,580
One of us has already passed out.

809
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,700
Before he could carry out his plan.

810
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,660
He died.

811
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,420
You asked to meet me at 6.

812
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,140
At the skating rink warehouse.

813
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,540
And said you'd grant my wish.

814
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,340
To disappear from "Zhentui".

815
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,380
You must have changed your mind and are willing to return.

816
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,140
That's great.

817
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,540
As we agreed.

818
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,100
Move forward, don't look back.

819
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,500
An identical symbol.

820
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,540
It should be one - Xiao Ba.

821
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,580
And the other one is...

822
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,900
Xiao Ba wanted to take that person away.

823
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,540
And the person who killed Xiao Ba is the same one.

824
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,500
The important thing is...

825
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,860
Is the guy who brought him here the killer?

826
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,100
The guy who brought him here is indeed the killer.

827
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,500
Right.

828
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,180
The one who brought him...

829
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,020
Obviously, as we said...

830
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,220
I wasn't brought here.

831
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,460
I was led in...

832
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,100
Summoned here.

833
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,460
Yes.

834
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
I was summoned here.

835
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,620
Then I was summoned too.

836
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,140
Because of missing family members...

837
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,580
Only you and Sis Ba.

838
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,140
Right.

839
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,820
Isn't that right?

840
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,220
Yes.

841
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,660
No, we weren't with Xiao Ba...

842
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,260
in the same timeline.

843
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,660
In the same timeline as Xiao Ba...

844
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,220
Only those two were.

845
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,100
So to put it bluntly now...

846
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,140
The killer is between you two.

847
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,860
Half an hour ago...

848
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,780
I already said this.

849
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,620
You all argued with me.

850
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,140
Don't rush.

851
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,580
Your mind works fast, ours are slower.

852
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,100
Actually, just based on this point...

853
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,700
We can eliminate...

854
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,900
their suspicion.

855
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,100
Right.

856
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,820
They've arrived here.

857
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,100
Connected.

858
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,380
It's connected.

859
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,140
What's connected?

860
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,380
Because upon entering this space,

861
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,580
you forget.

862
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,140
Right.

863
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,700
After he (the killer) performed that ritual,

864
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,660
he entered this space,

865
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,380
so he forgot

866
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,700
the person he should have recognized.

867
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,940
Only after seeing that

868
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,980
did he remember.

869
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,700
Ning and Ba are just like Titanic in one world.

870
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:02,900
Yeah.

871
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,340
The key is, people from our two worlds

872
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,100
all know each other.

873
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,860
But those two—

874
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,140
why don't they know each other?

875
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,300
That's the crucial point.

876
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,620
So the killer must be one of these two

877
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,740
I agree

878
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,900
Bro, your deductions today were amazing

879
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,180
What do you...

880
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,700
No, it's exactly like this

881
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,820
So let's compare you two

882
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,780
Let's see who you'll vote for

883
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,060
Why would I kill my own brother?

884
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,740
I think what you're saying...

885
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,060
You need evidence

886
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,900
There must be a motive

887
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,860
I think Sister Ba seems more like the killer

888
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,380
Why?

889
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,140
No particular reason

890
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,660
I'm just going by my own analysis

891
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,220
I look like a killer every day

892
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,820
Let's think about this again

893
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,980
Something that happened 8 years ago

894
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,580
It must be something I've never been able to let go of

895
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,180
That incident

896
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,460
Let's think

897
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,700
What was it from 8 years ago that we couldn't let go of?

898
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,900
Neither of them could let it go 8 years ago

899
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,580
She was going to find Bei Guo

900
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,860
The boat was tampered with

901
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,140
He thought his son had been pushed overboard

902
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,380
One lost a son, the other lost a father

903
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,660
Right

904
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,580
Back then you went to find that person

905
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,020
When you were getting the testimonial letter written

906
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,900
To be blunt about that testimonial letter

907
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,060
They wouldn't believe it

908
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,340
Right

909
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,740
Because there was thunder and lightning that day

910
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,980
I didn't even get the chance to say

911
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,020
She was gone

912
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,740
She disappeared

913
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,260
Right

914
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,860
Bei Guo had a younger brother

915
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,460
Bei Guo had a brother

916
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,900
Yes, that letter he wrote to his brother

917
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,300
Right, it was written to his brother

918
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,340
He had a brother

919
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,020
To be honest

920
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,940
This letter doesn't look good for you either

921
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,020
Why?

922
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,900
In this letter of yours

923
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,700
Look, it was him (Captain Ning)

924
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,300
Who burned down his (Bei Guo's) basement

925
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,900
All these years

926
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,660
He's never been able to let go of his obsession

927
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
He's a pitiful person

928
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,900
This is very important information

929
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,580
Exactly

930
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,780
Obsession, pitiful person

931
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,060
Do you understand?

932
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,460
Right?

933
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,500
So this obsession of yours

934
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,020
Has never disappeared

935
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,140
So his killing him wasn't necessarily

936
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,820
done under circumstances where they knew each other

937
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,540
Because the deceased was wearing a mask.

938
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,220
Because the deceased was wearing a mask.

939
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,060
Right.

940
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,620
Because the deceased was wearing this mask.

941
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:01,740
Because the deceased was wearing this mask.

942
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,020
So the sister mistakenly thought the wearer...

943
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,580
Because in this situation...

944
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,180
What's the crucial phrase here?

945
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,780
The hooded person should be...

946
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,740
General Manager Bei Guo.

947
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,860
So she always believed...

948
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,620
The person she arranged to meet...

949
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,060
She didn't know...

950
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,220
That was her younger brother Ba Di.

951
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,380
So after she invited him over...

952
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,220
After killing him...

953
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,580
Perhaps only now does she realize...

954
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,260
That was her brother.

955
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,980
That makes sense.

956
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,700
So powerful

957
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,620
That makes perfect sense

958
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,620
You've been feeling like someone's following you

959
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,980
Then someone's trying to drug you

960
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,300
So you just...

961
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,500
Someone's following me, trying to drug me

962
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,180
It's the young marshal Hao (Jiawei) from 1923

963
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,540
No no

964
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,300
In this era

965
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,060
No one's trying to drug me

966
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,980
Let's start from this

967
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,700
Because I think this

968
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,580
is the most crucial point

969
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:34,940
Right

970
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,580
Is it because I discovered

971
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,900
his murder from 8 years ago

972
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,180
that he wants to secretly find an opportunity

973
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,780
to silence me?

974
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,940
So because she has this

975
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,860
she has a motive for murder

976
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,020
If you try to silence me, I must take you down

977
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,500
Exactly

978
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,180
So following me is to find out

979
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,500
if I have evidence against him

980
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,900
This is all her logic

981
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,380
What a terrible person

982
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,340
Judging by the tone

983
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
it sounds like a girl's tone

984
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,140
Most boys wouldn't say

985
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,020
"What a terrible person"

986
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,300
This is my analysis

987
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,180
This is truly a...

988
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,940
Even though she's my daughter

989
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,820
but I'm just analyzing

990
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,020
Yes, excellent analysis

991
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,220
Impossible

992
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,980
I only have 20 days left.

993
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,380
In this short time, I want to use it

994
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,820
to spend quality time with my family.

995
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,580
Which of them wants to be with family?

996
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,380
His chances are higher.

997
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,580
Because the three of us are here.

998
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,380
His son is also here.

999
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,820
His two brothers are here too.

1000
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,980
Yes, our whole family is complete.

1001
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,020
But after 48 days, if I'm the killer,

1002
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,060
I'll be completely annihilated.

1003
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:20,820
Right.

1004
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,100
Are you willing to die with us?

1005
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,500
Die together?

1006
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,380
Because we're all

1007
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,220
You won't die.

1008
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,180
Why would you die?

1009
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,460
I know.

1010
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,500
Because when you return to reality,

1011
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,220
you won't be able

1012
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
to contact us anymore.

1013
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,900
You want to use your remaining time

1014
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,380
to live with us.

1015
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,460
These last 48 days.

1016
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,220
From the surface level,

1017
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,580
I think your side has a stronger case.

1018
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,420
Let's focus on evidence.

1019
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,460
I believe it's about evidence.

1020
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,380
Right, evidence matters.

1021
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,060
Right now, it's entirely about the evidence.

1022
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,140
Because this is my daughter,

1023
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,260
I would never have imagined

1024
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,620
she would kill her own brother.

1025
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,420
If she killed him, it must have been accidental.

1026
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,180
Right.

1027
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,540
Because her brother was wearing a mask,

1028
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,100
so she mistook him for someone else.

1029
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,460
She thought it was

1030
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,100
Yes, Bei Guo.

1031
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,500
She thought it was Bei Guo.

1032
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,980
Both of them had motive.

1033
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,260
Because both hated Bei Guo.

1034
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,340
My son has been found.

1035
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,180
Your son was found here.

1036
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,700
Yes.

1037
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,660
You wouldn't find him in the real world.

1038
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,460
He is my son, right?

1039
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,940
Yes.

1040
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,300
If my son has been found,

1041
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,820
would I still believe

1042
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,780
that person is the killer?

1043
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
Right, she's in the same situation.

1044
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,660
She found her father.

1045
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,700
This matter of yours

1046
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,500
Where else could this lead?

1047
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,140
Your son is innocent

1048
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,500
But

1049
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,100
so many of our people are still missing

1050
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,780
Was it Brother Bai who killed them?

1051
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,300
She came to find me too

1052
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,620
Because you regained all your memories

1053
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,580
You know everything now

1054
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,300
How can you prove

1055
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,340
that I regained my memories?

1056
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,540
It's because you saw it

1057
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,020
How do you know I saw it?

1058
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,580
No, the killer must have seen it

1059
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,100
Yes

1060
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,540
Right?

1061
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,220
Well...

1062
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,340
I think today

1063
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,020
they all know much more than I do

1064
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,140
Let me summarize the deductions

1065
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I'm completely confused now

1066
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,220
You... you summarize it

1067
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:41,780
I'll follow your lead

1068
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
So who do you think it is?

1069
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,060
I originally thought it was you

1070
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,460
Who do you think now?

1071
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,260
Now I think

1072
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,220
I'll just follow your reasoning

1073
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,260
It's one of those two

1074
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,860
Who seems more likely to you?

1075
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,740
It's all the same

1076
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,460
You're being a bit biased here

1077
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,700
I just think

1078
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,540
This accidental killing seems unlikely

1079
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,780
How is accidental killing impossible?

1080
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,100
They've made two "Accidental Killing" movies

1081
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,980
Don't know who's inside, bro

1082
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,260
No, he's...

1083
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,700
What he means is

1084
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,460
If that's the case, it would be too melodramatic

1085
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,820
That's probably what it means

1086
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,540
No, then this person...

1087
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,260
For example, if this person were me

1088
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,300
I wrote the letter to Bei Guo

1089
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,500
Why would Ba Di come here instead?

1090
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,340
You think the person you wrote to

1091
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,540
is Bei Guo

1092
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,780
But it was addressed to the Bird-Faced Man

1093
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,300
The problem is in all the stories

1094
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,780
I've told yesterday and today

1095
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,740
There's no Bird-Faced Man

1096
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,020
Same here

1097
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,620
I never mentioned a Bird-Faced Man either

1098
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,660
Right, same

1099
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,180
Our current evidence

1100
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,020
is identical

1101
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,940
Right, can't prove our innocence

1102
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,500
Exactly, can't prove our innocence

1103
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,580
Hurry up

1104
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,340
We ordinary folks

1105
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,740
are just waiting for you two to investigate

1106
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,060
and make the final conclusion

1107
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,660
After our earlier calculations

1108
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,980
the result of our discussion

1109
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,020
narrows down the suspects

1110
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,740
mainly to these two individuals

1111
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,260
Xiao Ba is important to all four suspects.

1112
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,140
Each has emotional ties to him.

1113
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,740
They all have personal connections.

1114
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,260
What you two mean is...

1115
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,380
you don't know who this person is.

1116
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,020
Right.

1117
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,740
They killed the wrong person,

1118
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,980
mistaking him for Bei Guo.

1119
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,380
Correct.

1120
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,980
Isn't that right?

1121
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,780
Then it depends on who wants to stay here more.

1122
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,380
Yes, who's more determined to remain.

1123
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,500
What we just discussed...

1124
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,460
about disappearances...

1125
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,420
and who placed the candles...

1126
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,140
Only one point convinces me.

1127
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,900
Only one argument holds water.

1128
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,140
The key point is that we two...

1129
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,300
Since the disappearance was in 1980,

1130
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,700
therefore...

1131
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,740
we couldn't have placed the candles.

1132
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,780
If we had placed them,

1133
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,620
they wouldn't have been summoned back.

1134
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,340
Exactly.

1135
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,460
Only among those four...

1136
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,580
Among those four individuals...

1137
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
two are the missing persons,

1138
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,700
while the other two are relatives.

1139
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,260
Relatives of the missing.

1140
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:38,580
Right.

1141
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,020
So those remaining in this world...

1142
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,740
are only the relatives.

1143
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,740
The missing persons have already...

1144
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,620
Then is our world...

1145
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,420
the real world,

1146
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,940
or an unreal one?

1147
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,020
"Town Records."

1148
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,060
Because everything we've seen...

1149
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,420
comes from the Town Records.

1150
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,540
Including company documents.

1151
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,780
So you're working with Town Records.

1152
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,220
Correct.

1153
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,940
So the parallel world concept means...

1154
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,300
then there's another one.

1155
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
There must be another.

1156
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,740
Another who was summoned.

1157
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,580
Yes, yes.

1158
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,620
Your reasoning is that

1159
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,180
this killer came to "Zhentui"

1160
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,220
not just to kill someone,

1161
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,820
he came to "Zhentui" and killed

1162
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,780
as a forced action.

1163
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,580
He came to "Zhentui" to find family

1164
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,740
and reunite with them.

1165
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,940
To reunite with family.

1166
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,820
He found them,

1167
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,700
but during his time in Zhentui

1168
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,660
in this process,

1169
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,180
he suddenly discovered someone was following him,

1170
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,380
someone was after him.

1171
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,860
Bei Guo.

1172
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,060
Then he needed to figure out

1173
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,860
how his family member

1174
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,100
disappeared back then.

1175
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,100
So he had to return here,

1176
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,020
and Bei Guo was here.

1177
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,180
That's why I arranged to meet him

1178
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,020
at this place.

1179
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,860
That's his entire reasoning.

1180
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,900
I think the killer's entire logic

1181
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,580
is like this.

1182
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,060
Come on, A'ba, you tell us.

1183
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,820
I didn't...

1184
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:41,660
How about...

1185
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,460
Quick, be inspired!

1186
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,300
Quickly point someone out for me.

1187
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,420
My sister Ba,

1188
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
save us both, okay?

1189
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,300
Ridiculous

1190
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,500
You see

1191
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,220
Professional habits have influenced

1192
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,020
your daily habits

1193
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,740
And being nitpicky

1194
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,580
Nitpicky

1195
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,220
This is also quite crucial

1196
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,860
Sis Li is nitpicky

1197
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,380
She's nitpicky, she's an accountant

1198
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,140
Right

1199
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,180
Alright alright alright

1200
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,740
So it's my fault now?

1201
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,700
Fine fine

1202
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,820
First of all, both of you

1203
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,020
have a grudge against Bei Guo

1204
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,500
Right

1205
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,780
After coming here, you discovered

1206
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,220
that this Bei Guo is here

1207
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,100
Should I now

1208
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,700
take care of this guy

1209
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,260
Maybe it'll change the space-time over there

1210
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,260
But you say this person doesn't want to go back

1211
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:31,660
You also say

1212
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,900
I want to reunite with you all here

1213
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,580
Then you say

1214
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,820
After I'm done, I want to reverse everything back

1215
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,980
Anyway, no matter what

1216
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,060
this person is your enemy

1217
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,140
You two just want to take him down

1218
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,660
Right

1219
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,300
Eliminate him

1220
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,700
Let me give an example - say I

1221
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,100
If I believed

1222
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,900
that my son was killed by Beiguo

1223
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:44,980
After I arrived here

1224
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,820
I saw my son

1225
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,900
Right

1226
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,220
You forgot

1227
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
You forgot this was your son

1228
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,940
The moment you arrived, you forgot everything

1229
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,820
You even found your son

1230
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,500
But you actually never found him

1231
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,460
Right, only after seeing the symbol

1232
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,980
Only after seeing the symbol do you remember

1233
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,380
For example

1234
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,980
What was my purpose in coming here?

1235
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,580
The purpose was to find the symbol

1236
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,540
But look

1237
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,420
Xiao Ba didn't find it until day 26

1238
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,540
before finding the symbol

1239
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,300
Is it possible

1240
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,140
that someone saw this symbol yesterday

1241
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,460
already?

1242
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,060
The killer must have seen it long ago

1243
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,460
Saw it and regained their memories

1244
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:10,780
Right

1245
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,260
But they'd already killed - nothing could be done

1246
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,420
This is already very clear.

1247
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,780
Let me sort this out.

1248
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,660
To summarize,

1249
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,060
Because I think we've covered what we needed to discuss.

1250
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,540
Don't laugh.

1251
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,740
Why do you keep laughing?

1252
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,220
You speak first.

1253
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,460
It's fine.

1254
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,100
If you want to say something,

1255
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,780
just say what you want to say.

1256
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,300
Make your statement.

1257
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,180
I don't even know

1258
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,460
what to say right now.

1259
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,260
Why today...

1260
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,260
Why today, daughter...

1261
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,940
You always have

1262
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
those moments of inspiration.

1263
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,260
Because you get into

1264
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,660
a self-justification loop.

1265
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,460
Actually, if we consider the bird killer's motive

1266
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,540
to deduce the murderer,

1267
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,500
we just need to look at the first round

1268
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,340
where each of the

1269
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,820
four suspects' motives against Beiguo.

1270
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,780
That's enough.

1271
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,700
We don't need to examine everyone's

1272
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,820
motive against Badi.

1273
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,340
Do you understand?

1274
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,220
Right, there was no motive against Badi.

1275
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:51,820
Right.

1276
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,340
I mean it was accidental killing.

1277
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,580
This time it was accidental.

1278
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,220
Even after his death,

1279
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,140
his mask wasn't removed.

1280
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,500
Right.

1281
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:58,780
Right.

1282
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,220
Isn't that right?

1283
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,580
Yes.

1284
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,740
This shows the killer left immediately

1285
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,020
after killing him.

1286
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,620
Right, he thought he got the right person.

1287
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,860
After doing this,

1288
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,860
he didn't verify the identity.

1289
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,820
But this is my daughter, I won't vote against her.

1290
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,020
Then let's vote.

1291
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,900
Dudu, you should give some input.

1292
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,660
To be honest, I'm really torn right now.

1293
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,060
I still haven't truly determined

1294
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,220
whether

1295
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,980
my daughter accidentally killed my son

1296
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,860
or Captain Ning killed my son.

1297
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:42,900
Because actually,

1298
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,860
both of their motives

1299
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,180
and methods of committing the crime

1300
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,540
are entirely plausible.

1301
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,220
I've been repeatedly going over

1302
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,900
the letter that Badi wrote

1303
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,580
because he was afraid he'd forget,

1304
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,420
the scene he described in writing.

1305
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,180
I've been replaying it in my mind.

1306
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,340
These words

1307
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,420
seem to fit well with his sister,

1308
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,660
but after I left,

1309
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,140
Captain Ning essentially became his foster father,

1310
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,820
which also fits quite well.

1311
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,060
Another crucial point is that

1312
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,220
as a captain,

1313
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
he must also have

1314
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,260
a meticulous and calculating side.

1315
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,660
Alright, no more hesitation.

1316
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,460
Today I choose

1317
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,820
Even if it's the wrong vote, so be it.

1318
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,660
I'll vote for them.

1319
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,900
I'll vote for them.

1320
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,140
Alright, Dilraba.

1321
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,340
Your innocence will be proven.

1322
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,060
Goodbye.

1323
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,500
The suspect I've chosen

1324
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,300
is because I found

1325
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,780
in his room

1326
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,660
marbles

1327
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,780
This old friend said

1328
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,060
he likes playing with marbles

1329
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,740
and that you enjoy playing marbles with me

1330
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,140
But I still have doubts

1331
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,260
about this suspect choice

1332
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,260
The true culprit I've chosen is Sister Ba.

1333
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,420
In the victim's writings,

1334
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,460
there was mention of this "you"

1335
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,860
which was actually addressed to the killer.

1336
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,460
The victim described you as

1337
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,500
a strict and nitpicky person.

1338
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,340
This detail alone

1339
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,020
strongly points to Sister Ba.

1340
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,020
Because in daily life,

1341
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,740
as an accountant,

1342
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,700
she's extremely meticulous.

1343
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,620
For example,

1344
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,300
when processing reimbursement receipts,

1345
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,140
she insists on precise calculations

1346
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,620
down to 3.1415926 decimal places.

1347
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,860
She maintains strict self-discipline

1348
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,220
and even keeps a golden abacus on her bed

1349
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,580
as constant motivation.

1350
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,820
She appears as a demanding,

1351
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,500
highly disciplined

1352
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,420
career woman.

1353
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,100
That's all.

1354
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,500
The suspect I'm voting for today is

1355
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,220
Through our earlier deduction

1356
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,500
My prime suspect

1357
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,340
is

1358
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,300
Today's prime suspect is

1359
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,780
The light today

1360
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,620
seems particularly strange.

1361
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,100
Yes.

1362
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,940
"Let's Begin Deduction" Season 2, Case 4:

1363
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,340
"The Never-Ending Busy Street"

1364
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,100
The case has reached its conclusion.

1365
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,900
Everyone has completed their voting.

1366
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,300
If the real culprit receives

1367
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,500
fewer votes than others,

1368
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,380
then the culprit and X get the golden key.

1369
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:00,940
Otherwise,

1370
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,180
the players who voted correctly

1371
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,380
will receive the golden key.

1372
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,500
The voting results will now be announced.

1373
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,220
Today, three players received votes.

1374
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,980
Three players.

1375
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,020
The three of us.

1376
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,620
The vote counts for these three players are:

1377
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,380
1 vote,

1378
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,100
2 votes,

1379
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:22,620
and 3 votes.

1380
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,180
3 votes.

1381
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:24,940
This again.

1382
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,140
It's me, isn't it?

1383
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,940
Moreover, one player

1384
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,140
changed their vote at the last minute.

1385
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,860
Before changing the votes,

1386
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,180
the person with the most votes

1387
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,700
was different.

1388
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,860
One person was torn between two options.

1389
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,940
Three votes for the left option,

1390
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,260
and three for the right.

1391
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,660
Oh no, I feel something's about to go wrong.

1392
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,740
This is bad, trouble's coming.

1393
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,380
The player who changed their vote

1394
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,100
needs to speak up.

1395
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,060
Wang Juanwang.

1396
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,020
Let Wang Juanwang announce

1397
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,180
who they changed their vote from and to.

1398
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,540
I originally voted for my daughter,

1399
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,460
but at the last moment,

1400
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,660
I felt that

1401
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,460
this story was about

1402
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,020
the sister accidentally killing her brother.

1403
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,460
I just felt somewhat conflicted inside.

1404
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,300
Plus today,

1405
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,260
based on my observations of Captain Ning

1406
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,300
and comparisons,

1407
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,500
but at the very last moment,

1408
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,420
I told myself it's okay.

1409
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,380
Even if I voted wrong,

1410
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,980
but I truly

1411
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,700
today experienced

1412
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,500
such a touching father-daughter bond.

1413
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,140
I think it was really special.

1414
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,980
Earlier in my content,

1415
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,260
my daughter suddenly jumped out

1416
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:39,860
to scare me.

1417
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,980
Today she suddenly jumped out

1418
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,900
to scare me again.

1419
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,060
Gave me a fright.

1420
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,540
You can try opening it.

1421
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,500
This...

1422
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,100
You scared me

1423
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,260
That's terrifying

1424
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,180
Which one of you

1425
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,420
Is it Sis Ba

1426
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,500
Is it you

1427
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,580
But I just feel quite happy

1428
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,340
So I changed my vote at the last moment

1429
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,220
and voted for Captain Ning

1430
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,140
It's that simple

1431
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,300
Maybe I voted wrong

1432
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,060
Brother, you also have an obsession

1433
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,780
Your obsession runs too deep

1434
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,580
I took care of your two kids for you

1435
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,300
For eight years

1436
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,380
Yes

1437
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,100
Alright

1438
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,180
I was wrong

1439
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,940
So the one with the most votes this time

1440
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,300
The suspect is

1441
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,020
Captain Ning

1442
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,020
So Captain Ning,

1443
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,820
is he truly the culprit?

1444
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,420
Before revealing the real culprit,

1445
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,260
let me first announce

1446
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,900
that this case has an X factor.

1447
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,020
The X factor is

1448
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,020
He Kefu.

1449
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,100
It's you.

1450
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:57,860
Faking it.

1451
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,500
Wasn't it supposed to be him?

1452
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,580
We both thought it was him all along.

1453
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,900
Just say it's him.

1454
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,820
Seriously.

1455
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,780
Had a good time today.

1456
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,140
The pressure of being X was too much.

1457
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,260
So when you saw yourself as

1458
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,820
X, how did you feel?

1459
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,620
I couldn't control it.

1460
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,820
I turned around too quickly.

1461
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,980
That moment he...

1462
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,700
My facial muscles were all...

1463
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,580
Very stiff.

1464
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,420
When he came out,

1465
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,860
I asked him to give me a look,

1466
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,260
but he just walked off tense.

1467
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:21,660
Right.

1468
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,380
My facial muscles never relaxed.

1469
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,140
Then I went back.

1470
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,180
So when you're X,

1471
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,860
you must take a breath,

1472
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,860
relax before stepping out.

1473
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,220
That's quite hard.

1474
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:29,740
So difficult.

1475
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,460
Really tough.

1476
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,980
The more you try to control it, the harder it gets.

1477
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,620
He's the disruptive factor for X.

1478
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,660
The biggest disruptive factor.

1479
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:34,940
Let me tell you,

1480
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,940
he's just bullying you.

1481
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,900
He bullies kids.

1482
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,420
Am I the X killer or something?

1483
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,060
Feeling like I have no role.

1484
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,660
Actually, playing relaxed is better.

1485
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,180
You can immerse yourself,

1486
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,780
and focus on finding clues.

1487
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,140
But once you have a role,

1488
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,500
you might get distracted,

1489
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,220
and possibly lose control.

1490
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,180
So Captain Ning,

1491
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,700
is he truly the culprit?

1492
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,580
Congratulations on your successful report

1493
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,700
The real culprit is Captain Ning

1494
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,620
Dilraba received two votes

1495
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,220
Wang Esq. received one vote

1496
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,060
Then I actually corrected it right

1497
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,620
Dad

1498
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,100
My dear son

1499
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:22,980
Let me change it.

1500
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,780
Change it to Captain Ning.

1501
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,900
The culprit I'm voting for today is

1502
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,740
Captain Ning.

1503
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,820
Captain Ning wanted to kill Bei Guo.

1504
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,380
In his memory and

1505
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,580
consciousness,

1506
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,340
Bei Guo caused the death of his son.

1507
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,420
So he had a

1508
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,140
desire to kill Bei Guo

1509
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,420
to avenge his son—

1510
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,660
an obsession.

1511
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,940
And on this "Confusion Plan,"

1512
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,860
he saw

1513
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,140
what he believed was Bei Guo's plan

1514
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,540
to drug this person.

1515
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,420
This further solidified his

1516
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,020
motive to kill Bei Guo.

1517
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,060
Because at the same time,

1518
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,620
not only did Bei Guo kill his son,

1519
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,660
but he also wanted to kill him.

1520
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,100
Today's culprit is

1521
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,300
Captain Ning.

1522
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,620
I chose him because

1523
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,500
he wanted to stay in "Zhen Tui"

1524
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,460
since all his family is here.

1525
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,620
So he preferred to stay.

1526
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,860
I voted for Sis Ba.

1527
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,580
Sis Ba.

1528
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,260
The culprit I chose is

1529
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,220
Wang Juanwang.

1530
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,300
Seriously?

1531
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,860
You didn’t expect it was me, right?

1532
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,420
Who did you pick?

1533
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,380
She voted for me.

1534
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,780
Because back then,

1535
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,660
after it ended,

1536
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,180
I found a marble.

1537
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,780
Next, we announce

1538
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,020
the crucial evidence everyone missed

1539
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,940
The crucial evidence

1540
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,180
is related to Xiao Ba's marbles

1541
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,540
This

1542
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,460
is related to marbles

1543
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,500
To identify the important person

1544
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,020
Xiao Ba actually placed marbles

1545
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,420
in all four people's rooms

1546
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,980
But only Captain Ning discovered the marbles

1547
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,100
Yet Captain Ning mistakenly believed

1548
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,980
that the bird-masked person throwing marbles was Beiguo

1549
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,620
So after killing the bird-masked person

1550
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,540
he hid the marbles related to the bird-masked person

1551
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,700
in the potted plant soil at a hidden company location

1552
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,940
So only Captain Ning's

1553
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,940
room had no marbles

1554
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,020
He hid them (the marbles)

1555
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:29,700
We all had them

1556
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,380
So what you found

1557
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,380
is something everyone had

1558
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,140
Besides the marbles

1559
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,940
Captain Ning also took Tony's

1560
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,700
five-element charm from the bag

1561
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,940
and hid it with the marbles

1562
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,700
Additionally, in the soil was Captain Ning's

1563
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,620
dropped hair clip

1564
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,380
This hair clip proves

1565
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,060
the real culprit who hid these items

1566
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,420
was Captain Ning

1567
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,180
Also, in this case, Sister Ba

1568
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,420
was brought into "Town Push"

1569
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,740
because Captain Ning

1570
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,140
during the ritual

1571
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,220
Sister Ba was within 50 meters

1572
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,980
so she was taken along

1573
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,140
Right

1574
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,580
Five-element charm

1575
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,540
Tony's bag had metal, wood, water, fire, earth

1576
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,020
which one was missing?

1577
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:14,940
We really overlooked the bag

1578
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,620
We truly missed the bag

1579
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,820
Actually when we looked at the bag before

1580
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,900
we did see that

1581
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,740
five-element thing

1582
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,020
Don't you think some evidence

1583
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,860
you overlook turns out important

1584
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,940
while what you focus on

1585
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,420
how to say

1586
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,860
you end up thinking those

1587
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,180
unimportant things are important

1588
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,180
Yes, sometimes we just

1589
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,980
fixate on this

1590
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,060
Right, too focused

1591
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,540
Today's golden key winners are

1592
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,660
Wang the Overachiever

1593
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,980
Bai Mai

1594
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,540
Ke Lidu

1595
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,900
Congratulations on the golden key

1596
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,020
Congratulations

1597
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,060
See how at the last moment

1598
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,380
I hesitated

1599
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,580
I changed it

1600
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,780
It won't open

1601
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,020
Come on

1602
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,980
Thank you, Captain Ning

1603
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,060
Thank you for voting for me

1604
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,180
Let me just...

1605
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,380
Almost let him get away

1606
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,220
Thanks, Big Cousin

1607
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,220
Thank you, big bro

1608
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:11,860
Congratulations

1609
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,300
Thanks, big bro

1610
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,900
That's really good

1611
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,380
So all these things

1612
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,340
how are they connected?

1613
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,780
Right now we're just relying on

1614
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,380
who isn't among the missing

1615
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,500
to determine this.

1616
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,620
Between him and me

1617
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,700
No, it's still about obsession

1618
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,020
Because the strongest obsession

1619
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,060
belongs to you and him.

1620
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,660
He just wants to clarify

1621
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,340
whether his son was actually

1622
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,620
pushed by Beiguo.

1623
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,100
That's the core of his obsession.

1624
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,220
Moreover, he had the desire

1625
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,180
to stay with me.

1626
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:46,900
Right.

1627
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,620
After he found his son,

1628
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,300
he wanted to stay in this space.

1629
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,180
So the letter mentioned that

1630
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,500
the person with the longest obsession

1631
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,380
was indeed him.

1632
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,660
You know what?

1633
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,220
Actually, that letter

1634
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,540
is also crucial evidence.

1635
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,580
The only reason I identified the culprit is

1636
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,740
his family is all here.

1637
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,820
All family members present,

1638
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,060
he wanted to be with his family.

1639
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,340
Not a single one missing.

1640
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:05,900
Exactly.

1641
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,060
In this story,

1642
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,820
how many spaces are there really?

1643
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,580
Is it a loop or parallel dimensions?

1644
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,660
There are both parallels and loops.

1645
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,700
When people with obsessions enter,

1646
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,380
that's when the loops begin.

1647
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,020
Right.

1648
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,820
The two ship disasters are parallel.

1649
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,340
The first time I piloted ship 4444

1650
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,260
and later when the company reassigned 4444

1651
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,580
to a new ship

1652
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,660
led to the disappearances on

1653
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,180
February 7th, 1988.

1654
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,780
Today's story is quite remarkable

1655
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,780
And I think it's quite sophisticated

1656
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,180
This obsession, for a person,

1657
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,900
is truly a terrifying thing

1658
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,620
Right

1659
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,260
So I genuinely think this episode

1660
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,620
holds significant real-world relevance

1661
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,140
It resonates with our daily lives

1662
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,540
We all have it—

1663
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,620
no one can claim to be free of obsessions

1664
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,020
Saying "I can let go of anything"

1665
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,180
just means you haven't encountered

1666
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,940
what truly pierces your heart

1667
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,260
Look, ours is a father-daughter relationship.

1668
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,980
His is between lovers.

1669
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,300
Yours is father-son.

1670
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,700
And there are brotherly bonds.

1671
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,140
And sibling relationships.

1672
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,060
Personally, I really like this story.

1673
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,820
Right?

1674
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,380
Sometimes,

1675
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,300
if we chase after things from the past too much,

1676
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:16,820
Yes.

1677
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,260
Right?

1678
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,540
Like wanting to see certain people again

1679
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,380
or redo certain things.

1680
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:19,900
Yes.

1681
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,500
It can make us lose

1682
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,380
what we currently have.

1683
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,940
And the outcome might not even be good.

1684
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,460
Yes, exactly.

1685
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,460
I've been thinking,

1686
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,940
take the two main suspects for example.

1687
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,340
They both wanted to protect

1688
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,380
the ones they loved.

1689
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,180
Or rather,

1690
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,900
to spend time with their loved ones,

1691
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,180
they opened this Pandora's box.

1692
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,700
They opened this Pandora's box.

1693
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,420
And what's worse, the murderer

1694
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,420
even killed

1695
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,580
the person who could have closed this Pandora's box.

1696
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,900
He wanted to keep

1697
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,060
the Pandora's box open.

1698
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,820
This is actually

1699
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,340
an extremely selfish act.

1700
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,860
Yes.

1701
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,980
You may have gotten the person you wanted,

1702
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,420
you may have kept your loved one

1703
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,980
by your side,

1704
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,540
living what seems like a happy life.

1705
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,420
But have you asked if that's what they wanted?

1706
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,660
Perhaps in their own

1707
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,540
parallel world,

1708
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,060
they were living happily.

1709
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,500
By forcibly bringing them here,

1710
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,580
if this isn't selfish,

1711
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,340
then what is?

1712
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:11,860
Yes

1713
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,340
This story also tells us

1714
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,300
To survive in this world

1715
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,660
We shouldn't hold too many obsessions

1716
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,220
Let go of the past

1717
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,980
Only then can you move forward tomorrow

1718
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,620
Right

1719
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,780
If you can't let things go

1720
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,020
They'll always come back

1721
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,980
And you'll bring harm again

1722
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,340
Yes, that saying about boarding the train

1723
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,260
Move forward

1724
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,300
Don't look back

1725
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,980
The characters in this episode's stories

1726
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,580
have all experienced family tragedies

1727
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,740
and they believe

1728
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,820
it was their own fault

1729
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,540
that caused their family's suffering

1730
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,260
so they remain trapped in guilt

1731
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,660
They stubbornly maintain

1732
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,540
there must be a murderer

1733
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,700
But as the stories progress

1734
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,900
when the fog of the cases clears, we see

1735
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,860
there was actually no murderer

1736
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,660
In the end, they reflect

1737
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,860
that their obsession with finding a killer

1738
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,300
was actually masking their guilt

1739
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,860
about their family's accidental deaths

1740
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,740
So today let's talk about

1741
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,140
how to overcome guilt and dispel the gloom

1742
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,300
First, overcoming guilt doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of

1743
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,220
what you believe you did wrong

1744
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,140
It's not about telling Dilraba

1745
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,700
that running away from home was the right thing to do

1746
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,100
and that it had absolutely nothing to do

1747
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:26,740
with your father's disappearance

1748
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,620
That's not the case

1749
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,220
Overcoming guilt still means

1750
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,100
taking reasonable responsibility

1751
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,740
for this matter

1752
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,020
and accepting the causes of your guilt

1753
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,940
For the parts we must take responsibility for

1754
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,580
and the parts that can't be made right

1755
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,540
we need to learn self-forgiveness

1756
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,500
We often see the concept of revenge

1757
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,140
in many films and variety shows

1758
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,780
Our legal principles

1759
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,260
prohibit vigilante justice

1760
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,620
So when seeking justice

1761
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,780
it means reporting to authorities

1762
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,620
not taking personal revenge

1763
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,980
Leave it to the judicial authorities

1764
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,580
who can employ more scientific and effective

1765
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,620
investigation methods and trial mechanisms

1766
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,740
to reduce the likelihood of wrongful convictions

1767
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:04,980
Secondly

1768
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,180
the rights of suspects

1769
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,940
also need protection

1770
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,940
Placing them within the judicial system

1771
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,460
allows for more reasonable determination

1772
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,340
of their actions' nature

1773
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,620
while also fully protecting

1774
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,340
their right to defense during the process

1775
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,140
If today we use violence

1776
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,060
to solve problems

1777
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,780
tomorrow we ourselves might

1778
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,300
become targets of violence

1779
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,220
Therefore, a stable and orderly

1780
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,260
legal environment

1781
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,540
is actually the best protection

1782
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,860
of everyone's fundamental rights
