1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,600
We need to enter the game world

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,240
Find that B Sect

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,320
Loading

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,400
All things return to one

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,480
It's open

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,680
Is anyone there?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,440
Even if you've figured out my plan,

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,960
you still can't stop Organization B.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,840
Play the piano.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,240
Come on, Peng.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,040
We'll have one person play,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,840
while eight others search for the stick.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,200
The door's open.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,560
You counted too slow.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
Hurry back.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,640
Hou.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,200
What's the situation?

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,440
We're the same kind.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,000
We're done for.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,800
Behave yourself.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,240
Okay, later.

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,560
It hurts—help me up.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,160
I don’t see where the stick is.

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,480
Go.

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,280
Where’s the stick?

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,720
No one survives this.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,120
Take them to the secret chamber.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Understood.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,080
Behave and cooperate.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
I'm about to enter

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,520
your memory systems

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,920
to find that crucial person.

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,040
It's open, I'm out.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040
We've found a way.

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,080
I don't know why

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,760
you're out too.

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
We're out.

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,680
So we're really out, right?

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,480
It's already begun.

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,840
Then what was the point of locking us up?

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,600
Probably to prevent us from communicating at first.

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,280
Didn't we communicate?

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,320
There's something here, folks.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,240
What?

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,480
A password.

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,160
Boss, as you instructed,

47
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,760
we've changed the password hint for this room.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,400
They'll never figure it out.

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,840
I think this place is useful.

50
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,960
3628.

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
3628.

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
How did you know

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
Fold this and it becomes 3

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,520
Fold it once

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,400
This is 6

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
This is 2

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
This is 8

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Chongqing scores big

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,800
I'll grab a brick

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,040
What if I encounter danger

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
There's an axe here.

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,400
And a hammer.

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,480
And eggs.

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
Eggs.

65
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,760
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,880
We must catch these five people

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,680
Retrieve memories to find the goose

69
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,840
Director He, 8D, and Shouruan—these three

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,960
Look, their identities have been verified here

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,400
So their identities are already known

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:39,960
I feel

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,520
In the end, we’ll definitely

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,560
return to this place

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,240
Let’s first see where we can go

76
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,840
Okay

77
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,640
Gather some useful information

78
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
Let’s check the cabinets first

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
There are many cabinets in this room

80
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,560
Can we break it

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Can we pry it open?

82
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
Do we need to open this box?

83
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
We need to open this one

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
But I really will pry it open

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,160
It really can be pried open

86
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
What's up?

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,320
Do we need to do that thing...

88
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,280
Stand inside here

89
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,640
And then do something or whatever

90
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,280
Maybe

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
This part is where you stand inside

92
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,640
It can strike

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,760
You go in

94
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,400
Who's holding me?

95
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,720
Me.

96
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,600
All roads lead to Rome, brothers.

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
All things return to one.

98
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,080
Everything comes full circle.

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,120
What?

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,840
I just touched that cabinet earlier.

101
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
Has it started already?

102
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,840
No, there's not a single light here.

103
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,920
Where should we go?

104
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760
There should be some scary parts.

105
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,240
Go in, enter this place.

106
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,320
I feel like we should go inside here.

107
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,640
Really? Just this one?

108
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,120
Let's go in and see.

109
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,840
There's another one here too.

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,960
Actually, there are two more over there.

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,120
You can go over there and try standing at those two.

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,760
Over there - who's there?

113
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,160
Who dares to go?

114
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,280
No one dares to go.

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
Someone's approaching over there.

116
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,920
You saw it?

118
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,000
Wait a moment.

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,440
Let me go in too.

120
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
Why is everyone going in?

121
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,800
Harmony.

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,920
You're just scared.

123
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,160
Hello

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Ting

125
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,840
I've already discovered

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,600
the secret of Tui Town

127
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,080
It's in the hands of a robot named Beiju

128
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,880
This Beiju

129
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,120
is a member of a mysterious organization codenamed B

130
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,920
This organization is destabilizing Tui Town

131
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
And my true identity

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,960
is actually the guardian of Tui Town

133
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,120
I came here today

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,040
hoping you can help me

135
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,680
stop Organization B's conspiracy

136
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,360
Alright

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
During my investigation, I discovered

138
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
they repeatedly mentioned a game called

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,800
2048

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
"Mysterious Player"

141
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,480
We can split into two teams

142
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
You enter the "Mysterious Player" game

143
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,520
to look for clues about Organization B

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
while I continue tracking Beiju's whereabouts

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay

146
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,920
As far as I know

147
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
That area over there is the virtual gaming room

148
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
This is the access card I found

149
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
You can start from there

150
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,960
the "Mystery Player" game

151
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,920
When needed

152
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,200
I'll contact you with this

153
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,920
This belongs to us

154
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,440
Alright, good luck to you

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
Let's go look for clues

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,720
Pass through

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
If she wants to split up

158
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm not too fond of that

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,040
She goes that way, we'll go this way

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
With all this

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,280
Her going alone on one path

162
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm not scared

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
I just don't want to be separated from you all

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,800
Here

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,920
What are you doing with that chain?

166
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,680
Why are you taking this chain?

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,320
I'm controlling myself

168
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,480
What are you doing with that axe?

169
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,840
You're asking me?

170
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,320
To protect me

171
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,000
To protect everyone

172
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Insert the game cartridge

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
to start the virtual game

174
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,080
There's a password here

175
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,080
Super Cyber Monkey Game

176
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
Contra Bull

177
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,200
123 124

178
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,320
Why? How did you figure it out?

179
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,840
Look

180
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,560
One

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,240
Let me guess

182
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,080
I'll take a wild guess

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
But this feels a bit... you know

184
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,320
558

185
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,200
That's the character count plus word count

186
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Let's try it

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,160
558

188
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,840
Give it a try

189
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,880
558

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,640
Let me observe more carefully

191
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,440
See, Super Cyber Monkey is just one monkey

192
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
Contra Bull has two bulls

193
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,280
See, Super Cyber Monkey is just one monkey

194
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,840
Contra Bull has two bulls

195
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
Following the zodiac order

196
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,840
Monkey ranks

197
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,520
9th

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Ox ranks 2nd

199
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,280
Tiger 3rd

200
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,720
Let's see if this works

201
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,360
No

202
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,360
923

203
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,480
Monkey

204
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
How did you do it

205
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,280
Just push it to the side, don't press

206
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,280
So what's the number

207
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,240
It's 923

208
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
It's starting

209
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,000
The game plot of "Mysterious Player"

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,640
is set in two eras 100 years apart

211
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,280
A mysterious time-space tunnel

212
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,240
connects 1924 and 2024

213
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,040
The tragic songstress of Tui Le Men

214
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
was traded as a commodity

215
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
to the unscrupulous Tui Health Company

216
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,400
and became a victim of organ trafficking

217
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,480
The fates of people in both eras

218
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,960
were thus completely transformed

219
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,720
Game protagonists:

220
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,920
Bali, Bai Youcai, Ning Shaoshuai

221
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,640
He Shaoshuai, Ke Shaoshuai, Wang Chuanshuo

222
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,160
Supporting characters:

223
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,600
Le Ye, Tui Shenmi, He Dao, Fen Fenghuang

224
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,680
Dongnao Tang doctor

225
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,960
and tragic songstress Mei Yunlianlian

226
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,480
So we need to enter

227
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,960
this game world

228
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,200
Right, we'll find Organization B inside

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,640
Loading

230
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,200
Later that...

231
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
This door should change

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,120
I'll check if the door's open

233
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,080
Smoke's being released

234
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,680
It's that this door will change

235
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,360
Isn't this the premiere?

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
People might rush out here

237
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,000
It's just...

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,080
Okay, don't be scared, stay calm

239
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,240
I can't take this anymore

240
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,840
Brothers, all roads lead to one

241
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,040
Scanning? We're scanning here

242
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,440
Okay

243
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
They released some smoke

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,080
Scan me

245
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,440
Are you still there?

246
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,160
I'm here

247
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,360
I thought you got eliminated by lasers

248
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,520
This sound is really loud

249
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,120
Welcome to

250
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,240
the game world of "Mysterious Player"

251
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
Please explore freely

252
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,280
Wishing Director He continuous masterpieces and complete success

253
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,800
A small flower basket

254
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
Wishing Director He great achievements and career success

255
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,680
Warmly celebrating Director He's new work

256
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,080
"Office Mysteries"

257
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,000
Mysteries

258
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,920
Come on brothers

259
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,560
Can we eat this?

260
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,280
Can we really drink this?

261
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,440
Today's the wrap party, right?

262
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,320
"Office Mysteries"

263
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,400
Isn't this just about office ghosts?

264
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Isn't that it?

265
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,080
Just these mysteries

266
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,640
No way

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,320
It couldn't be that...

268
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,000
That number must be some clue

269
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,280
I don't dare eat this

270
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,760
Zifan, did you come with a mission?

271
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,080
Yes

272
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,520
You've been holding an axe this whole time

273
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,640
In the end you'll need to

274
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,800
silence us

275
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,160
In the end, you must eliminate us to leave

276
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
No one survives

277
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
No survivors

278
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,160
This has intoxicating, fruity, and sweet aromas

279
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,160
Hello everyone

280
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,400
Director He

281
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,560
You all know me

282
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,480
Hello

283
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,920
You look familiar, my friend

284
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,600
You too

285
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,400
What's up

286
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
Director He is here, Director He

287
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,560
Come on

288
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,920
Welcome everyone to my new movie

289
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,960
"Office Mystery" premiere party

290
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm Director He, the director of this film

291
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,360
Hello Director He

292
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,240
I believe you've all heard of my legend

293
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,800
Because I've won three major awards

294
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,960
Have you heard of my legend?

295
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,720
Absolutely, it's legendary

296
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,800
Now let me introduce this person beside me

297
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,400
She is

298
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,600
A Lian, who just joined our studio

299
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,040
Hello everyone, I'm A Lian

300
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,240
Please guide me well

301
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
Hello A Lian

302
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,280
A Lian

303
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,840
You all don't seem excited enough

304
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,120
A Lian! A Lian! A Lian!

305
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,200
Alright, come on

306
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
No need to rush the excitement

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,280
Let's bring something more exciting

308
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,040
Not over here.

309
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,320
How about here?

310
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,560
Are you going to perform magic?

311
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,920
Found it, everyone look.

312
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,640
That's right.

313
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,520
Movie screening passes.

314
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
This is what we'll do next.

315
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,280
Next we'll attend a private screening.

316
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,200
To watch my movie.

317
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,520
Good.

318
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,360
But if you want to get...

319
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,760
these screening passes...

320
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,720
It won't be that easy.

321
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,880
Grab them!

322
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,120
Let's go, brothers!

323
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,920
We can't...

324
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,360
force people to do difficult things.

325
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,400
Look here.

326
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,720
There are some golden eggs.

327
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,040
Inside these golden eggs...

328
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,840
are the challenges I've set...

329
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,280
for obtaining the screening passes.

330
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,760
If you fail the challenges...

331
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,640
you can still grab them...

332
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,440
and that's fine.

333
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,040
You can keep trying...

334
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,760
but the golden eggs are limited.

335
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,360
So everyone...

336
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
should make the most of this opportunity.

337
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,760
Just pick one directly.

338
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,480
Randomly select one.

339
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
Pick one and be a good man.

340
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
All nine of us can...

341
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,040
use great strength.

342
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,440
Corny pickup lines challenge.

343
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,760
Make another player's heart rate rise.

344
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,800
This requires something...

345
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,120
A heart rate monitor.

346
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,920
You can choose any male participant.

347
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,760
Come on, I'll do it.

348
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,880
Let me try first as an example.

349
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,480
What if it drops later?

350
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,040
My heart would freeze.

351
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,280
86.

352
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,480
Then let's begin.

353
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,200
Okay.

354
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,560
Now I'll perform something for you.

355
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,800
Do you like songs?

356
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,360
I like you too

357
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,160
Success

358
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,080
It's rising

359
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,640
Singing nursery rhymes while crying

360
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,720
The kind that makes you burst into tears

361
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
You must shed tears

362
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,160
Tears flowing

363
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,760
Two tigers, two tigers, running fast

364
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,080
The emotions are there

365
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,080
I have to give it to you

366
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
I’ll contact you for my next project

367
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,000
Leave me your contact info later

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,480
Thank you, Director He

369
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
Unity is strength

370
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,920
Inviting everyone to complete the song chain

371
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,000
Ten years ago, I didn’t know you

372
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,560
Stop

373
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,840
You don’t belong to me

374
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,960
My hometown

375
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,320
You didn’t even finish this line—no good

376
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,720
I live in this village

377
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,440
This won’t do

378
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,320
I was born and raised in this village

379
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,200
As time flies by, I only care about you

380
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,800
You are my eyes

381
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,440
Only then can I see happiness before me

382
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,320
Waiting a thousand years for this moment

383
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,040
Come back, come back

384
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Take your heart, take my heart

385
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
String them together

386
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,720
String a lucky clover

387
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,200
String a circle of unity

388
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,440
Circle of unity

389
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,360
So you’re the luck I wanted to keep

390
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,920
Turns out we and love

391
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,560
Were once so close

392
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,440
Today you’re marrying me

393
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,920
Not bad

394
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
That was quite tough

395
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,640
Yeah, it was tough

396
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,520
Pretty tough

397
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
Next

398
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,520
I’ll go

399
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,160
No

400
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,520
Then the middle finger goes here

401
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,320
The middle finger presses the little finger

402
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,320
Okay

403
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,880
Actually it's the same

404
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,080
It's just (the fingers) are too short, really

405
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Wait a minute

406
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,280
No, I won't do this part

407
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,000
That's ambitious

408
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Are you ambitious?

409
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,760
No

410
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay, here

411
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,040
Decibel challenge

412
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,880
You use whichever body part to make (sound)

413
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,400
I'll place this on whichever body part

414
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,400
I nominate our

415
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,520
PKU soccer team's leg king

416
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,160
That's amazing

417
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,400
Alright

418
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
Truly the Leg King

419
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
The split exceeds two and a half meters

420
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,760
We're here.

421
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
Alright, challenge completed.

422
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,680
Spread the word.

423
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,480
Wei Xiaolong has legs 2.5 meters long.

424
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll gain Director He's friendship.

425
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Come on, let's hug.

426
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,800
So envious.

427
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,360
Director He.

428
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,800
Straight to you.

429
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
So impressive.

430
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,280
A Lian's friendship.

431
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,240
Good Guy King.

432
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,200
I thought it was something else.

433
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,680
I thought it would be directly...

434
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,720
Names of good friends.

435
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,440
Okay, no need to think now.

436
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,200
3, 2, 1, go!

437
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,320
Zong Yu, Zhuo Cheng,

438
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,520
then Shao Yang,

439
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
then Zi Fan,

440
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,800
then Director He,

441
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,720
then A Lian,

442
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,080
then Brother Long,

443
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,000
then Brother Kai,

444
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,720
Outdated, only eight.

445
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,160
One more, Director He is generous.

446
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,000
Director He is generous.

447
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,880
Director He is particularly refined and amiable.

448
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,800
And also exceptionally capable.

449
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,680
Alright.

450
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Next.

451
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
30 in 1 minute.

452
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,160
1, 2, 3, 4...

453
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,120
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

454
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,840
20.

455
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,680
Amazing.

456
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,440
20 seconds.

457
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,800
Okay.

458
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,520
Congratulations everyone.

459
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,480
You've all earned my movie screening passes.

460
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,840
Now then,

461
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,160
let's go to the screening room together.

462
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,960
To the screening room, come on.

463
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,800
A Lian, lead the way.

464
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,960
Over here

465
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,200
The atmosphere is too lively

466
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,600
One will come soon

467
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,080
Bring out that little cutie

468
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,560
Something's fishy

469
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,320
Contrast

470
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,040
This must be that thing

471
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,680
Alright, everyone, this way please

472
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,680
I'll sit inside

473
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Why?

474
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,400
Sitting inside makes it harder to run later

475
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,600
Come on, move inside

476
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I'll sit in the middle, come on

477
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Are you ready?

478
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,040
Then next...

479
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,600
The premiere of this movie will begin

480
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,200
Isn't this us?

481
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,040
So handsome

482
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,360
How did it turn out?

483
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,080
Not bad.

484
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,680
Did Director He fly this drone shot himself?

485
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,400
Of course.

486
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,120
I don't believe it.

487
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,360
If you don't believe it, suit yourself.

488
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,840
Did I scare you?

489
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,720
As expected of Director He

490
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:26,880
No

491
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,080
This scene wasn't in my movie

492
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
Someone definitely tampered with my movie

493
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,720
Someone tampered with your movie?

494
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,360
The character Tole in my movie

495
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,040
He couldn't possibly know about Buddy

496
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,000
hidden in the abandoned space of Twitter's backend

497
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,640
Besides, Tole doesn't even know Buddy

498
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,600
Then why would he go looking for him?

499
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,800
to alter the "Cold Blood Academy" comic?

500
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Unless...

501
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,720
Absolutely impossible

502
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
"Cold Blood Academy"

503
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
It's changed

504
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,080
This movie has changed

505
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,240
This manga has changed too

506
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,080
Look

507
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,040
This Xiao Xi

508
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,640
He was clearly cursed before

509
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,880
and turned into a dinosaur's head

510
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,840
But now, why in this manga

511
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,320
he's back to normal?

512
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,600
It says Xiao Xi escaped the curse

513
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,560
So originally, he didn't escape the curse, right?

514
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes

515
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
In this manga

516
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,400
Xiao Xi was cursed

517
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,840
and became a dinosaur's head

518
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,400
But look at him now

519
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,920
He has a normal human head

520
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,360
Let me see again

521
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,200
All things return to one.

522
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,160
You say even ghosts are afraid

523
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,240
There are nine of us

524
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,080
Unity is strength, this power

525
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,520
Alright

526
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,560
Where did Director He and A'Lian go?

527
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,000
The work ID fell

528
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,040
Director He, Employee A'Lian

529
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,280
Pull it out and take a look

530
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,120
Feels like there are two

531
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,360
Yes, tear it open

532
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,120
There's a paper sandwiched inside

533
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,840
Mei Yun Lianlian

534
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,800
As far as I know

535
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,720
A'Lian, the new employee at Director He's studio

536
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,800
Was absent from the premiere due to illness

537
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,520
You could disguise yourself as A'Lian to sneak into the premiere

538
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,240
And kidnap Director He when the chance arises

539
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,560
Before that, you can hide in the props room

540
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,920
It's very safe there

541
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,520
The way into the props room is hidden

542
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,480
On Director He's poster

543
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
She kidnapped Director He

544
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
So that person just now was Mei Yun Lianlian

545
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,520
Yes

546
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,000
Let's open the props room first

547
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,840
Let's go

548
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,520
This is the props room

549
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,360
Favorite poster

550
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,600
Got it down

551
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,000
It fell down

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,280
Here

553
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,760
There's a clue here

554
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,920
Chaos inside the house

555
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,120
What kind of nonsense is "flying dogs jumping"?

556
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,160
You need to go in and input that thing

557
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,120
Input this

558
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,840
There's more over there.

559
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,080
Each one has it.

560
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,400
All have it.

561
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,320
There's none here.

562
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,480
Here, it fell down.

563
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,160
Don't be a sneaky thief.

564
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,560
Now there's chicken and dog thieves.

565
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,000
The whole household is in chaos.

566
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,080
Come, let's piece them together.

567
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,120
Let's see what they look like combined.

568
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,160
Now there's...

569
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,360
Probably chicken thieves.

570
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,800
Chicken.

571
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,520
This also means household chaos.

572
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
This also means complete pandemonium.

573
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,800
Complete pandemonium.

574
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,920
This means petty theft.

575
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,160
Petty theft.

576
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,880
Chicken.

577
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,360
Related to chickens.

578
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,120
Means there's no chicken.

579
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,160
No chicken.

580
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,960
Nonsense.

581
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,000
Playing with homophones again?

582
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,240
Only this one has a chicken in it.

583
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,280
Right?

584
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
5G rooftop.

585
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,200
Rooftop.

586
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,840
The clue is on the rooftop.

587
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,640
I'll cover up all the chickens, unless...

588
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,880
Cover up all the chickens.

589
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,040
No chickens here.

590
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,720
Should we cover up that character?

591
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,680
There's a chicken character here.

592
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,520
I don't have it.

593
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,040
I only have two hands.

594
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,840
We need one more person.

595
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,080
Take this...

596
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,040
Be careful.

597
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,600
Slow down.

598
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,520
Will this work?

599
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,160
Quick, gather together!

600
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,600
Don't move.

601
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,360
Wait a moment.

602
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,280
Stay still.

603
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
Don't worry, no one will jump out to scare you.

604
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't go.

605
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm here.

606
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
Watch out for that.

607
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,640
We can let go now, right?

608
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,560
Let go, careful, someone's coming down.

609
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
You guys up on top...

610
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,960
Take it slow.

611
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,920
Yes.

612
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,280
Easy does it.

613
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,200
Looks like the door opened.

614
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,720
Flashing

615
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,880
Then let's move forward slowly

616
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,800
Wait, hold on - I have night blindness

617
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay, give him a hand

618
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,080
Whose hand is this?

619
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,400
Mine

620
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,240
All things return to one

621
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,480
Brother Kai, slow down

622
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,560
One team

623
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,040
Is the door open?

624
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,880
It's open

625
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,000
You can come in

626
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,280
It's fine

627
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,320
No problem, come in, it's okay

628
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,160
Go inside, it's fine

629
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,840
Move inward

630
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,720
This is a suona

631
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,720
Wait, be careful - this door is too narrow

632
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,680
Careful

633
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,320
Don't push

634
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,720
Okay, after entering let's stand properly

635
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,280
No problem

636
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,920
Last person in, close the door

637
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,680
Okay

638
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,600
Alright, no problem

639
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,360
Stand still now

640
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,920
Everyone's in, right?

641
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,640
Stop moving

642
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,040
All in, good

643
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,600
Not bad

644
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,400
Hello everyone

645
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,840
Go

646
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,840
No, I'm getting a bit of photosensitive "epilepsy."

647
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,640
Let's go.

648
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
Wait, I can't see.

649
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,720
Can't see.

650
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,160
Just a little.

651
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,000
Take it easy, guys.

652
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,440
Come closer, closer.

653
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,920
Is anyone there?

654
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,560
Stop grabbing me.

655
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,640
Grabbing my armpits is uncomfortable.

656
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,400
Are you A'Lian?

657
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,080
No.

658
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,600
A'Lian was hiding in the props room at first.

659
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,840
Which one of you is A'Lian?

660
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,160
How was our acting?

661
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,120
Excellent.

662
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,720
Our acting skills...

663
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,520
...should get us selected.

664
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,000
For "Office Horror 2," right?

665
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Of course.

666
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,880
Do you know where A'Lian is?

667
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm not sure about Director He and A'Lian...

668
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,520
But I just saw a strange...

669
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,920
...woman in a qipao.

670
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,280
She was sneaking around...

671
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,560
...stealing evening gowns.

672
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,760
I think she's over there.

673
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,720
Yes, seems to be that way.

674
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,640
This...

675
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,560
This...

676
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
Let's go, sisters.

677
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,040
We'll come back for the audition later.

678
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,320
I feel like I touched something paper-like.

679
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,720
Paper? Is there a letter?

680
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,280
Read it.

681
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,760
"Trapped in days promoting health."

682
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
I often reminisce about the stage of Tui Le Men

683
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,840
As an orphan, I originally thought

684
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,760
I could make my mark there

685
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,720
But never expected

686
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,680
The day I ascended to Tui Lao Hui

687
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,520
would mark the beginning of my nightmare

688
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,560
My pancreas was cruelly removed

689
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,400
Then my corneas

690
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,680
Just one second before I was to be incinerated

691
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,560
a group stormed into Tui Health

692
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,680
I seized the chance to stumble

693
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,360
and escape to Wu Kenai River

694
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,920
Unexpectedly

695
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,080
I found Bei Ju

696
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,680
a note from another world

697
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,080
Another world

698
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,320
Yes

699
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,040
Because Tui Le Men was in 1924

700
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,760
and one was in 2048

701
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,400
Though hard to believe

702
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,680
subsequent events proved

703
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,920
I, Bei Ju, Xiao Xi, and Tuo Le

704
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,880
were all tragic figures sharing similar fates

705
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,160
That's why we call ourselves Group B

706
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,920
If there's any chance to change our fate

707
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,280
even the slightest possibility

708
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm willing to try

709
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,800
Bei Ju, Xiao Xi, Tuo Le

710
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,840
all share this tragic

711
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,440
Nine nines return to one

712
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,880
Brothers, there's something behind us.

713
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,640
Stop pushing against me.

714
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,840
Lian, don't run away!

715
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,880
Where is she?

716
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,520
We'll save you.

717
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,560
We'll save you, Lian.

718
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Lian, we know what happened to your cornea.

719
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,040
Even if you know my plan,

720
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,280
you can't stop Organization B.

721
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,000
Before the movie is re-edited,

722
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,320
I won't release Director He.

723
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,440
Won't what?

724
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,280
Won't release Director He.

725
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,880
She won't release Director He.

726
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,080
Which means she kidnapped Director He.

727
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,400
Right.

728
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,760
It's Mei Yunlianlian.

729
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,800
She time-traveled from 1924 to 2024,

730
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,520
then formed an alliance with Beiju, Xiaoxi, and Tole,

731
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,600
creating Organization B.

732
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,760
But why kidnap Director He?

733
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,520
Because she wants to

734
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,080
edit

735
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,120
She wants to change the movie.

736
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,760
Because she altered that comic,

737
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,120
Xiaoxi wasn't cursed.

738
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,800
Since both she and Xiaoxi belong to Organization B,

739
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,680
she hopes that by

740
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,280
changing the movie and comic,

741
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,160
she can save Xiaoxi from being cursed.

742
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,920
The curse of turning into a dinosaur.

743
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,840
She wants to change things herself,

744
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,520
to save herself.

745
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
By altering the movie.

746
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,160
So that woman earlier

747
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,560
was Mei Yunlianlian.

748
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,160
Now that we know this,

749
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,400
her motive is clear.

750
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,120
She kidnapped Director He

751
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,000
just to

752
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,920
change the movie.

753
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,480
So should we go to the projection room now?

754
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
We need to find a favorite portrait

755
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and find clues from it.

756
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,720
Find the portrait Director He's son loved most.

757
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,560
There's a portrait over there.

758
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,040
Right.

759
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,840
His favorite portrait

760
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,800
I see a line of small text here

761
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,440
Call out my name

762
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,800
Three, two, one

763
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,520
Bali

764
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,680
Young Marshal Ning's descendant

765
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,120
could never write a bestseller

766
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,280
Young Marshal Ke's descendant

767
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,800
will open the most famous shop in Tui Town

768
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,600
Young Marshal He's descendant can't win the Three Tui Award

769
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,400
No matter what, Young Marshal Ning's descendant

770
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,640
can't win the Tui Nobel Literature Prize

771
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:42,920
Years later

772
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,040
This seems like a logic puzzle

773
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,640
Their descendants each achieved

774
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,920
one of four accomplishments

775
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,760
won the Three Tui Award

776
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,240
won the Tui Nobel Literature Prize

777
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,880
published a bestseller

778
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,800
opened the most famous shop in Tui Town

779
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,920
Regarding the predictions about their descendants' achievements

780
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,960
only the one whose descendant opened a shop predicted correctly

781
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,800
So what achievements did the descendants of Bai, Ning, Ke, and He

782
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,360
respectively accomplish?

783
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,120
Young Marshal Ke's descendant will open a shop

784
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,720
Therefore Young Marshal Ke

785
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,360
was correct

786
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,040
Young Marshal Ke predicted correctly

787
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,720
because the one whose descendant would open a shop predicted correctly

788
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,360
That was Young Marshal Ke

789
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,920
But Young Marshal Ning might be lying

790
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,480
No

791
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,840
Not necessarily, it might not be this

792
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Right, I think one of these two is correct

793
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,520
One is right

794
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,440
Bai Youcai's descendant opened a shop.

795
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,720
I understand now.

796
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,840
His descendant opened a shop.

797
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
That means what he said was wrong.

798
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,360
He didn't win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

799
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,400
Young Master Ning's descendant wrote a bestseller.

800
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,840
Young Master He's descendant won the Triple Prize.

801
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,120
And then Young Master Ke's descendant...

802
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,480
won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

803
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,480
Is this correct? Let's verify.

804
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,320
Young Master Ning's descendant wrote a bestseller.

805
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,000
This proves Bai Youcai was telling the truth.

806
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,120
He didn't win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

807
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,240
Meaning his (Bai Youcai's descendant) opened a shop.

808
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,360
His (Bai Youcai's) descendant opened a shop.

809
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,840
That means what he said was wrong.

810
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,560
This proves Young Master Ke...

811
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,320
This proves Young Master He's (descendant)...

812
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,360
won the Triple Prize.

813
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,240
Young Master He's descendant won the Triple Prize.

814
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
Right? And then...

815
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,120
What's still missing?

816
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,960
We've accounted for the shop.

817
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,160
Only the Nobel Prize in Literature remains.

818
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,640
This means Young Master Ke's descendant...

819
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

820
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,680
No problem, right?

821
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,960
No problem.

822
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,320
So, do we need to trigger something?

823
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,720
I remember now

824
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,320
The password for the editing room

825
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,280
is the names of these people

826
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,840
Like the shop names and such

827
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,640
In the past, we had to go there to open it.

828
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:47,920
Go.

829
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,080
Let's go.

830
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,280
Let's talk one by one.

831
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,200
Bai.

832
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Bai opened a shop.

833
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,200
Ning.

834
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,960
Bestseller.

835
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,760
Ke Shaoshuai.

836
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,640
Nobel Prize in Literature.

837
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,480
He Shaoshuai.

838
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,960
Three-time grand prize winner.

839
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,200
It's opened.

840
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,040
What's wrong? What happened?

841
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,520
Just now, A-Lian threatened me.

842
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,560
She asked you to edit it, right?

843
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes.

844
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,880
She's not even from our company.

845
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,760
We know, we're aware.

846
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,040
Can you help me get my keys?

847
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,880
My keys should be on that box.

848
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,280
Help me undo this.

849
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,120
Can you tell us in detail now?

850
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,000
She tied me up and brought me here.

851
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,360
She made me edit the scenes in this movie.

852
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,200
The plot about Tole.

853
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,440
How should it be edited?

854
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,560
She said she wants Tole.

855
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,200
Not to board the No. 4444.

856
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,080
In my work.

857
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,440
Tole boarded the No. 4444 ship.

858
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,160
And then?

859
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,360
He disappeared on the Wukenai River.

860
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,840
4444.

861
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,240
Exactly.

862
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
Said this could end.

863
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
The tragic cycle of Zhen Tui.

864
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,440
He wants to change the editing to.

865
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,160
Tole.

866
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,760
Save Tole.

867
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,080
I sincerely apologize for today's premiere.

868
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,280
Because of what happened.

869
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,840
It's okay.

870
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,600
But as the director.

871
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,040
I think these things are sources of inspiration.

872
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,680
So I want to go back and revise the script now.

873
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,320
Alright, you can go. Bye.

874
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,440
Your phone.

875
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,720
Hello

876
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm Xiaoting, can you hear me?

877
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,600
Hello

878
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,040
Have you found any traces

879
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
of Organization B?

880
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
We've found some clues.

881
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,360
I've infiltrated

882
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,160
the robot scrapyard

883
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,960
where Bei Ju is located.

884
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm getting closer to uncovering Organization B's plan.

885
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,680
I'll send my investigation notes

886
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,720
to the screen near you.

887
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Your next steps

888
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,280
are also in the notes.

889
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,240
Good luck.

890
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,880
Okay, thanks.

891
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,160
Let's go check it out.

892
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,240
Take it slow.

893
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
The Secret of Tui Town

894
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,000
Actually, Tui Town has no river

895
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,680
The so-called Wukenai River

896
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,280
is actually a connection between four

897
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
four dimensions

898
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,520
The shape of Wukenai River

899
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,160
symbolizes an infinite loop

900
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,480
This infinity links four different dimensions:

901
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,320
The gaming dimension

902
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,200
The comic dimension

903
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,000
The film dimension

904
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,160
The novel dimension

905
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,920
Each dimension is created by

906
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,960
authors from higher dimensions

907
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,080
forming a closed loop together

908
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,600
If water from Wukenai River

909
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,840
is used to water the wooden cabinet

910
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,680
it can activate the dimension-breaking mechanism

911
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,360
to send messages to lower dimensions

912
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,680
According to my investigation

913
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,720
this book sunk at Wukenai River's bottom

914
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,160
"The Secret of Tui Town"

915
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,600
was accidentally obtained by Beiju from the novel dimension

916
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,040
Following the book's instructions

917
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,560
he gathered four people to form Organization B

918
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,800
Here's their plan:

919
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,040
If their plan succeeds

920
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,680
the stability between dimensions will collapse

921
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,840
causing unpredictable disasters

922
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,000
across all four dimensions

923
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,200
Their current plan is like this

924
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,280
The game dimension we're currently in

925
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,000
"The Mysterious Player"

926
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,080
"The Mysterious Player" is Director He

927
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
who created "Office Ghost Story"

928
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,480
and created the movie dimension

929
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Within the movie dimension exists a comic dimension

930
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,040
There's a comic dimension in the movie dimension

931
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,440
where Brother Bai created "Cold Blood Academy"

932
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,120
Under Tole's guidance, Xiaoxi

933
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,440
kidnapped Hu Jie

934
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,920
Hu Jie is the soft-handed novelist

935
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,080
who altered Beiju's fate

936
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,840
Hu Jie wrote "Five Elements" in the novel dimension

937
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,440
"Five Elements"

938
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,040
"Five Elements" was from 2048

939
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,880
Under Xiaoxi's guidance, Beiju kidnapped Goose

940
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
to change Meiyun Lianlian's fate

941
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,320
Goose the game designer

942
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,280
designed this "Mysterious Player"

943
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,640
It's a closed loop

944
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
So we must stop them

945
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,000
Next step

946
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,800
Xiaoxi's fate in the comic dimension

947
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,520
has already been altered

948
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,680
You must find a way to contact Tole

949
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,000
to have Brother Bai fix the comic

950
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,240
To contact Tole,

951
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,920
we need to water the wooden cabinet with Helpless River water

952
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,840
to send messages to the lower world

953
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,280
Water the cabinet - where is it?

954
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,280
Helpless River water

955
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,000
I know

956
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,680
It's that flower-arranging cabinet outside

957
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,520
Let's go check outside

958
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,120
Helpless River water

959
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,960
Wooden cabinet

960
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,760
This one, this

961
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,600
This is where we pour water

962
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,600
We need to find Helpless River water

963
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,520
Helpless River water

964
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,480
Is there any alcohol

965
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,520
mixed with Helpless River water?

966
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,960
Check its ingredients, right?

967
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,280
Produced in Tui Town

968
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,280
No

969
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,680
Tui Drunkard

970
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,560
All come from Tui Town

971
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,280
This

972
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,360
Tuixiangnong

973
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,040
Specialty brand

974
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,120
Contains 1% Wukenai River water molecules

975
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,160
Amazing

976
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
There's a pen here.

977
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
We might need to write him a message.

978
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,640
Tell Dilraba to change the comic.

979
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,400
Immediately.

980
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,480
Change it back.

981
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,000
Otherwise, neither you nor us.

982
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,160
will get away unscathed.

983
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
Change him back to a dinosaur head.

984
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,600
Please.

985
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,160
Okay.

986
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,920
Put it in.

987
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,240
Done.

988
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,440
Mission accomplished.

989
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,280
Let's see.

990
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,800
Whether Tole has relayed the message back.

991
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,720
We can only judge.

992
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
by the changes in the real world.

993
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,560
whether we succeeded or not.

994
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,920
So let's find a comic.

995
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,600
This one, "Cold-Blooded High School."

996
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,280
This.

997
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,600
Left behind a curse of despair

998
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,000
Red dress, bald head

999
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,680
Doesn't he look like a dinosaur head?

1000
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,760
Then just flip to the next page

1001
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,000
Turned into a dinosaur head

1002
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,040
Xiaoxi became a dinosaur head

1003
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,520
So we've broken this cycle

1004
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:20,720
Right

1005
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,240
We succeeded

1006
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,040
If we just leave now

1007
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,400
Wouldn't the game end?

1008
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,040
Let's try it

1009
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,480
Is anyone there?

1010
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,600
Can anyone hear me?

1011
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,720
This is Xiaoting

1012
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,640
I was accidentally captured

1013
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,920
Captured with me

1014
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,720
Is the game designer Keke

1015
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,560
Keke

1016
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
We're currently

1017
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,560
Probably locked in the Cyber Robot Pavilion's

1018
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,200
Secret Room No. 3

1019
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,720
They took my communicator

1020
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,840
So Keke can only use in-game items

1021
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,640
To communicate with you

1022
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,600
Let's go into the game

1023
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,440
Anyway

1024
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,760
Right now the Cyber Exhibition Hall

1025
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,560
Is full of dangerous robots

1026
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,680
Earlier in the VR Game Center

1027
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,000
I saw information about

1028
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,720
Forcing robots into hibernation

1029
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
It should be near the virtual harp

1030
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,480
This

1031
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,320
You should search carefully

1032
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,800
This

1033
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,800
Virtual Harp User Manual

1034
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,360
Play the harp

1035
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,960
Come

1036
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,960
Peng

1037
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,520
This harp serves as

1038
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,560
a security backdoor for Cyber Robots

1039
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
Play the following musical notes

1040
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,080
to put the robots in the exhibition hall

1041
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,680
into emergency hibernation for 1 minute

1042
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,240
The robots will wake up after 1 minute

1043
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,680
The harp has a 5-minute cooldown period

1044
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,360
Then play this sequence of notes

1045
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,000
Note:

1046
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,600
To put robots outside this exhibition hall

1047
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,640
into permanent hibernation mode

1048
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,360
you need to activate the permanent hibernation device

1049
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,760
Activate it using the reading pen

1050
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,480
Have you seen this?

1051
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,120
Tap to read the sensor point

1052
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,200
This, isn't it in that...

1053
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,840
a circle?

1054
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,720
The sensor point is in the hall

1055
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,680
Outside, in the hall

1056
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,520
So we'll use this one minute

1057
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,840
to go to Room 3

1058
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,440
No

1059
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,400
We'll use this minute

1060
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,960
to put them into permanent sleep

1061
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,920
Find the reading pen

1062
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,480
Right, we need to rush out to find the reading pen

1063
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,000
If we find the reading pen later

1064
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,600
we need to hold the thick end

1065
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,720
point it at the star on the left

1066
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,760
then swipe toward the center

1067
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,360
Like this

1068
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,040
Let's have one person play

1069
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,080
while eight others look for the stick, okay?

1070
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,840
Yes, that works

1071
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,640
Come on, get ready to play

1072
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,520
Like this, we'll do it like this

1073
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,120
We should leave one person here to watch the clock

1074
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,840
Okay

1075
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,320
Four of us can stay out

1076
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
Hide in the hibernation pods?

1077
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,560
Even with lights on, he can't catch us

1078
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,880
There are hibernation pods

1079
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,480
Okay

1080
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,120
I'll go to the hibernation pod room

1081
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,080
Then when the lights come on

1082
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,920
we can observe

1083
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,520
Let me test the hibernation pod first, alright?

1084
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,640
Before entering the pods

1085
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,680
we should try to find the switches first

1086
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,720
I'll do it, I'll count at the door

1087
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,440
You focus on searching

1088
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,360
I'll count second by second

1089
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,880
Okay

1090
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,480
Let's go, Pengpeng is already playing

1091
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,000
Come on

1092
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,840
Coming

1093
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,680
Go

1094
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,440
The door opened

1095
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,120
7

1096
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,800
8

1097
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,800
9 10 12 13 14 15

1098
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,080
Counting a bit slow

1099
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,600
16 17 18

1100
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,400
Counting too slow

1101
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,480
19 20 21

1102
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Feels like it's almost 30

1103
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:20,880
22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

1104
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm back

1105
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,120
Go back first

1106
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,760
Back, I'm back

1107
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,320
Hurry back

1108
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,760
56

1109
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,240
Quick

1110
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,200
Wait, let me take a look first

1111
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,720
Don't close it yet

1112
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,480
Just a quick look

1113
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,120
Mine

1114
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,360
I'm afraid he'll come in

1115
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,360
He's so scared

1116
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,840
No, I'm afraid you'll get caught

1117
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,480
I'm not afraid

1118
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,840
What about Hou?

1119
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,120
Hou

1120
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,960
How's it going?

1121
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,200
It's fine

1122
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,760
No problem

1123
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,760
We are the same kind

1124
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,400
There's a hint of that in his cry

1125
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,760
Mockery, right

1126
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,920
Big brother

1127
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,200
I've been captured

1128
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,720
I heard him say he's been captured

1129
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,680
Is anyone with you?

1130
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,240
Xiaoting is here

1131
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Where?

1132
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,280
Does Xiaoting know where the magic wand is?

1133
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,400
Where's the wand? The magic wand

1134
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,560
I haven't seen it

1135
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,160
But Xiaoting is with me

1136
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,120
My name is Xiaoting

1137
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,680
He can't...

1138
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,000
Can't hear him speaking

1139
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,520
How did you get captured?

1140
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,840
I'm looking for the pen

1141
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,640
Do you know where the pen is?

1142
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,800
Don't you know where the pen is?

1143
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,280
I don't know where the pen is

1144
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,240
I'm waiting for you to rescue me

1145
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,960
Now I need them to rescue me too

1146
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,000
Let's make a plan

1147
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,400
I'll go find Brother Hou

1148
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Let's still try our best to find it

1149
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,640
You go find Brother Hou

1150
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,680
We need to stay united, okay?

1151
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,120
Okay

1152
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,200
Elevate our purpose, broaden our perspective

1153
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,160
Alright, let's go

1154
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,040
Alright, get ready, brothers.

1155
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,760
Ready.

1156
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
这次是猥琐模式 好吧

1157
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,320
Go.

1158
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,600
Hurry up.

1159
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,280
Find Hou first.

1160
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,600
Where's Hou?

1161
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,080
I'm here.

1162
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,160
But I'm in jail.

1163
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,120
Don't worry about me.

1164
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,600
Do you know where the stuff is?

1165
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,800
I didn't see it just now.

1166
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,760
You'll have to look for it.

1167
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,720
20

1168
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,320
Can't find it

1169
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,880
How many seconds?

1170
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,040
45

1171
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,200
Go back a bit

1172
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,000
Where is it?

1173
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,400
49 50 51 52 53 54

1174
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,080
Come back

1175
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,120
55 56 57 58

1176
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,800
Don't close it, not yet

1177
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,080
59 60

1178
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,840
Not closing

1179
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,520
Keep looking

1180
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,200
Stop shouting

1181
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,560
You didn’t see anything

1182
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,280
Tell him to look

1183
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,240
Why are people missing?

1184
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,120
Who are you

1185
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,560
Me

1186
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,280
50

1187
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,160
Please

1188
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,440
Come in quickly

1189
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,360
Okay, wait a moment

1190
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,160
I'll go in first

1191
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,120
We're done for

1192
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,400
Okay, we're coming in

1193
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,120
Do we really have to come in?

1194
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,880
Hi

1195
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,960
Fall down

1196
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,720
Okay, I'm going out

1197
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,320
Fell down

1198
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,320
It hurts

1199
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,160
Behave

1200
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,440
Okay, wait—ow, that hurts

1201
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,560
Give me a hand

1202
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,680
Behave yourself

1203
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,880
How did you all get captured?

1204
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,280
Come on

1205
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,320
I'll do it myself

1206
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,680
I searched everywhere outside

1207
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,440
Didn't find anything

1208
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,000
Me neither

1209
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,880
I've been arrested

1210
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,800
I don't see where the stick is

1211
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,840
You can come out

1212
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,480
Can come out

1213
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,760
Go

1214
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,520
Go

1215
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,600
Scream

1216
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,160
I found the stick

1217
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,480
Where is it?

1218
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,560
Quick, play the piano!

1219
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,920
Mi Suo Re Mi Fa

1220
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,480
Mi Mi Re Mi Fa Re Do

1221
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,880
They've gone dormant.

1222
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,480
He's right at the door.

1223
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,720
Tap.

1224
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,400
It'll connect.

1225
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,240
Bottom left.

1226
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,160
Go bottom left, like this.

1227
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:43,680
Yes.

1228
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:44,960
Topmost.

1229
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,560
Above.

1230
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,440
Bottom.

1231
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,320
Swipe to the middle.

1232
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,720
Okay, it worked.

1233
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,280
Done.

1234
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,640
Done, it's lit up.

1235
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,560
Good.

1236
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,360
Not easy

1237
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,880
They're in permanent hibernation, right?

1238
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,960
They should all be in permanent hibernation now

1239
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,080
They didn't move when we turned on the lights

1240
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,600
That proves they're permanently dormant

1241
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,200
This... the access card

1242
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,640
The access card, the access card is here

1243
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,000
Open it

1244
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,040
We can rewrite the ending now

1245
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,320
Is it finally over?

1246
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:26,960
Yes, it is

1247
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,440
Oh my god, you guys are amazing

1248
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,080
Oh my god

1249
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,640
Your combat power is off the charts

1250
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,440
We're really so grateful to you

1251
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,560
Thank you for your contributions to Tui Town

1252
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,640
It was a pleasure meeting you all

1253
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,720
Hope we meet again someday

1254
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,840
Goodbye

1255
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,800
Goodbye

1256
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,480
The story of Tui Town comes to a perfect conclusion

1257
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,120
Thank you all for your wonderful performance in Tui Town

1258
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,120
Now

1259
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,320
The exit from the alternate dimension of Tui Town

1260
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,440
is now open

1261
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,960
Please exit the Tui Cyber Robot Exhibition Hall

1262
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,560
and return to the real world

1263
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,960
Okay

1264
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,280
Good work everyone

1265
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:09,920
Okay

1266
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,800
Okay, good work everyone

1267
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,400
Alright everyone, dig in

1268
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,080
Dig in

1269
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,320
This season passed in the blink of an eye

1270
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,080
We've basically

1271
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,680
received the reward we deserved

1272
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,040
How do you feel about participating in

1273
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,480
this season of "Start Using Your Brain"?

1274
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,600
Any thoughts?

1275
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,480
I think honestly

1276
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,560
At first I came with just

1277
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,040
an attitude of wanting to experience it

1278
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,720
But after coming here

1279
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,520
it was really quite fun

1280
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,320
It was really quite fun

1281
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,680
What about Zhuocheng?

1282
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,720
You've grown a lot.

1283
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,840
In what ways have you grown?

1284
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,160
Before, I always thought I was someone who...

1285
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,320
acts impulsively,

1286
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,400
or doesn’t consider the consequences,

1287
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,120
when doing things.

1288
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,000
But after joining the show, I realized...

1289
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,560
I truly learned that...

1290
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,360
after participating in *Start Using Your Brain*,

1291
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,160
and *Start Deduction*,

1292
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,280
I now feel that many things...

1293
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,640
require planning before action.

1294
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,680
That’s the biggest lesson

1295
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,760
I’ve taken away.

1296
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,280
From a warrior to a soldier.

1297
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,400
Became a general

1298
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,040
Both cultured and martial

1299
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,280
Yes, capable of commanding

1300
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,880
But I can really feel the change

1301
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,680
I think this recording session

1302
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,720
Made me rediscover this feeling after so long

1303
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,760
Just a few people

1304
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,520
Playing board games together—that kind of feeling

1305
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,200
So it was really joyful

1306
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,200
Like going back to high school

1307
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,000
That most carefree time

1308
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,320
Right, I actually want to add something about this

1309
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,400
This feeling

1310
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,520
Just now, Lin Hao put it perfectly

1311
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,920
I feel the same way

1312
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,480
I just think

1313
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,240
I could really let loose

1314
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
I felt like

1315
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,840
I’d returned to that version of myself

1316
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,600
In that especially happy environment

1317
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,680
And my biggest takeaway

1318
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,600
Was truly getting to know all of you

1319
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,040
Really

1320
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,440
Cry, everyone, cry

1321
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,200
First, I feel

1322
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,680
That coming here

1323
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
The luckiest thing for me was

1324
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,640
Meeting all of you

1325
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,160
I’ve learned so much from everyone

1326
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,400
Because everyone has their own strengths

1327
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,560
It’s a process of mutual learning and growth

1328
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
And shared happiness

1329
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,360
Okay

1330
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,120
Happiness again

1331
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,200
Yes, happiness again

1332
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,680
I realized that

1333
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,440
During every assessment

1334
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,840
I discovered my flaws

1335
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,800
It's about competitive spirit.

1336
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,280
Can't say it's bad.

1337
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,200
Right.

1338
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,320
Within the game rules.

1339
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,840
Everyone naturally wants to win.

1340
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,280
With a little encouragement, they definitely will.

1341
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,600
Okay.

1342
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,600
They'll surely do that.

1343
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,440
Alright.

1344
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,040
Good.

1345
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,280
Yes.

1346
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,040
So I think many games.

1347
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,760
Are very enjoyable to play.

1348
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,280
But.

1349
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,000
Just started getting into the rhythm

1350
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,160
and already want to play again

1351
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,000
So I really hope to play with everyone again

1352
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,640
Everything that happened here

1353
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,200
felt much more natural than I expected

1354
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
I'm quite introverted

1355
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,200
and not great at playing games with others

1356
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,920
But coming here

1357
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,400
I felt everyone was really considerate toward me

1358
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,200
And

1359
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,320
playing games together felt very close-knit

1360
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:10,840
and natural

1361
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,960
Like brothers

1362
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:12,920
Yeah

1363
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,680
I think these feelings

1364
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,880
are quite personal things

1365
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,840
That everyone's willing to share them

1366
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,480
shows we've really become family

1367
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,120
Now, our Zifan

1368
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,440
Listening to him made me feel guilty

1369
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,960
Because I...

1370
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,880
You didn't feel... okay

1371
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,600
No, that's not it

1372
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,520
Actually, I'm the complete opposite of him

1373
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,680
When I first arrived

1374
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,360
I didn't care about winning or losing at all

1375
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,160
But eventually I became

1376
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,520
increasingly eager to become the hall leader

1377
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,640
That was my transformation

1378
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,720
So I'm actually quite happy

1379
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,720
that we've all grown in our own ways

1380
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,920
Yes, we've all grown

1381
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,160
Every single one of us

1382
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,320
Well...

1383
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,280
I think we've all written down

1384
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,120
some impressions of each other

1385
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,400
So

1386
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,280
Let's start from the far right

1387
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,120
with Zifan

1388
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,240
We'll go one by one

1389
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
and share our thoughts

1390
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,160
Tell us what you wrote about everyone

1391
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,760
and why

1392
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
Alright, elaborate please

1393
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,160
Okay

1394
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:53,760
Shaoyang

1395
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,080
I wrote four words for Shaoyang

1396
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,200
Warm and intellectual

1397
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,600
Intellectual

1398
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,120
I can somewhat relate to being warm

1399
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,000
But how about intellectual?

1400
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,360
Please elaborate

1401
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,280
Shaoyang is a very warm person

1402
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,320
Especially in the earlier episodes

1403
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:05,880
He could sense

1404
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,320
When many of us felt uncomfortable

1405
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,320
When we were feeling

1406
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,080
Awkward or restrained

1407
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,960
He would always help us

1408
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,040
Zifan's crossing his arms again

1409
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,240
I should learn from that

1410
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,800
*Laughs*

1411
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,360
He's enjoying this

1412
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,600
So I think he's

1413
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,000
A very warm and intellectual big brother

1414
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,240
As for Brother Kai

1415
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,760
I wrote "just smile" for Brother Kai

1416
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,560
Because I always feel he has this

1417
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,680
"Journey to the end of water"

1418
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,760
"Sit and watch the clouds rise" vibe

1419
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,480
When that mental challenge

1420
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,440
Actually comes to him

1421
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,240
He would just say

1422
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
"Ha, bring it on"

1423
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,080
It's like

1424
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,320
He gives people that composed feeling

1425
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,520
Then Pengpeng

1426
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,720
What I wrote for Pengpeng was very simple

1427
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,760
I just wrote two words for Pengpeng

1428
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,720
Chess King

1429
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,840
We should do this

1430
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,440
Then he can't move

1431
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,440
Actually we can, why not?

1432
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,480
Will this get stuck?

1433
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,920
But we're getting another one

1434
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,400
We go this way, right?

1435
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,880
We're still missing a 2 here.

1436
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,040
We're still missing a 3 here.

1437
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,160
Here we go, I'm getting the hang of it.

1438
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,640
There's one thing I really admire about Pengpeng

1439
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,800
It's because Pengpeng

1440
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,720
fully embraces his strengths

1441
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,520
Everyone knows he's the Chess King

1442
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,280
What are you talking about?

1443
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,040
And he knows he's the Chess King too

1444
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,720
No, this is actually good

1445
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,200
I think it's an excellent quality

1446
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,400
To face oneself honestly

1447
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:28,600
Right

1448
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,280
Being honest with yourself

1449
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,840
And accepting yourself

1450
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,600
I believe

1451
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,760
Self-acceptance is a process in itself

1452
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,680
Exactly

1453
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,600
As for Minghao

1454
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,280
I'd describe Minghao as composed and calm

1455
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,320
Composed and calm

1456
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,880
Yes

1457
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,400
I've noticed that often

1458
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,880
Unlike the rest of us

1459
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,880
who might get flushed during games

1460
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,120
and visibly worked up

1461
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,200
To the point where

1462
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
our hands are shaking

1463
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,320
But Minghao always remains

1464
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,440
very steady

1465
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,120
Except that time you betrayed me

1466
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,360
Betrayal Room Two

1467
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,240
Hurry, I can't wait

1468
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,080
Betrayal Room Two

1469
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,520
Alright

1470
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,040
Okay, good

1471
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,040
Room Four

1472
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,640
In the following two rounds

1473
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,760
He got a little angry that time, right?

1474
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,920
His hands were shaking then

1475
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,680
You know?

1476
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,680
That kind of...

1477
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,480
Getting a bit heated

1478
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,720
Then there's Xiaolong

1479
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,960
What I wrote for Xiaolong was

1480
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,920
"A man remains a boy at heart until death"

1481
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,240
Because I just learned today

1482
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,080
Xiaolong is slightly older than me

1483
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,560
Actually much older

1484
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,080
Right

1485
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,720
With all

1486
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,520
including physically demanding games

1487
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,920
he stops holding back

1488
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,360
When he moves

1489
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,080
he seems even more agile than Zhuocheng

1490
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,000
So I think

1491
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,640
At that moment

1492
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,920
what truly radiated from him

1493
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,640
was that very charming youthful energy

1494
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,520
Then there's Zhuocheng

1495
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,200
What I wrote for Zhuocheng was "worth investing in"

1496
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,360
Actually I later observed

1497
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,200
that even when alone

1498
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,040
fighting solo

1499
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,240
he actually has the ability

1500
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,360
to handle all types of games

1501
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,680
That's why he's worth investing in

1502
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,960
For Zongyu I wrote "brainpower leader"

1503
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,360
Because I truly think Zongyu is

1504
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,640
I don't know

1505
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:49,960
No

1506
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,000
But in my impression

1507
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,640
I think he's the quickest thinker

1508
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,200
Maybe it's related to his age

1509
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,280
Then for Haoyang I wrote

1510
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,640
Boundless energy

1511
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,280
Perhaps he's genuinely strong and energetic

1512
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,040
It might also be related to age

1513
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,320
He's a few years younger than us

1514
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,160
Understood

1515
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,120
What about Haoyang?

1516
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,600
Let me start with Shaoyang

1517
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,440
I described him as full of vitality

1518
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,000
Another description is "the life of the party"

1519
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,800
Because Brother Shaoyang gives me the impression of

1520
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,400
being very warm-hearted

1521
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,320
He's really good at bringing

1522
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,520
joy to those around him

1523
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,320
As for Kai

1524
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,240
Actually I think he's more of a

1525
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,640
very kind person

1526
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,000
Compared to being rational

1527
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,080
I feel he leans more towards

1528
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,040
the kind-hearted type

1529
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,160
Then there's Yinpeng

1530
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,720
I wrote three keywords for him

1531
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,920
First is "Chess King"

1532
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,600
Second is "strong"

1533
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,840
Third is "adorable"

1534
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,000
What? "Strong"?

1535
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,480
"Chess King"

1536
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,320
His mental abilities rarely decline

1537
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,200
His rankings

1538
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,480
seem to consistently remain

1539
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,600
relatively high

1540
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,440
The "adorable" part is hard to explain

1541
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,480
It's just a feeling

1542
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
You know, a vibe

1543
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,800
For Minghao, what I wrote was

1544
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,240
rational, calm, and straight to the point.

1545
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,880
His comments often give me the impression

1546
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,040
that he always hits the nail on the head.

1547
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,240
Although he doesn't speak that much,

1548
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,080
For Xiaolong, I wrote three traits:

1549
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,240
one is competitive,

1550
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,120
one is diligent,

1551
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,280
and one is agile.

1552
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,440
Xiaolong and I only partnered in the final episode,

1553
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,720
but when I played games with him,

1554
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,720
although I didn't show it,

1555
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,280
I felt that

1556
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,920
our attitudes toward gaming

1557
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,000
were quite similar in many ways.

1558
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,440
As for agility,

1559
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,080
Xiaolong seems to

1560
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,280
excel in all physical challenges,

1561
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,000
performing exceptionally well.

1562
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,520
Except for those times he got hit,

1563
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,960
when I hammered him 17 times.

1564
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,200
Lightning Five-Whip Combo!

1565
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,880
I remember

1566
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,760
"Xiaolong, minus 8 points."

1567
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,400
Then Zhuocheng

1568
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,840
I wrote two words for Zhuocheng

1569
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,760
One is "considerate"

1570
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,840
The other is "good teammate"

1571
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,080
Because between Zhuocheng and me

1572
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,800
How was he considerate to you?

1573
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,520
Please elaborate

1574
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,920
For example

1575
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,960
Before the game starts

1576
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,360
Zhuocheng would cheer me on

1577
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,560
And even when I hold bottles

1578
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,520
He'd tell me which muscles to engage

1579
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,280
"Hold on, lock it in"

1580
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,240
"Engage your core"

1581
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,960
"Use your waist"

1582
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,200
"Time's up"

1583
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,240
These details make me feel

1584
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,160
If you were teammates with him

1585
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,960
he's considerate about countless details

1586
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,320
That's why I wrote "a good teammate"

1587
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,280
Next is Zongyu

1588
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,840
For Zongyu, I listed four keywords

1589
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,520
clever, free-spirited, impulsive

1590
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,960
and a walking encyclopedia

1591
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,480
When it comes to humanities

1592
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,040
including classical poetry and idioms

1593
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,880
he's like a

1594
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,520
living database

1595
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,640
seeming to know everything

1596
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,240
List ten works by Lu Xun

1597
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,280
"Call to Arms", "Wandering"

1598
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,280
"A Madman's Diary"

1599
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,440
"Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk", "Wild Grass"

1600
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,800
"Hot Wind", "Storm in a Teacup"

1601
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,000
"Village Opera"

1602
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,640
"From Hundred-Plant Garden to Three-Flavors Study"

1603
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,200
Correct

1604
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Please answer

1605
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:32,840
Lure the tiger out of the mountains

1606
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,560
Correct answer

1607
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,440
Practice medicine to save people

1608
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,280
Correct answer

1609
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,040
Drag through mud and water

1610
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,000
Correct answer

1611
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,760
Without changing facial expression

1612
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,680
Correct answer

1613
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,600
The land is picturesque

1614
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,440
Correct answer

1615
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,480
In my memory

1616
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,720
I believe it was

1617
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,640
a Chinese soprano singer

1618
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,160
who received the first resident ID card

1619
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,360
In the end, I wrote Zifan.

1620
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,400
Then I wrote three keywords.

1621
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,800
Pleasant voice, easygoing.

1622
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,160
And high emotional intelligence.

1623
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,160
About the first one "pleasant voice" - I think...

1624
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,520
his voice is truly pleasant.

1625
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,400
Indeed.

1626
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,240
And "high emotional intelligence" because I feel...

1627
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,800
Brother Zifan is really good at helping others out of awkward situations.

1628
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,920
This room is already full.

1629
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,240
No problem.

1630
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,520
I hope you two have fun.

1631
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,560
My two former teammates.

1632
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:14,960
Actually, I think

1633
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,080
If theirs was red,

1634
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,440
they wouldn't have

1635
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,240
to discuss this much.

1636
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:17,680
Right.

1637
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,600
The reason they're discussing

1638
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,160
is because it's black.

1639
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,640
That's why they need to discuss it.

1640
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,960
How about we place it here,

1641
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,200
then move this here,

1642
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,480
and block this path first?

1643
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,360
That could work.

1644
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:25,920
Blocking three this way...

1645
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,600
Yes.

1646
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,160
Very smart. Genius.

1647
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,200
It gives people the impression of being very emotionally intelligent

1648
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,360
Understood

1649
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,800
I'm not very good at describing things

1650
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,440
So I gave everyone the title of "handsome guy"

1651
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,040
But with different modifiers in front

1652
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,480
And I also drew some little sketches

1653
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,760
There are some below too.

1654
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,840
And actually, there are some on everyone's faces too.

1655
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,840
Some drawings.

1656
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,920
Shall we pass them around?

1657
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,680
And you...

1658
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,520
Okay.

1659
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,400
Can you remember it?

1660
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,120
I can remember.

1661
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,760
Then I'll follow the order of these episodes.

1662
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,000
The sequence of my partners.

1663
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,040
Because I've partnered with...

1664
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,360
everyone before.

1665
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,160
First is my partner from the first three episodes.

1666
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,400
Yang.

1667
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,680
My description for him is "macho man".

1668
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,280
Really tough.

1669
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,000
When facing certain challenges...

1670
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,120
you often have your own...

1671
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,120
unique perspectives.

1672
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,760
That is to say...

1673
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,560
For this game...

1674
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,720
my strategy is...

1675
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,160
First accumulate power pills in the middle.

1676
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,200
Put this here first.

1677
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,480
Then jump over here.

1678
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,000
There's already a simple bridge here.

1679
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,720
Then at this point...

1680
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,480
accumulate another power pill.

1681
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,160
Store these two here.

1682
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,360
This acts like a slingshot.

1683
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,720
Launch it like this.

1684
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,760
Then bring this back.

1685
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,000
Then launch again.

1686
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,920
Keep sending pieces here.

1687
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,680
Remember the last column is 3453.

1688
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,080
4 is upright.

1689
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,360
The rest are inverted.

1690
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,360
Then subtract it from 10.

1691
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,880
This has proven very successful.

1692
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,840
Right.

1693
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,000
The description I gave Brother Kai...

1694
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,240
is "handsome whisperer".

1695
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,080
But I drew two chess pieces for him.

1696
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,320
Wrote "first"...

1697
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,040
If Pengpeng is the Chess King...

1698
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,280
then Brother Kai should be the Chess Sage.

1699
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,880
I see.

1700
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
Clear a path

1701
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,960
Then we can stall him

1702
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,920
Because this is our only option

1703
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,440
Otherwise they'll finish setting up here

1704
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,640
And we'll be one step behind

1705
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,760
Then it'll be five immediately

1706
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,200
Place it here, then jump over

1707
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,240
This would be fatal

1708
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,680
And Brother Kai, I think he's someone

1709
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,960
who makes everything seem possible

1710
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,600
like there's always a turnaround

1711
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,160
Next is Brother Minghao

1712
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,800
My keyword for him is "cool handsome guy"

1713
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,080
"Cool" meaning

1714
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:32,960
Egg

1715
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,280
Person

1716
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,160
Not showing much emotional fluctuation

1717
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,120
Just calmly composed

1718
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,520
Within just a few words

1719
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,040
he demonstrates his capability

1720
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,800
And sometimes

1721
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,800
he sees through things clearly

1722
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,360
That's how it is

1723
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,440
Next is episode six with Long

1724
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,840
The mysterious handsome guy

1725
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,680
Sometimes he shows more

1726
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,800
than we expected

1727
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,160
More explosive power

1728
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,400
More powerful feeling

1729
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,480
Time starts now

1730
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:04,960
30

1731
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,760
Get him

1732
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,160
Long, Dragon Fist

1733
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,560
"Dragon Seize"

1734
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,640
It's too intense

1735
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,640
He's locked

1736
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,360
Chokehold! I'm in a chokehold!

1737
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,440
Stop! Time's up

1738
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,000
One

1739
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,920
Dragon card position

1740
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,920
Next is our Cheng

1741
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,160
Lucky handsome guy

1742
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,520
I feel Brother Hou is also

1743
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,760
someone with clear thinking

1744
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,760
and acts decisively when needed

1745
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,160
A very decisive person

1746
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,840
Right

1747
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,240
Then comes Zifan

1748
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,280
99-point handsome guy

1749
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,960
Last time his luck score was 99

1750
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,880
I also hope he can

1751
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,160
maintain this

1752
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,360
Not just 99-point luck

1753
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,600
but also 99-point ability

1754
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,000
Thanks

1755
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,160
And finally there's

1756
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,560
Pengpeng who partnered with me last time

1757
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,640
White Tiger handsome guy

1758
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,840
I'm truly impressed

1759
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,320
No

1760
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,400
I feel Brother Pengpeng is also

1761
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,880
very resourceful when facing challenges

1762
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,640
a very strategic person

1763
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,320
Actually quite decisive too

1764
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,440
Once you've decided on a strategy

1765
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,440
you act on it decisively

1766
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,360
Okay, finally there's Shaoyang

1767
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,120
I've already seen it, I don't understand

1768
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,080
The keyword I gave you is

1769
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,280
Handsome crazy guy

1770
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,920
I think it's the moment we need

1771
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,080
To provide us with some

1772
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,600
Very lively emotional support

1773
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,240
Just like our backbone

1774
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,400
Bringing us together like this

1775
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,680
Okay, that's all from me

1776
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,200
Okay, thank you

1777
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,000
Let's go

1778
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,920
The first one I give to Zongyu is

1779
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,680
The witty idiom king

1780
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,200
First, he's indeed very smart

1781
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,480
As the idiom king, I think

1782
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,560
When we play idiom games

1783
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,640
Zongyu basically never loses

1784
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,280
And he's basically always first

1785
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,640
So we gave him

1786
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,120
This title

1787
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,400
For Minghao it's "unpredictable"

1788
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,400
Unpredictable

1789
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,800
Sometimes he's amazing

1790
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,040
Other times at chess he

1791
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,760
Can't play at all

1792
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,760
Right, no points scored

1793
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,280
That's why he's unpredictable

1794
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,800
What I give Zifan is composure

1795
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,560
And exceptional memory

1796
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,440
Because I've partnered with Zifan for three seasons

1797
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,960
I genuinely feel his personality

1798
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,640
Or his choices

1799
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,560
Are quite composed

1800
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,800
For Pengpeng, I wrote:

1801
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,560
Cute, agile, handsome, elegant

1802
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,040
Elegant

1803
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,960
Because he plays the cello

1804
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,680
Wait, why are you reacting so strongly?

1805
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,920
It's not about you

1806
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,960
For Shaoyang, I wrote:

1807
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,200
The king of comedy

1808
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,160
Where's this "king" you speak of?

1809
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,040
Actually he's really good at perceiving

1810
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,640
the emotional changes in people around him

1811
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:36,680
Okay

1812
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,560
Then Haoyang represents youth and energy

1813
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,080
That's true

1814
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,600
I think Haoyang has brought

1815
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,160
this kind of element to us

1816
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,400
He's also mobilized our collective

1817
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,120
energy

1818
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,240
With my trembling

1819
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,000
Yes, so full of vitality

1820
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,080
Kaikai represents hard work

1821
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,760
dedication and diligence

1822
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,320
Because I've heard Kaikai say many times

1823
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,120
"I want to be number one"

1824
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,040
So Kaikai definitely wants

1825
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:57,960
to excel at these games

1826
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,680
Works very hard

1827
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:58,960
Right

1828
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,760
Then Xiaolong, first as Brother Long

1829
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,320
And also as the King of Buffs

1830
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,400
Brother Long really has

1831
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,800
so many qualities

1832
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,400
Another is being a true man

1833
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,600
For example in highly competitive events

1834
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,880
Brother Long gives his all

1835
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,880
Alright, that's my commentary

1836
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,040
Let me go in order

1837
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:16,800
First is Shaoyang

1838
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,000
I think he's the team's soul

1839
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,680
Without him we'd struggle

1840
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,200
to reach our current level of

1841
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,200
emotional connection

1842
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,480
We probably wouldn't have made it

1843
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,560
Thanks

1844
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,640
Brother Kai is very emotionally stable

1845
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,560
And very considerate

1846
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,400
Then Peng

1847
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,520
Actually shows maturity beyond his age

1848
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,080
A sense of maturity

1849
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,960
Because in private with Peng

1850
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,520
We've had casual chats

1851
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,880
I've noticed Peng has

1852
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,640
some very clear ideas about

1853
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,440
his life direction

1854
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,240
I think this is a great quality

1855
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,440
Understood, I know

1856
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,920
As for Minghao

1857
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,160
He's actually full of contrasts

1858
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,680
He's both the King of Great Jokes

1859
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,840
And the King of Bad Jokes

1860
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:55,840
As for Hou,

1861
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,960
I wrote "charge forward."

1862
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,840
Why did I write that?

1863
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,520
Because when Hou and I are together,

1864
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,360
we often just exchange a glance

1865
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,520
I know what you're thinking,

1866
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,960
and you know what I'm thinking.

1867
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,480
Especially when we're on the same team,

1868
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,400
Yes, you know my intentions

1869
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,760
So we often

1870
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,440
don't need to say much.

1871
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,240
We just charge ahead.

1872
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,080
Though I don't know where

1873
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,600
this feeling comes from,

1874
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,160
maybe it's because we share

1875
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,360
some similar personality traits.

1876
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,040
For Zongyu, I chose a word

1877
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,200
that might not be entirely accurate -

1878
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,080
"deer-like grace."

1879
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,080
It's like

1880
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,960
I feel it's a kind of

1881
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:21,880
ethereal quality.

1882
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,120
It's abstract, I just wanted

1883
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,040
to express this understanding.

1884
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:24,240
Right.

1885
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,440
For Haoyang, one word:

1886
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,200
"giving his all."

1887
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,560
He truly puts forth

1888
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,160
his full strength every time.

1889
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,400
But I think this is great

1890
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,800
because when you're young,

1891
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,120
you should be more expressive.

1892
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,440
Maintaining this attitude

1893
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,040
is completely fine, I think.

1894
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,440
As for Zifan,

1895
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,560
he's actually someone who

1896
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,360
comes up with unexpected moves.

1897
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,480
I think through observation,

1898
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,720
he accumulates these unique techniques

1899
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,880
and applies them.

1900
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,680
This is quite impressive.

1901
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,120
Yes.

1902
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,280
Let me start with Cui Shaoyang.

1903
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,000
I wrote "best MC" for him.

1904
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,040
At the very beginning,

1905
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,640
without his hosting presence,

1906
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,560
we probably couldn't have continued.

1907
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:58,920
But I think

1908
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,920
everyone might discover beyond his hosting

1909
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,000
that he's actually someone who—

1910
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,160
why he's called the best MC—

1911
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,760
you'd realize if he plays games,

1912
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,800
he's incredibly skilled too.

1913
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,520
Because every time

1914
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,640
during our post-game reviews,

1915
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,840
he offers

1916
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,040
his own insights on the game.

1917
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,920
Next is Huang Kai.

1918
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,440
Since Huang Kai

1919
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,200
and I previously

1920
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,400
interned at the same law firm,

1921
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,040
so

1922
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,000
this time I wanted to highlight

1923
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,040
something different from what

1924
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,880
I observed in the show—

1925
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,720
his chess skills.

1926
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,200
It's interesting how

1927
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,320
you get to see

1928
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,920
another side of someone

1929
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,280
you thought you knew well.

1930
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,480
That's how it is.

1931
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,280
For Ren Yinpeng, I wrote "master strategist"—

1932
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,120
whether in chess

1933
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,000
or strategy games,

1934
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,120
he excels exceptionally.

1935
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,560
Long Wo is described as a tough guy

1936
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,240
In all physical challenges

1937
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,040
he's extremely agile

1938
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,000
and exceptionally brave in battle

1939
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,840
Hou Zhuocheng is portrayed as immensely strong

1940
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,280
This strength

1941
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,200
first refers to muscular power

1942
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,680
and secondly, his boyfriend charm

1943
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,280
This is what I've observed.

1944
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,000
He's genuinely considerate and gentlemanly.

1945
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,720
In daily life, I've noticed

1946
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,160
he's also very caring toward others.

1947
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,240
So these are two sides of his great strength.

1948
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,320
Next is Yang Zongyu.

1949
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,920
I wrote "little clever one" for him.

1950
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,880
He's indeed very smart,

1951
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,400
and you'll notice

1952
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,800
besides being academically excellent

1953
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,800
(a top student),

1954
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,080
he also dances, paints,

1955
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,000
and has various hobbies.

1956
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,120
He tells all kinds of jokes too,

1957
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,160
showing his humorous side.

1958
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,080
So I think

1959
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,080
it's rare for someone to have both intellectual depth

1960
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,080
and an interesting personality.

1961
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,920
That's truly exceptional.

1962
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,360
Next is

1963
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,160
Yu Haoyang - I wrote "well-informed" for him.

1964
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,760
This actually partly comes from

1965
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,560
outside of gaming.

1966
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,640
Because Yu Haoyang

1967
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,000
often discusses movies with me,

1968
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,240
philosophy,

1969
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,240
and other concepts.

1970
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,840
I've noticed he's watched many films,

1971
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,760
many works,

1972
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,040
and read many books.

1973
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,040
So we can always have great conversations.

1974
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,200
Next is Dong Zifan.

1975
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,280
I wrote "poker face" for him.

1976
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,160
Because I think he's actually

1977
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:51,880
quite composed.

1978
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,040
I don't think I've ever

1979
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,760
observed in Dong Zifan

1980
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,120
any extreme emotional changes.

1981
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,800
It's like he always

1982
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,560
comes home and starts smashing things.

1983
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,120
She has a serene and unassuming demeanor.

1984
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,920
Just sitting there,

1985
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,120
his deep and steady voice,

1986
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,080
expresses things with great logic,

1987
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,840
and delivers very composed remarks.

1988
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
So I think

1989
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,000
this is my overall

1990
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,040
impression of his demeanor.

1991
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,040
Good.

1992
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,960
Very good.

1993
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,080
Pengpeng.

1994
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,840
Let me start with Shaoyang.

1995
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,040
For Shaoyang, I wrote "considerate,"

1996
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,560
meaning he's very understanding.

1997
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,040
That is to say,

1998
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,120
early on, he had a lively image,

1999
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,440
but later, he would

2000
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,800
encourage us to contribute more,

2001
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,640
or things like that.

2002
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,080
I just feel

2003
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,360
he's actually a very considerate person.

2004
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,560
As for Brother Kai,

2005
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,160
I wrote "approachable,"

2006
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,520
meaning his overall vibe is very

2007
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,440
unassuming and non-competitive,

2008
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,120
and he's an especially gentle person.

2009
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,640
Then there's Minghao

2010
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,480
I'll just write three words

2011
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,960
I'll write something meaningful

2012
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,720
I would think

2013
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,320
First, he doesn't have much output

2014
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,480
But when he does output

2015
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,360
it comes unexpectedly

2016
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,120
suddenly hitting everyone

2017
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,800
expressing everything that needs to be said

2018
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,680
perfectly conveyed

2019
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,600
Think about it, if you

2020
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,600
Whether you question or not

2021
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,880
you're actually elevating them to

2022
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,760
a higher position

2023
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,280
Consider

2024
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,600
If your questioning succeeds

2025
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,000
he loses

2026
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,400
If your questioning fails

2027
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,440
they'll move from their current

2028
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,080
third place to second

2029
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,400
For Brother Long, I wrote "indomitable"

2030
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,360
There are many

2031
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,000
spears of perseverance

2032
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,400
Perhaps Brother Long

2033
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,080
lost this round

2034
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,240
but in the next game

2035
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,120
he still maintains that fighting spirit

2036
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,760
and keeps striving forward

2037
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,520
That's why I find him truly tenacious

2038
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,960
As for Zhuocheng

2039
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,800
I wrote "sunny and cheerful"

2040
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,240
I feel he's particularly

2041
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,280
both physically strong and well-rounded

2042
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:41,720
I think

2043
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,560
he gives off a very approachable

2044
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,400
and friendly vibe

2045
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,840
Regarding Zongyu

2046
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,560
I find him exceptionally humble

2047
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,160
Because every time

2048
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,080
whether we're playing word games

2049
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,840
or memory games

2050
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,440
or any other challenges

2051
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,920
even when Zongyu wins

2052
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,280
he never reacts excessively

2053
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,320
He just seems

2054
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,560
to radiate genuine humility

2055
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,200
And then

2056
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,040
for Haoyang I wrote "brave and resourceful"

2057
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,600
When I first met him

2058
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,880
I thought philosophy students

2059
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,480
must be very cultured

2060
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,720
But later

2061
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,920
after several episodes

2062
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,440
I realized he's not just smart

2063
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,480
but also courageous

2064
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,600
with remarkable boldness

2065
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,680
I find him quite versatile

2066
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,960
For Zifan I wrote

2067
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,120
"deep, textured voice"

2068
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,440
Because since the first episode

2069
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,960
I noticed this quality

2070
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,840
that's quite distinctive

2071
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,560
So I

2072
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,440
Really?

2073
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,800
Yes, exactly

2074
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,600
And that's that

2075
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,280
Okay

2076
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,440
First let me say

2077
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,200
Zifan

2078
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,480
Zifan, I really think

2079
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,520
he's as composed as everyone says

2080
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,120
I haven't noticed

2081
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,160
many emotional fluctuations in him

2082
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,120
even when teaming up with him

2083
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,960
As for Haoyang

2084
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,400
I'd describe him as adorable

2085
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,080
Although he's quite tall,

2086
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,040
I've noticed that sometimes

2087
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,000
he can be quite adorable.

2088
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,480
And then,

2089
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,880
for Zongyu,

2090
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,000
I wrote "composed" -

2091
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,920
he does make decisive choices

2092
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,240
during games,

2093
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,000
but he remains very calm

2094
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,800
about the outcomes.

2095
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,200
For Zhuocheng, I wrote "motivated" -

2096
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,440
he gives me the impression of going all out

2097
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,000
when playing games.

2098
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,120
For Long, I wrote "driven" -

2099
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,840
during our team-up episode,

2100
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,120
his emotional shifts were quite noticeable.

2101
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,360
He wanted to win more than I did.

2102
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,400
While I keep my desire to win

2103
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,080
more controlled internally,

2104
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,480
he expresses it more outwardly.

2105
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,280
But I think that's good.

2106
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,480
For Minghao, I wrote "chill" -

2107
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,480
what I observed during our internship

2108
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,480
was quite different.

2109
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:48,680
He's changed.

2110
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,760
For Pengpeng, I wrote "energetic" -

2111
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,760
he's quite young,

2112
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,880
and his whole personality

2113
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,480
is full of vitality.

2114
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:57,840
Right.

2115
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,320
For Shaoyang, I wrote "joyful" -

2116
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,960
I've noticed whether he's present

2117
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,880
really affects us.

2118
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,840
It's not just about Shaoyang's absence -

2119
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,880
actually missing anyone

2120
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,120
creates a noticeable gap.

2121
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,240
Alright, that's all.

2122
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,320
That's it.

2123
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,080
We're about to reach the end of this episode.

2124
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,160
Or rather, this season's

2125
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:23,760
final segment.

2126
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,480
What is it?

2127
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,520
Hall Master's Consecration Ceremony

2128
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:37,920
Award Ceremony

2129
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,360
Alright

2130
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,200
Now is our season

2131
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,920
The most exciting moment

2132
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,400
The Brain Hall is about to be revealed

2133
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,960
The highest honor in 124 years

2134
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,200
The Ultimate Brain King

2135
01:11:59,040 --> 01:11:59,760
Applause

2136
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,080
Good

2137
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:03,840
This applause

2138
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,720
is to thank yourselves

2139
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,880
From the innovation wave of 1924

2140
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,640
to the retro trend of 1988

2141
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,920
From the visual boom of 2004

2142
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,400
to the cyber trend of 2048

2143
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,080
Now start thinking

2144
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,960
Great Brain Development

2145
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,160
handles everything with ease

2146
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,720
serving the residents of Tui Town at the Brain Exercise Hall

2147
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,160
Now

2148
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,840
let us announce the Ultimate Brain Master winner

2149
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,480
who will receive from Tui Town

2150
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,960
the Thousand-Tempered Golden Gourd

2151
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,040
This physician has over 124 years

2152
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,120
accumulated 420% brain power

2153
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,240
He has fully proven himself

2154
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,400
across all eras

2155
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,960
with extraordinary intellect and outstanding ability

2156
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,600
Who is he?

2157
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,000
Who could it be?

2158
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,320
He is

2159
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,440
Hu Minghao

2160
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,200
No

2161
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:08,560
Come on

2162
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,400
Now let's

2163
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,600
present our golden gourd

2164
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,120
Solid gold

2165
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,520
Made of pure gold

2166
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,080
Real gold

2167
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,080
Authentic golden gourd

2168
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,000
Real or fake?

2169
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,000
What's the current gold price?

2170
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,760
Alright

2171
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,600
Our previous hall leaders

2172
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,280
had one special privilege

2173
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,280
The choice

2174
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,000
of intellectual enhancement services

2175
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,920
But now we're skipping the enhancement

2176
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,840
You'll choose a physician

2177
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,320
to help you wear this sash

2178
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,920
and also put on this

2179
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,720
thousand-tempered, furnace-refined genuine golden gourd

2180
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,520
Can I choose separately?

2181
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,800
Sure, you're being particular

2182
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,440
Not really

2183
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,280
Just having two people assist

2184
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,160
No problem

2185
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,960
First I'll choose Pengpeng

2186
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,080
Because previously

2187
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:55,760
Well

2188
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,880
Until my last time as hall leader

2189
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,600
Every time I became leader, he was with me

2190
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,320
So I think

2191
01:13:59,320 --> 01:13:59,920
You want me to serve you?

2192
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,200
He deserves credit, much credit

2193
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,160
Let him put it on for you

2194
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,480
And this gourd?

2195
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,320
Who should put it on for you?

2196
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,400
Let me think

2197
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:08,960
Give me a moment

2198
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,440
Of course, everyone here is

2199
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,400
a very good friend of mine.

2200
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:13,960
But

2201
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,040
you started

2202
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,040
stirring up these fake emotions.

2203
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,280
Ultimate Brain King

2204
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,640
Who should give you the golden gourd pendant?

2205
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,600
Golden Gourd Selection

2206
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,760
For the golden gourd, I choose Huang Kai

2207
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,240
Because we've known each other for quite a while

2208
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,400
We've worked together professionally

2209
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,560
And collaborated in games too

2210
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,840
I feel we've witnessed

2211
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,440
Each other's different

2212
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,240
styles and

2213
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,360
various aspects as friends

2214
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:49,720
Let's do it

2215
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,120
The gold price is very high

2216
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,360
Alright, where's the applause?

2217
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,880
Thank you

2218
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:00,840
I really didn't expect this

2219
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,000
Let's still congratulate our Minghao

2220
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,480
for becoming our Ultimate Brain King

2221
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,640
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

2222
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,560
I'm extremely shocked

2223
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,360
Well...

2224
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,320
I never expected

2225
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,280
I didn't think to prepare for this beforehand

2226
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,680
It's just that I feel

2227
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,280
When I lost before

2228
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,480
we sometimes said it was just bad luck

2229
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,880
Like in the first two rounds with Long

2230
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,120
when we were building blocks

2231
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,160
we never scored

2232
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,240
but still came in second

2233
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,640
But I don't think

2234
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,840
that having this gourd trophy

2235
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,320
means I'm better than everyone else

2236
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,520
I'm really grateful to everyone this season

2237
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,560
for playing together

2238
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,640
And whether

2239
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,360
as teammates or opponents

2240
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,080
it's been truly enjoyable

2241
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:37,640
In my opinion

2242
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,680
this "Ultimate Brain" title

2243
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,080
should really belong to everyone

2244
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,760
That's the bigger picture

2245
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,600
So I think

2246
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,000
this just happens to be with me

2247
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,080
Thank you all so much

2248
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:48,640
It's been wonderful playing with everyone

2249
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,800
Let's take it down

2250
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,000
Just kidding

2251
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,480
Come on

2252
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,000
Alright everyone

2253
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,600
Let's give our most sincere applause

2254
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,760
to our Ultimate Brain champion

2255
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,400
Come on, everyone

2256
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,480
Let our applause echo through past, present

2257
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,440
and future

2258
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,840
Once again, congratulations

2259
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,960
to Hu Minghao, the winner of the grand prize

2260
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,120
As we move forward,

2261
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,600
we hope all members of the Brainstorming Hall

2262
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,400
will continue to surprise us

2263
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,960
Lastly, remember to keep smiling and love brainstorming

2264
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,200
Now, let’s all shout together

2265
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,080
our slogan

2266
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,600
Ready, three, two, one

2267
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,640
Start brainstorming

2268
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,600
