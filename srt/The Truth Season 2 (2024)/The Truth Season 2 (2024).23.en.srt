00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,880
Welcome back to

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,800
our show supported by

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,440
all you bulldozers out there

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,120
"Let's Push It! X"

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm Cui Shaoyang

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,800
Recently

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,600
the legendary ritual of Push Town

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
was quietly activated

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,280
Xiao Ba wanted to take away

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,560
a loved one who couldn't let go

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
but was accidentally killed

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,440
Through our relentless efforts

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,360
we finally managed

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,040
to uncover

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,720
the real culprits

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,600
Captain Ning behind the scenes

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,800
and X's accomplice

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
So how did Captain Ning

19
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,240
pass X's test

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
and how did these two

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
manage to deceive everyone

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,840
right under our noses?

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,880
Now let's all

24
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,560
"Let's Push It! X"

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,280
Noodles plus knife equals five

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,200
Ox divided by hair equals what?

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Noodles plus knife equals five

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,840
Noodles squared equals what?

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,480
Equals what?

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,000
I have no idea what this is

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
Noodles plus knife equals five

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,240
Flower plus door

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,440
What does this have to do with anything?

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,280
Noodles plus knife equals five

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
Hair minus middle equals what?

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,080
This...

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm stumped today

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,480
Seriously

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,480
Why can't I tell what this is?

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,280
My brain just won't work.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,560
Twenty.

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,960
Twenty-two.

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,360
Seventeen.

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,800
Eighteen.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,280
No

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,200
What?

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Don't know.

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,360
Two hundred.

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,320
Time's up.

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Couldn't solve it.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
My brain's not working today.

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,760
Noodles.

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,040
Noodles.

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,000
Knife.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,880
Knife.

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Didn't get it.

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Just reveal the answer.

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,280
Double-dealing.

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,960
Noodles plus knife.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,440
Noodles.

61
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,840
One two three four five six seven eight nine.

62
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,600
One two.

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,680
Nine plus two.

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Still doesn't equal five.

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,640
Nine.

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
A drop in the bucket.

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
Noodle knife.

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,200
Double-dealing.

69
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
Two plus three equals five.

70
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
A drop in the bucket.

71
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,000
Nine divided by one equals nine.

72
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,240
Equals twenty-four.

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,680
Did I calculate wrong then?

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,400
Equals thirty-two

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Because it's two-faced and all-encompassing

76
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,760
Comprehensive in every aspect

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,360
Two-faced

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,240
A wide variety

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,640
Five plus eight

80
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,280
Thirteen

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,760
Face plus blade equals

82
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,320
Two

83
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,520
Two-faced

84
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,800
Two faces plus three blades equal five

85
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
A hundred shots minus a hundred hits

86
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
Equals zero

87
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,360
Right?

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,600
I choose

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Hefu Garment

90
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Take a gamble

91
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,920
Let him experience X

92
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
Keligudu

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
It might be Keligudu today

94
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,360
No, we didn't choose him

95
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,040
You chose him

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,960
Right

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,880
I today

98
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,920
It's very likely X

99
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,840
No

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,640
Today's murderer is a complete idiot

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
This little killer

102
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
Don't play these games

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,920
There's no need

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,440
You'd say the same about me when you're the X

105
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,240
You'd still say this about me when you're the killer

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,520
Defaming me every day

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,800
It's very likely him today

108
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,160
Little ones

109
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,440
[unintelligible]

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,560
Let him first

111
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
Let him first

112
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,160
He'll be shocked when he realizes he's [unintelligible] himself

113
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
I can't take it

114
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,600
Let me see your eyes

115
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
A bit stiff

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,400
Your smile looks forced

117
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,840
He was the first to investigate

118
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,640
First round as X

119
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,320
Perfectly normal

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,880
Today X is playing with open cards

121
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,200
X is done

122
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,000
It's decided

123
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Extremely stiff, extremely stiff

124
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,280
One after another

125
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,400
No matter what I do, they keep framing me

126
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
Detective, what should we do now?

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,520
We need to unlock this box.

128
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,320
Right, right.

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,120
It's about our real ages.

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,560
First, Dad.

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,880
Dad, how old are you?

132
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm fifty-one.

133
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,200
Zero five one, right?

134
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
Zero five one isn't correct.

135
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,000
Five zero one.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
Still wrong.

137
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,200
You're missing eight years.

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,440
You should add eight years.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
We lost eight years of age.

140
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,080
Fifty-one, so I should be fifty-nine.

141
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
Zero five nine.

142
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,080
In this world of the deceased buddy,

143
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,160
we all vanished.

144
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,440
Right.

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
Back in 1980,

146
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,080
he witnessed our disappearance.

147
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,480
Yes.

148
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Then in 1988,

149
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,920
he experienced your disappearance.

150
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,320
Correct.

151
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,120
You two from 1980 were fine.

152
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,640
That feels a bit forced.

153
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,480
This 1988 and 1980 thing...

154
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,160
What I mean is we came here in 1980

155
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,880
Both of us might feel that

156
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,160
by 1988 this world became better

157
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
and the people around us suddenly reappeared

158
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,280
so we wanted to stay here

159
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,200
That's entirely possible

160
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Why wouldn't it be possible?

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,800
Actually, what I just

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
said follows this same logic

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,840
I'm not taking sides with him

164
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,320
but what I said earlier follows this logic

165
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,360
Everyone here today

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,080
has found the person they were looking for, right?

167
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
We need to figure out

168
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,480
why he wanted to kill Dilraba

169
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,080
The murderer

170
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,800
If we follow the logic of killing Dilraba

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,480
If he was the one who summoned us here

172
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,720
then some of us should have memories

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
of not wanting to leave this town

174
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,160
and wanting to maintain the current situation

175
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,280
Yes, exactly

176
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,440
No,

177
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
the main point is maintaining the status quo

178
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,200
is bad for everyone

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,880
Why is it bad?

180
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Each of us

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,640
has actually found the person we were looking for

182
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,200
Right, right

183
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,080
If we were the ones who "cast the spell" in 1980

184
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,920
then you four hadn't disappeared yet

185
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,720
But if it was someone who "cast the spell" in 1988

186
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,840
they could bring back

187
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,600
the two people who

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,280
disappeared in 1980

189
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,080
Exactly

190
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,480
So we should look at 1988

191
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,360
to see who disappeared last

192
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,040
The later someone disappeared, the more likely

193
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,640
they are the "spellcaster"

194
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,040
Who exactly is missing?

195
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,080
It's one of those two.

196
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Between the two of them,

197
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,520
we're just making blind accusations.

198
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,120
Pure speculation.

199
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
His motive is definitely stronger than hers.

200
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,120
He's more likely.

201
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,880
Because the three of us are here,

202
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes, our whole group is present.

203
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,280
But if I'm the killer after 48 days,

204
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,480
I'll vanish into thin air.

205
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,160
I know.

206
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Because when you return to reality,

207
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
you won't be able to contact us anymore.

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
You want to spend your final days

209
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,080
simply because

210
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,960
you can live with us.

211
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,040
These last 48 days.

212
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,560
Because you've regained all your memories.

213
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,520
You know everything now.

214
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,240
How can you prove I've regained my memories?

215
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Because you've seen it.

216
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,680
You've seen it.

217
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,800
How do you know I've seen it?

218
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,040
The problem is,

219
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,480
the killer must have seen it.

220
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,920
Yes.

221
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,680
This...

222
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,400
What proof is there that I did it?

223
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,160
We can't find any.

224
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
We haven't found the crucial evidence yet.

225
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,160
We need evidence.

226
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
I believe in evidence.

227
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Detective He, you need to speak up.

228
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,600
No,

229
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:40,920
Detective.

230
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,680
Say something.

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,760
Both of you, speak up.

232
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,440
They must have lit candles between them.

233
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,480
But how can we tell them apart?

234
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
I genuinely can't distinguish.

235
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
I don't understand.

236
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,320
Should I just confess then?

237
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,840
Vote quickly

238
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,120
Go vote immediately

239
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,600
Vote for Xiao Ba

240
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,280
Vote for Sis Ba

241
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,560
After this ends, go apologize to Sis Ba

242
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,880
The real culprit candidate

243
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,720
Sis Ba

244
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
The real culprit is Sis Ba

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,560
We voted for her in previous rounds

246
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
Or at least considered voting for her

247
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Voting for her again

248
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,880
I feel a bit embarrassed

249
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,160
Let's both vote for Sis Ba

250
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,360
Then we might still have a slight chance

251
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,240
If we vote for someone else

252
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,840
We'll have no chance at all

253
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,520
I should also consider Brother Ning

254
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
The real culprit is Captain Ning

255
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Captain Ning

256
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,520
Let's vote for him

257
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,120
Captain Ning

258
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
The real culprit is Wang the Overachiever

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
The real culprit is Captain Ning

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,120
Congratulations everyone, accusation successful

261
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,720
X is

262
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
Hekefu

263
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
My dear son

264
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,240
It's you

265
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,400
Faking it

266
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,560
Wasn't it supposed to be him?

267
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,440
We both thought it was him

268
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,080
Really

269
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,760
This X role has too much pressure

270
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,400
From the moment you enter,

271
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
if you show even the slightest hint,

272
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,920
the whole game would collapse.

273
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,080
How can you be so adorable?

274
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,880
Any tips for playing X well?

275
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,600
Like how to master X?

276
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,360
Yes.

277
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,200
The most important tip: ignore him.

278
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,800
He's the disruptive factor in X.

279
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,160
The biggest disruptive factor.

280
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,880
He's just bullying you.

281
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,080
He bullies younger players.

282
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,680
He picks on you both for being younger.

283
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,400
Honestly.

284
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,080
Am I the "X killer" or something?

285
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
Let me tell you, when you were X,

286
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,280
he really did bully me.

287
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
He bullied him too.

288
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,560
No,

289
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
how was I supposed to know you were X?

290
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,480
He has his own methods,

291
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,320
you know?

292
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,200
He pressures you,

293
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,560
and while pressuring you,

294
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,240
he observes how you react

295
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
to the pressure,

296
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,360
to determine if you're X.

297
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,120
Such a veteran.

298
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,960
Unfortunately,

299
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
both of you failed to escape.

300
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,360
But the process

301
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,680
was absolutely thrilling.

302
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,200
So what's the truth of the story?

303
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Everyone, please look this way with me.

304
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,240
Boss Tuo, Boss Tuo

305
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
I'm Captain Ning

306
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,800
February 13, 1988

307
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Thomas was poisoned during the company's 8th anniversary celebration

308
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,400
We found what he hid in his office

309
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,320
inside the clock mechanism cabinet

310
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
Only then did we learn about his favorite place to visit

311
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,640
After seeing a symbol

312
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,960
I suddenly realized this week was stuck in an endless loop

313
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,520
That night while having barbecue on the rooftop with everyone

314
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,960
I pondered about the nature of this time loop

315
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,720
Suddenly it hit me

316
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,640
I remembered his favorite spot

317
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,800
was the mirror on the company's first floor

318
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,440
I decided to check it out

319
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,360
Perhaps I could recover loop memories too

320
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,320
23:00

321
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,720
I excused myself from the rooftop

322
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,800
Successfully found the symbol behind the mirror

323
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,000
Indeed, a flood of memories came rushing back

324
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,240
But these weren't loop memories

325
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,640
Rather memories of many people and events

326
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,240
It turned out

327
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
I was actually the one

328
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,360
whose obsession trapped everyone in this loop

329
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,960
This all started eight years ago

330
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,120
It was a Sunday night

331
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,000
I encountered a severe thunderstorm while boating on the Helpless River

332
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,600
Completely lost my bearings

333
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,800
The harbor lighthouse strangely remained dark

334
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Just when I thought I'd perish in the river

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
the distant lighthouse suddenly relit

336
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,600
I finally made it safely ashore

337
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,600
After returning home I learned

338
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
the person who lit the lighthouse to save me

339
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,960
was actually my son

340
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,840
My usually timid son who feared heights finally overcame his fear

341
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,920
and became a courageous man

342
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,360
I was overjoyed

343
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,200
but never got to praise him in person

344
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,240
because he never came back

345
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,800
That night after lighting the lamp, someone pushed him into the river

346
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,840
He disappeared completely

347
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,200
After my son was killed,

348
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
my main motivation to keep living

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,640
was to find the murderer

350
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,760
and avenge my son.

351
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,000
But for eight whole years, I couldn't find the real culprit.

352
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,360
Until February 1st, 1988,

353
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,640
when I overheard a conversation

354
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,880
and learned that the company's general manager, Bei Guo,

355
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,400
was the real culprit behind my son's disappearance.

356
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,480
I planned to confront Bei Guo,

357
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,800
but he kept avoiding me.

358
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,040
Don't run!

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,080
I learned Bei Guo would take a business trip by boat on February 7th,

360
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,920
so I decided to intercept him on board.

361
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,040
My younger brother came to help

362
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,200
and went with me.

363
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,840
We boarded two separate boats,

364
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
but encountered a thunderstorm.

365
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,920
My brother vanished forever in the Wukenai River.

366
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,920
I was so focused on avenging my son

367
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,200
that I neglected my brother.

368
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,680
In the end, because of my obsession,

369
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,120
I caused my brother's disappearance too.

370
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,520
Filled with regret,

371
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
after my brother vanished,

372
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,920
I remembered

373
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,880
I had once accidentally obtained

374
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,120
an ancient book.

375
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,160
I immediately searched everywhere to find it.

376
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,120
It is recorded that

377
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,440
by performing a ritual at the River of No Return

378
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,880
I can enter the Town of Push

379
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,280
and reunite with my missing son and younger brother

380
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,080
But if I enter the Town of Push

381
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,960
I'll be trapped in a seven-day time loop

382
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,680
After the fourth cycle ends

383
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,480
I can never leave again

384
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,720
When the seventh cycle concludes

385
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,320
I will vanish completely

386
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,080
But this is exactly what I want

387
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,160
Let me spend forty-nine final days with my lost family

388
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,760
before disappearing forever

389
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,280
My adopted younger brother from next door discovered my plan

390
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,160
and tried to stop me

391
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
I warned him not to interfere

392
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,960
nor follow me into the Town of Push

393
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,440
After performing the riverside ritual

394
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
I successfully entered the Town of Push

395
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,640
but forgot about my son and younger brother

396
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,880
and also forgot about the ritual

397
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,520
Only after seeing the symbol behind the mirror did I remember them

398
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,520
But strangely enough

399
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,280
I still can't recall their faces or names

400
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,520
Even

401
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,240
the faces and names of our close neighbor family

402
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,520
have completely slipped my mind

403
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,640
At this moment,

404
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,280
I noticed there was an abandoned office behind the mirror.

405
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,960
There were signs of someone having lived there.

406
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,680
Some marbles were also placed there.

407
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,760
They were identical to the marbles

408
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,520
that fell from the bird-masked man the previous day.

409
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,360
This must be

410
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,560
the bird-masked man's hideout.

411
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,080
A few days ago, I noticed

412
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,160
the bird-masked man kept appearing near me.

413
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,440
He was acting suspiciously.

414
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,320
Could he be targeting me?

415
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,680
I entered the abandoned office to investigate.

416
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,920
I found a document called the "Miyong Plan."

417
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,160
From this plan,

418
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,240
I deduced

419
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,360
the true identity of the bird-masked man.

420
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,320
He is the general manager, "Bei Guo."

421
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,280
Eight years ago, he harmed my son.

422
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,440
After being exposed,

423
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,520
he hid his identity and stalked me,

424
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,360
waiting for a chance to silence me.

425
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,760
So I decided to kill "Bei Guo"

426
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,080
and take revenge myself.

427
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,320
Those who die in Zhen Tui

428
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,000
won't revive in the loop.

429
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,080
This way, it can be settled once and for all.

430
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,520
He will disappear forever,

431
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,160
unable to disrupt my family life.

432
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,400
I remember the ancient texts mentioning

433
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,640
I remember the ancient texts mentioning

434
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,920
that the skating rink is the only place

435
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,720
where Zhen Tui overlaps with the real world.

436
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,240
Through a switching ritual,

437
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,640
the Zhen Tui skating rink can be switched with the Tui Zhen skating rink.

438
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,480
I plan to use the overlapping space and switching ritual

439
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,680
to kill "Bei Guo."

440
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,880
At 4:10 PM on February 14th,

441
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,960
I left a note inviting "Bei Guo" to the skating rink warehouse

442
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,160
in his abandoned hideout.

443
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,880
I hid in the shadows,

444
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,280
making sure "Bei Guo" saw the note

445
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,360
before quietly leaving.

446
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
At 4:20, I arrived at the skating rink.

447
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,680
Used Tony's Five-Element keychain for the switching ritual.

448
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,040
Obtained the Push Incense Candle.

449
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,840
Within two hours,

450
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,520
by extinguishing the Push Incense Candle,

451
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,360
I could switch between the Push-Town and Town-Push skating rinks.

452
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,440
At 4:30,

453
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,240
I lit the Push Incense Candle at the rink's front desk

454
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,720
and entered the Push-Town skating rink.

455
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,160
From 4:30 to 5:00

456
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,720
I set up a delayed-action device in the warehouse of Tui Town skating rink

457
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,720
I tied a string to the trigger of the steel ball device

458
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,720
Then secured the device inside a wooden crate

459
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Aimed the device's opening toward a stool

460
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,480
Tied the other end of the string to a rock

461
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,480
Placed the rock on a shelf behind the crate

462
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,720
There was also a CD player on the shelf

463
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,360
The CD player's tray was positioned to face the rock

464
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,120
5:02

465
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,960
I inserted a one-hour CD into the player

466
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,960
The CD tray would automatically eject after playback

467
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Pushing the rock

468
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,280
Causing it to fall

469
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,240
Pulling the steel ball device's trigger

470
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,680
Which would then fire

471
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,960
A lethal steel ball toward the stool

472
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,920
5:45

473
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,760
I extinguished the incense at the rink's front desk

474
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,960
Returned to Tui Town

475
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,880
And placed a cursed CD

476
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,840
Into the warehouse CD player

477
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,280
After setting everything up

478
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,760
I quickly threw Tony's bag

479
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,240
Into the trash bin by the company entrance

480
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,840
And buried the five-element charms

481
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,720
I found at my home

482
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
Along with marbles "Beiguo" dropped while following me

483
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,520
In the potted plants on the company's first floor

484
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,040
Then return to wait at the skating rink's front desk.

485
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,880
Around six o'clock.

486
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,160
"Bei Guo" enters the warehouse.

487
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,480
He follows the instructions on my card.

488
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,040
After pressing the play button on the disc player.

489
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,960
Sits on the chair watching TV.

490
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,960
Then I light the incense candle.

491
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,640
Switch to the Tui Zhen skating rink.

492
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,680
Inside the warehouse.

493
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,320
"Bei Guo" sitting on the stool watching TV.

494
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,560
Is also switched to the Tui Zhen warehouse.

495
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,680
The Tui Zhen warehouse has a wooden box with a steel ball device.

496
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,720
The position of the stool.

497
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Matches the position of the TV stool in Zhen Tui warehouse.

498
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,840
Perfectly aligned.

499
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,160
When he's switched over.

500
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,960
His chest will be directly facing.

501
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,160
The marble device.

502
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,040
At the same time.

503
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,160
Inside the Tui Zhen warehouse.

504
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,840
The disc tray ejects.

505
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,440
Pushes the stone.

506
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,560
Pulls the trigger.

507
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,520
The steel ball instantly hits "Bei Guo".

508
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,760
Causing immediate death.

509
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Then I extinguish the incense candle.

510
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,720
Switch the skating rink back to Zhen Tui.

511
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,240
The TV in Zhen Tui warehouse.

512
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,560
Just shows the scene of a man shooting at the camera.

513
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,040
After completing everything.

514
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,960
I return home.

515
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Around 6:30, Hekefu and Kelidu came knocking on the door.

516
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,760
They asked us to check out the skating rink.

517
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,400
I pretended to know nothing about it.

518
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,800
Then we headed to the skating rink.

519
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,160
Thank you for watching this week's episode of

520
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,720
"Let's Push It! X."

521
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,960
To find out what happens next,

522
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,680
stay tuned for Shaoyang's breakdown next time.
