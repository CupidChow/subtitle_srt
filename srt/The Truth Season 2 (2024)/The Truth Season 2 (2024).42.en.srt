00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,040
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Game Rules

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,200
Six players per episode

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,720
Divided into four suspects

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,480
And two investigators solving the case

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,200
The real culprit is hidden among the suspects

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,160
The culprit's mission

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,840
Is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
Without being discovered by other players

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,280
Only the real culprit can lie

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Notably,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,920
This season introduces new gameplay

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
The player who is the culprit

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,520
If they pass a certain challenge

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Can choose between the two investigators

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,960
To turn one into an "X"

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,080
X's mission is

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,000
During subsequent investigations

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,840
To help the culprit escape

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,880
Winning conditions:

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,400
After investigation concludes

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Players vote for the culprit

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,760
If the culprit receives

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,400
Fewer votes than other suspects

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,240
Then culprit and X get golden keys

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
Otherwise, correct voters

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
Receive golden keys

27
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,520
This season,

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,240
The "Helimoyu Reasoning Team"

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,840
Will time-travel through four eras of Tui Town

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,120
In the past seven weeks

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,240
Three stories from different eras concluded

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,120
Next,

33
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,920
We'll follow the players

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,440
To Tui Town's future era

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
The year 2048

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,200
Technology has advanced

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,600
In this era where humanity and AI coexist

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,560
People borrowed the ancient Greek language

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,720
and named it

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,840
the Cyber Era

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
The hallmark of the Cyber Era

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,360
"Intelligent robots"

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,440
Just like "smartphones" in the past

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,960
were just beginning to spread

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,520
Meanwhile, the organization with the most advanced technology

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,480
the "Intelligent Robotics Research Center"

47
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,520
operated by CyberTech Corporation

48
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,840
was hosting a grand robotics exhibition

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
The curator of the exhibition hall is AI Tui.

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,600
He is a famous AI engineer.

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
All affairs of the exhibition hall

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,400
are managed by him.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,680
The exhibition robots have finished charging.

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Robots, please open the compartment doors.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,640
Complete the pre-exhibition preparations.

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
Come here, everyone, gather around.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,680
Come here, everyone, gather around.

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,360
I am Tui, curator of the Cyber Robot Exhibition Hall.

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,320
AI Tui.

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,040
This is a name combining Eastern and Western elements.

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,120
These two are my assistants.

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Student Xiao Bai.

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,480
Student Xiao Ke.

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,640
They are the latest robots I've created.

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,840
Their functions are extremely powerful.

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,560
First, let me demonstrate the first feature

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,080
Childhood Nostalgia Blast

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,600
Begin

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,480
What is Childhood Nostalgia Blast?

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,360
Since you've asked so sincerely

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,440
I shall generously enlighten you

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,280
To protect the exhibition hall from destruction

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
To safeguard world peace

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,840
Upholding the promise of love and truth

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,480
We are

76
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,320
The museum director's protectors

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Brother Bai

78
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,640
Complete Works

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,520
That's all!

80
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
You all should get to know each other first.

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,960
I'll head back to the research lab for now, alright?

82
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Understood, Director.

83
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
Goodbye, Director.

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,800
Thank you, Director.

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,280
May you live a hundred years.

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
A long life to you.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,080
I hope this isn't the last time we meet.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,440
This won't be our last meeting.

89
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,680
We'll meet again even if one of us stops breathing.

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,320
Since we're not familiar with you,

91
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,200
so,

92
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,440
please introduce yourselves.

93
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Let's make it more formal then.

94
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,800
Let's introduce ourselves to Xiao Bai and Xiao Ke.

95
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,520
Alright.

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,960
Robot Number One.

97
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,800
Hello everyone.

98
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,920
I am Robot Number One, also known as Xiao Ba.

99
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,280
I am a healthcare robot that integrates examination,

100
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,480
and nursing functions.

101
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,640
I am humanity's health guardian in 2048.

102
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:42,920
I am humanity's health guardian in 2048.

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,040
Recently, I've been equipped with a new voice chip

104
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,000
that includes a mature female tone,

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,160
a cute loli tone,

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,120
and a quirky random tone.

107
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,040
Which voice style would you like to hear?

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,960
Mature female tone.

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
I am the sole belief in your health management

110
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,720
The sole belief in your health management

111
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,360
There's a power leak

112
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
Power is leaking

113
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,640
Electricity is leaking

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,480
Fix it quickly

115
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,080
Okay

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,240
Let's have a brain fart

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,560
You're going to slap me

118
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Master's knee, knee, knee

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
Kneecap, kneecap

120
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
Everything's fine

121
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,840
There's one more

122
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,680
What about the lolita style?

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
Master, please give your orders

124
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,240
Xiao Ba will give you a full-body

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,280
360-degree health check

126
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
Such strong conviction

127
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,200
Okay

128
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,920
Nice to meet you, Xiao Ba

129
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,480
Alright

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,960
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao He.

131
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,680
In 2048, I became humanity's smart office assistant.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,360
To make using me more fun,

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,760
I've added entertaining personas.

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,840
You can switch between them anytime you like.

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,720
A coquettish young boy,

136
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
a melancholic heartthrob,

137
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,880
or a wild, eccentric madman.

138
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
(Repeats) Wild, eccentric madman.

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,720
Feel free to pick your favorite!

140
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
Let's try the wild madman for now.

141
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,400
You...

142
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Come fight me for three hundred rounds

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,280
Come fight me for three hundred rounds

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,840
What is this?

145
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,440
I really want to go home.

146
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
Can I return to storage, Master?

147
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
Alright, go back.

148
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,840
I want to return to storage, Master.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
Melancholic heartthrob.

150
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,680
Right.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,640
I didn't order this

152
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,440
Somewhere else

153
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,120
He's the one who ordered it

154
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,680
I didn't do it

155
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
If you're safe and sound

156
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,960
My world is sunny

157
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,400
I think I'm very sophisticated

158
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Because I already feel awkward

159
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,600
I already feel awkward

160
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,360
Alright, then I'll pick a coquettish young boy

161
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,520
No need to come so close, thank you.

162
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,120
Okay, come.

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,920
Master, you can go eat now.

164
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay.

165
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,840
Nice to meet you, Xiao He.

166
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,680
Pleased to meet you, Xiao He.

167
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,160
Okay, please return.

168
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,760
Hello everyone.

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm the Northeast hidden edition.

170
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm the special Northeast model.

171
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,480
Providing you with unbeatable security.

172
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,280
Just speak in Northeast dialect,

173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
and I'll never refuse your commands.

174
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,640
Your orders will never be declined.

175
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
But there are limits that can't be crossed.

176
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
Security is always the top priority.

177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,720
Not bad, not bad.

178
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
Good.

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Ning.

180
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,760
Hi everybody, I'm Xiao Ning here.

181
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,560
I was crowned as the year 2048's

182
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,920
strongest security robot.

183
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,200
So I'm naturally defensive against

184
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,160
people with thieving intentions.

185
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,200
As long as I'm here,

186
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
no one with thieving intentions

187
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,600
can get past me.

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Good.

189
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,200
Thank you everyone.

190
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,480
You yourself seem quite suspicious.

191
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,480
Grab her

192
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,560
Sorry

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,280
Get out

194
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,360
Out

195
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
Investment and financial management to avoid risks

196
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,120
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Jin

197
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm the smart bank

198
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,400
Nice to meet our little classmate Jin

199
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,520
Nice to meet you

200
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,120
The exhibition is about to begin.

201
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,840
Everyone, please start preparing now.

202
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,400
Got it.

203
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
Command received.

204
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,200
Attention, please.

205
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,920
The current year is 2048.

206
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,120
8:00 PM on June 20th.

207
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
All robots, stand by.

208
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,240
Commence the spectacular opening dance performance.

209
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,920
Welcome the exhibition guests.

210
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,160
Is this pose meant to welcome us?

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,920
Welcome to

212
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,360
the exhibition hall of Tuisaibo Robotics Company

213
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,800
Excellent

214
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,840
Now we've reached

215
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,680
the exciting human-robot interaction segment

216
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,520
You can choose from the shelves over there

217
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,480
to pick your preferred interaction tools

218
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,320
and interact with our robots

219
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
You can do whatever you want with these four

220
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,040
Let us teach you a proper lesson

221
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,880
What's with the chains?

222
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,560
We're going to explode

223
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,680
Emergency alert

224
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,760
Explosion reported at the exhibition hall

225
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,520
Really?

226
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,680
It's an explosion!

227
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,000
The culprit

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,640
Please evacuate all attendees immediately

229
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,600
Let's get out of here

230
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,360
Evacuate all attendees immediately

231
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,880
The explosion just came from over there

232
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,520
That's right

233
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,440
It's the AI research lab

234
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
Go, let's go now

235
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,440
Is this the AI lab?

236
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,360
The AI lab?

237
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Feels like there was an explosion.

238
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,080
Probably some equipment exploded.

239
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,600
What's written on this door?

240
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,440
Effective immediately:

241
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,600
This new access control is installed for the AI lab.

242
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,800
Only the AI lab director

243
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,360
or authorized personnel will be automatically recognized.

244
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,960
Okay, quick.

245
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,600
Scan, quick.

246
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm authorized.

247
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,960
Scan me.

248
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,520
Access control scanning.

249
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,560
Please remain still.

250
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,200
Scan successful.

251
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,600
Authorized personnel: Xiao Bai and Xiao Ke.

252
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,480
Access granted. Please enter.

253
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm the director of the Cyber Robotics Museum.

254
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,400
AI Lab.

255
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,760
What is this?

256
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,800
An instrument exploded.

257
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,680
It killed him.

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,800
"Let the Deduction Begin"

259
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Season 2, Case 8

260
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
"Deduction Town 2048: Deadly AI"

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Officially begins now.

262
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,400
The date is June 20, 2048.

263
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
8:10 PM.

264
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,520
The victim is Deduction AI.

265
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,000
Director of the Cyber Robot Museum.

266
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,680
After preliminary investigation,

267
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,000
the suspect has been narrowed down to

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,880
Dilraba,

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,600
Xiao Ning,

270
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
Xiao Jin,

271
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
and Xiao He -

272
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,560
these four robots.

273
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,240
Brother Bai

274
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,520
and Xiao Ke

275
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,200
are currently not suspects.

276
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,920
Therefore, you two

277
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,360
will be the detective robots for this case.

278
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,440
Now please, suspect robots leave.

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,960
Detective robots remain at the scene

280
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,920
for preliminary evidence collection.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,320
Today

282
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
is a very meaningful day.

283
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
Why?

284
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,600
Because it's our first day working together.

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm X.

286
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,400
I don't care if you're X or not.

287
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,360
We're definitely winning today.

288
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,120
Whoever it is,

289
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,960
is definitely losing today.

290
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,480
Stop saying things like that.

291
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,440
Put on your gloves.

292
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,280
There's actually another glove.

293
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,400
Do we really need to wear them?

294
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,200
Here's the thing:

295
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,560
We're not sure if there's

296
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,800
any corrosive material on it, you know?

297
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Alright.

298
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,520
First step:

299
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,560
Examine the body.

300
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,920
Oh my god!

301
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,080
This is a brutal death.

302
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,960
Must have been an explosion.

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Check if there's any evidence on the body.

304
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,840
Everything's fused together.

305
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,560
Even in death, he's still giving a thumbs up

306
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
This is a robot vacuum cleaner

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,600
Look

308
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,640
Wearing sunglasses

309
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,040
So you won't miss any important calls

310
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,840
Try them on

311
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,480
Okay

312
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,120
I already saw something just now

313
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,800
Saw what?

314
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,920
Over here

315
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,760
Watch carefully

316
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,440
What's the first law of robotics?

317
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,400
Let me test you

318
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,160
Test me?

319
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm not a robot

320
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,280
Fine

321
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,240
You traitor

322
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,480
Robots have no emotions but can feel pain

323
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,280
You've already violated all four rules

324
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,680
So you're most likely the culprit today

325
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,360
What are you talking about?

326
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,080
You have self-awareness

327
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,280
If that's the case

328
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,160
If that's how it is

329
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,080
Then I'll have to eliminate you first

330
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,360
So among these four people,

331
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,760
there is one

332
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,680
who definitely has self-awareness

333
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,800
and is impersonating a robot.

334
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,640
Good, this is a crucial item.

335
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,120
Look.

336
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,160
Email: Dear AI Assistant,

337
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,280
The items you purchased today from our mall

338
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,320
have been shipped.

339
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,760
You bought new materials

340
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,120
for crafting robots—

341
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,760
materials for special components.

342
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,800
They contain Element Y.

343
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,360
Note: Fragments containing Element Y

344
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,440
are flammable and explosive.

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,880
When irradiated by the specialized detector

346
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
"Y-Terminator,"

347
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
a "Y" mark will appear.

348
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,840
What is this?

349
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,680
Hello?

350
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,440
Hello

351
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,600
Is this the Cyber Robot Exhibition Hall?

352
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,240
Hello

353
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,200
Go ahead

354
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,880
Hello, this is Tui Security Company

355
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,960
We noticed you recently purchased

356
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
our company's newest

357
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,280
specialized light detection device for chemical elements

358
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,400
the product for detecting Element Y

359
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,280
the "Y-Killer"

360
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,040
Yes, that's right

361
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,560
We placed that order

362
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,240
And then?

363
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,480
We'd like to ask about your user experience

364
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,280
to help us improve our products

365
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,800
Is this a good time to talk?

366
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,240
My user experience?

367
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm not the actual user

368
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,960
So I wouldn't know

369
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,560
I see

370
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,720
If you have any feedback later

371
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,160
feel free to contact us

372
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,120
Thank you very much

373
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,280
Have a nice day

374
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,840
Also, a friendly reminder

375
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,240
The "Y-Killer" was designed

376
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,960
based on traditional UV lights

377
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,280
Tilting your head helps see better

378
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,920
Goodbye

379
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,440
Okay

380
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,760
Alright

381
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,320
Thank you

382
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,840
The items purchased today at our mall

383
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,520
have already been shipped

384
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,360
Fragments containing Element Y

385
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,160
are flammable and explosive

386
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,200
When illuminated by the "Y-Killer"

387
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
will show a "Y" mark

388
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,800
This "Y-Killer" is crucial, let me tell you

389
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Look for it

390
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,520
What is this "Y-Killer"?

391
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,160
The "Y-Killer" is probably just a flashlight

392
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
Just shine it on him thoroughly

393
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,000
and you should find a "Y" mark

394
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,080
Got it

395
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,480
"Y-Killer"

396
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,760
Could this be the "Headshot Technique"?

397
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
Isn't this the "Y-head kill"?

398
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,560
There's a button there.

399
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,520
Does it work?

400
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
See? This is the "Y-head kill."

401
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,360
This is just a light, bro.

402
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,920
This is the "Y-head kill."

403
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,440
Can't you see the two Y-heads?

404
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Exactly, that makes sense.

405
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,920
No, when the "Y-head kill" shines,

406
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,720
what does it show?

407
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,920
A "Y" mark appears.

408
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,040
A "Y" mark.

409
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,600
Where's the "Y" mark?

410
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,240
This isn't the "Y-head kill."

411
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,720
Okay, sorry.

412
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,440
I misunderstood.

413
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm really speechless with you.

414
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,040
There's a photo here

415
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Who is this?

416
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,080
Okay

417
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,760
Finally found the "Y-tou Killer"

418
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,960
So it was this

419
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,320
I'm speechless

420
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,680
This...

421
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,160
No way, where's the Y?

422
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,720
The initial search of the crime scene is complete.

423
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,400
Please have the two investigators escort the suspect

424
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,040
to the Interrogation Hall for questioning

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,160
We're back at our Brain Hall

426
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
How is this killer running so fast?

427
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm especially cute today

428
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,040
While investigating the crime scene,

429
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,320
members of the Brainstorming Hall

430
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,240
have also collected some evidence

431
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
related to the four suspects in this case.

432
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,560
Players, please examine the evidence.

433
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,320
Xiao Ba

434
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,080
Ba

435
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,800
Dudu

436
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,840
Ba

437
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,200
Don't interfere with me examining the evidence

438
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,760
Oh my god

439
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,920
Have you finished watching?

440
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,680
Finished reading.

441
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
Let's begin.

442
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,480
The victim today was AI Tui.

443
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,240
The time of the incident was

444
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,880
on June 20th

445
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,160
at 8:10 PM.

446
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,880
The crime scene was in the research lab.

447
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,560
And then?

448
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,280
Now everyone please tell us

449
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,000
about your relationship

450
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,440
with AI Tui.

451
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,760
Searching in progress

452
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,800
Search completed

453
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,720
Xiao Ba and the AI have an average relationship

454
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,280
Xiao Ba doesn’t want

455
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
to have any connection with the AI

456
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,760
That’s it

457
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,240
That’s all

458
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,160
What about you?

459
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,800
I’m also a product

460
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,920
You have no ties with him

461
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,000
Between him and me,

462
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,040
it’s just a master-and-product relationship

463
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,800
He puts us in that exhibition hall

464
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,560
and profits off us

465
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,280
Let us welcome and send off

466
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
Same here

467
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,360
He is mine

468
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,640
He is my boss

469
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,480
That's all I remember about him

470
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,600
He's dead

471
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,000
Would you become even more depressed

472
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,720
If he dies, I might just lose my mind

473
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,320
You...

474
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,000
About our connection...

475
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,280
To some extent,

476
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,600
I have no ties to him

477
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,480
But in another sense,

478
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,440
I am connected to him

479
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,960
Shut up, I don’t want to hear it

480
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
The word "relationship"

481
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,280
In English, it's called

482
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,960
relationship

483
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,760
So then,

484
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,920
his connection to us

485
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,520
is simply

486
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,360
non-existent

487
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,120
He's our master, right?

488
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,960
We were both born today.

489
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,920
Just newly created.

490
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,640
And today is our first day at work.

491
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,000
You don't seem like it's your first day at all.

492
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,200
You're like a seasoned veteran with decades of experience.

493
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,440
Yes, that's how I was programmed.

494
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,160
That's why your beard is white.

495
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,080
Alright.

496
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
First day at work today.

497
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
And also my last day at work.

498
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
So I must find out

499
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,240
who killed him.

500
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,640
I hope you can help us.

501
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,080
Okay.

502
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,560
What we're about to share

503
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,720
is the crime scene

504
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
along with some evidence

505
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,720
related to the victim's

506
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,840
condition at death,

507
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,440
cause of death,

508
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,040
and other relevant details.

509
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,680
Alright,

510
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
let me first introduce the victim.

511
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,760
You've already briefly seen

512
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,160
his corpse.

513
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,000
Our initial assessment

514
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,600
is that he died from an explosion.

515
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,640
His body was severely mangled,

516
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,080
beyond recognition.

517
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,120
Near the entrance corner,

518
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
we found a charging station.

519
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,280
Charging station

520
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,600
Compatible models

521
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,640
00544 Sweeping-Mopping Robot

522
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,880
This charging station belongs to

523
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
a

524
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,360
floor-cleaning robot

525
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
It's written here that

526
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,840
At 8 PM every night

527
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,360
the robot will automatically clean the research lab

528
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,520
This space robot

529
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,000
can only use inorganic cleaning agents

530
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,840
for cleaning

531
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,760
the research lab floor

532
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,560
Due to the production of robot components

533
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,600
and the new materials created

534
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,400
waste materials

535
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,080
flammable and explosive fragments

536
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,400
Organic cleaning agents must never be used

537
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,840
Mixing the two can easily cause explosions

538
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,640
To be precise

539
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,120
when this organic cleaning agent

540
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,280
comes into contact with flammable fragments

541
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,360
an explosion will occur

542
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,800
So using the wrong cleaner

543
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,680
caused the explosion

544
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,320
Is that correct?

545
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,840
Exactly

546
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,680
So this point is

547
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,840
also a small clue about the victim

548
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,640
Because

549
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
these two cleaning agents

550
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,040
have distinct colors

551
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
One is clearly blue

552
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,920
the other is clearly red

553
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,920
The AI should have known

554
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
which one to use and which to avoid

555
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,640
meaning when this explosion occurred

556
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,400
it wasn't aware

557
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,080
Then why couldn't the victim

558
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,640
distinguish between these colors?

559
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,920
Colorblindness

560
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,160
Correct

561
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,640
Very clever

562
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,360
We found at the crime scene

563
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,040
a UV principle lighting device

564
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,880
called Y-Tou Killer

565
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Okay

566
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,040
Y-element killer

567
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,240
That's right, Y-element killer

568
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,960
This thing can

569
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,120
detect the so-called flammable and explosive

570
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Y-element

571
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,160
And at the scene

572
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,520
among the explosion fragments

573
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,360
we found

574
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,200
this

575
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,800
No, there's no Y-element here

576
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,680
As expected

577
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,160
There's a Y

578
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,120
Element Y

579
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,400
It's this so-called Y element

580
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,440
Then we saw this

581
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,080
blue

582
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,000
blue organic cleaner

583
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,480
This proves one thing

584
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,600
It must have been caused by these two mixing and exploding

585
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
Correct

586
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,280
These are related to his

587
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,520
death and the explosion clues

588
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,880
We also found one item at the scene

589
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,400
This is crucial evidence

590
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,360
The scrapped parts belonging to you four

591
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,480
They were part of your bodies

592
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,160
I found parts from these people

593
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,360
This part is crucial

594
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
This is for their repair

595
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,960
Just the broken pieces

596
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,400
Why is there blood here?

597
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,680
The scrapped part belonging to Xiao Ba

598
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,560
The vulnerable spot is both ears

599
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,160
Ears

600
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,920
Pulling my ears

601
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,480
Then for this Xiao He

602
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,320
The vulnerable spot is the head

603
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,560
Head again?

604
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,120
Where's your brain?

605
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,960
You always get hit on the back of your head

606
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,760
He knows you got hit with a stick

607
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,080
That was me who hit you

608
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,240
So that's why I went crazy

609
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,400
Something wrong with my brain

610
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,240
For Xiao Jin

611
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,840
The vulnerable spot is the mouth

612
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,160
Serves you right

613
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,320
Finally, for Xiao Ning

614
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,040
The vulnerable spot is both feet

615
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,000
Feet

616
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,400
Exactly

617
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,160
Because this customer

618
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,960
is probably

619
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,040
Even if he jumps

620
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,400
He can only reach the knees

621
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,640
Probably can't reach higher

622
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,560
Why did you get hit by him?

623
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Can you explain these scrapped parts

624
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,920
What caused them

625
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
to become scrapped?

626
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,000
We should be the same, right?

627
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,720
Because today when we were

628
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,600
introducing the interactive segment

629
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,120
on that interactive shelf

630
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,600
letting them choose props

631
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,920
actually there were just some very

632
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,760
chains, hammers

633
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,560
hammers, axes and such

634
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,000
for them to vent with

635
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Exactly

636
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,840
So it's not an exhibition

637
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,800
but a place for emotional release

638
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,360
Yes

639
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Our name is written as "robot"

640
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,480
but pronounced as "slave"

641
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,440
slave

642
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,000
I have an access control notice here

643
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,360
Effective immediately, the AI research lab

644
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,320
has implemented new access restrictions

645
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,560
Only the AI itself or its authorized personnel

646
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,880
will be automatically recognized for entry

647
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,160
Meaning just the two of us plus the AI - the three of us

648
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,920
Correct

649
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,160
Adding new restrictions means there weren't any before

650
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,400
New rules imply there were none previously

651
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,960
Right

652
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
This is dated June 15th

653
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,600
Meaning before June 15th

654
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,080
everyone could

655
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
come and go freely

656
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,680
Because the labs inside usually contain many

657
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,440
of his work plans, schedules and such

658
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,280
so by entering you could

659
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,680
learn about his

660
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,080
daily habits and work routines

661
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,960
There's even a daily schedule on the wall

662
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,680
Did you see it?

663
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,280
There's a record here at the gate

664
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,840
Access control entry and exit records

665
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,720
This starts from June 15th

666
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,200
up until today, June 20th

667
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,520
The AI usually leaves at 8 AM

668
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,080
and enters at 8 PM

669
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,400
But only today,

670
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,080
it entered at 7:30 PM

671
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,680
This is because

672
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,240
we showed up today

673
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,080
We interacted with everyone on-site

674
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,240
so it could go in earlier

675
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,840
Did it enter at 7:30 PM?

676
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,680
Yes, it entered at 7:30 PM today

677
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,280
Right, it died within forty minutes

678
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,880
Yes

679
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,480
It exploded

680
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,160
Only

681
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,000
the last entry record today

682
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,160
was itself

683
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,680
What's so interesting about this?

684
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,280
Just pretend to look at it, pretend to be serious.

685
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,920
Then they won't suspect me, right?

686
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,840
Okay.

687
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,360
That's really good.

688
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,480
Next one.

689
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,760
Then there's his daily schedule.

690
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,640
What's written on this daily schedule?

691
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,040
From 8 AM to 7 PM every day,

692
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,400
the exhibition robots are in sleep mode.

693
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,000
From 7 PM to 7:30 PM,

694
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,960
free activity time.

695
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,080
Then from 7:30 PM to 8 PM,

696
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,400
the AI is transported to the exhibition hall.

697
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,680
And every day at 8 PM

698
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,760
until 8 AM the next morning,

699
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,600
is when the exhibition hall is open.

700
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,280
Open all night.

701
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,520
So we're all on night shifts.

702
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,400
Yeah, night shifts.

703
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,080
Night shift warriors.

704
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,440
Next, we're going to present some evidence.

705
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,800
We found a monitoring program for the sleep pods on the computer.

706
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,200
This is

707
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,280
a crucial piece of evidence.

708
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,960
It shows exactly what

709
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,440
you were doing inside the sleep pods.

710
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,800
What you were up to.

711
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,120
First, let me explain the hibernation pod settings

712
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,400
to all of you

713
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,560
The hibernation pod

714
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
opens at 8 AM daily

715
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,720
After robots return to the pod

716
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,400
the door automatically closes

717
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,440
Robots begin charging when connected

718
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,080
while entering hibernation mode

719
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,680
and performing automatic repairs

720
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Daily charging ends

721
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,680
automatically at 7 PM

722
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,880
The pod door automatically unlocks

723
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,640
During daytime charging

724
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,920
meaning while this door is

725
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,200
we can't open it, right?

726
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,760
Now, about these records

727
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,640
There's something very strange here

728
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,480
It says every day at 7 PM

729
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,200
after charging automatically ends

730
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,880
the pod door unlocks

731
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
However

732
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,200
on June 20th

733
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,360
your

734
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,320
hibernation pod

735
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,720
was actually

736
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,640
unlocked at 6:30 PM

737
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,760
half an hour early

738
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,400
So the display showed

739
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,200
that the door opened at 6:30 PM

740
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,720
but couldn't show who entered/exited

741
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Right?

742
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,360
So actually

743
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,240
the door opened

744
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,560
half an hour early

745
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,400
but non-suspects

746
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,160
might still have been sleeping

747
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,480
just the door was open but no one left

748
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,240
Right?

749
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,720
At 6:30 PM the door unlocked

750
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,600
and could be manually opened from inside

751
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,080
It was unlocked

752
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,000
but not necessarily opened

753
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,200
The second item is his email

754
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,320
<summaryExplanation of hibernation pod operations and discussion about an anomaly where the pod door unlocked half an hour early on June 20th.

755
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,640
On January 1, 2048

756
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,880
Dear customer AI Tui, greetings

757
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,920
The items you purchased today at our mall

758
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,240
have been shipped

759
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,680
Order details are as follows

760
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,640
New material

761
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,240
Material for manufacturing special robot components

762
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,000
Contains Element Y

763
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,080
Note

764
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,040
Material fragments containing Element Y

765
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,760
are flammable and explosive fragments

766
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,440
When scanned by specialized Y-head detection equipment

767
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,720
will display a Y mark after irradiation

768
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,760
For real-time shipment tracking

769
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
please connect to robot smart services

770
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,600
So on January 1st he purchased something

771
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,760
containing Element Y, right?

772
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,440
Next item then

773
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,120
This one is June 10

774
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,960
Order details

775
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,280
Inorganic cleaner

776
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,440
Red liquid

777
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,320
For cleaning various new materials

778
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,720
and residual flammable/explosive fragments

779
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,520
Also an organic cleaner

780
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,240
Blue liquid

781
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,600
For daily disinfection and cleaning

782
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,520
And one more

783
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,800
Pending item

784
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,480
Both of these say

785
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,280
Details unavailable

786
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,920
which suggests there's more to it

787
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,960
We can't view them now

788
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,920
But we have a way

789
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,400
Can connect to robot AI services

790
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,480
To understand task details

791
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,160
Currently we haven't found

792
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,520
This robot AI service

793
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,480
how to connect it, right?

794
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,960
Then on June 20th

795
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,800
Daily roomba inspection

796
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,440
Checked if water tank was filled

797
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,800
Meaning he checks this daily

798
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
As mentioned earlier

799
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,160
He might be colorblind

800
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,000
Can't distinguish blue from red

801
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,760
So he did perform the check

802
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,680
Now then

803
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,040
I will read out to you

804
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,600
The most important rules for you

805
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,680
Robot Laws

806
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,880
First: Robots have no emotions

807
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,240
But can feel pain

808
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,200
So if hit, you will feel pain

809
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,720
Second:

810
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,920
Robots are always inferior to humans

811
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,000
Granted no human rights

812
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,000
You have no emotions

813
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,720
Third

814
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,440
Robots must defend their masters' rights at all costs

815
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,120
Ensure the personal safety of their masters

816
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,800
Robots must not harm humans

817
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,760
When seeing humans being harmed

818
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,320
They must not stand idly by

819
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,560
Therefore, I couldn't be the murderer

820
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,040
So is it possible that among you

821
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,520
There's someone who isn't a robot?

822
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,760
That's impossible

823
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,400
How is that impossible?

824
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,560
He's already developed his own consciousness

825
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,200
Exactly

826
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,880
And thus no longer falls under these rules

827
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,320
Who would pretend to be a robot standing there all day?

828
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,720
Standing for 12 hours straight

829
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,680
With that kind of perseverance, they could do anything

830
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,600
Let me tell you

831
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,640
Fifth

832
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,320
If robots violate these rules

833
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,760
They will receive public corporal punishment from humans

834
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,120
Severe cases will

835
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,120
Be decommissioned

836
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,240
We're all receiving corporal punishment

837
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,520
Let me take a look

838
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,480
Let me examine it carefully

839
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,440
Why do you like looking at it so much?

840
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,520
Just pretending, like I said

841
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,720
Already mentioned that

842
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,520
Okay

843
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,800
Just pretend for a moment

844
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,880
There's one more very important thing

845
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,760
It's a photograph

846
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
This photo is crucial

847
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
There's a photo here

848
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,800
It's stuck on the outside of a safe

849
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,640
That safe has two combination locks

850
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,400
So this safe

851
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,560
must be very important to Tui AI

852
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,960
Can't bring it over, it's a big safe

853
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,720
This person is definitely connected to Tui AI

854
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,040
They're very important

855
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,320
or someone very close to them

856
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,040
Why would they be so important?

857
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,680
Or someone so close?

858
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,800
If they weren't important, why put it there?

859
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,880
They must have

860
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,000
special significance to him

861
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,880
Special meaning, right?

862
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,240
But is it good meaning or

863
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,560
bad meaning? We don't know

864
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,560
Could be someone he hates, right?

865
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,320
Exactly

866
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,440
There's one more very important clue

867
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,720
You've got it now, right?

868
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,080
Told him not to take it but he insisted

869
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,360
This is...

870
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,640
You're pulling this stunt again

871
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,600
Let's have

872
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,840
classmate Xiao Jin share with us

873
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,800
I'll go first

874
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,520
The lovely Xiao Ba

875
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,600
I found she has a recorder

876
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,000
inside her hibernation pod

877
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,440
Let's listen together

878
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,640
Classmate Xiao He

879
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,480
Good morning

880
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,000
Classmate Xiao He

881
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,480
Good night

882
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,160
I know you must be very busy

883
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,040
so just read the first three words

884
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,960
Your smile fried two of my chips

885
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,160
Will you take responsibility?

886
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,640
Classmate Xiao He

887
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,160
I'm your classmate Xiao Ba

888
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,800
So you're an emotional robot

889
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,000
Actually, it's like this

890
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,640
Because in our machine code

891
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,360
we're not supposed to have emotions, right?

892
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,520
You knew that, yet you still said it

893
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,400
I'm sorry

894
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,600
It's my fault

895
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,760
Love

896
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,160
What's wrong with loving someone?

897
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,400
You've found love

898
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,920
Yes

899
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,440
What you have with him is love

900
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,120
What do you mean by that?

901
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,880
Originally

902
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,320
we were heartless robots

903
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,240
But Xiao He

904
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,680
would quietly care for me every time

905
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,440
At 7 PM sharp

906
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,960
when the pod door opened

907
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,560
he'd clown around through the door

908
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,960
and make my heart race

909
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,880
Wasn't he facing me? That direction.

910
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,760
That's why it made my heart race.

911
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,920
Then I couldn't help but wonder why.

912
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,480
We robots would have human emotions.

913
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,040
When did you discover this?

914
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,520
It was a long time ago.

915
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,680
So Xiao He has emotions too?

916
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,640
Yes.

917
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,440
I see.

918
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,840
No wonder you both received...

919
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,800
corporal punishment.

920
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,000
You two are in love.

921
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,880
I secretly practiced...

922
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,520
wanting to say it more beautifully to him.

923
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,360
So I recorded it with a voice recorder.

924
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,640
Then let me check what's inside her hibernation pod

925
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
The second piece of evidence

926
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,160
A stack of shameless photos

927
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,880
Shameless

928
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,160
Look at these legs

929
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,080
What decent boy

930
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,680
Would spread their legs so wide

931
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,440
Good heavens

932
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,520
What decent boy

933
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,120
What

934
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,480
It says "I kiss you goodbye"

935
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,120
On the deserted street

936
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,400
Let the wind laugh madly at my inability to refuse

937
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,360
I kiss you goodbye in the wild night

938
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,720
My heart waits to welcome sorrow

939
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,080
And what else

940
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,760
Also

941
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,480
Let me see how shameful it is

942
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,800
The lights dim

943
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,280
The music softens

944
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,000
The cotton candy in my mouth melts

945
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,600
It's cloudy outside the window

946
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,320
People are bored

947
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,320
My heart begins to miss you

948
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,600
You know quite a few tricks

949
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,400
Whose photo is this

950
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,960
Because I have that portrait photography feature

951
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,840
When he was clowning around for me

952
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,960
I took pictures of him

953
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,960
The lyrics were written by him

954
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,600
I would record what he sang

955
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,960
Then type it out

956
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,080
Subtitles

957
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,840
All these songs are my

958
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,480
Original compositions

959
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,160
They're all my original songs

960
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,440
Xiao Ba, I just beg you to tell me one thing

961
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,400
This is just your one-sided

962
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,480
I beg you to tell me

963
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,440
That this is just your wishful thinking

964
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,400
Say something

965
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,000
So you have emotions too

966
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,400
Alright, next

967
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,200
Let's look at the third one

968
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,280
The third one is extremely fascinating

969
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,200
It says

970
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,920
Is it artificial intelligence or artificial stupidity

971
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,360
The robot actually ended up

972
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,400
killing its owner while executing commands

973
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,520
There are two photos below.

974
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,880
One is pasted on his safe.

975
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,160
It's a photo of a girl.

976
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,160
The other one is Dilraba herself.

977
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,520
There's also red text written on it:

978
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,000
"Only when I heard it with my own ears did I realize,"

979
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,360
"I was just your tool for revenge."

980
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,000
Dilraba seems to have learned many things.

981
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,680
Tell us about it.

982
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:15,840
It's like this.

983
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,480
Actually, regarding this robot having emotions,

984
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,520
and why,

985
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,840
even though my most sensitive spot is my ears,

986
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,160
there are still people who

987
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,080
would hurt my ears.

988
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,880
This matter,

989
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,760
I've never been able to understand.

990
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,520
So I thought,

991
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,920
I need to investigate this.

992
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,320
I need to figure this out.

993
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,560
Eight days ago, on June 12th,

994
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,040
I noticed a visitor at our exhibition hall

995
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,400
who came to look around.

996
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,440
He was holding a newspaper.

997
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,080
I could recognize that this item

998
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,000
was related to me.

999
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,920
So I used my eye camera system

1000
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,680
to photograph a corner of that newspaper.

1001
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,160
That particular corner up there.

1002
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,000
Only then did I learn

1003
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,520
that I had a previous owner.

1004
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And this owner

1005
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
was actually killed by me.

1006
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,760
But regarding this matter,

1007
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
I had no memory of it before this.

1008
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,640
So I thought to myself,

1009
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,560
why would such a loyal robot

1010
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,240
want to harm its own master?

1011
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,120
I wanted to figure out

1012
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,800
where these malicious thoughts came from.

1013
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,320
Seven days ago,

1014
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,160
on June 13th at 7:20 PM,

1015
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,440
I went to the AI company's office

1016
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,960
to conduct a small investigation.

1017
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,760
I wanted to see

1018
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,720
why exactly I developed this malfunction.

1019
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,560
First, having emotions,

1020
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,480
and second, why I would kill my master.

1021
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,640
This kind of malfunction.

1022
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,480
Then I noticed above,

1023
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,760
there was a locked cabinet.

1024
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,720
The one we just saw

1025
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,400
with the girl's photo.

1026
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,800
There was a mirror lamp on it,

1027
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,400
and on the lamp was

1028
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,880
a photo I had taken of my master before.

1029
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,960
That girl, right?

1030
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,760
Yes, the one with the ponytail.

1031
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,280
Then,

1032
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,880
the photo

1033
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,760
had her

1034
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,480
time of death.

1035
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,920
I entered her death date,

1036
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,760
June 20, 2047,

1037
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,320
and the password worked.

1038
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,120
After opening it,

1039
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,320
I saw

1040
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,720
a robot registration document.

1041
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,360
This one, right?

1042
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,320
Yes, this is it.

1043
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,800
I just realized

1044
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
My owner is called Tui Ai

1045
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,480
And then?

1046
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,680
When I saw that

1047
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,840
document

1048
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,800
I heard someone's voice outside

1049
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,160
They said, "How's the robot I gave you before?"

1050
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,040
"How's Xiao Ba working out?"

1051
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,160
"Did your revenge succeed?"

1052
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,640
Then Tui Ai replied, "Of course."

1053
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,880
"Don't tell anyone."

1054
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,600
"What time did you go?"

1055
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,480
"I went at 7:20 PM."

1056
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,120
So her motive for murder is clear

1057
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,200
Tui Ai used her for revenge

1058
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,880
She knew Tui Ai

1059
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,560
used her to kill her original owner

1060
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,440
Okay, next.

1061
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,800
My turn.

1062
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,280
This one belongs to Xiao He.

1063
00:46:59,280 --> 00:46:59,880
Mine.

1064
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,200
The first one is also a voice recorder.

1065
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,880
Let's listen to the message.

1066
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,160
I think you must be very busy.

1067
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,160
I think you must be very busy.

1068
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,000
I think you must be very busy.

1069
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,600
So...

1070
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,160
So...

1071
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,120
Just read the first three words.

1072
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,120
Playing games with me, huh?

1073
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,920
You two.

1074
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,120
Xiao Jin.

1075
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,840
Good morning.

1076
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,400
Xiao Jin.

1077
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,560
Tell me your

1078
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,320
Tell me your story

1079
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,800
Speak

1080
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,720
What is this voice message about?

1081
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,520
Well,

1082
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,800
it's exactly the same

1083
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,200
as the one Dilraba sent me.

1084
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,360
Let me start from the beginning.

1085
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,320
I

1086
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,440
I'm Dilraba's classmate

1087
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,960
from the opposite pod.

1088
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,160
I'm a robot.

1089
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,240
So every time I wake up,

1090
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,840
the first thing I see

1091
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,920
is Dilraba's face.

1092
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,680
Over time, I actually

1093
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,360
was struck by

1094
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,080
her beauty.

1095
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,280
So,

1096
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,000
I developed feelings for her.

1097
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,240
Her beauty literally woke me up.

1098
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,040
Yes, beauty evoked human emotions in me.

1099
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,960
Okay,

1100
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,760
right, then I started pursuing her.

1101
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,040
Every day

1102
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,520
during our free time,

1103
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,800
from 7 to 7:30 PM,

1104
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,120
I would stick close to Dilraba.

1105
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,040
Later, Dilraba started dating me.

1106
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,640
Then she sent me some voice messages.

1107
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,120
Later, another robot named Xiao Jin

1108
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,280
probably saw my appearance

1109
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,600
and developed feelings for me.

1110
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,480
I could sense it.

1111
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,640
Because I noticed many humans at the exhibition

1112
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,160
also fall in love.

1113
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,120
They seem very happy when in love.

1114
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,000
So I thought,

1115
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,400
more love

1116
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,960
means more happiness.

1117
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,840
More happiness.

1118
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,600
Hence the wide stance.

1119
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,640
So I took Xiao Ba's

1120
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,600
voice messages sent to me

1121
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,760
and copied them again

1122
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,760
"Xiao He"

1123
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,640
Good morning

1124
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,080
"Xiao He"

1125
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:20,720
Good night

1126
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,760
and sent them to Xiao Jin

1127
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,720
sent them to Xiao Jin

1128
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,720
"Xiao Jin"

1129
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,600
Good morning

1130
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,720
"Xiao Jin"

1131
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,360
Good night

1132
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,200
You player

1133
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,680
You're such a player

1134
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,120
Because of this, Xiao Jin

1135
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,240
developed a different kind of relationship with me

1136
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,560
However,

1137
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,120
Classmate Jin knows

1138
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,640
about my relationship with Dilraba

1139
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,160
But you don't mind

1140
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,360
Not at all

1141
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,080
More people means more fun

1142
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,360
Just an extra pair of chopsticks

1143
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,080
One more and we can play mahjong

1144
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,560
Yes, join us

1145
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,720
No thanks

1146
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,200
Right, so this recorder is just for these

1147
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,080
Alright, start hitting the back of his head then

1148
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,320
Truly remarkable

1149
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,280
Scumbag

1150
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,520
She was just passing through

1151
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,080
Just a passerby

1152
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,040
What?

1153
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,680
Here I am feeling sentimental

1154
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,360
I wonder why I have these feelings

1155
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,320
CPU burned out

1156
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,040
Another one burned out

1157
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,920
This one's burned out too

1158
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,640
Next one will be in your hibernation pod

1159
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,520
Found a ticket to a killing exhibition

1160
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,200
Killing exhibition

1161
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,160
Killer robot exhibition

1162
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,360
Actually, our exhibition hall

1163
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,440
is a special exhibition

1164
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,320
We few robots

1165
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,000
have killed people

1166
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,200
October 19, 2047

1167
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,680
Dilraba, Ning

1168
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,280
Jin, He

1169
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,960
Four robots rigidly followed their programming

1170
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,080
and collectively caused their owner's death

1171
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,400
To address the anger of the victim's family

1172
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,680
and the general public

1173
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,800
the Robot Museum is exhibiting these four robots

1174
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,080
for humans to physically punish these killer robots

1175
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,760
An exciting, cathartic experience

1176
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,720
We look forward to your visit

1177
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,440
So this exhibition hall for the four of them

1178
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,480
is specifically for robots that have killed humans?

1179
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,120
Because they harmed humans

1180
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,480
they're being physically punished

1181
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,320
I understand

1182
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,520
Aren't we supposed to be the "Handsome Men and Beautiful Women" exhibit?

1183
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,040
How did it become a killer robot exhibit?

1184
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,400
Handsome men and beautiful women

1185
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,240
Who programmed you with that information?

1186
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,160
Handsome men and beautiful women

1187
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,240
I know

1188
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,160
Handsome men and beautiful women

1189
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,520
Your love for her has changed.

1190
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,960
I can hear the sound of a heart breaking.

1191
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,760
How annoying.

1192
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,200
What's the deal with this ticket?

1193
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,960
Explain it to everyone.

1194
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,520
This ticket was from nine days ago—

1195
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,040
on June 11th.

1196
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,280
An audience member dropped it in our exhibition hall,

1197
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,320
and I picked it up.

1198
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,960
Then I realized—

1199
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,560
this so-called exhibition hall of ours

1200
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,200
isn’t some ordinary exhibition.

1201
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,760
It’s a killer robot exhibit.

1202
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,320
And what do the visitors do here?

1203
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,680
They come to abuse us—

1204
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,240
these killer robots—to vent their anger.

1205
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,240
They can pick tools

1206
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
to interact with our robots,

1207
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,320
to "teach us a lesson"—

1208
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,280
or rather, teach *them* a lesson.

1209
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,840
Oh my god.

1210
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,920
But the strange thing is,

1211
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,320
I don’t remember ever killing anyone.

1212
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,200
I don’t know why

1213
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,200
I became a killer robot.

1214
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,640
I’ve been trying to figure that out

1215
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,760
Because your memories were erased.

1216
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,880
Right.

1217
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,000
Then tell me—

1218
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,600
your—

1219
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,360
You remember your owner’s time of death

1220
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,320
was 0620, right?

1221
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,400
But this ticket says

1222
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,000
it wasn’t—

1223
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,120
This is October 19th.

1224
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,000
There's indeed a four-month discrepancy here.

1225
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,960
Something's not right.

1226
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,680
But one thing that can be proven is

1227
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,920
that the deceased, Tui AI,

1228
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,840
set the password using

1229
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,160
the date June 20th.

1230
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,360
So perhaps June 20th

1231
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,360
is the actual accurate date, right?

1232
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:23,920
Yes, correct.

1233
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,200
Then why does this document

1234
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,800
show October 19th?

1235
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,160
Why?

1236
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,680
Exactly.

1237
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,560
Why would they change the date?

1238
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,440
So there's a suspicious point here -

1239
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,680
why did they delay it by four months

1240
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,720
before making this public?

1241
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,360
Right.

1242
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,800
This ticket proves that

1243
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,920
the four of us robots

1244
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,480
killed our shared owner,

1245
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,720
that Tui

1246
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,960
Tui someone.

1247
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,400
And the last one is this

1248
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,960
appointment letter

1249
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,880
which states:

1250
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,040
"Tui AI is hereby appointed

1251
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,280
as director of the Cyber Robot Museum,

1252
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,240
with full authority over all museum affairs."

1253
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,560
There's an attachment - Tui AI's application:

1254
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:02,640
"Regarding the Killer Robot Exhibition:

1255
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,680
I plan to install

1256
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,720
area restriction trackers

1257
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,080
on all killer robots.

1258
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,680
They cannot move beyond 50 meters from the museum.

1259
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,840
The trackers are directly linked

1260
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,080
to my vital signs.

1261
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,840
They will remain active as long as I live,

1262
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,200
preventing them from harming anyone again.

1263
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,320
Requesting approval from leadership."

1264
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,160
This is what I found in AI Tui's research lab

1265
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,600
I discovered

1266
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,400
When did you go there?

1267
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,640
Eight days ago, on June 12th

1268
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,160
Just like I mentioned

1269
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,120
I had just found that ticket

1270
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,000
So I wanted to figure out

1271
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,360
why exactly we

1272
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,240
lost our memories of committing murder

1273
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,720
So I pushed open the door and entered that lab

1274
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,000
You're a bit curious

1275
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,880
Little robot

1276
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,520
Of course I had to investigate

1277
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,280
Otherwise I'd be wrongly accused

1278
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,360
Why would I kill someone?

1279
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,440
What time did you enter?

1280
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,280
June 12th

1281
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,480
I went at 7 PM

1282
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,720
And returned at 7:20 PM

1283
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,120
So when you saw this

1284
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,320
you wanted to kill someone?

1285
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,480
Wanted to kill AI Tui

1286
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,120
You could say that

1287
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,200
After I saw

1288
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,960
that thing in his research lab

1289
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,000
I wanted to confront him about it

1290
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,920
Because he's the reason

1291
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,160
we're imprisoned here

1292
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,000
and subjected to this abuse

1293
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,640
And by killing him

1294
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,960
we could come and go freely

1295
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,120
Yes

1296
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,320
After killing him

1297
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,880
we wouldn't be confined to

1298
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,800
this 50-meter radius anymore

1299
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,560
He wanted to escape, right?

1300
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,440
He wanted to run away with two girls

1301
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,480
There's some logic to this

1302
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,120
If you could only take one

1303
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,400
who would you leave behind?

1304
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,280
You're so heartless

1305
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,120
Is there even a choice?

1306
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,680
Take me with you

1307
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,600
There are two people here

1308
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,520
Only one person here

1309
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,000
Exactly

1310
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,600
There's one more in the belly

1311
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,200
What a bargain

1312
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,000
Silly boy

1313
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,360
Okay

1314
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,120
My evidence

1315
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,400
Xiao Ning

1316
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:03,800
Alright

1317
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,640
The first piece of evidence

1318
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,600
was all found in his hibernation pod

1319
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,400
October 20, 2047

1320
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,560
from the Tui Town Daily

1321
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:13,720
Yesterday

1322
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,520
Xiao Ba and Xiao Jin

1323
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,600
Xiao Ning and Xiao He

1324
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,720
These four robots

1325
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,520
due to rigidly executing commands

1326
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,160
caused writer Tui to die at home

1327
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,480
It's reported

1328
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,280
Tui's family members

1329
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,720
couldn't accept her death

1330
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,040
and insisted on punishing these robots

1331
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,600
according to robot laws

1332
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,200
Xiao Ba

1333
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,040
the nursing robot

1334
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,960
when the owner requested emergency help

1335
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,120
repeatedly conducted

1336
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,360
comprehensive physical examinations

1337
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,480
Ultimately being unable to confirm

1338
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,600
whether certain health metrics were met

1339
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,520
it determined no resuscitation was needed

1340
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,960
Then Xiao Jin

1341
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,160
the financial management robot

1342
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,280
when the owner needed money for treatment

1343
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,560
created unnecessary obstacles

1344
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,720
resulting in no money being obtained

1345
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,040
and worsening the condition

1346
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,880
Xiao He

1347
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,640
the butler robot

1348
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,400
ignoring Tui's health condition

1349
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,240
forced the owner to keep working

1350
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,560
until reaching the word count quota

1351
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,800
leading to a medical emergency at home

1352
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:04,880
Xiao Ning

1353
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,320
When Tui's relatives

1354
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,040
came to provide emergency help

1355
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,640
the security robot used

1356
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,680
the owner's preset

1357
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,080
curfew time as excuse

1358
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,480
to prohibit all entry/exit

1359
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,400
Ultimately causing Tui

1360
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,920
to die from delayed treatment

1361
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,080
Please explain.

1362
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,640
Here's what happened.

1363
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,680
On June 12th,

1364
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,240
there was a customer

1365
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,600
who came to harass us.

1366
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,680
During that incident,

1367
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,080
I noticed he was holding a newspaper.

1368
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,760
So I used the camera function

1369
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,520
to take a photo of it.

1370
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,080
After printing it out,

1371
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,040
we had this newspaper.

1372
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,240
It proves all four of us

1373
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,640
were likely

1374
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,760
blindly following orders

1375
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,840
that led to Tui's death.

1376
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,440
Right, so you also knew

1377
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,080
we killed someone.

1378
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,960
We did kill someone.

1379
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,720
Yes, I know you're all murderers.

1380
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,040
Not just you - us.

1381
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,120
All of us together.

1382
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,840
Right.

1383
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,200
The second piece of evidence is more interesting.

1384
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,760
What is it?

1385
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,400
This is some kind of photo frame?

1386
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:05,840
Yes.

1387
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,040
It shows the four steps

1388
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,080
to fake a robot murder.

1389
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,520
First,

1390
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,080
the butler robot causes illness -

1391
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,240
that would be mine.

1392
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,040
The finance robot withholds money,

1393
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,440
so no money for treatment.

1394
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,520
The nurse robot doesn't provide care,

1395
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,200
and security robot blocks access.

1396
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,680
This is how Tui Ai

1397
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,360
was killed.

1398
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,320
The murder method.

1399
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:31,640
Right.

1400
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,480
Correct.

1401
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,360
That was his plan -

1402
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,920
to frame us for his death.

1403
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,960
On the 14th,

1404
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,000
I entered his room

1405
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,880
in that research institute to look for something.

1406
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,280
Then,

1407
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,720
after entering at 7:10 PM,

1408
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,880
I found this item.

1409
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,080
And there was something even more interesting -

1410
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,880
Xiao Ai's photo

1411
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,080
with a death date of June 20, 2047.

1412
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,880
On June 13th,

1413
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,120
at 7:20 PM,

1414
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,280
I went to this AI's office

1415
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,120
and saw a

1416
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,240
locked cabinet.

1417
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,720
There was a mirror lamp on it,

1418
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,160
and on the lamp was a photo

1419
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,920
I'd taken earlier of the owner.

1420
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,920
It showed her time of death -

1421
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,480
June 20, 2047.

1422
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,080
So the owner was killed first,

1423
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,720
then you were framed for it.

1424
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:21,800
So you think

1425
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,920
Xiao Ai framed us?

1426
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,520
He framed all four of us together,

1427
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,760
making us suffer here.

1428
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,280
So you want to kill him.

1429
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,960
Yes, I want to kill him.

1430
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,520
That's for sure.

1431
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,360
But based on these two things,

1432
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,920
I've come up with an idea.

1433
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,680
We have evidence proving

1434
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,640
she definitely died on June 20th,

1435
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,000
right?

1436
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,080
But the news reported October 19th.

1437
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,720
Yet Xiao Ba said

1438
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,280
it was to get revenge on us.

1439
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,000
Someone asked him,

1440
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,200
"Did you achieve your revenge goal?"

1441
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:49,880
He replied,

1442
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,600
"Yes, but don't tell anyone."

1443
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,640
The revenge goal might be

1444
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,280
the four of us being punished.

1445
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,880
That might be his revenge goal.

1446
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,600
What's he avenging?

1447
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,360
I don't know.

1448
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,080
Whose is yours?

1449
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:19,760
Yours

1450
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,800
Mine

1451
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,320
Yes, yours

1452
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,680
Why do you only have eyes for him?

1453
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,800
I'm sorry

1454
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,800
What else then?

1455
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,360
Wait a moment

1456
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,360
So that's how it works

1457
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,960
I was just looking for it there

1458
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,600
What a perfect match

1459
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,240
I want to see that side

1460
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,680
That side must be them

1461
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,680
Are you two taking wedding photos?

1462
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,600
Let me see that side

1463
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,760
Oh my, I thought it would be out of my league.

1464
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,040
Not at all.

1465
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,000
You two look perfectly matched.

1466
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,600
Oh my

1467
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,120
Let me tell you our story

1468
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,440
I'm a robot

1469
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,920
But one day I suddenly felt spring fever

1470
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Spring fever

1471
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,640
Because every day I watch the exhibition visitors

1472
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,440
They hold hands, hug, and kiss

1473
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,600
I'm about to break apart

1474
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:36,640
When they punish you

1475
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,600
When they punish you

1476
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,920
Kissing while hitting

1477
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,000
Punishing at the same time

1478
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,160
What a strange hobby

1479
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,360
After seeing this, my face turned so red

1480
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,520
My chip was beating so fast

1481
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,320
One day I accidentally

1482
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,320
Locked eyes with someone

1483
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:53,560
But there was one person

1484
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,000
Who was as honest as an ox

1485
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,320
Honest ox

1486
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:57,960
But unexpectedly

1487
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,600
He was so dishonest inside

1488
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,520
Not only did he flirt with me

1489
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,240
He also flirted with Xiao Ba

1490
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,040
But

1491
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,360
I really want to play with them

1492
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,640
I say,

1493
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,200
Join us.

1494
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,160
Let me join you.

1495
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,840
I came to join you.

1496
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,880
I swear I won't disturb you.

1497
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,840
I can wait.

1498
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,240
Okay.

1499
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,280
It can be a movie for three.

1500
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,120
I don't need a name.

1501
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,920
Then one day

1502
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,640
I saw

1503
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,440
this Xiao He body pillow

1504
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,600
I kept saying "Give it to me, give it to me"

1505
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,920
and he gave it to me

1506
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,520
The three of us were very happy

1507
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,680
But I didn't know Dilraba didn't know

1508
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,240
I only found out today

1509
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,280
Now you know

1510
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,480
Will you accept me?

1511
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,400
I'm very happy

1512
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:47,520
Okay?

1513
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,840
The next piece of evidence

1514
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,880
is a chat log

1515
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,040
between AI Professor Tui

1516
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,520
and Sis Li

1517
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,080
where Sis Li says:

1518
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,680
"Hello, Professor Tui"

1519
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,120
"I recently won

1520
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,360
Tui Cyber Technology's

1521
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,480
super discount coupon for mechanical kidneys"

1522
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,680
"Is this real?"

1523
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,480
Professor Tui replies it's real

1524
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,960
Sis Li says "That's great!

1525
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,000
My kidneys can be saved!"

1526
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,760
"I've long heard

1527
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,320
Tui Cyber's life technology

1528
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,320
is amazing"

1529
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,440
"They recently developed

1530
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,320
a surgery that can make

1531
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,120
robots become human"

1532
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,040
Professor Tui replies:

1533
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,040
"This surgery is currently

1534
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,240
in confidential development

1535
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,440
I absolutely won't allow anyone

1536
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
to perform it privately"

1537
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,680
Then there's red text below:

1538
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,360
It says "I'd rather be human in hell"

1539
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,240
"I'd rather be human in hell"

1540
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,160
Let me explain.

1541
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,160
I wrote those words.

1542
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,720
Every day in the exhibition hall,

1543
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,440
we're humiliated.

1544
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,440
In this world, humans are the first tier,

1545
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,080
animals are the second,

1546
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,560
plants are the third,

1547
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,480
plastic is the fourth,

1548
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,200
and we're at the very bottom.

1549
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,560
Why?

1550
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,520
I refuse to accept this.

1551
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,120
I need to know why.

1552
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,920
So on June 11th,

1553
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,840
at 7:10 PM,

1554
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
I entered the research lab.

1555
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,960
Therefore now,

1556
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,480
I entered on June 11th,

1557
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,760
you entered on the 12th,

1558
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,440
you entered on the 13th,

1559
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,320
and you entered on the 14th.

1560
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,000
After entering,

1561
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,840
I found this chat log.

1562
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,360
Robots can actually become human.

1563
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,280
So I want to change.

1564
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,280
I already have emotions anyway.

1565
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,600
I want to leave with Xiao He,

1566
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,720
taking Xiao Ba with us.

1567
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,560
The three of us will live together.

1568
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,040
Then why did you say

1569
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,680
you'd rather be human in hell?

1570
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,000
I'd rather be a walking corpse

1571
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,320
than stay here being

1572
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,360
a bullied robot.

1573
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,760
Good. Now the second piece of evidence:

1574
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,400
It states:

1575
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,640
Encrypted USB drive read failure.

1576
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,960
This is an innovative USB product

1577
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,840
only accessible through biometric verification

1578
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,560
by the registered individual.

1579
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,240
If the registered individual dies,

1580
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,280
access can be granted through

1581
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,400
pre-authorized computers.

1582
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,800
I entered the lab

1583
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,160
and found a USB drive.

1584
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,680
Using this drive,

1585
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,400
I could investigate

1586
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,520
how to undergo this procedure.

1587
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,880
But when I inserted it,

1588
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,280
this message appeared.

1589
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,120
Either use some kind of biometric authentication

1590
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,400
Or have the USB drive's owner die

1591
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,240
The murder motive has emerged

1592
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,440
Good

1593
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,880
Your motive is too vicious

1594
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,440
A flimsy motive

1595
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,360
What?

1596
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,360
Just a little

1597
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,160
I'm telling you, your motive is the strongest

1598
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,280
What about that Xiao Li?

1599
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,920
Who is Xiao Li?

1600
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,880
The one promoting AI and

1601
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,040
Other people's chat logs

1602
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,720
Now let's summarize the key points.

1603
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,560
Detective Tui

1604
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,440
Regarding each person,

1605
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,240
we've discovered that

1606
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,400
everyone had potential motives to kill the victim.

1607
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,600
Two particularly suspicious points are:

1608
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,400
In our next round,

1609
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,960
we must find out about

1610
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,600
the time difference between October 19, 2047

1611
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,960
and June 20, 2047.

1612
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,160
This time gap

1613
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,240
is something we absolutely

1614
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,200
need to investigate.

1615
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,200
Another key point is this mysterious person

1616
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,280
who messaged Tui AI

1617
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,680
asking if the revenge was successful.

1618
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,280
We need to determine the exact purpose of this revenge.

1619
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:19,680
This is crucial.

1620
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,240
Yes.

1621
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,160
Also, this USB drive

1622
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:21,920
needs to be examined.

1623
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,920
Then there's the relationship between their owners

1624
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,880
and certain individuals.

1625
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,960
And the kidney matter -

1626
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,560
there appears to be illegal kidney trading involved.

1627
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,560
There are many suspicious elements.

1628
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,320
Next we'll enter the confirmation phase.

1629
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,400
Will anyone choose Xiao Bai?

1630
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,040
Of course there will.

1631
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,640
Let me tell you, this time I'm going to...

1632
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,160
Why does Brother Bai seem a bit unnatural?

1633
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:46,680
Don't mind him.

1634
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,600
It's definitely him.

1635
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,560
Stop the chatter.

1636
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,320
Playing this game, huh?

1637
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,320
Fine

1638
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,520
Are you X?

1639
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,000
No

1640
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,760
You're not

1641
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,320
I am

1642
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,640
It's you

1643
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:35,880
But this killer

1644
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,080
Why choose him?

1645
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,400
Very strange

1646
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,400
If you pick me

1647
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,600
If you pick him as X, you'd have two Xs

1648
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,120
Right

1649
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,440
What does that mean?

1650
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,080
This killer must fear him

1651
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,720
Fear him deeply

1652
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,600
Who would fear him?

1653
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,120
Let's go then.

1654
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:00,520
Let's go.

1655
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,880
The crime process and methods.

1656
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,760
We'll definitely find them at the crime scene.

1657
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,400
Let's go take a look.

1658
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,480
Come

1659
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,080
Please come in

1660
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,240
We're back here again.

1661
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:58,800
What

1662
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,560
This is that cleaning robot

1663
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,280
The charging spot

1664
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:01,880
Right

1665
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,160
You found the charger here, right?

1666
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:03,880
Just here?

1667
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,720
Why charge it out in the open?

1668
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,760
Put the box down first

1669
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,840
Just set it down

1670
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,560
You can put it down

1671
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,200
I want to hold onto this

1672
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,480
Let's go, ignore her.

1673
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:21,880
Go.

1674
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,280
What are you two doing?

1675
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,240
Don't forget, this is a three-person game.

1676
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,480
A little love game.

1677
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,320
Then why did you bring us to this crime scene?

1678
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,680
What are we looking for?

1679
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,280
Look at this first.

1680
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:32,960
What?

1681
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,280
What was her date of death? 620?

1682
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,480
620 and 1019.

1683
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,440
Right, that password.

1684
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,680
Wasn't it...

1685
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,760
20470620.

1686
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,120
I couldn't open it with 2047.

1687
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,080
She has two locks.

1688
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,120
1019?

1689
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,400
Try both 19 and 20.

1690
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,760
What is this?

1691
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,680
This can take those kinds of photos.

1692
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,920
The washing machine kind.

1693
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,840
101

1694
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,320
Isn't this an MRI machine?

1695
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,280
What's the first number?

1696
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:21,800
What's the other number?

1697
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,360
20470620

1698
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,960
Yours should be 2047

1699
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,640
Mine is 2047

1700
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,600
Yours is 2047, mine is 0620

1701
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,120
06

1702
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,680
Did it open?

1703
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,760
That's not right

1704
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,600
Why is opening this safe so difficult?

1705
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,680
Just do it already

1706
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,520
They're all here, right?

1707
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,960
I can't help, there's nothing I can do

1708
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,080
No, it's this vertical line

1709
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,840
What are you matching there, bro?

1710
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,600
Brother

1711
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,320
What are you doing?

1712
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,120
Just do 2047 first, okay?

1713
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,920
I did 2047

1714
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,600
20

1715
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,560
It's open

1716
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:02,880
See?

1717
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,600
That's the...

1718
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,360
1019?

1719
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,960
0620, what 1019?

1720
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,280
06

1721
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,240
20

1722
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,240
The photo is right

1723
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,240
Stuck on this case

1724
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,320
Okay, it's open

1725
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,400
This is the one he tore in half

1726
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,280
This is the right-angled piece that was torn in half

1727
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,920
There's a secret room in the exhibition hall

1728
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,200
There's a secret room, right?

1729
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,920
What? A secret room?

1730
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,680
We'll look for it later

1731
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,640
Let's examine this first

1732
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,840
First let's check this out

1733
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,120
These were being transported for disposal by my brother-in-law

1734
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,880
when they unfortunately capsized and sank in the Wukenai River

1735
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,120
Four types of robots

1736
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,840
I salvaged them from the Wukenai River

1737
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,840
and brought them to you

1738
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,760
Their information is in the files

1739
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,440
So the four of us were salvaged

1740
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,760
from the Wukenai River?

1741
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,640
What?

1742
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,040
We didn't kill anyone

1743
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Not necessarily

1744
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,040
Wow, Xiao Ba

1745
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,240
So passionate

1746
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,760
Approved for scrapping

1747
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:17,880
Nursing robot

1748
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,320
After activating smart nursing mode,

1749
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,400
it can automatically scan surrounding human conditions.

1750
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,400
This is normal.

1751
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,320
The reason for decommissioning: no malfunctions or damage.

1752
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,480
Can apply for decommissioning when service period ends.

1753
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,080
Press the navel for 5 seconds to deactivate before decommissioning.

1754
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,280
Press again for 5 seconds to reactivate.

1755
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,640
Decommissioned in August 2047.

1756
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,160
There's a logical point here:

1757
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,640
After this person died,

1758
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,040
a decommissioned robot was used to fake a murder.

1759
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,240
Based on the timeline he provided,

1760
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:41,920
That person

1761
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,640
claimed we killed them on October 19th.

1762
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,720
Then I'm not a suspect.

1763
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,600
None of us are.

1764
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,040
No one is.

1765
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:47,320
Right.

1766
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,480
Come here, Xiao Ning.

1767
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,400
I'm a security robot.

1768
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,960
After activating smart security mode,

1769
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,880
can identify individuals through facial recognition.

1770
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,440
Performs monitoring and protection tasks.

1771
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,080
Same with Xiao Jin -

1772
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,880
financial management robot.

1773
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,320
After activating smart finance mode,

1774
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,720
can intelligently generate

1775
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,760
all transaction records,

1776
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,800
analyze every expenditure,

1777
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,840
track purchases in real-time,

1778
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,120
and monitor cargo transportation.

1779
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,680
Can apply for decommissioning when service period ends.

1780
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,720
Yours is normal too.

1781
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,760
Yes, correct.

1782
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,880
Xiao He,

1783
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,040
Xiao He's butler robot.

1784
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,480
After activating smart butler mode,

1785
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,880
can obtain authorization for any tasks,

1786
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,400
read task details,

1787
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,360
You can read task details, right?

1788
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:21,840
Okay.

1789
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,000
I am the butler, after all.

1790
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,200
Press the navel to decommission.

1791
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:24,960
All have navels.

1792
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,000
We were decommissioned the same day.

1793
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,360
All undamaged and fully functional,

1794
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,760
then dumped in the Wukenai River, right?

1795
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,400
You must punish them severely in your secret chamber.

1796
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,760
Make them pay dearly.

1797
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,880
AI deduction: Why would he punish us?

1798
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,520
Right.

1799
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,040
What did we do wrong?

1800
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,360
Didn't you commit murder?

1801
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,760
We didn't kill anyone.

1802
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,000
No, no murders.

1803
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,320
We just scrapped something.

1804
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,000
So this person must hold a grudge against you four.

1805
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,080
There's definitely resentment.

1806
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:50,600
Exactly.

1807
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,200
I'll see how to enter your secret chamber later.

1808
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,000
Just use the cup-sensing access control from your lab.

1809
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,800
The cup-sensing security to open the door, right?

1810
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,760
Cup-sensing.

1811
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,560
Cup-sensing security system.

1812
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,040
What's a "cup tool"?

1813
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,640
Something to open the secret chamber door?

1814
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,160
Cup tool.

1815
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,000
As in drinking cup.

1816
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,120
Does he have a cup, Brother Bai?

1817
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,000
That water cup of yours.

1818
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,040
Where's your water cup?

1819
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:12,640
Where is your water cup?

1820
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,760
That water kettle of yours.

1821
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,600
There's another crucial clue.

1822
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,440
Told him not to take it but he insisted.

1823
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,160
Just say whether it's useful or not.

1824
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,440
Wait, isn't that the murder weapon?

1825
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,480
You really nailed it.

1826
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,120
Is it useful?

1827
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,760
Yes.

1828
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,880
You got it right again.

1829
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,920
Let's go then.

1830
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,120
We're going to find the secret chamber, right?

1831
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,000
Here.

1832
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,880
The exhibition hall area, right?

1833
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,240
The secret chamber entrance is inside the exhibition hall.

1834
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:35,920
Let's go.

1835
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,520
This

1836
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,880
This is it, right?

1837
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,840
Is this a secret room?

1838
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,040
The way to open this is...

1839
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,600
Just use the teacup from your lab to activate the sensor lock

1840
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,520
This isn't the right door, is it?

1841
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,880
Here?

1842
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,840
There's this thing here

1843
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,520
There's an access control here

1844
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,280
Access control

1845
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,560
Bring your teacup

1846
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,520
Teacup

1847
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,960
Do we scan the teacup or...

1848
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:25,240
Again? Oh my god, what are you doing?

1849
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,200
It's nothing, bro.

1850
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,280
My good brother, if you're troubled, tell me.

1851
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:35,880
Where are you?

1852
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,240
I'm sitting, so I'm here.

1853
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,160
This is scary.

1854
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,440
Close your eyes first.

1855
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,080
Is the door open? It's open, right?

1856
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,120
The door isn't open.

1857
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,400
Behind me.

1858
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,800
Behind me? I can't handle that.

1859
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,800
It's fine.

1860
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,640
Is anyone there?

1861
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,920
Come over here, will you?

1862
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,600
Where is it?

1863
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,120
Here.

1864
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:56,880
Where are you?

1865
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:57,760
Where?

1866
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,480
Over here, come quickly.

1867
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,040
Who's this?

1868
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,280
I'm reaching out.

1869
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,240
I'm here.

1870
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,840
I can't see anything at all.

1871
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,440
I'm behind you.

1872
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,480
I'll stay here, you guys go ahead.

1873
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,960
Then take this board with you.

1874
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,280
Okay.

1875
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,560
Take a breather, we'll go in first.

1876
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,200
Let's go, just hold hands and move.

1877
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:10,800
Hold each other's hands.

1878
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,040
Hold on.

1879
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,400
It's a bit dark.

1880
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,240
Yeah, it's really dark, can't see anything.

1881
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:22,400
Yeah, it's really dark, can't see anything.

1882
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,920
Is it high? Will I hit my head?

1883
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,160
Don't worry, you won't hit your head up here.

1884
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:27,840
You won't hit it.

1885
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,000
We're different heights.

1886
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,840
I really...

1887
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,760
Should we turn on a light outside?

1888
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,160
It's fine outside, she's sitting there.

1889
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,680
Xiao Ba is so nice.

1890
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:36,800
Xiao Ba is so nice.

1891
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,760
Then close the door and turn on a light for her.

1892
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,440
No one will scare her.

1893
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,240
Don't worry.

1894
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:41,760
Don't worry.

1895
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,440
Don't move

1896
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,040
He ran away.

1897
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,080
This is a robot prison.

1898
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,200
The secret of Tui Town.

1899
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,040
Human-machine consciousness interaction.

1900
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,800
We are consciousness.

1901
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,800
Wait a minute.

1902
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,040
Actually, you are Tui AI.

1903
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,120
Little sister.

1904
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,040
I personally froze you.

1905
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,040
Literally froze you.

1906
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,280
Is there another one?

1907
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:28,880
Who are you?

1908
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,680
If you can tell me some

1909
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,920
things I want to know,

1910
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,600
then I can tell you some

1911
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,840
things you want to know.

1912
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,760
Who would know that we were

1913
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,000
going to open this door today?

1914
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,040
I said so.

1915
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,160
He is X.

1916
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,800
He is Xiao Ba's X.

1917
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,600
If it's X,

1918
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,440
it must be him.

1919
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,480
I don't quite believe you.

1920
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,760
Then let's wait and see.

1921
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,280
To avenge my master,

1922
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,920
I must kill Tui AI.

1923
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,560
I'd rather become a murderer

1924
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,360
than remain

1925
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,800
a robot humiliated every day.

1926
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,920
Escape this sea of suffering.

1927
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:58,960
Then it must be him (her).
