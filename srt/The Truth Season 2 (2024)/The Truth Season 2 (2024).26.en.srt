00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,180
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Game Rules

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,340
Six players per episode

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,860
will be divided into four suspects

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,620
and two investigators to solve cases

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,340
The real culprit hides among the suspects

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,300
The culprit's objective

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,980
is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,820
without being discovered by others

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,420
Only the actual culprit may lie

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,140
Notably,

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,060
this season introduces new gameplay

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,740
If the culprit player

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,660
passes a certain challenge

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,660
they may select one investigator

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,100
to corrupt into becoming "X"

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,220
X's mission is

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,140
to assist the culprit's escape

18
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,980
during subsequent investigations

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,020
Victory conditions:

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,540
After investigation concludes

21
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,540
players vote for the culprit

22
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,900
If the culprit receives

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,540
fewer votes than others

24
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,300
culprit and X win golden keys

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,540
Otherwise, correct voters

26
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,940
receive golden keys

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,420
This season,

28
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,140
the "Helimoyu Reasoning Team"

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,660
will time-travel through four eras in Reasoning Town

30
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,620
The 1920s and 1980s cases have concluded

31
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,500
Next,

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,900
we'll follow players

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,940
to the millennium era

34
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,820
Classmates

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,420

10:00 AM on June 3rd, 2004

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,220
Today marks our annual

38
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,900
Tui Zhen Art Academy anniversary celebration

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,340
This event will last for three days

40
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,100
The event will be broadcast live

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,500
by our school television station

42
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,940

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,340

He was our first place last year

110
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,340
He's had so many scandals recently

111
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,780
Scandals

112
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,380

Then who would be in 1st place?

130
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,180
Who could be in 1st place?

131
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,740

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,940
Re-evaluated

This year's "Star of Pushing Arts" title

138
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Let's welcome Ba Zimei to the stage

139
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,620

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,620
Re-evaluated

141
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,260
Actually, I already guessed it would be me

142
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,820
Because during this period

143
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,020
I've been studying hard

144
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,740
And also in daily life

145
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,620
I've always been helping others

146
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,820
Making moral and academic excellence

147
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,260
My personal goal

148
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,020
So I hope next year

149
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,580
And the year after

150
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,140
I can continue to be

151
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,620
The "Star of Pushing Arts"

152
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,460
Thank you everyone

153
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,020
Great

154
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,260
Thank you, Ba Zimei

155
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,660
Alright

156
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,300
Everyone

157
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,620
As per tradition

158
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
The top six from previous years'

159
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,820
"Star of Pushing Arts" rankings

160
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,020
Would always perform

161
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,900
Wonderful performances

162
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,660
This year is no exception

163
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,940
So without further ado

164
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,020
Let's welcome the six

165
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,140
To give us a wonderful performance

166
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,180
Help

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Where's the applause

168
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,060
And

169
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,140
Come on, buddy

170
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,940
This is the legendary leg zither

171
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,460
Such long legs

172
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,180
Thank you all six

173
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,140
for the wonderful performance

174
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,980
That was amazing

175
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,220
Truly incredible

176
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,660
It was indeed very pleasing to watch

177
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,660
Just now I...

178
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,300
Who?

179
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Someone's knocking

180
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,620
Who's knocking?

181
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,660
What's wrong?

182
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,660
Classmates

183
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,740
What's wrong?

184
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,380
It's terrifying.

185
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,020
I saw a monster in the laundry room.

186
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,180
The Tuiyi Ghost Stories are real

187
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,500
Tuiyi Ghost Stories

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,540
Pushing Ghost

189
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,740
That Xiao Huang

190
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,620
Come here for a moment

191
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,300
Take this classmate

192
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,740
to the infirmary first

193
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,300
to rest

194
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,860
There are monsters in Tuiyi Ghost Stories

195
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
Let me see what this is

196
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,380
Be careful

197
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,500
What is that?

198
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,940
Called the Seven Tuiyi Ghost Stories

199
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,940
Everyone can take a look

200
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,980
Seven Tuiyi Ghost Stories

201
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,100
Don't open cabinets randomly

202
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,020
Beware of what's inside

203
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,220
A blood-covered person

204
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,020
Don't casually

205
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,020
enter empty piano rooms

206
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,500
Beware of deadly piano music coming from there

207
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,060
Don't linger in laundry rooms

208
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,980
Beware of seeing hideous-looking strangers

209
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,460
Don't stare at class photos

210
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,580
Beware of seeing extra classmates

211
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,020
Don't forget to close dorm doors

212
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,780
Beware of someone lying back-to-back with you

213
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,740
Don't enter night study rooms during daytime

214
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,900
Beware of never coming out

215
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,740
Don't take the library elevator

216
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,460
Beware of going to

217
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,780
non-existent floors

218
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,700
Back in 1988,

219
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,940
when I first enrolled,

220
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,500
I think I heard about this incident.

221
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,860
But that's actually quite normal.

222
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,380
During my student days,

223
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,180
it seemed every school had

224
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,460
some strange occurrences.

225
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
These campus legends,

226
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,940
after all, they're just

227
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,700
stories circulating among students.

228
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,260
They're merely rumors,

229
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,900
right?

230
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,940
No need to be afraid,

231
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,740
alright?

232
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,020
Now

233
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,580
It should be around 11 AM now

234
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,300
Today's school anniversary events

235
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,620
will probably come to an end

236
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,140
Tomorrow will be the musical

237
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,300
"Swan Lake Push" performance

238
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,420
Those who need to rehearse

239
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,140
should have a good rehearsal this afternoon

240
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,820
Okay

241
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,300
Good

242
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,140
Everyone can have free time now

243
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,700
Alright

244
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,140
Got it

245
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,060
Feel free everyone

246
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,300
Let's go

247
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,820
It's time for rehearsal

248
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,820
Hello

249
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,140
Hello Ba Zimei

250
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,860
Hello everyone

251
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,100
The script is here, right?

252
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,620
Yes.

253
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,100
Everyone can just find any seat.

254
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,300
Just take a seat.

255
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,500
Then I'd like to tell everyone...

256
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,780
Director Rui Sipai

257
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
She has something to attend to this afternoon

258
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,460
so she won't be able to come

259
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,340
Therefore, I'll be hosting

260
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,980
this afternoon's rehearsal

261
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,420
Alright

262
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,740
First, let's

263
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,260
introduce our respective roles

264
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,580
I'll start with myself

265
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm Ba Zimei

266
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,460
And I play the female lead in this drama

267
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,620

268
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,660
Thank you

269
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,500
Female lead

270
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,540
My turn. I'm He Dinghong

272
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,100

Male lead

275
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,660
Adding lines for yourself

276
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,380
Where does it say "male lead" here?

277
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,540
We're equal in billing

278
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,580
Male lead

279
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,660
I am the male lead

280
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,180
Well then

281
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,380
Fine

282
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,500
Hello everyone, I'm Ning Hao

283
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I play one of the two male leads

284
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,500
I am the War God, Prince Heavy Rain

285
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,420
War God

286
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,580
Where's this War God?

287
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,700
Whatever

288
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,900
Hello everyone, I'm Ke Daole

289
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,140
I play the role of

290
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,300
the brave and battle-hardened Prince Drizzle

291
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,500
Hello everyone

292
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,860

the cowardly Prince Light Rain

296
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,340
Hello everyone

297
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,300
I share equal billing with Ba Zimei

298
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,420
Canary

299
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,820
I play one of the two female leads

300
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,900
Princess Gold Card

301
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,460
I'm 1.72m tall

302
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,900
Shoe size 40

303
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,060
Alright

304
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:37,980
Okay

305
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,860
Let's begin rehearsal everyone

306
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,900
Okay

307
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,460
I'll go play the music

308
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,140
There's music too?

309
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
The Rain Kingdom where it rains year-round

310
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,100
What's going on?

311
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
There's a...

312
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,020
Wait

313
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,540
It's not dark yet, bro

314
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,700
Here we go again

315
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,900
It's really too dark

316
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,940
Here we go again

317
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,500
I'll protect you

318
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,100
I'll protect you

319
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,980
Thank you

320
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,500
Help me

321
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm Zi Daole

322
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,100
Zi Daole

323
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,820
Zi Daole

324
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,580
Zi Daole

325
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,340
Zi Daole, what's wrong?

326
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,700
I'm in the cabinet

327
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,620
In the cabinet

328
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,500
She's in the cabinet

329
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
She wants us to save her

330
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,580
But don't forget

331
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,180
The school's seven urban legends

332
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,260
Say we mustn't open the cabinet

333
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,660
But we need to find the cabinet

334
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,460
If we don't find it

335
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,620
We can't solve this

336
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,460
Should we search like this?

337
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,420
Or what?

338
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,460
This is a painting.

339
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,620
There should be a cabinet, right?

340
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,540
Here.

341
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,740
There's a cabinet here.

342
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,100
I have a light.

343
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,540
It's a dead body.

344
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,820
There's someone.

345
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,740
What's wrong?

346
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,380
Zhi Daole.

347
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,340
Zhi Daole.

348
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,300
"Let's Start Deduction."

349
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,940
Season 2, Case 5.

350
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,780
Deduction Town 2004.

351
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,140
"Strange Tales of Deduction: The Blood Cabinet Mystery."

352
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,820
Officially begins.

353
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
The current time is.

354
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,300
June 3, 2004.

355
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,620
4:10 PM.

356
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,060
The victim in this case is Zhi Daole.

357
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
Leader of the Zhi Music Troupe.

358
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,220
After preliminary investigation.

359
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,100
Zhi Daole's death.

360
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,540
Cannot rule out homicide.

361
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,940
The murderer who killed her.

362
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,660
Is narrowed down to Ning Hao.

363
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,980
Canary.

364
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,740
Bai Yangzuo.

365
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,260
Ke Daole among the four suspects.

366
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,620
In this case.

367
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,260
Ba Zimei and He Dinghong.

368
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,140
Are temporarily not suspects.

369
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,580
Therefore, you are the case investigators.

370
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,740
Now please, both investigators.

371
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,220
Remain at the crime scene.

372
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
To conduct initial evidence collection.

373
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Someday I'll get to do this job too.

374
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,180
It's all blood

375
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,740
Wait a moment

376
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,580
There's another wound here

377
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,460
Carotid artery

378
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,940
There's a hat inside.

379
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,340
I'll do it.

380
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,140
This...

381
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,380
This is her coat.

382
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,420
The coat pocket...

383
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,780
The Weird Tales of Tuiyi.

384
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,380
There's nothing left here

385
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,020
No murder weapon

386
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,060
I'll take the clothes back first

387
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,820
Strange

388
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,220
This place is unusually clean, but

389
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,300
What do you mean?

390
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,980
It's just too clean

391
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,260
There's absolutely nothing

392
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,260
What is this

393
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,020
Mission note

394
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,660
Do me a favor

395
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,180
Move the props from the warehouse to the small auditorium

396
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,260
Canary

397
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,700
Ke Daole

398
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,140
Bai Yangzuo

399
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,180
Ning Hao

400
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,100
What's this box used for?

401
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,660
These are all props we moved.

402
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,180
There should be...

403
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,700
nothing important inside.

404
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,380
Because there's no camera in here.

405
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,420
"Pushing Goose Lake" Prop Cabinet

406
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,020
High sealing capability.

407
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,500
Sorry

408
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,580
Why is your hair falling out?

409
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,300
This is the surveillance footage.

410
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,740
June 3rd

411
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,260
Art corridor surveillance footage

412
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,420
The prop painting is 1 meter by 1.8 meters.

413
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,500
Are these the two?

414
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,700
Wait a moment

415
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,900
What's this about now?

416
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,580
Even when it's just the two of us?

417
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,180
Hold on

418
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,860
Does it have some kind of glow?

419
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,900
Is it fluorescent?

420
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
What do you mean?

421
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,380
No, no fluorescence

422
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,980
What about this painting?

423
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,500
Should we bring it over to look together?

424
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,380
I'll bring it

425
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,700
Excuse me

426
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,940
Piano sound

427
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,980
We're going out, right?

428
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,060
Wait, no way

429
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,740
No way

430
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,580
Just the two of us? Wait a minute

431
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,220
Let's go, go, go

432
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,700
Wait, the two of us investigating

433
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,100
Do we really need to do this?

434
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,300
Go

435
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Why is the piano playing by itself?

436
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,380
What

437
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,500
"Deadly Melody"

438
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,580
Someone died here.

439
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,420
No way

440
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,900
TYP

441
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
TYP

442
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,180
Why are his lips so black?

443
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,500
His hands are black too.

444
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,540
He's poisoned.

445
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,620
It's that again

446
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,100
There's a fragrance

447
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
What kind of fragrance?

448
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,780
Perfume scent

449
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,420
No way

450
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,700
The fragrance

451
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,340
This is the certificate

452
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,820
Performance costume

453
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,700
Young Marshal 101 Clothing Store

454
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,940
Initial evidence collection at the crime scene is complete

455
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,140
Please have the two investigators escort the suspect

456
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,900
to the Brainstorming Hall

457
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,140
for questioning

458
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,980
Here

459
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,060
Here

460
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,020
Come

461
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,700
Welcome to Dongnao Hall

462
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,340
Big production, very nice

463
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,340
Little culprits

464
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,620
While investigating the crime scene

465
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
the members of the Think Tank have also collected

466
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,820
some evidence related to

467
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,020
the four suspects in this case

468
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,060
Now, players, please examine the evidence

469
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,300
Bai Yangzuo

470
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,460
You're so fickle, canary

471
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,940
I'm so beautiful

472
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,420
Wouldn't it be a waste not to be fickle?

473
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,660
How ridiculous

474
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,700
Let's watch for one more minute

475
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,300
There's a time limit

476
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,980
I set the rules

477
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,460
Controlling the pace, good

478
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,220
Listen to me

479
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,580
Master of control

480
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,340
Alright, we're done watching

481
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,020
I'm done watching too

482
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,100
I've finished watching too

483
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,980
Today's case

484
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,780
is different from previous cases

485
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,780
We found another body

486
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,700
in the music room

487
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,340
This body

488
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,620
is someone we met today

489
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,500
TYP

490
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,020
He's the one who died

491
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,300
There are two victims today

492
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,020
So there might be

493
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,140
one killer or two killers

494
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,300
Regarding that killer,

495
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,700
there are actually three possibilities.

496
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,860
This killer

497
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,220
killed two people.

498
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,300
The second possibility is

499
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,900
TYP first killed

500
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,820
Zidaole,

501
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,620
then

502
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,100
the killer murdered TYP.

503
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,820
Yes.

504
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,180
The third possibility is

505
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Zidaole killed TYP,

506
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,580
then the killer murdered Zidaole.

507
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,300
Let me start by saying

508
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,100
about my relationship with the deceased

509
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,140
I'll go first

510
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,660
Okay

511
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,020
My relationship with TYP is that

512
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,020
he was my boss

513
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,860
And

514
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,580
he was also kind of my benefactor

515
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,020
How could you repay kindness with betrayal

516
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,140
by killing him?

517
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,900
I don't know

518
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,540
As for this Zidaole

519
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,780
She and I were just

520
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,020
schoolmates from the same university

521
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,900
We were in the same company

522
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,140
Let's take turns explaining

523
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,300
Suspect Bai

524
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,420
You go first

525
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,020
Why are you hiding?

526
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,100
Is this some secret signal between you and X?

527
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
My relationship with both of them runs deep

528
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,260
How deep?

529
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,700
We were part of the Zi Band

530
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,260
She was our lead singer

531
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,740
And TYP was my boss

532
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,980
You were the producer for Zi Band, right?

533
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,820
Producer, yes

534
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,460
The songs were just average

535
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,020
Fine, I accept that

536
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,660
Zidaole and I

537
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,140
were both artists signed by TYP

538
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,860
And

539
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,300
she was my girlfriend

540
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Since when?

541
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,220
It was a secret relationship

542
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,380
We even had matching names

543
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,060
Kedaole

544
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Zidaole

545
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,220
Was this known to everyone or...

546
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,980
It was known to everyone

547
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,660
Was it real love?

548
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,380
Of course

549
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,180
But there's one problem

550
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,700
You have no connection with Zi Daole either

551
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,820
You're her ex-boyfriend

552
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,580
I'm not

553
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,180
You have no connection with my girlfriend

554
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,060
None

555
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Fight breaks out

556
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,060
I was just bluffing him

557
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,940
It's fine

558
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,420
Alright

559
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,740
Then it's my turn to speak

560
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,540
My relationship with Zi Daole is just

561
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,740
Female artists from the same company

562
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,580
We might compete for the top female artist position

563
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,140
There might be some rivalry

564
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,500
But Ke Daole

565
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,980
This also gives you a murder motive

566
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,100
But don't forget

567
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,500
The one who just sang with TYP

568
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,220
Was Zi Daole

569
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,700
Not me

570
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,300
That proves I didn't compete

571
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,060
Which makes your motive even stronger

572
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,540
Anyway

573
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,580
I actually had a good relationship with Zi Daole

574
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,300
As for me and TYP

575
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,340
He's just my boss

576
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,580
Nothing more than that

577
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,500
Let me share first

578
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,700
Some evidence we've found

579
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:57,980
Zi Daole

580
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,780
She was stabbed by something

581
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,540
Sharp and long

582
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,660
Because the wound on her body was very deep

583
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,260
So it should be

584
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,180
something relatively long

585
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,100
that directly pierced

586
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,580
her left carotid artery

587
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,700
causing her to bleed to death

588
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
There was blood everywhere

589
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,140
This is Zidaole's coat

590
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,860
Inside her pocket was found

591
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,260
a paper titled "The Seven Strange Tales of Tuiyi"

592
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,900
This strange tale

593
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,700
wasn't this what she was reading?

594
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,580
I read it

595
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,580
Right

596
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,540
Then in this small auditorium

597
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,420
while collecting evidence

598
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,180
the piano room next door

599
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,980
suddenly produced a very eerie

600
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,660
and terrifying piano sound

601
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,420
We both went to the piano room

602
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,500
and found the piano playing by itself

603
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,340
a piece called "The Deadly Melody"

604
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,860
"The Deadly Melody"

605
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,420
What?

606
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,500
Then the two of us went behind the screen

607
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,100
and found TYP

608
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,940
He died behind the screen

609
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,340
TYP

610
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,420
There were no obvious external injuries on his body

611
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,580
His lips were black and purple

612
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,660
His hands were also black

613
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,220
He likely died from poisoning.

614
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,140
But there was a fragrance on his body.

615
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,260
We both smelled it.

616
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,780
Yes.

617
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,420
There was a scent.

618
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,060
A perfume smell.

619
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,020
There was a certification tag inside his jacket.

620
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,060
And in this...

621
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,580
Inside TYP's pocket...

622
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,500
we also found...

623
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,580
a paper titled "The Seven Mysteries of Tuiyi Arts."

624
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,020
Again, that...

625
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,780
There was also one.

626
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,260
Right.

627
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
So both victims today...

628
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,660
are connected to our campus legend...

629
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,380
about...

630
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,420
"The Seven Mysteries of Tuiyi Arts."

631
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,500
"Don't open cabinets carelessly."

632
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,180
"Beware of blood-covered people..."

633
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,700
"hiding inside cabinets."

634
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Zidangle corresponds to the first rule.

635
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,660
TYP corresponds to...

636
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,620
"Don't enter empty piano rooms lightly."

637
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,940
"Beware of deadly piano music playing there."

638
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,660
One rule, one death.

639
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,260
Five rules left, five more will die.

640
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,460
That means you all.

641
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,460
I think so.

642
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,500
Perhaps the killer

643
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,660
is imitating the Seven Mysteries to commit murders.

644
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,500
That would prove

645
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,820
there will be more

646
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,860
cases happening later.

647
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,420
as foretold in this prophecy.

648
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,900
Now let's talk about the time of death.

649
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,580
Not entirely certain.

650
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,180
But at least

651
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,060
the person performing on stage

652
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,900
was indeed him.

653
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,820
So between the 11 AM break

654
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,180
and when we found the body

655
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,380
at 4:10 PM is when the death occurred.

656
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,180
Did you two find

657
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,340
any weapon at the scene?

658
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,020
No.

659
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,460
At both crime scenes,

660
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,020
no weapons were found.

661
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,620
Alright, about the evidence I have -

662
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,620
look at this first.

663
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,780
In the auditorium,

664
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,260
there are two identical prop cabinets

665
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,740
and two identical prop paintings.

666
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,980
The cabinets have labels indicating

667
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,620
'highly sealed'.

668
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,500
Meaning those prop cabinets

669
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,860
wouldn't let anything

670
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,820
leak out from inside.

671
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,140
So blood couldn't leak out, right?

672
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,940
Correct.

673
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,860
Strange.

674
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,100
This area is unusually clean, but

675
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,980
Zhi Daole's blood

676
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,060
shouldn't have leaked out.

677
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,220
The killer murdered Zhi Daole

678
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,940
and then moved the body here.

679
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,260
Then they died before that.

680
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,820
Yes, then put it into the cabinet.

681
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,500
Then pushed it in.

682
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,020
Right.

683
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,060
Then we saw on the auditorium wall,

684
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
the director's note for you all,

685
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,660
assigning tasks.

686
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,540
June 3rd, 4 PM,

687
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,780
official rehearsal.

688
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,340
Do me a favor.

689
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,660
Move props from storage to the small auditorium.

690
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,540
2 PM,

691
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,660
Ning Hao moves a prop cabinet.

692
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,180
2:30 PM,

693
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,620
Canary moves a prop painting.

694
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,180
Correct.

695
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,220
3 PM,

696
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,380
Bai Yangzuo moves a prop painting.

697
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,620
3:30 PM,

698
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,380
Ke Daole moves a prop cabinet.

699
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,620
So one of them

700
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,380
moved the prop cabinet containing a corpse

701
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:10,980
How was it?

702
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,380
Have you figured out how to explain it?

703
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,660
Yes, hurry up and explain.

704
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,620
The weight of the boxes you pushed—

705
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,020
Did you feel anything?

706
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,180
Were the boxes heavy?

707
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,580
No, it felt normal.

708
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,020
That's how it was.

709
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,100
I’ve never pushed prop boxes before.

710
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,220
I don’t know how heavy they were supposed to be.

711
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,500
So I just pushed them normally.

712
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,260
And there's one more thing

713
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,580
The most crucial element is

714
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,460
the surveillance footage in the computer

715
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:46,900
Really?

716
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,980
Everyone can take a look

717
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,580
Let me draw you a

718
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,060
view from the surveillance footage

719
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,940
When we enter

720
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,260
There's a door here, right?

721
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,260
This is labeled as Door 4

722
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,260
This is a hallway

723
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,060
There are three doors here

724
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,300
This is Door 1

725
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,700
Door 2 and Door 3

726
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,700
And this is our auditorium

727
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,980
This is the piano room where TYP died

728
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Opposite the auditorium

729
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,780
This is the props room

730
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,100
This is the yoga room

731
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,100
This is a recording studio

732
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,140
The surveillance camera is here

733
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,420
It's on the left side of the hallway

734
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,140
So its field of view

735
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,900
only covers this much

736
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,660
There are blind spots

737
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,060
Right

738
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,540
This area is a camera blind spot

739
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,740
It can't see here

740
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,260
Another suspicious point is

741
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,460
this surveillance camera

742
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
This surveillance camera

743
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,740
is only active from 12:30 PM

744
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,380
until 10:30 PM

745
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,940
every day.

746
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,940
From the surveillance footage,

747
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,100
we can piece together a timeline.

748
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,620
Zidangle entered through Gate 2

749
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,100
as the first person to enter the props room.

750
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,380
(1:10 PM)

751
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,500
and never left.

752
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,060
TYP entered at 1:20 PM,

753
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,180
passed through the corridor from Gate 4,

754
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,980
and entered the props room.

755
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,260
He was never seen again.

756
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,660
Ninghao entered at 2:00 PM,

757
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,220
moved a props box at 2:05 PM,

758
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,380
and left at 2:10 PM

759
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,500
through Gate 2.

760
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,060
Right.

761
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,340
Goldfinch arrived at 2:30 PM,

762
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,260
moved a painting at 2:35 PM,

763
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,300
and left at 2:40 PM.

764
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,460
Same as before,

765
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,620
exiting through Gate 2.

766
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,980
Bai Yangzuo arrived at 3:00 PM,

767
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,180
moved a painting at 3:05 PM,

768
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,940
and left at 3:10 PM.

769
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,580
Kedangle came at 3:30 PM,

770
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,220
moved something at 3:35 PM,

771
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,740
and left at 3:40 PM.

772
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,540
Then from 1:50 PM

773
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,700
until 3:50 PM,

774
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,380
Xiao Hou was in the auditorium the whole time

775
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,580
helping with set decoration.

776
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,740
TYP

777
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,340
went straight into the props room

778
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,540
and never came out.

779
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,740
He died in the music room,

780
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,900
meaning he actually died in the props room

781
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,940
and was then

782
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,180
moved to the music room.

783
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,060
Is that correct?

784
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,620
This relates to what we mentioned earlier

785
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,820
about that painting.

786
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,300
The painting's dimensions are

787
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,900
1 meter by 1.8 meters.

788
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,060
If the killer hid the victim

789
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,260
behind the painting

790
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,420
and transported it that way,

791
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
that would make sense.

792
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,460
If this possibility holds,

793
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,300
then the two people who moved the paintings

794
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,260
would absolutely

795
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,940
know whether there was a body behind them.

796
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,740
There's another logic

797
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,540
How can you be certain

798
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,940
that TYP was already dead when he arrived?

799
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,780
If he was conspiring with the killer

800
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,260
and hiding behind the painting,

801
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,460
then the killer murdered TYP.

802
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,300
I think that possibility is very slim.

803
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,020
I agree.

804
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,980
But it is still a possibility.

805
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,380
Right?

806
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,340
So what you're saying is

807
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,140
where exactly did he die?

808
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,380
Let's discuss the evidence everyone has

809
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,180
First

810
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,980
Ke Daole

811
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,260
The evidence in my box is

812
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,580
Ning Hao's evidence

813
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,660
Let's start with this IOU

814
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,140
I, Ning Hao, owe Director Fu 20,000 yuan

815
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,060
Promise to repay within one month

816
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
July 1, 2002

817
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,100
Below it is a pass

818
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,660
Audition pass

819
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,140
For the film "Crazy Stone Thief"

820
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,300
Name: Ning Hao

821
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,940
Date: July 2, 2002

822
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,860
Let me elaborate

823
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,740
As everyone knows

824
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,900
I gained recognition through

825
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,620
acting in "Crazy Stone Thief"

826
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,460
and won the Best Actor award

827
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,300
won the Best Actor award

828
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,260
Best Supporting Actor

829
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,100
and three major acting awards

830
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,820
Triple Push Best Actor

831
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,660
Triple Push Best Actor

832
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,420
But I want to say

833
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,060
In the beginning,

834
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,100
I was someone who loved acting deeply

835
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,420
but could never land any roles

836
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,780
I could only be a "Push drifter"

837
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,220
in our Push Town

838
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,100
doing bit parts in film crews

839
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,540
playing insignificant roles

840
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,420
Then one day by chance

841
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,820
I heard the famous Director He

842
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,180
was making a new film

843
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,300
I wanted an audition chance

844
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,780
So I approached the casting director

845
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,540
Director Fu here

846
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
I thought I'd

847
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,980
treat him to dinner

848
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,300
and get closer to him

849
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,060
to maybe get an audition

850
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,940
But unexpectedly

851
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,700
he got me drunk that day

852
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,660
After getting me drunk

853
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,060
he made me sign an IOU

854
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,740
for 20,000 yuan

855
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,780
to "buy a pass"

856
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,220
Basically bribing him

857
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,860
to give me a chance

858
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,900
All my savings

859
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,500
amount to just 20,000 yuan

860
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,860
This is all the money I have

861
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,180
If I give it to him, I won't be able to survive

862
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,260
So I took this pass

863
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,580
and went to TYP company

864
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,380
to find Director Fu's office

865
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,820
and steal this IOU note

866
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,060
I did see the IOU

867
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,660
But as I was leaving

868
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,420
I was sneaking around

869
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,980
acting all suspicious

870
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,180
when accidentally

871
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,780
I wandered into an audition

872
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,180
a casting call

873
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,660
My furtive movements were caught on camera

874
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,660
The TYP boss saw me on the monitor

875
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,660
"This person's acting is so natural"

876
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,740
"Perfect thief-like demeanor"

877
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,780
So he called me over

878
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,580
Said "You there"

879
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,900
"You're here to audition, right?"

880
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,420
"Your performance was amazing"

881
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,300
"Perfectly nuanced"

882
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,100
"Just right"

883
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,580
"You'll play"

884
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,540
the lead in "Crazy Stone Thief"

885
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,660
named "Stone Thief"

886
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,580
Through sheer coincidence

887
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,340
Yes

888
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,580
I got cast just like that

889
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,340
Then let's talk about your second piece of evidence

890
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,900
This was found in your dorm room

891
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,700
inside the desk drawer

892
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,220
a photo album we discovered

893
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,780
Friends walk together through life

894
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,620
Those days are gone now

895
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,060
Inside this photo album

896
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,260
Can you tell me who this is?

897
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,700
Brother

898
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,140
What?

899
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
There's a short-haired version of the canary

900
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,340
He's called the golden monkey

901
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,180
He's your biological brother

902
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,140
Biological brother

903
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,940
Back in May 2002

904
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,860
These two took

905
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,100
a photo together like this

906
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,660
In June 2002

907
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,500
there was another photo

908
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,100
On the third page

909
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
suddenly appeared

910
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,740
a photo of him with a masked man

911
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,820
Then

912
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,620
Brother

913
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,500
Thank you for giving me

914
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
this suit and mask

915
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
So cool

916
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,500
I what?

917
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,140
I love it so much

918
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,340
I adore it

919
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,140
I like it so much

920
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,180
I love it

921
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,860
Let's go online

922
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,780
What's the relationship with Golden Monkey?

923
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,380
This Golden Monkey...

924
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,700
was also an extra actor.

925
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,860
When I was in Tui Town...

926
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,260
working as an extra...

927
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,940
when we were both struggling together...

928
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,300
that's when I met him.

929
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,620
Because at that time...

930
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,180
we were both living very hard lives.

931
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,980
Finding work...

932
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,420
or getting into a production crew was extremely difficult.

933
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,220
But he and I...

934
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,140
relied on each other for survival.

935
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,300
We would also...

936
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,740
rent a place together...

937
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,860
and live together.

938
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,580
We supported each other.

939
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,660
I think during that period...

940
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,380
although it was tough...

941
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,060
having such a friend by my side...

942
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,020
made me extremely happy.

943
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,740
So he's my best friend...

944
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,340
in this world.

945
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,220
Best friend.

946
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,460
Best friend.

947
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,140
Yes.

948
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,060
Although I've been doing better...

949
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,740
I've never...

950
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,620
distanced myself from him.

951
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,500
I still occasionally ask him out for meals...

952
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,340
and hang out together.

953
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,740
I share my happiness with him.

954
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,260
About the formal suit...

955
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,340
There was one time...

956
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,460
I specially bought a set of clothes...

957
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,380
and gave it to him.

958
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,100
He liked it very much...

959
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,060
put it on immediately and said...

960
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,980
"Let's take a photo together."

961
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,740
I said okay.

962
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,140
That's the photo.

963
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,860
So this person is Golden Monkey.

964
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,740
Exactly.

965
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,820
Since your emotional bond with him

966
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,540
is so deep

967
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,420
Exhibit three

968
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,220
A crucial piece of evidence

969
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,900
was found inside his pillowcase

970
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,940
Hidden very carefully

971
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,060
It was an envelope from

972
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,460
an investigation agency called Tuihui Detective Agency

973
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:22,660
An envelope

974
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,420
containing several photographs

975
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,580
Let me show them to you one by one

976
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,940
The first photo shows

977
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,140
this masked man in formal attire

978
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,540
whom he just referred to as Golden Monkey

979
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,300
talking with TYP

980
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,740
The second one

981
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,060
shows TYP pushing

982
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,380
this masked man in formal attire

983
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,340
The third photo

984
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,180
shows the formally dressed man fallen on the ground

985
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,820
lying dead in a pool of blood

986
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,300
So to take revenge

987
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,980
you killed TYP

988
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,740
Here's what happened.

989
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,380
One day,

990
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,740
I made plans with him in April,

991
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,020
suggesting we meet on May 3rd.

992
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,260
I proposed we have dinner together.

993
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,900
He agreed.

994
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,180
We had it all arranged.

995
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,660
On that day,

996
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,220
I went to the restaurant,

997
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,900
but he never showed up all evening.

998
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,820
I found it very strange,

999
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,220
because when I invite him,

1000
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,380
he never misses it.

1001
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,300
So I went to his place,

1002
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,940
but he wasn't home either.

1003
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,140
However, on his calendar

1004
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,740
I found an entry:

1005
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,900
"May 3rd -

1006
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,700
attend masquerade ball."

1007
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,220
Masquerade ball...

1008
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,100
That's organized by our school's TYP club.

1009
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,300
He would definitely attend that.

1010
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,100
Hosted by TYP.

1011
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,180
Yes, by TYP.

1012
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,900
So I suspected

1013
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,060
this was connected to TYP.

1014
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,540
I went back to

1015
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,020
our TYP company to investigate.

1016
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,740
I asked if anyone

1017
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,180
had seen Golden Monkey.

1018
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,380
Nobody had seen him.

1019
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,660
But when I asked TYP,

1020
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,300
he became evasive and hesitant.

1021
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,100
That's when I concluded

1022
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,380
he was hiding something.

1023
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,260
His behavior

1024
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,300
was clearly suspicious.

1025
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:02,860
Because nobody

1026
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,220
knows sneakiness better than me.

1027
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,220
He was even shadier.

1028
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,700
Exactly.

1029
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,420
So I immediately

1030
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,340
spotted his guilt.

1031
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,300
I hired this detective agency

1032
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,620
to investigate thoroughly,

1033
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,980
to find out the truth.

1034
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,740
Eventually,

1035
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,020
they provided me with evidence

1036
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,660
confirming that

1037
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,460
TYP killed Golden Monkey.

1038
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,900
So there was a motive

1039
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,100
Yes, I had that motive

1040
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,260
So you killed for revenge

1041
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,940
and took out TYP

1042
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,380
I didn’t

1043
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,020
Then did you kill Zi Daole?

1044
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,500
I wasn’t close to Zi Daole

1045
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,940
When you killed TYP

1046
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,460
Zi Daole found out

1047
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,140
So you took care of Zi Daole too

1048
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,980
Next is Bai Yangzuo

1049
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,940
Mine is the golden monkey's little sister

1050
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,020
The canary's

1051
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,660
The canary's

1052
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,420
My turn

1053
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,620
Quick, eat a pistachio to cheer up

1054
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,700
Inside this sticker photo album

1055
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,540
I don't know how to say it

1056
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,380
Look

1057
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,580
What's this again

1058
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,700
What's wrong?

1059
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,020
What's wrong?

1060
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,340
What do you mean?

1061
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,820
It's like having that kind of...

1062
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,980
very intimate kind of photo together.

1063
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,060
That feeling I can't bring myself to talk about

1064
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,340
What is this?

1065
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,500
Photos of me with my dear brothers

1066
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,980
What is this?

1067
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,220
The first one is

1068
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,580
A photo of her and her brother

1069
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,340
My brother

1070
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,460
The second one is

1071
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,380
A photo of her and Keqin

1072
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,460
Burn this for me

1073
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:04,940
You're going to ruin me

1074
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,060
This is her own doing

1075
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,580
What are you trying to do?

1076
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,980
Just how many "good brothers" do I have?

1077
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,740
You singled out two people.

1078
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,740
Canary

1079
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,740
Why wasn't it you who died today?

1080
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,500
You're letting love turn into resentment.

1081
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,220
Your love triangle situation

1082
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,060
It's already painfully obvious.

1083
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,340
So it's a love triangle.

1084
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,740
Speaking of which, let me add something.

1085
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,060
Back in September last year,

1086
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,540
I transferred into this school.

1087
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,300
So melodramatic.

1088
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:50,980
I love watching this.

1089
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,140
Then when I joined this class,

1090
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,540
I saw Canary's face

1091
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,300
and was completely captivated by her.

1092
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,820
began pursuing her

1093
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,660
To be honest

1094
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,700
When I was pursuing her

1095
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,060
she already had a boyfriend at first

1096
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,980
Who was her boyfriend?

1097
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,100
Who was her boyfriend?

1098
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,940
Ke Daole

1099
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,220
Last year

1100
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,220
they were still dating

1101
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,860
After I found out she had a boyfriend

1102
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,220
I said alright then

1103
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,740
and wished them well

1104
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,940
But a month later

1105
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,100
they broke up

1106
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,420
Did she break up for you?

1107
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,500
No

1108
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,020
I didn't do anything like that

1109
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,340
Then why did they break up?

1110
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,900
Because of you

1111
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,420
You stole her away

1112
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,420
Your relationship is so complicated

1113
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,220
I was the one who dumped him

1114
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,820
I take the initiative in relationships

1115
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,300
I can't help it

1116
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,780
Because I'm like a morning glory

1117
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,740
Morning glory

1118
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,260
Even the ox is coming out

1119
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,900
How could I not follow him?

1120
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,740
Let me explain

1121
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,220
Golden Monkey is my dear brother

1122
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,500
I grew up in a single-parent family

1123
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,420
My father

1124
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,740
was very worried about my health

1125
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,420
because I was truly sickly and weak

1126
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,420
So he had my brother

1127
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,980
take care of me all the time

1128
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,580
Feeding me

1129
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,420
Combing my hair

1130
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:24,900
Dressing me

1131
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,700
All these were done by my brother

1132
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,380
So you couldn't take care of yourself as a child

1133
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:28,900
Right?

1134
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,300
Yes

1135
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,020
Later

1136
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,100
I got into our performing arts school

1137
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,860
But my brother

1138
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,860
went to work as an extra

1139
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,820
What was I to do?

1140
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,660
I couldn't be without a brother by my side

1141
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,660
So at school

1142
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,460
I found many brothers

1143
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,500
I was running a fever all over school

1144
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,780
Fever everywhere

1145
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,780
Sickly and weak

1146
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,780
Sickly and frail

1147
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,540
No

1148
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,300
I had a fever

1149
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,700
Pretended to be delicate

1150
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,860
Right

1151
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,300
So many older brothers and sisters

1152
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,060
Fell for my act

1153
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,740
But the one who fell hardest

1154
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,900
Was our Ke Daole

1155
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,100
It always made him so happy

1156
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,980
He'd laugh uncontrollably

1157
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,340
Then he treated me extra special

1158
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,260
So I said

1159
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,020
Alright then

1160
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,100
I'll agree

1161
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,700
to let you be my first love

1162
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,100
He was overjoyed

1163
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,580
But

1164
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,940
I never imagined

1165
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,220
there could be better brothers in this world

1166
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,100
So tall

1167
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,500
So handsome

1168
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,860
He rushed over and said

1169
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,740
"Be with me"

1170
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,620
Moo

1171
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,820
What's "moo"?

1172
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,700
Moo

1173
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,020
He's my Bull Demon King

1174
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,980
But he's not very good at doing hair

1175
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,700
Because my brother

1176
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,660
used to do my hair since childhood

1177
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,700
So in my first photo

1178
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,860
I had two little buns

1179
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,460
You're somewhat better at it

1180
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,300
It's a half ponytail

1181
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,300
But he's completely clueless

1182
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,380
Leaves my hair all messy

1183
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,060
That's my story with my brother

1184
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,380
Should we just...

1185
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,660
...get rid of her?

1186
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,100
And you should quit being an investigator too.

1187
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:19,660
I'm quitting.

1188
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,900
So dramatic, I love it.

1189
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,100
The next piece of evidence is Exhibit B.

1190
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,980
There's a bankbook.

1191
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,580
This bankbook...

1192
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:32,780
Every month there is

1193
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,620
1000 yuan in tokens

1194
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,540
deposited and withdrawn

1195
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,140
deposited and withdrawn

1196
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:40,620
Right

1197
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,420
Tell me about this

1198
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,380
Where do you work

1199
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,820
Or who is sending you this money

1200
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,580
Speaking of this money

1201
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,420
it brings up my sad story

1202
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,340
The brother I loved most

1203
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,780
was still my Brother Hou

1204
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,820
He didn't pass our performance exam

1205
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,700
but kept working as an extra

1206
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,220
Yet he still cared for me deeply

1207
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,060
Though we met less often

1208
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,300
every month he would

1209
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,260
send me 1000 yuan

1210
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,260
The day after sending it

1211
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,100
I would eagerly withdraw it

1212
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,820
because I desperately needed money

1213
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,420
You already have two brothers

1214
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,660
taking care of your fever

1215
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,340
Yet you still

1216
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,740
had to buy fever medicine

1217
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,060
But suddenly one day

1218
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,180
around May 2004

1219
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,380
April 29th was the last transfer

1220
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,180
Yes

1221
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,300
That May, nothing came

1222
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,940
Because on the 30th of each month

1223
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,820
the second-to-last day

1224
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,820
he would send money

1225
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,740
I waited in vain for the 1000 yuan

1226
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,140
It wasn't about the missing money

1227
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,940
I was worried about my brother

1228
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,100
Where had he gone?

1229
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,580
So I went to

1230
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,100
his rented room to find him

1231
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,220
The landlord said

1232
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,900
"Your brother hasn't been here for ages"

1233
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,820
I could only search around

1234
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,380
All I found was a note

1235
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,700
The note said:

1236
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,740
May 3rd

1237
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,060
Please come to

1238
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,460
some Tuxedo Mask party

1239
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,980
My brother went to this party

1240
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,460
and then disappeared

1241
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,580
Okay

1242
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,140
Let me continue with another clue

1243
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:08,820
Two pendants

1244
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,740
Clearly, they're sibling pendants

1245
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,540
One is a canary

1246
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,260
The other is a golden snub-nosed monkey

1247
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,700
There are bloodstains on the golden snub-nosed monkey

1248
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,820
Yes, there's bloodstains.

1249
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,460
You're making me remember that night again.

1250
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,100
That night on May 3rd.

1251
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,260
Zhi Daole and I.

1252
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,300
Wanted to take some photos.

1253
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,740
To post on Weibo for promotion.

1254
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,940
While posting them.

1255
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,900
We heard from behind.

1256
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,940
Some crazy noises.

1257
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,900
So I went with Zhi Daole to check.

1258
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,540
Then we saw TYP.

1259
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,140
And someone in a mask costume.

1260
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,300
Pushing and shoving each other.

1261
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,940
Just like in that photo.

1262
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,540
You just showed me.

1263
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,420
Finally that person was pushed down.

1264
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,180
Hit their head on a rock, bleeding profusely.

1265
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,460
I was panicking in fear.

1266
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,700
But Zhi Daole remained very calm.

1267
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,420
She said it's fine.

1268
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,140
Because she's TYP's niece.

1269
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,700
As everyone knows.

1270
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,780
Her niece.

1271
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,300
Then she told TYP.

1272
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,140
Don't worry.

1273
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,220
I'll handle this.

1274
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,180
While saying she'd handle it.

1275
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,340
She also told me.

1276
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,380
"Come, help me with this."

1277
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,140
I said "I thought you were handling it?"

1278
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,380
Then TYP said.

1279
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,460
"Do you want to do this?"

1280
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,700
"Do you want to help me?"

1281
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,820
"Do you still want to be famous?"

1282
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,220
So I said.

1283
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,580
"Fine, I'll do it."

1284
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,660
"What should I do?"

1285
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,740
"You dig the hole."

1286
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,420
Then they put that person in.

1287
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,260
So I pat-pat-patted.

1288
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,460
And buried them.

1289
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,540
That pendant.

1290
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,420
Where did the pendant come from?

1291
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,700
Later when I was looking for my brother.

1292
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,940
Didn't I see that note.

1293
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,460
In the rental apartment?

1294
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,300
Then this scene.

1295
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,900
Suddenly flashed in my mind.

1296
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,380
Could it be that what I buried on May 3rd was...

1297
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,300
my brother

1298
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,620
Then I found that pit

1299
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,140
The pit I dug with my own hands

1300
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,420
I dug

1301
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,740
A month passed

1302
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,780
The corpse was unrecognizable

1303
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,300
I couldn't even remove the mask

1304
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,420
It was all stuck

1305
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,420
I couldn't tell

1306
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,820
Just when I had nowhere to turn

1307
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,100
I saw on his hand

1308
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,980
Our

1309
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,820
pendant

1310
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,180
Sibling necklace

1311
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,700
With blood on it

1312
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,940
So you saw with your own eyes

1313
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,300
TYP killed your brother, right?

1314
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,260
Yes

1315
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,300
Your motive for murder is too strong

1316
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,140
Overwhelmingly strong

1317
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,780
The stronger it is, the less likely you're the killer

1318
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,540
Let me tell you

1319
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,660
It's possible

1320
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,260
But I still think you're the killer

1321
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,980
Bai Yangzuo

1322
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,700
Fine

1323
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,740
You just wait

1324
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:43,940
Next

1325
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,500
Next is the canary

1326
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,620
Allow me to return the favor

1327
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,860
Bai Yangzuo

1328
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,780
Let's examine Bai Yangzuo's evidence

1329
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,500
First piece

1330
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,180
Inside the suitcase in the recording studio

1331
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,300
There was a box

1332
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,460
The box was labeled with:

1333
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,860
2003 "Promoting Affection" Golden Melody Awards

1334
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,700
Best Original Love Song Theme Award

1335
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,860
Best New Artist Group Award

1336
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,340
Best In-Group CP Award

1337
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,220
Zike Syrup

1338
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,260
And on this box

1339
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,460
Someone was circled

1340
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,580
That was Ke Daole

1341
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,340
Beside it were written some A B

1342
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,180
A B C D letters

1343
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,420
Explain then

1344
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,700
One day

1345
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,060
TYP came to find me

1346
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,020
Said I was very talented

1347
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,100
And wanted to form a band

1348
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,420
So I formed a group with Ke Daole

1349
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,420
And Zi Daole

1350
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,740
We formed a music group

1351
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,980
Our first song

1352
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,020
Became an instant hit

1353
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,980
We peaked right from debut

1354
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,300
Because I was the main

1355
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,900
Music producer

1356
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,780
His role in our team was

1357
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,420
Rap

1358
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,620
Yes, the rap parts

1359
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,980
What he writes

1360
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,500
needs my approval

1361
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,180
He's written many things

1362
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,380
I think it's just

1363
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:58,940
complete trash

1364
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,740
absolute garbage

1365
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,580
really terrible stuff

1366
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,420
Right

1367
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,340
So I replied to him

1368
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,060
about those abbreviations

1369
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,780
What do they mean?

1370
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,500
Don't you know what they mean?

1371
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,420
Of course I don't know

1372
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:09,860
How would I know?

1373
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,180
Like sitting on pins and needles

1374
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,340
Like thorns in my back

1375
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,220
Like a fishbone stuck in my throat

1376
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,020
I thought RZZZ

1377
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,020
stood for "scumbag"

1378
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,340
That's what I assumed

1379
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,380
Originally I intended

1380
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,340
but thought it wasn't appropriate

1381
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,100
Let's drop it

1382
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:32,700
Never mind

1383
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,540
Don't be too...

1384
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,620
Wait a minute

1385
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,300
There's more inside

1386
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,540
In here we have

1387
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,740
tapes of their original compositions

1388
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,180
Probably made by Bai Yang

1389
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,100
producing hit songs for them

1390
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,260
I wrote these

1391
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,260
Let me read them out

1392
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,780
Suona with guitar

1393
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,180
"I'm Your Superstar"

1394
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,260
Qin, xiao, strings and flute combined

1395
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,300
"Folk Rock You and Me"

1396
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,140
Electronic keyboard with pipa

1397
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,980
"Let's Rock and Wash Together"

1398
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,100
Erhu meets drum set

1399
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,500
"Won't Suffer Love's Bitterness"

1400
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,540
But everything was destroyed

1401
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,940
Bai Yangzuo probably couldn't stand

1402
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,220
the love song he wrote

1403
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,100
being sung by someone else

1404
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,700
Bai Yang has met his match today.

1405
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,460
No.

1406
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,340
Finally, someone can put you in your place.

1407
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,300
Explain yourself.

1408
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,580
Ever since I was a child,

1409
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,060
I’ve loved folk music.

1410
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:43,660
I just wanted

1411
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,180
to blend folk music with rock

1412
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,220
and combine them.

1413
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,580
To create folk-rock.

1414
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,060
But TYP made me write

1415
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,820
songs about romance and love—

1416
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,980
these kinds of songs,

1417
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,420
these tracks.

1418
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,060
But that’s not what I wanted.

1419
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,420
Then one day,

1420
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,660
Zidao Le discovered this

1421
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,340
and asked me,

1422
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,340
"What are you doing?"

1423
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,700
"Why are you writing this nonsense?"

1424
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,780
It’s not even something I can sing.

1425
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,980
Why bother writing it?

1426
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,380
So,

1427
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:14,860
She destroyed your

1428
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,660
hard work.

1429
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,940
Then she said no

1430
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,860
If you don't properly

1431
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,060
work within this team

1432
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,540
and write songs that match

1433
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,140
our current positioning

1434
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,060
I'll have my uncle blacklist you

1435
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,460
I never expected

1436
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,260
this girl would be

1437
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,500
so ruthless

1438
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,340
Completely different from

1439
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,420
her on-screen persona

1440
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,740
Totally different

1441
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,980
Then I had no choice

1442
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,380
You had to kill her

1443
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,740
Or your career would be over

1444
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,340
Exactly

1445
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,340
You make perfect sense

1446
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:47,980
Right

1447
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,780
Did you like her?

1448
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,260
If I liked her, could I have killed her?

1449
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,700
No, love turned to hate

1450
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,020
But what he truly loved was art

1451
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,580
For art's sake

1452
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,660
Both could be sacrificed

1453
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,380
I understand you

1454
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,060
Don't fall for me

1455
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,500
I already have too many brothers

1456
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,140
You're really oozing charm constantly

1457
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,060
Alright, let's talk about

1458
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,220
Under the coffee table in the recording studio

1459
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,740
there's a copy of "Push Town Gossip Weekly"

1460
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,300
with Bai Yang on the cover

1461
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,740
calling him Push Town's new mad prince

1462
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,260
Taking over from

1463
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,060
the previous mad prince

1464
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:29,740
which was me

1465
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,900
Bai Yangzuo's social demise at the noodle gathering

1466
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,860
Shocking appearance of "Half-Step Madness with Alcohol"

1467
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,060
Bai Yangzuo, musician and producer of Purple Band

1468
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,100
Born into a musical family

1469
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,460
But during a noodle gathering

1470
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,260
His "mad lad" traits were revealed

1471
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,500
A quick summary of Bai Yangzuo's actions that night

1472
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,660
Casual rundown

1473
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,420
One

1474
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,220
Forced several people to follow him

1475
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,060
In dancing "The Big Sedan Chair" together

1476
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,580
Can you demonstrate it now?

1477
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,460
Combined with rock music

1478
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,500
Begin

1479
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,180
What she meant was

1480
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,260
I forced people to dance with me

1481
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,860
Then shouldn't you—

1482
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:02,540
What are you doing?

1483
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,780
Forcing everyone to dance

1484
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,700
Then just go with it

1485
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,740
Come on, quickly, force them

1486
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,620
Just dance randomly and be done with it

1487
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,900
How do we dance?

1488
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,820
No, just walk in a cross pattern

1489
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,780
Just do the cross steps

1490
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,620
That's it.

1491
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,940
My face got a little red.

1492
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,220
Two,

1493
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,140
challenged someone to an erhu battle.

1494
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,140
Three,

1495
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,380
used my head to stop

1496
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,340
cards sliding down the wall.

1497
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,740
Four,

1498
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,500
other indescribable dangerous actions.

1499
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,180
Yes, I can't remember at all.

1500
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,260
Because I

1501
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,460
One day a reporter interviewed me,

1502
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,700
After the interview,

1503
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,420
he invited me to dinner.

1504
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,260
I said okay.

1505
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,820
After we got there,

1506
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:03,740
he kept

1507
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,020
pressuring me to drink.

1508
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,020
I took just one sip,

1509
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,060
but I never expected that after drinking,

1510
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,380
I completely blacked out.

1511
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,060
I have no memory of it at all.

1512
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,540
Only the next day did I discover

1513
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,700
I'd done these things.

1514
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,300
But how it all happened -

1515
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,420
I don't remember at all.

1516
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:21,740
Recording studio.

1517
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,860
Then I found his computer.

1518
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,980
When I opened it,

1519
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,260
there was only one contact on QQ -

1520
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,340
our Zidaole.

1521
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,500
Clicking on Zidaole,

1522
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,460
this chat history appeared.

1523
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,860
Chatting with Zidaole

1524
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,500
Bai Yangzuo

1525
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,380
Let me tell you what's going on

1526
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,100
Come, sit over there

1527
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,780
Because for a long time,

1528
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,140
I've been threatened by Zidaole,

1529
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,860
and I couldn't do anything about it.

1530
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,820
I was constantly oppressed by her.

1531
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,380
One day,

1532
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,780
I suddenly received news

1533
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,540
that TYP

1534
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,100
was hosting a masquerade ball.

1535
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,660
So I took

1536
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,780
a newly composed

1537
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,300
song I wanted to create,

1538
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:05,980
a piece of music,

1539
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,140
planning to talk with TYP that day

1540
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,980
about it.

1541
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,180
I wanted to see if he could

1542
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,380
possibly incorporate

1543
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,700
some elements of this style.

1544
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,660
When I went to the party,

1545
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,980
Zidaole saw me

1546
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,100
and suddenly came over,

1547
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,380
acting very friendly.

1548
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,940
Calling me "brother,"

1549
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,060
saying we should work together well

1550
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,060
on this band.

1551
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,500
She said whatever songs I wanted to make,

1552
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,100
we could

1553
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,900
discuss them together.

1554
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,020
I thought

1555
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,620
there might be hope.

1556
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,380
Then she gave me something to drink

1557
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,740
that was labeled as non-alcoholic,

1558
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,180
but after drinking it,

1559
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,140
I lost control again

1560
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,380
and passed out.

1561
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,700
When I woke up the next day,

1562
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,260
I was lying

1563
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,980
in front of my rented dorm,

1564
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,460
and found blood on my clothes.

1565
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,540
I rushed home

1566
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,380
to check online for any news.

1567
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,300
Then she sent me

1568
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,540
threatening photos,

1569
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,740
trying to frame me.

1570
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,900
She said I killed someone last night

1571
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,260
and that I must obey her from now on.

1572
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,060
I don't even know if last night

1573
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,820
I actually killed someone or not

1574
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,860
But because of this picture

1575
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,420
I believed I killed him

1576
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,260
But now it's proven

1577
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:20,900
that I didn't kill him

1578
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,500
It was TYP

1579
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,500
And there's also a motive

1580
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,060
A very strong motive

1581
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,020
Alright, we can vote now

1582
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:31,900
Vote

1583
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,100
Now it's my turn

1584
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:41,300
Right

1585
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:41,660
Yes

1586
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,220
Your turn

1587
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,100
Only you're left

1588
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,340
What I have is Kedao Le's evidence

1589
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,340
Inside is a box of leather covers

1590
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,820
Rubber bands

1591
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,100
And there's a chat log inside

1592
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,900
It's Canary

1593
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,220
A chat log with Kedao Le

1594
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,020
Most likely

1595
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,620
Still in contact

1596
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,460
From before

1597
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,140
Don't be jealous

1598
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,620
The canary sent him a song

1599
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,180
called "Our Love"

1600
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,740
Ke Daole changed "Our Love"

1601
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,460
to "The Love Between Us Three"

1602
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,300
What nonsense

1603
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,540
"The Love Between Us Three"

1604
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,980
"The Love Between Us Three"

1605
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,020
The modified lyrics

1606
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,180
Let me read some for you

1607
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,220
with a little singing

1608
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,060
In memories I recall vague childhood days

1609
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,940
You said your brother was a golden monkey

1610
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,180
Back then you said we'd hold hands

1611
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,660
And have me comb your hair every day

1612
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,460
After breaking up I couldn't even look up

1613
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,860
You turned my true feelings into trash

1614
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,220
Ke Daole replied with a question mark

1615
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,100
and an exclamation mark

1616
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,740
Then the canary replied with a heart

1617
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,940
Then Ke Daole wrote below

1618
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,740
You still love me after all

1619
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,340
Just like I do

1620
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,860
Why didn't I see this message?

1621
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,060
Say

1622
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,260
What's going on?

1623
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,580
That's a long story

1624
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,940
Tell me properly

1625
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,940
When I was preparing for art school exams in high school

1626
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,460
I met her

1627
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,060
Yes

1628
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,100
Back at the art prep school

1629
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,580
I really liked her

1630
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,540
Thought she was pure

1631
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,860
and pitifully cute

1632
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,940
Like morning glories

1633
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,380
I fell in love at first sight

1634
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,500
I really liked her

1635
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,740
Later we got together

1636
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,340
After getting together

1637
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,420
In September

1638
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,700
She told me she wanted to break up

1639
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,380
This costume

1640
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,740
After we broke up,

1641
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,020
she sent me this song again.

1642
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,660
I thought she wanted to get back together,

1643
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,700
so

1644
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,340
I decided to win her back.

1645
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,260
Weren't you still with someone at that time?

1646
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,740
Zidaole

1647
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,260
Yes

1648
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:27,540
I was still with her at that time

1649
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,980
But I

1650
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,620
couldn't forget her in my heart

1651
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,860
Still couldn't forget her

1652
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:34,900
So

1653
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,260
In the relationship between the three of us

1654
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,500
We kept getting entangled

1655
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,580
A beauty brings trouble

1656
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,220
During the entanglement

1657
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,220
I changed it to "Love Between the Three of Us"

1658
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,780
Because I was deeply entangled

1659
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,820
You're not exactly a good person either

1660
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,380
How am I not a good person?

1661
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,980
He wrote "Love Between the Three of Us"

1662
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,060
Hard to forget old feelings

1663
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,500
Both of you agreed

1664
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:00,780
For the three of us to be together

1665
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,500
I didn't agree

1666
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,380
I never agreed

1667
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:02,820
No

1668
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,940
This was just my own

1669
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,260
Wishful thinking

1670
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,780
You wanted the three of us together

1671
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:07,420
No

1672
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:07,620
I

1673
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:07,860
Yes

1674
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:08,100
No

1675
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:08,980
This was just to express

1676
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,340
The three of us

1677
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:09,820
Stop fanning

1678
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,340
You're so flustered

1679
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:10,900
Just to express our

1680
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,300
How did he manage this?

1681
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,700
Because he still loves me in his heart

1682
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:13,940
Right

1683
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,460
But in reality, he's with Zidaole

1684
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,780
They have this necessary professional relationship

1685
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,340
What you're doing

1686
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,260
Doesn't seem like something from 2004

1687
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:23,540
Period dramas

1688
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,060
Don't they often have this kind of plot?

1689
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,340
You should be very familiar with it

1690
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,300
The last one

1691
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,860
is Kedao Le's second piece of evidence

1692
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,900
It's an MP3 player

1693
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,980
found under the pillow on his dorm bed

1694
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,420
with a playlist on it

1695
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,340
titled "Purple Kedao Syrup Exchange Playlist"

1696
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,700
These song titles form a sentence when connected.

1697
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:57,900
"I Said I Love You"

1698
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:58,260
"But"

1699
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:58,900
"Didn't Say"

1700
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,860
"I Only Love You"

1701
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,660
"This Isn't"

1702
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,540
"My Fickleness"

1703
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,060
"It's You"

1704
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,820
"Can't Hold"

1705
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:03,660
"My Heart"

1706
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,180
"Already"

1707
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:04,780
"Apologized"

1708
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,900
"What More Do You Want From Me"

1709
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,020
"Breakup Blues"

1710
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:08,540
"Look"

1711
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,180
"The Contract"

1712
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:09,700
"Say Again"

1713
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,180
"You Are"

1714
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:10,940
"A Good Girl"

1715
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:11,260
"I"

1716
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:11,780
"This Kind of"

1717
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,540
"Boy"

1718
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,460
"Not Worth It"

1719
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,820
This is your playlist content.

1720
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,100
Here's the thing

1721
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,180
Before I went to buy hair ties

1722
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,740
I was planning this whole thing

1723
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,700
I thought

1724
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,860
I'd break up with her amicably first

1725
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,900
I didn't want to two-time anyone

1726
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,420
Right

1727
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,900
Then after the breakup

1728
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,220
I'd go reconcile with Canary

1729
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:37,740
And figure out a way

1730
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,620
To win her back

1731
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,260
Because I felt

1732
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,580
When she shared that song with me

1733
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,380
It might mean she still liked me

1734
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:46,740
Because in the past

1735
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:47,820
My favorite thing to do for her

1736
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,060
Was tying up her hair

1737
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:51,460
So I went

1738
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:55,860
And bought five hundred hair ties

1739
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,580
To give to her

1740
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:57,980
To tell her

1741
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,980
I still wanted to tie her hair for her

1742
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,340
Then when I bought it back,

1743
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,020
I ran into my current girlfriend,

1744
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,220
Zhi Daole.

1745
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:14,620
After bumping into her,

1746
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,180
the nature of it changed.

1747
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:16,980
She immediately knew

1748
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,980
that I had cheated.

1749
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,300
We argued about it,

1750
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,020
and she called me a scumbag,

1751
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,620
accusing me of being unfaithful.

1752
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,660
Then,

1753
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,740
I suggested we should break up,

1754
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,500
but she said,

1755
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,220
"Our agreement was

1756
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,660
that we can't separate

1757
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,380
unless one of us dies."

1758
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,060
For the sake of love,

1759
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,740
Then that day,

1760
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,700
because of this matter,

1761
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,060
we parted on bad terms.

1762
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:53,500
After coming back,

1763
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:57,380
I shared these playlists myself,

1764
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,380
Actually, it was because during that time,

1765
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,220
I was struggling

1766
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,300
in our three-way relationship.

1767
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,660
This was no longer just a struggle—

1768
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,860
I made it clear to her:

1769
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:08,820
Either we break up,

1770
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:09,740
or I’ll kill you.

1771
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,380
No—

1772
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,860
She refused to break up with me,

1773
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,020
so I was stuck

1774
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,980
in a very desperate situation.

1775
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,900
Want to break up?

1776
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,180
Unless I die.

1777
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,780
Unless one of us dies.

1778
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,860
We've reviewed all the evidence

1779
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,060
Alright, we've gone through all the evidence

1780
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,620
All four of them actually have

1781
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,980
their own motives for murder

1782
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,140
Next,

1783
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,620
we will proceed to the X confirmation phase.

1784
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,140
This is my first time being the investigator,

1785
01:11:59,140 --> 01:11:59,940
so I'm not sure

1786
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,420
what will happen after the selection.

1787
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:02,740
Let's stay quiet for now.

1788
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,340
Don't pick me.

1789
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,020
Don't pick me.

1790
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,260
If we pick you, we'll lose, right?

1791
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,620
Normally, we would pick you.

1792
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,380
If you want to win, don't pick me.

1793
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,100
First time experiencing this

1794
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:59,460
Completely calm and composed

1795
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,900
Almost as if nothing could faze them

1796
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,620
What's with that look?

1797
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,340
It's you.

1798
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,540
Why are you staring at him?

1799
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,140
Would X know who the killer is?

1800
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,540
Those two would know.

1801
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:24,980
Who is X and who isn't.

1802
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,220
You've played every role, huh?

1803
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,140
Do you know now?

1804
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,260
How do you know this round

1805
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,780
will be different from before?

1806
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:36,580
Alright.

1807
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:41,980
Let's go.

1808
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,740
Then let's proceed to the next round of investigation.

1809
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,340
Okay.

1810
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:44,900
Okay.

1811
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:45,100
Come on.

1812
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,820
Let's go.

1813
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,620
Little killers.

1814
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,900
Little killers.

1815
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,140
You old killer.

1816
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,580
Fine, little X.

1817
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:01,300
Alright

1818
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,620
Let's search here

1819
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,540
TYP Rest Area

1820
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,220
Okay

1821
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:07,980
Got it

1822
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:10,740
We need to search this

1823
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,380
Tui Town Daily

1824
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:16,980
Tui Town Daily

1825
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,260
The harder you work, the more successful you become

1826
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,540
Interview with the man behind the superstar

1827
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,460
Mr. TYP, may I ask

1828
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,860
what's the secret to your success?

1829
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,020
The secret to my success

1830
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,660
is our company's corporate culture

1831
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:28,260
which actually represents my secret

1832
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,340
If you haven't become

1833
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,180
a Super Star yet

1834
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,780
it must be because you're not working hard enough

1835
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,700
The reason I made this phrase

1836
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,860
our corporate culture

1837
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:34,260
is because

1838
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,620
of my own entrepreneurial story

1839
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,180
Back then

1840
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,540
I had just graduated from college

1841
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,260
with no connections

1842
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,380
no family wealth

1843
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:40,300
I relied solely on myself

1844
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,660
and my bare-handed hard work and determination

1845
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:43,860
to build TYP Entertainment

1846
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,780
into today's entertainment empire

1847
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,660
What my story tells everyone

1848
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:49,020
is that in the face of success

1849
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,380
everyone has equal opportunities

1850
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,140
Remember

1851
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,580
The harder you work, the more successful you become

1852
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:54,580
Wait a minute

1853
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,420
There's more

1854
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,100
Director He's new film begins production

1855
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,740
Background actor collapses and dies on set

1856
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,820
Who died?

1857
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:02,420
Yesterday at Director He's

1858
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,500
"Standing Out from the Crowd" film set

1859
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,100
a tragic incident suddenly occurred

1860
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:06,940
A background actor named

1861
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,420
Biao Ayan

1862
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,740
died suddenly from overwork

1863
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:15,740
In the past month, Biao Ayan

1864
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,300
had been working exceptionally hard.

1865
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,260
He was running over ten crews daily,

1866
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,220
going without sleep for three days and nights.

1867
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,100
This ultimately led to the tragedy.

1868
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,180
It's reported that

1869
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,500
Biao Ayan was a three-time Best Actor nominee during his lifetime

1870
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,060
and a devoted fan of Ning Hao.

1871
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:32,260
His dream

1872
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,460
was to follow in Ning Hao's footsteps,

1873
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,420
rising from extra roles to Best Actor.

1874
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:36,580
After learning about this,

1875
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,020
Ning Hao expressed deep regret.

1876
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,380
for his loyal fan.

1877
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,260
Next

1878
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,620
This is TYP's computer

1879
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:00,020
Decrypt this

1880
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,860
Come and decrypt this

1881
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,620
It's a password.

1882
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,340
One plus one equals seven.

1883
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,220
Zero plus zero equals question mark.

1884
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,100
Zero plus one equals nine.

1885
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,300
One plus zero equals question mark.

1886
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,140
Then 3.5 plus 3.5

1887
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,180
Right, that's what it means

1888
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:20,460
For example

1889
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,620
It's 3.5 plus 3.5 equals 7

1890
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,860
Meaning one equals 3.5

1891
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,740
Zero plus one equals 9

1892
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:28,900
Then 9 minus 3.5

1893
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,700
Is that correct?

1894
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,540
Then that's wrong

1895
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,020
Zero plus zero

1896
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,820
Would become a two-digit number

1897
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,740
The computer password should be four digits

1898
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,340
Isn't this just a pattern?

1899
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,100
"one" isn't a vertical line

1900
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,100
A vertical line

1901
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,860
1 plus 1 equals 7

1902
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,340
I think the canary approach

1903
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,020
should be correct, right?

1904
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:07,580
Isn't it?

1905
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,180
I think so too

1906
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,140
You say

1907
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,700
"zero" is a 0

1908
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:12,420
"one" isn't a 1

1909
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,540
Isn't this 9?

1910
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:16,300
Right?

1911
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,340
There's an extra stroke

1912
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,180
What about one plus zero?

1913
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,700
One plus zero equals 6

1914
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,700
Zero plus zero equals 8

1915
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,420
Right

1916
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,140
7896

1917
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:27,180
Isn't it?

1918
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,740
7896

1919
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:37,940
Right

1920
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,540
That part is correct

1921
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,140
We have a pattern here

1922
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,300
Whoever gets the password right

1923
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,300
Could be the culprit

1924
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,700
What kind of trick is this?

1925
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:52,420
He wasn't speaking earlier.

1926
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:57,180
Is there anything else on the desktop?

1927
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:58,380
Yes.

1928
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,540
Push it.

1929
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,100
Push it.

1930
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:00,540
Push it.

1931
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,260
Open it.

1932
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:03,980
Ninghao

1933
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:04,900
It's mine, right?

1934
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,100
You're on top

1935
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,020
This person is called Biao Ayan

1936
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,460
The one who died

1937
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,460
That's right

1938
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,580
Ningning

1939
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,820
After watching "Crazy Stone Thief"

1940
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,980
I was so excited

1941
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,060
Your journey from being an extra

1942
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,380
To becoming a movie star

1943
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,620
Deeply inspired me

1944
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,900
You even replied to him

1945
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:18,700
I replied to him

1946
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,740
The harder you work, the more successful you'll be

1947
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,580
You can definitely be like me

1948
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,020
Ningning

1949
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:22,700
I followed your advice

1950
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,980
Recently been working extremely hard

1951
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,180
Now I do

1952
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,540
At least ten different shoots every day

1953
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,020
Fight scenes

1954
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:27,580
Water scenes

1955
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,580
Fire scenes

1956
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,340
But my body seems to be getting more exhausted

1957
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,620
My condition keeps worsening

1958
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,420
I can't even play a corpse well anymore

1959
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,580
I'm about to give up on

1960
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,700
My acting dream

1961
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,380
Success feels so far away

1962
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:38,940
Ninghao replied

1963
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:41,380
Don't always think about being tired and wanting to quit

1964
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,220
Have you ever considered

1965
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:42,940
That the reason you haven't succeeded

1966
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,380
Is because you're not working hard enough?

1967
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,380
Biao Ayan replied

1968
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:45,780
I understand

1969
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:46,580
I shouldn't complain

1970
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,540
It's because I'm not trying hard enough

1971
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,300
I'll keep persevering

1972
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,460
You're manipulating him

1973
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,020
You're brainwashing people

1974
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:51,820
I really

1975
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,380
Right

1976
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:54,700
Ningning

1977
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,100
It's currently April 29th,

1978
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:56,580
around midnight.

1979
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,780
I've been working nonstop for

1980
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,700
three days and nights straight.

1981
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,020
But soon we have Director He's

1982
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,260
"Standing Out from the Crowd" starting production.

1983
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,020
With all this hard work,

1984
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,660
I'm bound to succeed, right?

1985
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,100
Of course.

1986
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:04,780
Don't forget,

1987
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,420
the harder you work, the more successful you'll be.

1988
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,460
It's your philosophy of hard work that harmed him.

1989
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,220
You pushed him to work hard.

1990
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,140
I didn't write this.

1991
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:21,780
You didn't write it.

1992
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,460
I didn't reply to it.

1993
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,940
Because my company's...

1994
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,060
helps manage my account.

1995
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,100
They're the ones managing the accounts.

1996
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:27,700
They're managing it.

1997
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:28,740
TYP.

1998
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:34,340
Behind the scenes, it's all TYP.

1999
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,260
Right, and also...

2000
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,660
And look at what's written at the top.

2001
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:39,380
If you haven't become a...

2002
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,100
super star yet,

2003
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:40,980
it must be because you're not trying hard enough.

2004
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,740
That's actually TYP's catchphrase.

2005
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,740
Yes, that's right.

2006
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,940
What's this?

2007
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,220
His personal space.

2008
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,380
May 31st.

2009
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,940
I still remember 1988.

2010
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,460
I was a sophomore at Tuiyi University.

2011
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,980
With the support of all my schoolmates.

2012
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,060
I won that year's.

2013
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,460
Tuiyi Star title.

2014
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:08,860
To reward myself at that time.

2015
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:09,820
I bought my life's.

2016
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:10,700
first formal dress.

2017
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,620
After 16 years.

2018
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,500
I received another invitation from my alma mater's anniversary.

2019
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,540
to perform on stage.

2020
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:15,900
I took out this dress that holds.

2021
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,340
special meaning for me.

2022
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,260
I'll wear it again on the anniversary day.

2023
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:19,620
Alma mater.

2024
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,900
See you on June 3rd.

2025
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,100
The dress he died wearing.

2026
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,220
was the same dress he bought back then.

2027
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,820
There's also a QQ email.

2028
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,420
Yes

2029
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,620
This is the QQ email

2030
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,660
I've heard about your situation

2031
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,100
You have three days to sign this

2032
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,300
Or I'll start releasing some press materials

2033
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,020
I advise you not to ruin your own future

2034
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,860
Sign it

2035
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:47,500
There's that

2036
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:47,980
Scroll down, what are you looking at?

2037
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:48,740
Contract

2038
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,260
Party B is Ke Daole

2039
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,380
Through Zi Daole's introduction

2040
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,140
Now TYP

2041
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,940
Has reached a signing agreement with Ke Daole

2042
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,380
Ke Daole

2043
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,740
From November 11, 2003 onward

2044
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,260
Will become a signed artist of TYP

2045
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,740
Together with Zi Daole and Bai Yangzuo

2046
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:08,340
Will form the Zi Music Group for debut

2047
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:08,860
Zi Music Group

2048
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,940
Unconditionally centered around Zi Daole

2049
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,700
At the same time

2050
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,820
Zi Daole and Ke Daole

2051
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:13,660
Must maintain

2052
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,980
A couple's image

2053
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,380
In public view

2054
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,580
Jointly maintain the golden couple image

2055
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,100
Never break up

2056
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,460
The two must complete at least

2057
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:24,660
Three KPIs per month

2058
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,180
Upload to platforms like Weibo

2059
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,820
At least one unique couple photo

2060
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,260
Be photographed by paparazzi on one date

2061
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,380
And get reported on Tui Zhen Big Melon

2062
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:38,900
During group performances

2063
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,580
Every eight beats

2064
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,180
Every eight beats

2065
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,180
Ke Daole must make heart gestures to Zi Daole

2066
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,660
Or blow kisses at least once

2067
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,700
There's actually such a contract

2068
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,540
Detailed terms

2069
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,620
This is truly outrageous

2070
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,340
The contract takes effect immediately

2071
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,780
Contract validity period

2072
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,220
is determined by Zidaole

2073
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,980
This isn't just an unfair contract anymore

2074
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,300
This is basically a slave contract

2075
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:07,580
Exactly

2076
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:09,540
Determined by so-and-so

2077
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,740
Such terms have no legal validity

2078
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,540
Really?

2079
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,740
He's legally illiterate

2080
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,060
That's why I'm breaking up with you

2081
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:18,540
Stop pretending

2082
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,780
You actually like him

2083
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,500
Didn't you send back a heart emoji?

2084
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,540
The evidence is right there

2085
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:23,980
What are you trying to hide?

2086
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,180
I like everyone

2087
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,220
Fair enough

2088
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,060
After signing such a contract

2089
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:33,220
Don't you have any resentment?

2090
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,060
Because before I signed this

2091
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,780
I was already with Zidaole

2092
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,340
We were dating

2093
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,620
We were already dating before signing

2094
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:42,900
Right

2095
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,260
So I have no issues with this

2096
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,620
It just means more interaction

2097
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:46,460
with my girlfriend

2098
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,860
Also

2099
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:52,900
This is a supplementary agreement

2100
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,260
Signed later

2101
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,820
If Kedao Le and Zidaole break up

2102
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,420
The company will reclaim

2103
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,420
all income Kedao Le earned during the contract period

2104
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,860
and demand 5 million in compensation

2105
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:04,220
for loss of benefits and reputation

2106
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,100
Speak

2107
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,180
Speak

2108
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,780
This is

2109
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,180
When I tried to break up with her

2110
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,420
she refused to end the relationship

2111
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,740
She stepped out to take a call

2112
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,420
and said "I'll ruin your reputation"

2113
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:22,420
Then told me

2114
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,740
"Go check the contract first"

2115
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,540
The next day when I returned

2116
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,140
I saw this contract

2117
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,580
This was written by TYP

2118
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,300
That...

2119
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,140
Both were written by TYP

2120
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:30,740
Zidaole

2121
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,500
probably called TYP

2122
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,460
saying he wanted to break up with me

2123
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:34,820
He said to sign a supplementary contract

2124
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,500
"Sign it immediately"

2125
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,900
"or you'll regret it"

2126
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,980
"and pay compensation"

2127
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:38,340
Sign this

2128
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:38,900
Right

2129
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,740
She wanted to ruin me

2130
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,340
Then TYP tried to exploit this

2131
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,700
to extort money from me

2132
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,660
That gives you stronger motive for murder

2133
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,140
You wanted to kill two people

2134
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,780
Check QQ

2135
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,580
Click login

2136
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,540
There are chat records

2137
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,700
TYP's chat history with Purple Daole

2138
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,340
It concerns the orchestra's future

2139
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,580
Wait for me at the prop warehouse at 1:10 PM

2140
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:22,820
What time?

2141
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,060
Sent at 11:45 AM on June 3rd.

2142
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,740
Next is a Twitter friends group.

2143
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:29,740
TYP

2144
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:30,540
Please notify.

2145
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:31,220
The principal hopes.

2146
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:32,580
During the school anniversary on June 3rd.

2147
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:33,580
Our company's artists.

2148
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,260
Will film a segment for the campus TV station.

2149
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,860
Promotional material for the school.

2150
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:37,460
Ning Hao.

2151
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:38,100
Canary.

2152
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:38,820
Bai Yangzuo.

2153
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:39,340
You three.

2154
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,860
Will film at the school's front plaza.

2155
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:44,060
Time is from 12:00 to 12:30.

2156
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,620
Next page.

2157
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:46,500
Click to next page.

2158
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,380
It's a video.

2159
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,340
Brothers and sisters,

2160
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,380
For those just tuning in

2161
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,980
to our campus TV station,

2162
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,780
let me reintroduce myself.

2163
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,500
With this lovely voice,

2164
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,540
I'm the explosive Diva Canary.

2165
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,460
Our Tui Zhen Arts Academy

2166
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,340
is where I found my voice.

2167
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,300
You could say it's

2168
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,300
the dream school for countless art students.

2169
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,100
Practice rooms,

2170
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,220
small auditoriums,

2171
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,140
dance studios,

2172
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,060
recording booths -

2173
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,420
we have it all.

2174
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,580
TYP,

2175
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,500
you should sign me.

2176
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,140
Look at me, TYP.

2177
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,860
Let me introduce myself again -

2178
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,220
I'm triple-push actor Ning Hao,

2179
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,180
with Bai Yang's works.

2180
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:22,300
Looking forward to chasing dreams

2181
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,180
in showbiz with you all.

2182
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,220
The three of us filmed

2183
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:26,940
during the time slot

2184
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:29,060
between 12:00 and 12:30.

2185
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,380
You were definitely there,

2186
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,620
we were definitely there.

2187
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,500
It was you three,

2188
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,860
12:00 to 12:30.

2189
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,700
Actually, we could

2190
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,300
provide alibis for each other.

2191
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:37,580
Yes,

2192
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:39,100
we were filming here.

2193
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,420
This should be enough proof

2194
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:44,700
Is TYP still alive right now?

2195
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,340
When was he still alive?

2196
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,420
12:30

2197
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,900
That means he's still alive right now.

2198
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,220
But is that really him?

2199
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,300
Can't see clearly.

2200
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:02,980
Let me take a look.

2201
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,500
Everything's here.

2202
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,300
TYP wants to sign me.

2203
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,940
Can't tell if it's him.

2204
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,300
I think this video

2205
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,660
can't prove it's TYP

2206
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:15,460
is very unclear

2207
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:16,300
just shows a back view

2208
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,580
He deliberately walked away showing only his back

2209
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:21,620
That makes sense

2210
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:28,580
Do you remember when we previously

2211
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,780
watched the surveillance footage from the art corridor?

2212
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:31,420
The front of the art building is Gate 2.

2213
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,980
The front of the art building is Gate 2.

2214
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:33,500
All four of you

2215
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,460
entered through Gate 2.

2216
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,220
So why did TYP

2217
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,580
enter through Gate 4?

2218
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,820
So the one who entered through Gate 4

2219
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,460
was the fake TYP

2220
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,540
The one in the surveillance footage was fake

2221
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:01,620
Possibly

2222
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,900
Then before 12:30

2223
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,020
he died inside

2224
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:20,540
Then who would play him?

2225
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:22,340
If all three of us are filming,

2226
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,380
and he's not the real person.

2227
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:31,780
No

2228
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,140
Let's check TYP

2229
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:35,460
What time does the entry video show?

2230
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,060
Entered through Gate 4

2231
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:37,980
Around 1 PM

2232
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:38,900
1:20 PM

2233
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,620
What I mean is

2234
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,300
The TYP at 12:30 was real

2235
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,780
But the one around 1 PM was fake

2236
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,020
One real, one fake

2237
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:52,220
A junior saw TYP

2238
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,860
TYP signed me

2239
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,300
The 12:30 TYP was genuine

2240
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,220
But whether it was 1:20 or 1:10

2241
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,620
At that time TYP

2242
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,020
During those 30-40 minutes

2243
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,100
TYP was already dead

2244
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:04,420
Right

2245
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:06,860
After TYP entered around 12

2246
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,260
I think they were already gone

2247
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:13,180
So who killed him?

2248
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,740
All three of us were recording videos.

2249
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,060
We could've killed him after finishing recording.

2250
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:18,460
Right.

2251
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,260
In that case,

2252
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,940
actually all four of us are suspects.

2253
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:21,540
Exactly.

2254
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,420
Now all four have equal suspicion.

2255
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,220
That person was pushed down

2256
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,860
So I just buried him right there

2257
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:43,940
What?

2258
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,220
No

2259
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,420
Here

2260
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,220
How?

2261
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:49,660
Are you okay?

2262
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:49,980
What's wrong?

2263
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:50,900
What happened?

2264
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,820
I buried my brother here

2265
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:53,140
Seriously?

2266
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:54,500
Your good brother

2267
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,580
He's right here

2268
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,540
Let's dig Brother Monkey out

2269
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,140
Brother Monkey...

2270
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,580
Come on, hurry up

2271
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:00,260
Be careful

2272
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:01,420
It's quite heavy

2273
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:01,860
Yes

2274
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,300
Let us handle this hard work

2275
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,540
Give it to me

2276
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,500
There's the head

2277
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,740
It's already appearing

2278
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:13,460
Wait

2279
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:15,060
Come on

2280
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:16,500
My brother's mask

2281
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,660
I couldn't remove it back then

2282
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,860
I gave him this outfit

2283
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,740
I remember

2284
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,100
Almost done

2285
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,300
Just uncover the shoulders

2286
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,100
Here

2287
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,300
Three, two, one, pull

2288
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,500
Gently

2289
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:30,780
Done

2290
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,460
Come on, let's search him.

2291
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,860
Check if he has anything in his pockets.

2292
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,420
Voice recorder

2293
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,460
Hold onto it for now

2294
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:52,340
This is a mark of decay

2295
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:53,220
Decay

2296
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,340
The back of the head was likely...

2297
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,500
injured when pushed and knocked down

2298
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:58,420
Gone

2299
01:29:58,420 --> 01:29:59,500
This should be the only one

2300
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,660
Just a voice recorder

2301
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,020
There should only be one voice recorder

2302
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:03,580
Let's go

2303
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,780
It's out of power

2304
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,140
Need to find batteries

2305
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,700
The Push Art convenience store sells batteries

2306
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,700
Let's buy two batteries

2307
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,100
Put them in

2308
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:12,340
This side

2309
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:13,020
Come on

2310
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,220
Hello

2311
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:28,260
Hello, welcome to our convenience store

2312
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,300
Who endorses these?

2313
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:37,380
I think one of their spokespersons is called...

2314
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,260
Dililili

2315
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,140
Dilireba

2316
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,420
Wei isn't here today for her work-study program

2317
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:48,100
I'm Xiao Yu, filling in for her

2318
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,820
What would you like?

2319
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,740
Do you have batteries?

2320
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,220
Yes

2321
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,500
Is this the right model?

2322
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,060
Same one

2323
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:54,380
That's correct

2324
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:55,300
Same type

2325
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,140
Can we take two?

2326
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,140
We don't have money.

2327
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:04,980
Can we owe you?

2328
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,540
You can have these for free.

2329
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,180
Really.

2330
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:08,900
Since such a big incident happened at school,

2331
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:09,940
our little shop wants

2332
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,300
to contribute to solving the case.

2333
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,580
Thank you.

2334
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,140
You're so kind.

2335
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,140
Kind-hearted people.

2336
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,180
Since you're investigating here,

2337
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,460
I won't disturb you then.

2338
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:20,740
Okay, goodbye.

2339
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,220
Goodbye.

2340
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,060
That scared me to death.

2341
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:24,940
That sound is terrifying.

2342
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,140
Why did you close the door?

2343
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,700
I'm afraid the lights might go out later.

2344
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,380
It's fine.

2345
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,740
Coming.

2346
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,380
Everyone,

2347
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:33,540
listen to this.

2348
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,260
First listen to this dying message.

2349
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,700
This recording's time is

2350
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,660
May 3rd, 2004.

2351
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,740
May 3rd.

2352
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,300
TYP, I finally found you.

2353
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,380
Who are you?

2354
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,260
I'm Golden Monkey, Ning Hao's friend.

2355
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:44,820
I know it's you.

2356
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,900
Using Ning Hao's account every day

2357
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,380
to reply to fans on the forum.

2358
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:48,260
Because of you,

2359
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,260
A'Yan died.

2360
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,580
Who's A'Yan?

2361
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:51,380
What's that got to do with me?

2362
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,140
Cousin A'Yan.

2363
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,700
Your mantra of "the harder you work, the more successful you'll be"

2364
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:54,580
was like a trap

2365
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,100
that gradually consumed A'Yan,

2366
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,580
until he died from overwork.

2367
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,500
Hard work doesn't guarantee success.

2368
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,300
Don't you know

2369
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,540
some people give their all

2370
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,220
but still live mediocre lives?

2371
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,420
Those less successful than you

2372
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,420
might just be

2373
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,420
less fortunate than you.

2374
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:08,300
Bullshit luck!

2375
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:09,940
My success

2376
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,620
was achieved through my own efforts.

2377
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:13,260
Others' failures

2378
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:14,620
must be their own fault.

2379
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,700
What was that noise?

2380
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:20,660
Just knocked it over

2381
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:25,900
There's one more

2382
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:27,540
The recording date is

2383
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,420
July 2, 2002

2384
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,740
The QQ email address is

2385
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:35,100
3761068053@qq.com

2386
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:43,940
The password is woshimimaxixixi

2387
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:44,660
I logged in

2388
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,660
Won’t forget

2389
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,260
From now on, I’ll contact you through this

2390
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,020
Don’t worry

2391
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:48,980
Our secret

2392
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,540
No one else will ever know

2393
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,620
Is this his email?

2394
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,740
What was it again?

2395
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,020
The QQ email address is

2396
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:02,820
3761068053@qq.com

2397
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:10,860
The password is woshimimaxixixi

2398
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:14,420
"I’m your mom, heehee"

2399
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,540
Can we listen again?

2400
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:21,780
woshimimaxixixi

2401
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,460
"I’m the password, heehee"

2402
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:24,900
What? "I’m your mom, heehee"?

2403
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,660
No wonder it sounded so weird

2404
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,380
What

2405
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:43,340
Who sent this to the golden monkey?

2406
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,180
What Ruohan?

2407
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,460
Is that you?

2408
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:01,900
Is that you?

2409
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,540
Brother

2410
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,140
Thank you

2411
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,380
Thank you for being willing to

2412
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:13,180
make such a big sacrifice for me

2413
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,060
Making such a big sacrifice for me

2414
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:16,540
What sacrifice?

2415
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,540
I transferred 24,000 to you

2416
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:19,940
It's my sister's living expenses

2417
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:23,140
You're the one who's been sending me money

2418
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,220
You like me too

2419
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,580
Open your eyes wide

2420
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,340
Take a good look from the beginning again

2421
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,460
If you keep chatting with me

2422
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,380
The recipient is Golden Monkey

2423
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:42,700
Brother

2424
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:43,140
Thank you

2425
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,940
Thank you for being willing to

2426
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:46,380
make such a big sacrifice for me

2427
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,420
I transferred 24,000 to you

2428
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:48,700
It's my sister's living expenses

2429
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,060
On the second-to-last day of each month

2430
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,620
just send her 1,000 yuan

2431
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,060
My Brother Monkey

2432
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,020
Every month

2433
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:58,060
he sends me 1,000 yuan

2434
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:01,460
What?

2435
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,340
She's your sister?

2436
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:11,940
I'm your sister?

2437
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:18,300
Really?

2438
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,020
You're the golden snub-nosed monkey?

2439
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:25,140
What's going on?

2440
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,500
Actually...

2441
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,460
I *am* the golden snub-nosed monkey.

2442
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,340
Monkey

2443
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,260
Little sister

2444
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,060
Long time no see

2445
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,540
Brother

2446
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:50,820
You've grown taller

2447
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:52,060
Yes, a little taller

2448
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,260
This tall

2449
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:54,340
Just a bit taller

2450
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:56,820
Sorry, everyone

2451
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,700
I lied to you

2452
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:59,860
Actually, I'm a golden snub-nosed monkey

2453
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,260
Going to take it off

2454
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:02,980
No

2455
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:03,980
I transform

2456
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:09,380
Here's the thing

2457
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,740
Actually, what I just said

2458
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,340
About being forced to drink

2459
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,460
And signing an

2460
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,100
Unfair IOU

2461
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:17,140
Including the actor certification process

2462
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:20,860
Actually, it was Ninghao who was forced to drink

2463
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,060
So I went to the casting director

2464
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,620
To see if I could audition

2465
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,820
But unexpectedly

2466
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,860
He got me drunk that same day

2467
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,660
And made me sign an IOU

2468
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:36,020
You two swapped faces

2469
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,140
Why is my face

2470
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,660
switched with his?

2471
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,780
Because there's a trending makeup technique now

2472
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:45,340
called "extreme transformation"

2473
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:49,340
I get it

2474
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,500
I've tried it

2475
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,220
So if you remove your makeup now

2476
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:57,340
you'll look like this?

2477
01:36:58,460 --> 01:36:58,980
Exactly.

2478
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,060
No way, I don't believe it.

2479
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:03,740
Wet wipes.

2480
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,900
Remove it.

2481
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:07,660
See? Like this.

2482
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:08,220
Right.

2483
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:10,220
This makeup technique

2484
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,980
was also taught to me by Ning Hao.

2485
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,620
How to completely transform yourself.

2486
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,780
So I made my face

2487
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:15,900
look like Ning Hao's face.

2488
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,980
I got hold of his pass

2489
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,220
to steal from the company

2490
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:21,940
But by some twist of fate

2491
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:22,740
I got selected

2492
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:24,340
for the role in "Crazy Stone Thief"

2493
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,180
After coming back

2494
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,660
I told Ning Hao

2495
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,860
I explained what had just happened

2496
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:31,700
But Ning Hao was really kind

2497
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:33,740
He said

2498
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,700
"People like us two

2499
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:36,580
who've been drifting in this place so long

2500
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:37,420
only getting bit parts

2501
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,060
Now you've got this chance

2502
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,260
so take my identity

2503
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,100
and play this lead role

2504
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,900
This could be your breakthrough"

2505
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,700
I was deeply moved

2506
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,140
because I really wanted to succeed

2507
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:49,060
With this opportunity

2508
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:50,020
I had to seize it

2509
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:51,500
So from that day on

2510
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,620
he and I

2511
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,060
essentially swapped identities

2512
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,700
Then

2513
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,420
I gave him my golden monkey bracelet

2514
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:58,100
as a token

2515
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,740
and all my remaining 24,000 yuan

2516
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,220
to him

2517
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:02,060
asking him to send

2518
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:02,820
my little sister

2519
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,660
1,000 yuan each month for living expenses

2520
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:05,740
"I transferred you 24,000

2521
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:07,060
for my sister's living costs

2522
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:08,380
Just send her 1,000 yuan

2523
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:10,220
on the second last day each month"

2524
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:13,940
So it was Ninghao who died

2525
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:15,500
Yes, it was actually Ninghao who died

2526
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,300
Did you know Ninghao was dead all along?

2527
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,580
Of course I knew

2528
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:20,540
One day

2529
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:21,580
he suddenly sent me an email

2530
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,540
asking me

2531
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:23,940
if I was the one posting things on the forum

2532
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:24,580
I said I didn't know

2533
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:26,860
TYP was handling all that stuff for me

2534
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:27,660
Then he said

2535
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:28,140
"I understand now"

2536
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:28,900
"Never mind"

2537
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,660
Actually, Biao Ayan

2538
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:31,580
was one of our brothers

2539
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,780
when we were drifting together

2540
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,620
Because of the things posted

2541
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,660
he died from overwork

2542
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:38,740
So he went to confront TYP about it

2543
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:39,980
Then TYP killed him

2544
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,740
So you want revenge for him even more now

2545
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:43,860
Of course

2546
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:45,620
I won't deny that

2547
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,140
I definitely want to kill him

2548
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,340
I'll just stay here.

2549
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,260
Let's go.

2550
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:10,020
What are you "ah"-ing about?

2551
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:10,780
You stay behind me.

2552
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:11,260
I...

2553
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,140
You ask your brother...

2554
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:12,940
No.

2555
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:14,020
He's even more timid.

2556
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:16,460
Wait a second.

2557
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:17,700
Why are you holding onto me?

2558
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,500
I'll grab someone.

2559
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,460
Bai Yangzuo, slow down.

2560
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:32,580
There's a blood mark

2561
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:38,220
This is so neat and tidy.

2562
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:38,980
What is this?

2563
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:44,420
Such synchronized steps.

2564
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,580
Laundry room.

2565
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:06,340
It's okay

2566
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:09,140
There are lots of clothes here

2567
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,020
Wait a second

2568
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:13,260
What's up?

2569
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,580
I think there's something behind this wall

2570
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,580
I knew it

2571
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,260
Who's this?

2572
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,500
With that height, it must be Old Bai.

2573
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:36,660
Don't scare me

2574
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,300
Eat one

2575
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:37,900
Don't scare me

2576
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,100
Eat

2577
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:40,980
Me

2578
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:41,940
I'll take action

2579
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,420
There's something

2580
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:53,580
Here

2581
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,540
Over there, right?

2582
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:55,140
Here

2583
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,140
Where?

2584
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:56,700
Who are you?

2585
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:58,180
Me—never mind who I am

2586
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:01,620
Who’s this? Still eating?

2587
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,460
Why are you still eating?

2588
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,660
I’m scared

2589
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,300
Where?

2590
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:07,820
Right here

2591
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:09,100
In front of me

2592
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,500
Where in front of you?

2593
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:17,820
Campus Urban Legend

2594
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,540
There's a monster in the laundry room

2595
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,980
Tuiyi Class of 2001

2596
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,940
Class photo

2597
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,580
31 people

2598
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:25,940
Our class only has thirty students

2599
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:26,860
That curse

2600
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:28,020
The photo might include

2601
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:29,180
someone you don't recognize

2602
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:31,180
This is the fourth one

2603
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,620
Hired killer method

2604
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:35,900
Same time, same place

2605
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,220
I want someone dead

2606
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,540
One wants to kill TYP

2607
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:41,380
One wants to kill Zidaole

2608
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:44,500
Definitely a coordinated murder by two people

2609
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,540
Killing the second person was probably

2610
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:49,260
an additional requirement from 555

2611
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,220
Their motives

2612
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:51,700
must be very strong

2613
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:52,820
I think these siblings

2614
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,060
are highly suspicious

2615
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,900
You're obviously targeting me

2616
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,300
controlling me

2617
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:59,220
It's you, isn't it?

2618
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,820
You need evidence first

2619
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:01,740
before making accusations

2620
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:02,620
You're X

2621
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:03,700
Stop talking

2622
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:04,580
There must be an X

2623
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,340
What now?

2624
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:09,700
Xiao Ai jumped to her death
