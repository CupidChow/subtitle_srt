00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,200
June 5, 2004

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,520
The Tuiyi Basketball Friendship Match commenced as scheduled

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,320
Let's welcome our contestant Ba Zimei

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,480
Ba Zimei, who should have been at the award ceremony

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
was reported to be in trouble

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920
Emergency!

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,960
Ba Zimei is in danger

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,760
What?

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
But when everyone went to investigate

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,200
Ba Zimei had vanished from the locked library

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,520
disappeared without a trace

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,080
Investigations by Detective Hetui revealed

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,040
the canary's identity was reversed

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,560
it was actually controlled by Ai Singing

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,640
I, Ai Singing, have returned

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,480
While the mysteriously vanished Ba Zimei

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,960
was the true perpetrator of hidden bullying

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,840
and the originator of the curse

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,120
Hu Jie is your cousin

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,520
We were very close

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,960
I came in last place

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,240
while Ba Zimei took the top position

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Ba Zimei was also the one who cursed us

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,280
Other suspects needed to break the curse

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,360
What's the way to lift the curse?

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,320
The cursebreaker must kill the caster

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,160
So I must kill Ba Zimei

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,040
But the exhibition hall's layout is complex

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
Only these people could do it within six moves:

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,960
B, C, D

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,000
There couldn't be a round-trip path

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,640
The number of moves is insufficient

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,120
The killer's method remains unsolved

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,560
The group decides to search upstairs for more clues

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,240
There's one more person in the elevator besides us.

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,560
Yet the eerie tale comes true again in the elevator.

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,920
No matter which button we press, it will take us.

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,400
It's moving.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Where will everyone be taken?

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,520
And what will they encounter?

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,880
It keeps going down.

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
No, it keeps going up and down.

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,440
Where are we now?

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,120
Warning.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,360
Elevator malfunction.

46
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,920
Elevator malfunction.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
The elevator has stopped at a non-existent floor.

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
Please wait for rescue.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,400
We're done for.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,440
Wait a minute.

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,120
We can't move now.

52
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,440
Okay.

53
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,240
What does it say?

54
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,560
Elevator malfunction.

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,120
Wait for rescue.

56
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,920
We've now arrived at a non-existent floor.

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,320
Okay.

58
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,960
That means...

59
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,200
Let's think about earlier.

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,440
Why was it that when we entered...

61
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,400
At the very first moment...

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
This elevator wasn't working properly.

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,440
No, wasn't it written up there...

64
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,880
Can we not see him anymore?

65
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,840
Xiao Dong said no one can see me now.

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
And then said...

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,760
Ba Zimei is now the same as him.

68
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
So it's possible that Ba Zimei...

69
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,560
has been with us all along.

70
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Ba Zimei, are you there?

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Ba Zimei!

72
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,160
But just now...

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,720
She was here helping us open the elevator door.

74
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,840
But now she's definitely not here.

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,720
Because there's five of us again.

76
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,600
So it can operate again.

77
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,400
She must have heard this...

78
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,320
and then went down.

79
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,000
Warning.

80
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
Six people detected in the elevator.

81
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Come out first.

82
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,760
She must have heard this

83
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Then she went down

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
No

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,040
Come on

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Are you going or not?

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,360
If you're not going, I'll go

88
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,960
Come on

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,280
Are you going or not?

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,160
If you're not going, I'll go

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
I can't

92
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,160
I'll go behind

93
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Okay, I'll go behind

94
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
It's okay, Sis Li, it's okay

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
It's okay

96
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,000
Are there stairs?

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,280
Be careful

98
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,840
There are stairs, be careful

99
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,280
How many?

100
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,960
There are two

101
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,920
Two

102
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,040
Be careful

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,280
Who's this?

104
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,040
Me

105
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,240
Is this the stairs?

106
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,800
It's stairs

107
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,160
It's a small two-level staircase

108
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,520
Hold my hand

109
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,600
Hold my hand

110
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:25,960
Got it

111
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,800
Slow down

112
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Don't make me fall

113
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Could this make me fall?

114
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
We've reached one side

115
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
Turn right

116
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
The elevator doors closed

117
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,120
Turn right

118
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,680
It's fine

119
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,600
Turn right

120
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,920
The elevator doors closed

121
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,480
Turn right

122
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,280
No problem, let's go

123
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,960
Follow me

124
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Keep up behind me

125
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,840
Where is it?

126
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,800
Turn right

127
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:47,960
Here

128
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,280
Okay

129
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,160
There's a pillar

130
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,720
There's a pillar in the middle

131
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,160
Here's another elevator

132
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,840
We just went in a circle

133
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,400
We've come full circle

134
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,280
No

135
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,800
We're just going in circles now

136
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,240
What kind of path are you leading us on, Bai Yangzuo?

137
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,080
Where is the sound coming from?

138
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
We need to find them.

139
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
Is anyone there?

140
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,560
Who?

141
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,600
Brother

142
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,640
Brother

143
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
Here

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
In front of me

145
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,480
Here

146
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,360
This is me

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
No, her voice is coming from here

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,440
Brother

149
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm the canary

150
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,480
Then who are you?

151
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm Ai Singing.

152
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,480
Which of my brothers is outside?

153
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,120
We're all here.

154
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,240
Great!

155
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,520
You've finally come to save me!

156
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,600
How are we saving you?

157
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,720
Yes, how do we save you?

158
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,960
I've been trapped here since last night around 9 pm.

159
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,640
Locked inside this...

160
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,120
white fabric space.

161
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
How come we can hear...

162
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,280
a girl's voice outside?

163
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm Ai...

164
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,760
Wait, I'm scared.

165
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,840
Don't scare yourself.

166
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,760
Don't pull me.

167
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,080
I'm Ai Singing.

168
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,000
Give me back my body!

169
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Give it back!

170
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Quick, give me back my body!

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
Return it!

172
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,280
I knew it.

173
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
Give it back!

174
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,400
Fine, here you go.

175
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,160
Take it.

176
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,080
Push her over.

177
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,640
Give it to her.

178
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,560
Go.

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
Give it back to my sister, go!

180
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,920
But I can't return it.

181
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,400
Why?

182
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
I was wrong, I regret it.

183
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,600
How do I return it?

184
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,480
She's not coming out, is she?

185
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't scare me.

186
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
Is anyone there?

187
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,880
Who are you?

188
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,400
Who?

189
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,520
I'm Xiaowei.

190
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,200
Xiaowei?

191
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,400
Xiaowei...

192
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,040
Yes.

193
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
I've been trapped here for two years.

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,840
Who trapped you here?

195
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,040
I don't know.

196
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,280
I just suddenly ended up...

197
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,040
behind this white fabric space.

198
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,720
Have you seen my good friends?

199
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,440
Who?

200
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
Xiaoxi and Xiaonan.

201
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,680
No.

202
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,840
Haven't seen them.

203
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,840
They wouldn't be...

204
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,280
Those two often appear...

205
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,360
near the laundry room.

206
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,720
We've seen dinosaur monsters

207
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
The three of us

208
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
created the Tweeter Empire together

209
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,800
What about Xiao Dong?

210
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,200
Who is Xiao Dong?

211
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,600
He was your good friend

212
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,200
The four of you created it together

213
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,960
this Tweeter Empire

214
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,320
Impossible, there were only three

215
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Xiao Dong said

216
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,960
No one can see him anymore

217
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,920
First invisible, then forgotten

218
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,320
When we created the Twitter Empire

219
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,600
There was indeed someone in the group chat

220
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,320
Someone I seem to have forgotten

221
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
There's a computer on the first floor of the library

222
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
Why don't you log in

223
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,200
to my QQ account and check

224
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,600
What's your QQ number?

225
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,360
My QQ number is

226
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,360
38520

227
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
26260

228
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,600
260

229
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,840
My QQ password is

230
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
The password is

231
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
XV

232
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,080
XV

233
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,480
123456

234
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,960
123456

235
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Quick, log in and check

236
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,480
You must save us

237
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,320
How do we go back?

238
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm looking for a pen, not your hand

239
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,720
Brothers, save me

240
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
We won't

241
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Is she a canary?

242
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,720
You must find a way to save me

243
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,600
How can we save you?

244
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
But you bullied me before

245
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,360
You deserve to be trapped here

246
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,880
Don't

247
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't

248
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,360
I'm sorry

249
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,040
Let's go

250
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
Brothers, you must remember

251
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,080
to come back and save me

252
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,960
We definitely will

253
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,880
come back

254
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,000
My false eyelashes fell off

255
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,080
All of them

256
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,080
My wig almost fell off too

257
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,880
Wait, there's a possibility

258
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
Xiao Ba isn't dead now

259
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,640
but actually following behind you

260
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,760
Ning Hao, you think you're brave?

261
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm not

262
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
She said there's a laptop here

263
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,160
Here

264
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,960
Isn't it right in front of you?

265
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,520
Quick

266
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,040
This one?

267
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,640
Type it in

268
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,040
Yes, log in from here, come on

269
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,880
And brought a notebook

270
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,720
38, correct

271
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,640
xv123456

272
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
Okay, here we go

273
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,920
This is Xiao Wei's group chat

274
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,880
There are four people total

275
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,720
Xiao Dong, Xiao Xi, Xiao Nan, Xiao Wei

276
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Today I was playing games in the study room

277
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
Xiao Rou suddenly came over and told me

278
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,880
to be quiet

279
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,480
Tomorrow I'll post rumors about her

280
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,840
saying she's a habitual thief

281
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,080
She'll never get into the study room again

282
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,880
So actually Xiao Nan

283
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,360
bullied Xiao Rou, right?

284
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,680
Exactly

285
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,240
Yes, and then Xiao Xi

286
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,080
Xiao Rou looks like a dinosaur

287
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,000
Why don't we

288
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
all call her Dinosaur Sister from now on

289
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
They all started bullying Xiao Rou

290
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,920
Right

291
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,200
What about Xiao Wei?

292
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,520
Xiao Wei joined in

293
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,640
Dear brothers

294
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,080
Dear brothers

295
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
Dear brothers

296
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,280
Don't bully Xiao Rou too harshly

297
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,440
She treats me like a real sister now

298
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,720
I don't want to bother finding a new sister

299
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,800
to order around

300
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
She's just like you

301
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,400
Xiao Dong said,

302
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Interesting.

303
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,120
For this year's Push Art Star,

304
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,880
the last place

305
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,920
should go to Xiao Rou.

306
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800
They all ignored her,

307
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
including Bai Yangzuo, whom she had a crush on.

308
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,800
When Bai Yangzuo takes first place

309
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,640
and she gets last place,

310
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,920
it would be so dramatic.

311
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,440
I like it.

312
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,920
So when I got first place back then,

313
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,640
it was all arranged by them.

314
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,280
You thought it was your ability,

315
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,240
I thought I had real talent,

316
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,080
but actually, these four were all bullying Xiao Rou.

317
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
But their bullying method

318
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,520
was the same as that canary's.

319
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,080
That's why the canary was possessed.

320
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,560
And that one,

321
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,800
Xiao Wei was also possessed.

322
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,800
It's subtle bullying—

323
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,160
not hitting or scolding her,

324
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,640
but it's the same.

325
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,720
Subtle and direct are the same.

326
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,120
Xiao Nan said,

327
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,360
"I heard she went missing by the Wukenai River."

328
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
"Did she jump in out of despair?"

329
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,520
"Whatever,"

330
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
"since at school,"

331
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
"she was treated like a ghost anyway."

332
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,800
"No one cared about her."

333
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,520
"Back to the point—"

334
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,920
"I've named our online forum"

335
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,600
"something:"

336
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,240
"Push Empire."

337
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,600
"From now on, our meeting place"

338
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,680
"will be the hidden room in the laundry."

339
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,080
"Fine."

340
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,760
"Then we won’t have to hide our secrets"

341
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,920
"in the library anymore,"

342
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,680
"in that little hidden compartment by the bookshelf."

343
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,160
Let's start searching.

344
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,720
The bookshelf against the wall?

345
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,480
A hidden compartment.

346
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
We probably need to take out all the books.

347
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,640
There's a compartment inside.

348
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,120
Are we really going to dismantle

349
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,080
the library?

350
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
None confirmed

351
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
Then next one, come on

352
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
Wall-mounted bookshelves, these

353
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,480
Is this against the wall?

354
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,920
This is against the wall

355
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,760
Which wall is this against?

356
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,040
Why aren't you playing our song?

357
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,080
Is it because it sounds too bad?

358
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,480
Tick-tock

359
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,080
We've seen

360
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,480
This we

361
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,040
saw in the previous era

362
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,760
Perhaps there are some new discoveries

363
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,600
Genealogy

364
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,720
Which section have we reached?

365
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,880
Look who you are

366
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,520
You're He Dinghong

367
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,280
You were born in 1984

368
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,560
This year is 2003

369
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,760
Aren't you this old?

370
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Next, you'll be Jiawei

371
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,440
Guo Baoyou and Ba Zimei are

372
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,080
Let me see where Guo Baoyou is from

373
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,320
Ba Zimei is

374
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,560
Guo Ba and Baoyou's

375
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,240
daughter

376
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,840
She and Guo Baoyou are siblings

377
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,760
The small hidden compartment in the wall-mounted bookshelf

378
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,120
Since there's a ladder here,

379
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
doesn't that mean

380
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,920
We'll need to use this ladder.

381
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,400
Though you're lazy, you like to think.

382
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,440
Just had this one thought

383
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,080
Using your brain once requires sitting for ten minutes

384
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,400
Just throw everything on the ground, no need to worry

385
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
Take a good look behind me

386
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,000
Almost got hit

387
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
You're too violent

388
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,520
Then you fix it back

389
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm not that kind of person

390
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,840
No

391
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,800
Nothing at all

392
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,520
Really? Nothing?

393
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,960
No

394
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,520
It should be right here

395
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,360
I just did a quick calculation

396
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,720
Anything?

397
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,080
No

398
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Nothing on my side either

399
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,760
There must be a hidden compartment in this wall

400
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Hidden compartment

401
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,560
Have you heard the saying "unexpected disaster strikes"?

402
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,400
Didn't you already search it?

403
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,840
No, bro.

404
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,240
No hidden compartments.

405
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,800
Why are you

406
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,200
What's going on with you

407
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,640
There must be a hidden compartment in this wall

408
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,920
I didn't expect that despite being lazy

409
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,560
your work is quite meticulous

410
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,640
What is this thing

411
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,560
The Secret of Wukenai River

412
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,760
Wukenai River is the oldest river

413
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,520
in Tuizhen Town

414
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,440
This is also a

415
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,120
mysterious area with extremely unique magnetic fields

416
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,240
Those with strong determination can open

417
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,200
the parallel world "Zhen Tui" from here

418
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
Legend says that when a desperate person

419
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
places a message in a bottle with their dying wish

420
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,360
into the River of No Return

421
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,800
that final wish

422
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,040
will be granted after the desperate one

423
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,640
passes away

424
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Read it out

425
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,800
That's a wish, isn't it

426
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,800
Everything we've endured

427
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,760
is covert bullying

428
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,880
We once turned to

429
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,640
our loved ones for help

430
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,920
Longing for family and friends

431
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,480
to understand our pain

432
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,800
Yet those around us

433
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,840
without exception believed

434
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,240
we were oversensitive and dramatic

435
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,880
After all, with no visible scars

436
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,120
it couldn't be that serious

437
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,240
But this covert bullying

438
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,440
can also inflict

439
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,360
severe harm on victims

440
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,280
even utterly shattering their souls

441
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,560
May our final wish become a curse

442
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,960
so bullies too can taste

443
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,400
the bitter fruit of covert bullying

444
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,760
the bitter fruit of covert bullying

445
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
We hope

446
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,560
that whenever someone dies from covert bullying

447
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,320
bullies will face punishment at school

448
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,640
Those who isolate others

449
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,120
Become truly invisible

450
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
Those who spread malicious rumors

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,800
The harm you cause returns to you

452
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,640
Yours

453
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,560
That's right

454
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,240
It's mine

455
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,120
These are all his accounts

456
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
You fabricated

457
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,640
Malicious rumors

458
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,720
I started bleeding all over

459
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,600
Like being cut by knives

460
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,960
Those who mock others with nicknames

461
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,000
Become the monster in their nickname

462
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,680
I think this is a

463
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,560
Chance to get back at him

464
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,680
So I told Sisi

465
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,400
I said change the name

466
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,440
of the main character

467
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
to "Pig Head"

468
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,360
Okay?

469
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,720
Because it sounds like "pig head"

470
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,160
My voice became pig noises

471
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,680
Then I looked by the river

472
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,360
At my reflection

473
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,600
And saw I'd become

474
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,040
A person with a pig's head

475
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,360
Those who manipulate others

476
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,800
Become the puppets they controlled

477
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,280
Sister Singer, my hair's messy

478
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,920
When will you be back?

479
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,680
To braid my hair

480
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,520
Sister Singer can you

481
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,360
Buy me some snacks?

482
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,160
I'm feeling peckish

483
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,920
Sister Singer, I got pimples

484
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,080
Remember to buy me medicine

485
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,760
When I woke up again

486
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,200
I was at the store

487
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,800
I teleported

488
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,840
The bullying continues

489
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,800
The curse remains

490
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,200
Big mole

491
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,200
Big waves

492
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,080
Big glasses

493
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,600
Big bald head

494
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,520
Big scar

495
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,720
Big red dress

496
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,400
Actually, those few people

497
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,960
Xiaodong, Xiaonan, and Xiaoxi

498
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,480
have proven it true

499
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
Right, they've proven it true

500
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,720
How can we save them?

501
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
Why bother saving them?

502
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
If we don't save these people

503
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,840
aren't we bullying them too?

504
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,520
Standing by and doing nothing

505
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,000
is also a form of hidden bullying

506
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
Yes, we need to end all this

507
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,920
Standing by is also a kind of...

508
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,440
We should...

509
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,080
They are...

510
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,920
Can't you be more generous?

511
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,560
No

512
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,520
Pointless generosity

513
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:52,880
No

514
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,800
Pointless generosity

515
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
No

516
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,920
If I had a knife right now

517
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,400
I would kill each one of you

518
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,280
one by one

519
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,080
Let's search around.

520
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,720
There's another bookshelf.

521
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,480
Keep looking.

522
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,160
There's something here.

523
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,320
As punishment for you all,

524
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,480
you must thoroughly

525
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,680
search every shelf.

526
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,320
Go away, vanish already!

527
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,480
Just like that hidden compartment earlier,

528
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
right in front of us yet missed repeatedly,

529
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,040
we still couldn't find it.

530
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,280
Let's search through those things up there again.

531
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Come on, let's not miss anything today.

532
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,960
Any valuable clues.

533
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
This is also a wall-mounted bookshelf.

534
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,560
Should we check this art entrance area?

535
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,880
I already went through these two—

536
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,400
—searched them already.

537
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,920
You searched all of them?

538
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Just skimmed through.

539
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,560
Don’t just skim.

540
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,800
Dig deep.

541
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,840
If you just skim, people will complain again.

542
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
Those who just sit around and don’t work—

543
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,160
You already searched it, so do it properly.

544
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,920
"Just skimmed"—really?

545
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,680
You didn’t even search properly, yet you criticize me?

546
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,400
I’ll *thoroughly* search you next!

547
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,040
What's there to translate?

548
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,240
What's there to translate?

549
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
You tell me what's there to translate.

550
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,680
You tell me what's worth translating.

551
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
What do you think needs translating?

552
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,800
Where?

553
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,880
Bai Yangzuo

554
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,160
You're way too accurate.

555
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,240
You're aging like fine wine.

556
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,480
I'm really speechless about some people.

557
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,160
What does this prove?

558
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,640
It means we'll still have to rely on him to find it.

559
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,360
Exactly.

560
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,600
From now on we'll just sit there and wait it out.

561
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
Password.

562
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,960
Password.

563
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,800
Come on.

564
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,160
What is it?

565
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,040
Password.

566
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,160
Three-digit password.

567
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,000
Whose notebook is this?

568
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,480
Could be any of them.

569
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,200
Xiao Dong, Xiao Xi, Xiao Wei, Xiao Rou.

570
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,280
It's Xiao Dong's

571
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,120
Xiao Dong's birthday or Xiao Xi's birthday

572
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,600
Or Xiao Rou's password

573
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,120
Try 520

574
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,560
Why 520?

575
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,480
Because 38520 26260

576
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,400
Doesn't work

577
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,840
Then whose notebook could this be?

578
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
This computer is Xiao Rou's, right?

579
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
Xiao Wei's

580
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,080
Are there any numbers in the chat history?

581
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,160
Let me check the date

582
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay

583
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
Then the password

584
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,840
xv123456

585
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,720
When was it created?

586
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,120
930

587
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
What about 930?

588
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,560
Really?

589
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,680
No

590
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,880
Any other numbers besides dates?

591
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,520
No other numbers

592
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Ba Zimei, right?

593
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,120
There's the number 8

594
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,160
East, South, West

595
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,680
Rou and V

596
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,280
Is V a number?

597
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,720
What can Xiao Dong convert to?

598
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
What number is D?

599
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,240
Isn't D zero?

600
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,120
D could be 6 or 9, right?

601
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,280
ABCD 4

602
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,280
You're smart

603
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,280
O is almost in the teens

604
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,560
In the teens

605
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,920
ABCDEFGHIJK

606
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,600
Not working

607
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,840
Then try Xiao Dong

608
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,880
What's X?

609
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Xiao Dong X

610
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,880
X

611
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,560
What number is X?

612
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,960
ABCDEFGHI

613
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,560
Count backwards from 26

614
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,120
26 25 24

615
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,840
24

616
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,560
244

617
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,560
244, right?

618
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,600
It's open

619
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,160
Wow, amazing

620
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,480
Come

621
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,880
You thought of 244 first

622
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,360
Great job

623
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,560
June 3, 2004

624
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,000
After turning into monsters, we always hid in

625
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,920
the abandoned space of the night study room

626
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,360
because ordinary people wouldn't dare go there

627
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,800
But since I'm invisible

628
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,400
I often wandered outside

629
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,200
When no one was around

630
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,880
I would play piano in the music room

631
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,800
playing my favorite "Fatal Melody"

632
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,200
Unexpectedly while playing today

633
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,800
I was interrupted by students investigating a case

634
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
On June 3rd

635
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,840
at night I also found

636
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,160
a very ancient message in a bottle

637
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,040
It contained the truth about the curse

638
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,680
Turns out we monsters

639
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,960
from the campus horror stories

640
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,400
were all transformed because

641
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,680
of bullied victims committing suicide

642
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
The message repeatedly stated

643
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,480
"The curse won't break until bullying stops"

644
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,760
So I decided

645
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
to kill the bullies at school

646
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,560
Only their deaths could stop the bullying

647
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,720
and lift my curse

648
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,360
I quickly targeted Sisi

649
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,480
because her bullying behavior

650
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,800
directly related to my curse

651
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,760
I planned to use the most

652
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,040
simple and brutal method

653
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,960
stab her to death

654
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,960
But when I tried to stab her

655
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,400
while she was unaware

656
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
I found the knife couldn't pierce her

657
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,240
I realized

658
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,480
the curse not only made me invisible

659
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,160
but also prevented me from harming others directly

660
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,080
Who does he want to stab?

661
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,720
Sisi

662
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,800
Wants Sisi dead

663
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
I had to manipulate others to kill

664
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
I tried to make Ninghao,

665
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,920
Canary and Kedao Le want her dead

666
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,080
But only Canary verbally abused her

667
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,760
So I chose Canary

668
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
as my weapon

669
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,720
June 4th

670
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,520
which was yesterday

671
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,880
I painstakingly used

672
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,320
"sorry" to open Ruisibai's locked case

673
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,040
This was yesterday's locked case

674
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,960
The case from Ruisibai's secret space

675
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,520
How did it end up with you?

676
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,640
This case is just like that other one

677
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
After I returned to my room

678
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,040
both cases were placed there simultaneously

679
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,720
Someone wanted me to know about this

680
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,680
I never expected Ba Zimei to be

681
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,640
the mastermind behind her bullying

682
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,840
I had to change my target again to

683
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,680
Ba Zimei

684
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,040
After midnight tonight

685
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,440
the Tuiyi Mysterious Art Exhibition might help me

686
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,640
As someone who attended last year's exhibition

687
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,040
I know the exhibition hall's layout

688
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,240
I can create an "impossible murder"

689
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,840
But I'll also need someone to help me

690
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,160
Has the truth already been revealed?

691
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,680
Let me see

692
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,400
What's the last sentence on the final page?

693
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,360
Wait, there's that

694
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
There's that shadow

695
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
Who has a pencil?

696
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,920
I suggest you don't mark it

697
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,400
Mark

698
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
Because it points to someone

699
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,920
I can already sense it

700
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,360
I suggest you don't mark it

701
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Go ahead and mark it, you do it

702
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,840
So this little Dong wants to kill

703
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,360
Wants to kill Ruisi Bai, right?

704
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,680
He wants to break this great curse

705
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,160
But as he discovers more

706
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,800
He decides to kill Ba Zimei

707
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,040
Alright

708
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,720
I know you want to kill Ba Zimei

709
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,360
You can take advantage of tonight's

710
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,800
Tuiyi Grand Exhibition

711
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,360
I've experienced this exhibition before

712
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,000
I know there are secret

713
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,120
What's

714
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,400
secret passages

715
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,760
Not secret passages

716
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,920
Deliberately misspoke

717
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,320
What's private

718
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,600
Portrait

719
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,840
Fingerprint

720
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
Switch

721
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,040
No

722
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,800
Is it possible he didn't want us to see this?

723
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,560
You could use

724
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
mechanisms

725
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,200
mechanisms to kill

726
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,040
This note represents

727
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,400
Xiaodong had already found the killer

728
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,160
He was telling him how to kill

729
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,400
But unfortunately traces

730
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,040
were left in this notebook

731
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,640
The original paper was torn away

732
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,920
But these marks remain here

733
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,200
Let's outline them

734
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,800
to identify you

735
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,920
So Xiaodong was the accomplice

736
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,760
Right

737
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,640
Using mechanisms to kill

738
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Take us into that room

739
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,520
We're returning to the scene

740
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:40,840
Come on

741
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,000
This doll

742
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,160
I think the mechanism needs to be symmetrical

743
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,600
It can't be at AB

744
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,120
The doll

745
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,880
AB wouldn't work

746
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,320
We should definitely look inside

747
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,440
The sculpture - it's movable

748
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
What about here?

749
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,600
No

750
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
The candle didn't move either

751
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,640
Here

752
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,960
Then what we need

753
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,440
to find is

754
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
It can't be the candle, right?

755
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,320
The doll's orientation

756
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,800
Probably each person

757
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,280
needs to be in a room

758
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,400
to control it

759
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,920
Come here, come up

760
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,640
Don't stay there

761
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,560
Turn it

762
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,800
This doll can rotate

763
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,200
Yes

764
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
What happens when we turn it?

765
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,840
This can be rotated

766
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,080
Look, I'm going up

767
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,600
From this room

768
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,440
to another room

769
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,720
directly entering

770
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,520
What's next to it?

771
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
You're too heavy

772
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,760
Just twist it once to turn

773
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,720
Why does stepping on the circle

774
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,760
trigger an alarm?

775
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,080
You need staff to activate it first

776
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,360
before it can rotate in working mode

777
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,080
But we didn't activate it earlier

778
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
When it was rotating just now

779
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
But if you step on it

780
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,720
there will be an alarm

781
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
You can't step on it

782
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,440
You mustn't

783
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,360
When this thing is rotating

784
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,280
no one can stand on it

785
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,360
What if we turn it again?

786
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,520
Is it fixed in place?

787
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,840
Turn it the opposite way to reset

788
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,800
This Room D

789
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,720
Not important, wait a moment

790
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,440
Turn counterclockwise once more

791
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,360
It doesn't matter

792
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:18,800
It only goes back and forth

793
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,240
It only moves like this in both directions

794
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm at F now

795
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,800
I know

796
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,560
Each time it only

797
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,360
goes left and right

798
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,920
I want to ask about the dolls in each room

799
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,840
Can they all do this?

800
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,200
Either way is fine.

801
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,760
I understand now.

802
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,040
He had Xiao Dong step on it.

803
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,800
But Xiao Dong isn't human.

804
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,120
Xiao Dong could help him.

805
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,280
Right.

806
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,680
No, if Xiao Dong could help,

807
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,360
then why would he need

808
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,200
then why would he need

809
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,320
this thing?

810
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,200
Someone helped him rotate it.

811
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,040
He was already standing on it waiting.

812
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,600
No, I don't think it was Xiao Dong.

813
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,840
The main function of this rotating door

814
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,680
is that when you turn it to this wall,

815
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,120
it connects these two rooms.

816
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Turn it to this wall and

817
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,800
it connects these two rooms.

818
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,680
That's the purpose of this rotation.

819
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,520
Not for someone to stand on it

820
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,680
and be rotated over.

821
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,840
If no one stands on it,

822
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,880
how would they switch rooms?

823
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,520
Look at this door -

824
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,200
that button (on the doll)

825
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,760
when pressed,

826
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,080
lets you skip

827
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,240
Right.

828
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,600
skip going through one door.

829
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,400
It connects to what was

830
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,280
originally disconnected.

831
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,240
He needed to switch doors,

832
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,880
not have someone stand on it.

833
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,200
Exactly.

834
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,920
Detective, you're so clever.

835
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,800
You're supposed to help the murderer,

836
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,320
how could you figure this out?

837
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,560
What does "changing doors" mean?

838
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:34,760
This...

839
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,400
It's about changing doors, not standing people.

840
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,640
I know about changing doors, then what?

841
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,240
What is he trying to do?

842
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
Then he can open and close it six times.

843
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,600
I haven't figured out this approach yet.

844
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,160
How exactly do they change it later?

845
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm only talking about this mechanism.

846
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,160
It's this action.

847
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,120
Okay.

848
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,200
Previously, there wasn't only...

849
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,880
There was no rotation like this.

850
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,720
In that case...

851
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,920
Only C could accomplish it.

852
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,240
It wasn't possible before either.

853
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,280
It wouldn't work anywhere.

854
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,680
Because he must go to F first.

855
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,560
And then...

856
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,480
What about now?

857
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:55,560
What about now?

858
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,880
Now it changes a door.

859
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
For example...

860
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,520
How does he go to F first?

861
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,840
Press that fingerprint scanner.

862
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,520
Even if he changes doors, he can't...

863
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,600
reach that fingerprint scanner, right?

864
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,200
He can go press that fingerprint scanner.

865
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Our vacuum time...

866
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,440
is lights-out time, correct?

867
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,120
Just tell me how to get to F.

868
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,720
No.

869
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,400
I can just push the door and come through.

870
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,640
I push the door and enter.

871
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,680
I push the door and enter.

872
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,040
I push the door again and reach F.

873
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,280
What's so difficult about that?

874
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,120
How do you return?

875
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,960
How do I return?

876
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,840
Isn't there a fingerprint scanner on F's wall?

877
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,160
Then won't your attempts run out?

878
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,040
When you exit F...

879
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,280
No, it's like this.

880
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,280
That thing needs to activate first.

881
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,600
Then it starts counting your attempts.

882
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,800
You can walk like this however you want.

883
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,680
On this rotating wheel,

884
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,440
there's only one D door, right?

885
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,800
Yes, only one door.

886
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,560
Give it a spin.

887
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,280
Let's spin it.

888
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,560
Right, we each need to

889
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,440
go to our own rooms.

890
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,600
Yes, you all go.

891
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,800
First, let's deduce if C is the killer.

892
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,720
How did he first go to F to open that?

893
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,000
Here's how:

894
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
We'll return to our rooms,

895
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,520
then I'll spin the door again.

896
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,800
You try first, yes.

897
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,280
Let's push that door open and see.

898
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,880
where everyone is positioned, okay?

899
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,440
Let's have everyone try it once.

900
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,080
If F is the killer,

901
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,680
what advantage does changing doors give you?

902
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,760
The door's spinning now.

903
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm E.

904
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,760
Call out when you're in position.

905
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm a bit scared.

906
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,760
Here's what I'll do:

907
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,560
What am I?

908
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,200
You're D.

909
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,000
Good, we can't see anything.

910
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
Now we can't see anything at all.

911
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
Okay, I pressed the fingerprint scanner.

912
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
Spin the doll.

913
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,320
Alright.

914
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,680
That's F right there.

915
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,400
F can go directly to C.

916
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,920
Right.

917
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,680
It has that fingerprint scanner.

918
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,880
Allows direct passage.

919
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,720
It's a two-way door now.

920
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,080
We have six attempts.

921
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay, rotation complete.

922
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Yes, six attempts.

923
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,800
Right, he can come through.

924
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,040
Where can we go now?

925
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,160
I'll go straight to C.

926
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,680
I'm going directly to C.

927
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,840
Then you go from C to B.

928
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,240
Then I'll go from C to B.

929
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
Then to A to make the kill.

930
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,080
And we're done.

931
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,640
The timing will work.

932
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,560
The number of attempts fits too.

933
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,360
So that counts as his first opening, right?

934
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:01,880
Two openings.

935
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,400
Two, you calculated it right.

936
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,720
Correct.

937
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,560
Then three.

938
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,720
Kill.

939
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,880
Kill complete.

940
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,440
Then four.

941
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,440
Five.

942
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,240
Five.

943
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,880
Six.

944
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,960
Wait, we're missing one.

945
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,680
For when we exit finally.

946
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,880
Ba didn't open the door for him.

947
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,280
What?

948
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
She's already dead, she can't press (the door button).

949
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,240
I understand what you mean.

950
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,680
Let Xiao Dong press (the door button)

951
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,480
If Xiao Dong can press

952
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,080
that button (door button)

953
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,720
Why can't Xiao Dong

954
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,920
unlock that fingerprint scanner

955
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,880
He can't come in

956
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,200
He just said he can't walk through walls

957
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,960
He can't follow you

958
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,760
inside together?

959
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,400
No

960
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,280
Why not?

961
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,520
He's just hiding on F's side

962
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,560
Press that fingerprint scanner

963
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,240
If Xiao Dong is on F's side

964
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,600
He's been invisible to people

965
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
He just needs to unlock this (fingerprint scanner)

966
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Then people in this room

967
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,320
He just needs to turn this (doll) thing

968
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,560
can get out

969
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,000
Doesn't need six times at all

970
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,480
Then what's the point of the revolving door?

971
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,120
In that case, Xiao Dong can just stay in

972
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,680
Ba Zimei's Room A

973
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,600
and directly give it to Ba Zimei

974
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,720
Wouldn't it be better to just kill her?

975
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,440
He can't stab anyone

976
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,880
As mentioned in the evidence earlier

977
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,600
What do you mean?

978
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,680
Xiao Dong attempted to kill someone

979
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,400
He tried to kill

980
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,240
Rui Sisi or Ba Zimei

981
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,000
But he discovered

982
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,680
his knife couldn't harm her

983
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,160
So he needs someone else to do the killing

984
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,080
Then if he presses the button (door button)

985
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,960
can he just press it?

986
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,200
Yes, he can

987
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,040
The piano room

988
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,240
suddenly emitted a very eerie

989
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,800
and terrifying piano sound

990
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,040
"The Deadly Melody," huh?

991
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,560
Then it's the same.

992
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,000
The only thing he can't do is kill.

993
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,920
As for other physical tasks,

994
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,720
he can do everything else.

995
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,240
Right.

996
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,680
That's what it means.

997
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,560
Actually, it's very simple logic.

998
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
That is,

999
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,640
he can press the button (fingerprint scanner).

1000
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,440
Right?

1001
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,120
But here's our situation.

1002
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,000
He can't possibly,

1003
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,640
it's impossible for him to,

1004
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,240
He can only,

1005
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,320
wait until we've all entered,

1006
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,160
then come out from that,

1007
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,120
prize collection point, right?

1008
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Right?

1009
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,120
Then he's responsible for,

1010
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,880
pressing the button (door button).

1011
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,760
Actually, he didn't enter.

1012
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
He used the fingerprint scanner,

1013
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,200
but didn't enter.

1014
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,520
So we have to wait until Ba Zimei arrives.

1015
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:57,960
When this arrives,

1016
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,080
one, two, three, four, five, six.

1017
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,520
So the killer is still,

1018
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,040
the one making this trip alone.

1019
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,200
Someone did press the fingerprint scanner.

1020
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,600
Yes.

1021
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Someone did press the fingerprint scanner.

1022
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,520
So it can only rotate one position, right?

1023
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,040
It can only rotate from F to me.

1024
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,520
Correct.

1025
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,400
It can only connect F and C.

1026
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
That's the only way to reset it.

1027
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,960
It can only move position by position.

1028
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,600
Right.

1029
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,640
Exactly.

1030
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,600
What does that mean?

1031
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,400
Then people at E and D aren't suspects.

1032
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,200
That doesn't make sense.

1033
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,040
If it were them...

1034
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,640
Are they suspects?

1035
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,360
Then this means...

1036
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,760
We can directly eliminate both of them.

1037
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,960
Impossible.

1038
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,720
If this mechanism (doll) was used...

1039
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,560
So you're saying...

1040
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,840
It's between me and him then.

1041
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,520
What else could it be?

1042
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,640
Or maybe just him alone.

1043
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,280
Yes, that settles it.

1044
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,880
Let's vote.

1045
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,960
Only him

1046
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,400
Only me?

1047
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,360
Why only him?

1048
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,640
If this mechanism (doll)

1049
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,120
requires using this fingerprint scanner

1050
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,240
meaning under these conditions

1051
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,680
and Xiao Dong still had to press

1052
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,000
the outer button (door button),

1053
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,800
then this thing

1054
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
only he could be the killer.

1055
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,240
Anyone could go to F to press it

1056
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,800
Right

1057
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,560
You can move freely

1058
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,320
as long as the lights are off

1059
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,200
and no one sees you.

1060
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,760
You can go anywhere inside

1061
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
Yes, then Xiao Dong hid there

1062
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,480
to finally open the door for B

1063
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,440
Six times was perfect

1064
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,520
Does that make sense?

1065
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,400
This button's (door button) function is

1066
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,080
to let people out,

1067
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,920
not in.

1068
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
Right

1069
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
Got it

1070
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,080
Yes, anyone could

1071
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,880
Anyone could!

1072
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
Except it couldn't be me

1073
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,840
Why exclude you?

1074
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,960
Why would you be excluded?

1075
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,320
I don't follow

1076
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
You're the closest one here

1077
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,560
How could you possibly be ruled out?

1078
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,760
Come on, try it once.

1079
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,720
Come on, you guys go back.

1080
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,400
No, that's wrong.

1081
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,440
Didn't we say the door was only used once at the entrance?

1082
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,880
That was pressing the access control button.

1083
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,200
The access control was only pressed once.

1084
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,280
For a one-way door, you don't need to press the access control.

1085
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,200
The access control is for opening the door at the end.

1086
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,120
It's to make it a two-way door.

1087
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,920
The (door button) was pressed once.

1088
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,200
For a one-way door, I don't need to press (the door button).

1089
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,160
You can push without pressing (the door button).

1090
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
The function of this button is

1091
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,360
to let people out,

1092
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,280
not to let people in.

1093
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,920
Okay.

1094
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,280
It's open now.

1095
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,720
And here too,

1096
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,840
you can enter directly.

1097
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,600
You can go directly to F.

1098
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,120
Everyone had the time to commit the crime,

1099
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,920
right?

1100
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,840
The opportunity to commit the crime.

1101
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,800
This makes more sense.

1102
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,760
Everyone could reach F.

1103
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
Everyone could.

1104
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,600
Okay, let's calculate. Wait a moment.

1105
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,640
Let's calculate.

1106
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,440
We should still

1107
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,120
go outside.

1108
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,480
I know.

1109
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,680
How do we calculate this? Come on.

1110
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,000
We still have to rely on you, I'm telling you.

1111
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,560
Today's deduction is just

1112
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,360
impressive.

1113
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,440
He's helping the murderer.

1114
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,880
It's really quite unbelievable.

1115
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,720
Come on, I'll just work on this directly.

1116
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,160
Yes, just work on this directly.

1117
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,680
If I were the killer,

1118
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,720
would I arrange myself at C?

1119
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,840
E, F.

1120
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,040
B is here, right?

1121
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,600
Just draw this rotating door.

1122
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,760
So that means when the lights were off,

1123
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,040
C could reach F.

1124
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,960
D could reach F.

1125
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,000
E could reach F.

1126
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,120
F could be F.

1127
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,360
Assuming these three people

1128
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,720
all come to point F

1129
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
activate this fingerprint

1130
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,760
the door becomes bidirectional

1131
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,040
then twist this doll

1132
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,080
that's door D

1133
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,680
becoming the door from F to C

1134
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,880
Come on, count my attempts first.

1135
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,800
Starting now, we'll count six attempts.

1136
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,000
One, two, three—kill.

1137
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,840
Four, five, six—return.

1138
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,120
Alright, so this is enough.

1139
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,560
Who's enough?

1140
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,680
F is enough.

1141
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,840
If F is enough, then anyone is enough.

1142
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,840
No, if F is enough, then D is also enough.

1143
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,760
Calculate D

1144
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,120
From D to F

1145
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,600
One, two, three, four, five, six—got it

1146
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,840
No, wait

1147
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,200
How?

1148
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,280
How?

1149
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
How did I get to F? First, I D...

1150
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,640
You D—that's when you move in the dark

1151
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:33,960
You D—that's when you move in the dark

1152
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Slide over without wasting moves

1153
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,480
Slide to F and press this button (fingerprint scanner)

1154
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,760
Once, twice, three times

1155
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,280
Kill

1156
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,760
Now he has to return to D, right?

1157
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,160
Four times, five times

1158
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,760
Then twist this doll

1159
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,240
Six times

1160
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,080
Still enough

1161
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,760
Next, we'll calculate C.

1162
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,480
You're C, right?

1163
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,680
I'll calculate you.

1164
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,880
If it's C, we still start from F.

1165
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,160
Right.

1166
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,600
Same thing.

1167
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,680
One, two, three - strike.

1168
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,160
One, two - five times.

1169
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,520
You've got a chance.

1170
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,320
Now calculating E

1171
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,920
Starting with E

1172
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,800
Once, twice, three times

1173
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,760
Four, five, six, seven

1174
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
Exceeded the count for E

1175
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,600
I've been eliminated

1176
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,280
You ruled it out, impossible

1177
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,080
So E can't return this way

1178
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,800
Therefore E is not possible

1179
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,920
Why?

1180
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,120
Because she didn't return enough times

1181
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,640
Let's consider her possibilities

1182
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,840
Other than this murder method

1183
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,760
Is there a second way?

1184
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,640
No

1185
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,480
Is there any place

1186
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,560
We might have missed something?

1187
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
No

1188
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The route starting from F

1189
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,520
Is also the law of all things

1190
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,600
So what we need to pay attention to

1191
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,520
Is actually returning from A

1192
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
The number of times for each person's room

1193
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,480
After noting these counts

1194
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,520
Only C, D and F can actually return

1195
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,920
I also think E is impossible

1196
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,280
You just said you were impossible too

1197
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,600
That was just nonsense earlier

1198
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,960
Just think about it

1199
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
Why is E impossible?

1200
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,000
Because it can only be this way

1201
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,000
After pressing, go through this door to C

1202
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,680
I can't go backwards like this

1203
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,280
This way I waste counts

1204
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,400
You go through the door

1205
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,280
Her F must go to C

1206
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Wouldn't that be once?

1207
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,560
Doesn't C have to go to B?

1208
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,960
Once, twice, three times

1209
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,160
Exactly

1210
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,600
Return

1211
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,960
Four, five

1212
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,720
How else can we go?

1213
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,440
Six times

1214
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,560
This is also six, seven times

1215
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,320
Six times

1216
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,840
Eliminated

1217
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,720
Can't return to E, right?

1218
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,520
Right, no matter how we go it's seven times

1219
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,000
Little Killer

1220
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,320
Why do you all look like

1221
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,680
you're not very happy?

1222
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,120
Little Killer seems a bit unwilling

1223
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,680
Tried so hard not to eliminate someone

1224
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,200
I'm not willing to accept this

1225
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Your unwillingness won't change anything

1226
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,560
He didn't want to eliminate me

1227
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,080
I was the one eliminated

1228
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,680
It's not that I didn't want to eliminate you

1229
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,800
Today I wanted to take a wild guess

1230
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,080
I was ready to guess you

1231
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,560
But you got eliminated

1232
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,800
Now I feel today was wasted

1233
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,640
It messed up your plans for today

1234
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,920
Your plans with X are all wrong now

1235
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,080
X didn't expect we had a

1236
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,840
math prodigy among us

1237
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,240
You've met your match

1238
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,400
You two are the most suspicious

1239
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,240
You've hit a steel plate

1240
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,720
Alright, now I'm another investigator

1241
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,800
Everyone, listen to me

1242
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,360
Go ahead, say what you want to say.

1243
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,120
I have nothing to say.

1244
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
So this path eliminates me, right?

1245
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,400
That's correct.

1246
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:21,920
The three of you remain.

1247
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,120
The chances are equal now.

1248
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,120
You're clear, don't worry.

1249
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,800
I'm clear too, rest assured.

1250
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,800
I'm D, right?

1251
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,360
I enter here and go to this point.

1252
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,240
We've already calculated this part, bro.

1253
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,280
Then return to this spot.

1254
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,120
He's not willing to accept it.

1255
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,480
Little killer.

1256
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,800
You can't find any flaws now.

1257
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,840
You can't eliminate it.

1258
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,280
No, I just didn't understand earlier.

1259
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,720
You used to grasp things quickly.

1260
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,520
I'm slower at understanding these mechanisms.

1261
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,400
My approach to logic is more like...

1262
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,920
You

1263
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,080
This kind of thing really messes with people's minds

1264
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,120
People like you really...

1265
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,080
So currently

1266
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,920
The people in CFD's room

1267
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,720
are suspicious, right?

1268
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,160
So it's one, two, three

1269
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,600
Right

1270
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,480
What do you think?

1271
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,600
Then I know for sure it's not me

1272
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,480
So it must be one of you two

1273
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,600
What you're saying makes sense

1274
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,840
Could it really be that simple?

1275
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,280
Yes

1276
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,160
Let's look at C

1277
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,760
I think you're acting suspicious today

1278
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,360
No, look

1279
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,240
If C did it, how would they have done it?

1280
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,680
From here they would need to go here

1281
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,920
This door was originally here, right?

1282
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,600
They must have returned here

1283
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,360
One, two, three, four, five

1284
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,480
They wouldn't even need six

1285
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
So if I don't need six

1286
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Does that make me the killer?

1287
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
That's right, it's me

1288
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,320
No, we're just talking about the logic

1289
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,480
This is six

1290
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,440
This is also six, right?

1291
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,920
Six, six, five is the count

1292
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,160
Have you finished your deduction? Speak up

1293
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,680
Take charge of the situation

1294
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,440
What I'm thinking is whether

1295
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,040
we can rotate while pushing

1296
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,000
and then stop

1297
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,920
You completely ignored them

1298
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,480
Who are you trying to help escape?

1299
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,920
I'm not helping anyone escape

1300
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,360
Just say it then

1301
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,600
Which one of us three seems

1302
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,360
Who seems most like you? You do!

1303
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,920
You're acting too suspicious

1304
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,240
Fine, yes, it's me

1305
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,000
I think these two are most likely

1306
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,800
Choosing between two is

1307
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,040
Why though?

1308
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,560
It's me, don't pick others

1309
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,720
What about Kedao Le?

1310
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,000
It could be me

1311
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,120
All three of us are completely

1312
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,800
He seems likely too, he can't escape it

1313
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,120
I still fit this pattern

1314
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,360
From my perspective, he can be ruled out

1315
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
On what basis?

1316
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,000
Because he is F

1317
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,880
He's more likely than us, I mean

1318
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,600
The simplest way to kill

1319
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,040
But we all need to consider F

1320
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,160
Right, you're correct

1321
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,040
But if you eliminate him

1322
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,160
That makes you more suspicious

1323
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,240
If he's possible

1324
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
He's muddying the waters

1325
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,160
No, I think you're the one confusing things

1326
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
You're the one causing confusion

1327
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,960
He's just been agreeing

1328
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,400
I really think you're somewhat

1329
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,440
And today you're not even hostile toward me

1330
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,400
Fine, it's me

1331
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,320
My theory is this

1332
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,520
Because I know for sure I'm not

1333
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,000
But he's the most likely

1334
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Because he is F

1335
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,320
But if he is F

1336
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,760
It would be too obvious

1337
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,560
So it must be him, it's that simple

1338
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,400
From my perspective

1339
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,080
If you accept what I just said

1340
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,760
Then you must think it's me, right?

1341
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Then I'm C

1342
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,680
Am I not more likely than F

1343
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,120
To kill and return?

1344
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,400
No

1345
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,760
Because you can't be at F

1346
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,640
I understand what you mean

1347
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,000
It's just that F's murder motive

1348
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,320
and method are too direct

1349
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,760
Too direct

1350
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,440
If as the killer

1351
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,000
you should actually be placed

1352
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,360
in a position like C

1353
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,400
Right, I think this

1354
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,000
is psychologically correct

1355
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,200
So how is your logic different

1356
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,000
from my previous locking logic?

1357
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,240
His is more clever

1358
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,320
I think this is too simple

1359
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,240
Now your evidence is too obvious

1360
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,760
Is there any difference between you and me?

1361
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,520
Actually from the start his evidence

1362
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,680
was the most obvious

1363
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,760
I don't think so

1364
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,440
I think Xiaodong's vote control

1365
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,360
was just to make me get E

1366
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,360
Right, any of our three rooms

1367
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
would work

1368
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,000
Right

1369
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,800
As long as it's in C, D or F

1370
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,680
you can kill someone

1371
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,360
Any would work for killing

1372
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,520
He just needs to make you

1373
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,920
draw E, right?

1374
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,760
Exactly

1375
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,880
Old Bai, you've truly lost today.

1376
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,080
You're acting too unusual today.

1377
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,240
I'm telling you, you're being way too suspicious.

1378
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,880
Because in the first round of brainstorming,

1379
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,880
I already eliminated him.

1380
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,760
Because he was too suspicious.

1381
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,200
The seventh room, Room F.

1382
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,440
But he wasn't eliminated either.

1383
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,680
I don't accept your logic.

1384
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,480
But your methods are impressive.

1385
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,360
But I just don't want to eliminate you.

1386
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,840
Because this whole thing feels too strange to me.

1387
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,040
How could you completely eliminate him?

1388
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,840
Hearing you say that makes me more convinced you're innocent.

1389
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,600
Then I'll stop pretending.

1390
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
I think only a wolf would admit to being a wolf.

1391
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:38,840
Right.

1392
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,800
Innocent people wouldn't pretend to be wolves.

1393
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,240
Right.

1394
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,080
It can't be that simple.

1395
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,600
It's not that straightforward.

1396
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,600
He really is.

1397
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,520
Isn't it exactly that simple?

1398
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,520
Why protect him?

1399
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,000
No need to protect him now, it's too late.

1400
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,280
You should have acted sooner.

1401
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,560
You're protecting him.

1402
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,920
I'm X and can still protect people?

1403
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,280
That's impressive.

1404
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,520
So who do you think it is now?

1405
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,280
Him.

1406
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,160
I'm telling you, I've already locked onto him.

1407
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,400
You've locked onto him?

1408
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,040
Yeah.

1409
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,280
How did you identify him?

1410
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,160
What about you?

1411
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,360
Who do you think we should vote for?

1412
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,680
Actually, I think...

1413
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,560
it's him.

1414
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Basically, it comes down to...

1415
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,920
For me, this is...

1416
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
pretty much just intuition at this point.

1417
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,520
Let's just go with our gut feeling.

1418
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,120
Alright then.

1419
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,920
Is there any other evidence?

1420
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,560
Let's vote, shall we?

1421
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,040
Let's vote.

1422
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,920
Time to vote.

1423
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Wait, hold on...

1424
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,360
Just a moment.

1425
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,800
Don't you think we're being...

1426
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,040
too hasty?

1427
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,640
It couldn't be you, could it?

1428
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,080
You managed to escape.

1429
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,000
It must be me.

1430
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,640
It must be you.

1431
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,560
It must be me.

1432
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,360
You admitted it, you admitted it too.

1433
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,080
Why are you all using this tactic now?

1434
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Our motives are all the same, you know.

1435
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,200
There's no way to eliminate this possibility.

1436
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,320
To me, it's just guessing between you two.

1437
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,440
And you both know in your hearts who the culprit is.

1438
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,560
To me, it's you.

1439
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,080
Fine then.

1440
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,280
It's definitely one of us two.

1441
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,600
There must be one who knows they're...

1442
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,400
...the innocent one.

1443
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,920
Between us two, there must be one wolf.

1444
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,960
Between us two, there must be one wolf.

1445
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,720
This is like when you accused me that day.

1446
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,280
But in the end, neither of us was the wolf.

1447
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,840
As the culprit, playing like this...

1448
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,720
...is the right move.

1449
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,880
That's right, I am the culprit.

1450
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,560
No matter what, I'm voting for you.

1451
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,240
I'm convinced it's you now.

1452
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
Oh, that's possible too.

1453
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,440
Don't let your argument with Lao Bai...

1454
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,840
...make you overlook the real...

1455
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,160
No, it must be him.

1456
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
You're not just arguing.

1457
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,800
I'm not arguing.

1458
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,080
From the beginning in the Think Tank...

1459
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,840
When we were discussing clues...

1460
00:47:59,840 --> 00:47:59,920
When we were discussing clues...

1461
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,280
You thought he seemed unnatural.

1462
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:02,440
You thought he seemed unnatural.

1463
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,520
During his speech just now...

1464
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,160
...he appeared very unnatural.

1465
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,080
It was quite different from his usual self.

1466
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,840
Yes.

1467
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,320
Going to great lengths not to exclude someone

1468
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,560
I can't accept this

1469
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,720
No matter how much you resent it, it won't change anything

1470
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,120
Then, from this series of

1471
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,440
actions observed,

1472
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,840
I believe it's him

1473
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,800
No doubt about it

1474
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,280
Because once my younger brother finds a clue,

1475
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,800
he immediately voices his thoughts

1476
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,160
He blurts it out without hesitation

1477
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,960
The access control system is only in Room F

1478
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,440
So if the culprit wants to act,

1479
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,800
no matter which room they're in,

1480
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,680
they must first go to F

1481
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,200
The path starting from F is the universal rule

1482
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,280
So what we need to focus on

1483
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,280
is actually the return trips from A

1484
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,720
The frequency of each person's room visits

1485
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,160
After noting these frequencies,

1486
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,600
only C, D, and F could have returned

1487
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,040
And just like that, I'm ruled out

1488
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,800
That's my reasoning

1489
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,200
Because I haven't found any concrete

1490
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
substantial evidence

1491
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,040
Alright

1492
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,560
That works

1493
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,920
Yes, everyone has their own judgment

1494
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,840
I think he can choose me

1495
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,960
Because I can't—

1496
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,200
I'm really afraid it'll just be the two of you battling again

1497
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,440
And then letting one go—

1498
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,160
Wouldn't that make you ecstatic?

1499
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,160
Don’t stir up chaos here

1500
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,400
Go

1501
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,480
No, wait a minute

1502
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,680
We just have five minutes left

1503
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,080
Only two minutes have passed

1504
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,680
Calculating so precisely

1505
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,040
It's fine, keep arguing for a while

1506
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,800
I won't argue

1507
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,080
I'm just figuring out my choice

1508
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,560
No problem, you think about it

1509
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,960
I know you want to vote for me

1510
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,040
Just go ahead and vote then

1511
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,440
I might not vote for you, the issue is

1512
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,200
It's me

1513
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,760
I don't think it's you or you

1514
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,800
Then who is it? Him?

1515
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,120
You're X

1516
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,680
Between these two, who do you vote for?

1517
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,680
Between these two, who do you vote for?

1518
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,880
You're not voting for either of them

1519
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,120
I don't suspect either of them

1520
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,240
You suspect Bai Yangzuo

1521
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,560
Yes

1522
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,280
I've suspected him from the beginning

1523
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:50,920
I've said it before

1524
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,760
One vote for Bai Yangzuo

1525
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,640
Are you X?

1526
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,880
Do you actually have a role right now?

1527
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,560
I am X

1528
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,600
Wait, look me in the eyes and tell me

1529
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,000
What's your role today?

1530
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,360
I am X

1531
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,280
You're X

1532
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,760
Then you're helping the killer

1533
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,880
You definitely can't vote

1534
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,200
Right

1535
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,080
I don't know who to vote for

1536
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,200
I really don't know who to vote for

1537
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,840
Today's prime suspect

1538
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,320
Ning Hao

1539
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,320
The killer's motive was

1540
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,320
to lift the curse on themselves

1541
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,000
They collaborated with Xiao Dong

1542
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,280
to successfully kill Ba Zimei using a mechanism

1543
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,240
After a day of investigation and deduction

1544
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,480
we finally understood the killer's method

1545
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,320
Since Jin has been ruled out

1546
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,080
in my opinion

1547
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,880
the killer must be

1548
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,600
between Ke and Bai

1549
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,480
Therefore

1550
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,840
I ultimately chose to vote for

1551
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,200
Today, my prime suspect is

1552
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,760
There's no other reason

1553
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,480
except that

1554
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,760
his body language

1555
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,640
and behavior seem off

1556
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,480
For this case, my prime suspect is

1557
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,400
That's it

1558
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,680
Flawless deduction

1559
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,480
You voted for me

1560
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,280
I didn't vote for you

1561
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,480
Really?

1562
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,920
Who did you pick?

1563
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,840
You voted for yourself

1564
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,240
I did

1565
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,120
I'll tell you later

1566
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,520
Next

1567
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,160
We'll directly reveal the truth of this case

1568
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,840
Golden Key

1569
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,960
In today's case

1570
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,640
There are two suspects everyone focused on

1571
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,840
He's causing trouble

1572
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,760
No, I think you're the one causing trouble

1573
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,520
You're the one disrupting things

1574
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,760
He's just been agreeing

1575
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,920
One of us must be the wolf

1576
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,960
It's not you, is it?

1577
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,400
There are two suspects everyone has identified.

1578
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,480
They are:

1579
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,360
Ning Hao

1580
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,480
and

1581
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,040
Ke Daole

1582
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,400
Are you nervous?

1583
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,280
Are you feeling very nervous?

1584
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,440
You think you can get away, don't you?

1585
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,520
The one who received the most votes is

1586
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,560
The person with the most votes is

1587
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,760
I'm so nervous

1588
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
Ning Hao

1589
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,960
He received

1590
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,840
four votes

1591
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,800
Four votes

1592
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,280
All four people voted for me

1593
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,600
Today's prime suspect is

1594
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,080
Ning Hao

1595
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,280
Today, my choice for the real culprit is Ning Hao

1596
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,440
I voted for Ning Hao.

1597
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,520
I voted for Ning Hao to balance the situation.

1598
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,400
Because I suspect Bai Yangzuo has two votes.

1599
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,760
Ning Hao has one vote.

1600
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,240
So if I vote for Ning Hao, it'll be a tie between the two.

1601
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,360
We still have a chance to win.

1602
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,920
I think if someone can manipulate the votes,

1603
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,440
Room F would be the most convenient place to do it.

1604
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,800
And it's the least likely to cause any accidents.

1605
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,840
So in the end, I chose

1606
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,440
to cast my vote for Ke Daole.

1607
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,200
According to the rules,

1608
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,320
Ning Hao, who received the most votes,

1609
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,920
is identified as the true culprit.

1610
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,480
Therefore, this case's culprit identification result is:

1611
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,840
Complete victory.

1612
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,120
This case's culprit identification result is:

1613
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,880
Failure.

1614
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,040
The real culprit in this case is

1615
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,360
Ke Daole

1616
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,920
Additionally, does this issue involve X?

1617
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,640
This case involves X.

1618
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,800
I have to say...

1619
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,760
We have a bit of默契, don't we?

1620
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,480
That's amazing!

1621
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,960
We really do have默契.

1622
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,800
Did you just draw X?

1623
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,520
Yes, I did.

1624
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,600
You're X.

1625
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,720
Yes.

1626
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,000
Alright, let's play this openly.

1627
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,800
Okay.

1628
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,200
Your plan with X is all wrong.

1629
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,920
Have you thought it through? Speak up.

1630
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,040
Take charge of the situation.

1631
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,400
What I'm thinking is whether we can—

1632
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,640
rotate and push at the same time.

1633
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,440
You're completely ignoring them.

1634
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,960
Who are you trying to help escape?

1635
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,920
So who do you think it is now?

1636
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,040
I'm telling you, I've already locked onto it.

1637
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,040
Why protect him?

1638
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,520
No need to protect him, it's too late now.

1639
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,920
The path starting from F is also the law of all things.

1640
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,000
So what we need to focus on

1641
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
is actually returning from A.

1642
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,200
The number of times each person enters rooms.

1643
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,360
Once little brother finds a clue,

1644
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,600
he immediately blabs about it.

1645
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,600
What about Ke Daole?

1646
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:34,880
It could be me.

1647
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,000
All three of us are completely

1648
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,040
He can't escape either.

1649
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,240
X didn't expect we actually have a

1650
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,000
math prodigy among us.

1651
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,400
You've met your match.

1652
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,560
You two are the most suspicious.

1653
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,400
You've hit a steel plate.

1654
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,640
What about you?

1655
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,760
Who do you think it is?

1656
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,520
To me, it's one of you two.

1657
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,640
And you both know who the real culprit is.

1658
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,520
To me, it's you.

1659
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,720
It's you two again

1660
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,080
He got away

1661
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,200
Whose fault is that?

1662
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,760
Give me a hug

1663
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,000
So what everyone missed

1664
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,360
The crucial evidence was

1665
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,840
What was it?

1666
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,360
The crucial evidence everyone missed was

1667
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,120
In Xiao Dong's notebook

1668
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,000
The missing page

1669
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,640
That note must have been given to the killer

1670
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,680
Ke Daole

1671
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,280
Right in the corner of the library shelf

1672
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,640
There were pencil-written responses on the page

1673
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,680
And the person who owned this pencil

1674
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,040
Was in the previous case

1675
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,640
The one cursed by personal belongings

1676
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,120
Ke Daole

1677
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,840
I'll tell you what's most concerning

1678
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,640
The final canary

1679
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,680
Your intuition is too accurate

1680
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,120
Don't let your conflict with Lao Bai

1681
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,680
Make you overlook the real

1682
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,280
So it's him, right?

1683
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,040
Your intuition is really sharp.

1684
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,920
Oh my god.

1685
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,080
That's terrifying.

1686
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,960
This part of her is so much like Sis Ba.

1687
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,320
No.

1688
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,360
Actually, you also said that line—

1689
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,640
I kinda had a realization.

1690
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,480
I felt like I was just stubbornly arguing with him.

1691
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,200
And he wouldn’t even make eye contact with anyone.

1692
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,200
Yeah, and what he said at the end—

1693
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,240
"It was me."

1694
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,920
"Let you escape."

1695
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,840
"It must be me."

1696
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,480
"It must be you."

1697
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,400
"It must be me."

1698
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,960
Those two lines were a bit nervous.

1699
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,240
I was already nervous by then.

1700
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,840
Your intuition really was spot-on.

1701
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,520
How many times has your illogical thinking ruined things?

1702
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,840
Wake up, Bai Yangzuo

1703
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,800
Then what's your reasoning for voting for him?

1704
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,120
Is it because you two shifted the focus

1705
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,680
Every time, you bring the heat onto yourselves

1706
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,400
No, why did you end up voting for me?

1707
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,120
Do you remember him

1708
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,000
Before leaving, he said one thing

1709
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,480
I had already locked onto Bai Yangzuo

1710
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,560
Him?

1711
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,120
I told you, I had already locked onto him

1712
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,800
Yeah, so he locked Bai Yangzuo.

1713
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,360
I think Bai Yangzuo has two votes.

1714
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,920
I think you should lock him too.

1715
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,440
How did you know I locked him?

1716
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,040
You told me you've been targeting him.

1717
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,760
Yet you ended up voting for him.

1718
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,240
I thought he voted for you.

1719
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,880
So I'll vote for you too.

1720
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,880
Two votes.

1721
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,480
Even if it's between the two of you,

1722
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,960
a tie means we can still win.

1723
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,080
Alright.

1724
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,400
Never expected that.

1725
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,800
But your performance...

1726
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,080
He really spoke well later on.

1727
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,280
I was being completely genuine.

1728
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
I was being totally honest.

1729
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,520
It was very moving.

1730
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:49,840
I don't know why you...

1731
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,040
still doubted me in the end.

1732
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,160
Actually, when you were talking about that door,

1733
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,200
I was completely confused.

1734
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,680
That made me think you...

1735
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,880
were highly suspicious.

1736
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,000
Especially since you defended him.

1737
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,200
His defense was so transparent.

1738
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,440
Mine was just a normal defense.

1739
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,280
Getting four votes is insane.

1740
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,520
Luckily Brother Bai was here.

1741
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,560
Otherwise how could the culprit escape?

1742
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,440
No, before coming I asked around,

1743
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,200
they said Brother Bai is the best.

1744
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,760
Yes.

1745
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,640
He is good.

1746
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,080
You don't know how good he was before you came.

1747
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,400
These three days,

1748
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,520
I only saw one...

1749
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,120
I had to give you room to perform.

1750
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,280
You know what I mean?

1751
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,840
You've been too good to me.

1752
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,040
Alright.

1753
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,000
Now we'll begin awarding the golden key.

1754
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,240
Bai, you distribute them

1755
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,120
Every key is your achievement

1756
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,280
Yes, I love watching them

1757
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,000
receive golden keys

1758
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,160
From now on, you'll never touch it again

1759
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:55,880
Come, let's give

1760
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,560
Come, Sis

1761
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,000
Come

1762
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,560
I'm not your sister, I'm your girlfriend

1763
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,120
Girlfriend

1764
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,360
I love seeing how they feel receiving golden keys

1765
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,400
Our Kim family

1766
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,560
will award you the golden key

1767
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,760
Keep up the good work, you two youngsters

1768
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,240
The world belongs to the youth now

1769
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,800
Of course we know the world is for the young

1770
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,000
That's why we're letting you take the lead

1771
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,800
Right?

1772
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,040
I previously knew about a

1773
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,920
psychological concept

1774
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,720
called "beneficiary's malice"

1775
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,000
It means if I help someone

1776
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,040
we'd normally expect them to be grateful, right?

1777
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,520
Right

1778
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,800
But actually, if you help someone excessively

1779
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,040
that person will instead

1780
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,240
dislike you, resent you, and take advantage of you

1781
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,960
This is like "a peck of rice brings kindness, but a bushel brings hatred"

1782
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,360
There should be limits to how kind you are to someone

1783
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,400
If you're too good to them

1784
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,800
the day you stop being kind

1785
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,440
they'll think you're a terrible person

1786
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,720
I took advantage of this mentality

1787
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,400
to continuously manipulate Ai into singing

1788
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,640
This kind of manipulation

1789
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,280
is something everyone should be wary of

1790
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,000
If someone manipulates you like this

1791
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,160
you might think you're doing good

1792
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,480
but you must control the extent

1793
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,960
because human greed knows no bounds

1794
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,520
Exactly, you're absolutely right about that

1795
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,160
Because covert bullying isn't like

1796
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,040
direct physical violence

1797
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:20,600
You know?

1798
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,560
Punching you physically

1799
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,280
You can see if someone suffers domestic violence

1800
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,760
Much covert bullying is the kind

1801
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,760
that you can't see or touch

1802
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,120
but causes greater psychological harm

1803
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,640
than physical damage

1804
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,000
Yes

1805
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,600
The impact is more profound

1806
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:33,840
Today we saw

1807
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,280
Today we witnessed

1808
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:34,600
in that group chat

1809
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,520
in that group chat

1810
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,640
everyone was

1811
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,440
bullying and isolating one person

1812
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,520
These so-called victims

1813
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,560
would sacrifice their own lives

1814
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,280
to wish harm upon others

1815
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,760
creating an endless cycle

1816
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,160
Right, so actually in many cases

1817
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,160
when facing bullying

1818
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,240
you must have the courage to speak up

1819
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,920
and seek help

1820
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,000
Tell people around you, yes

1821
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,080
Otherwise, if you

1822
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,320
choose to hurt others instead

1823
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,520
To seek revenge against someone

1824
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,160
actually traps this situation into

1825
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,200
a vicious cycle

1826
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,560
The true way to break this curse

1827
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,360
is to eliminate bullying - then there would be no curse

1828
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,040
Exactly

1829
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,160
I urge everyone to pay more attention to this issue

1830
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,400
And don't subject others

1831
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,040
to this hidden form of bullying

1832
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,000
If we encounter bullying incidents in the future

1833
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,120
we must

1834
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,280
within our capabilities

1835
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,680
bravely stand up

1836
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,360
Yes

1837
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,800
Classmates

1838
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,480
Can you hear me?

1839
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,480
Can you see me?

1840
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,840
Do you still remember me?

1841
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,320
I'm Ba Zimei.

1842
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,520
I'm not dead

1843
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,720
So you didn't kill anyone

1844
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,600
Return the key

1845
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,880
I'm right behind you

1846
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,040
Hello

1847
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,400
That's so scary

1848
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,720
Sorry, I was wrong

1849
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,080
Good that you know

1850
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,560
If apologies could solve everything,

1851
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,960
what would be the point of us killers?

1852
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,160
"Helimo Jinyu," let the deduction begin.

1853
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,200
See you next time.

1854
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,720
Today we'll start from

1855
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,880
the perspective of being bullied

1856
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,960
to discuss how we should deal with bullying

1857
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,560
First, when facing bullying,

1858
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,800
we must take up

1859
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,720
legal weapons to protect ourselves.

1860
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,800
But in this case,

1861
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,960
the bullying manifests as emotional abuse,

1862
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,800
which makes

1863
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,920
evidence collection and legal accountability

1864
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,400
particularly challenging.

1865
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,440
Moreover, it often lacks parental understanding.

1866
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,840
Therefore, whether it's

1867
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,560
physical or emotional bullying,

1868
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,720
we should give it full attention and prevention.

1869
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,360
Last time we discussed

1870
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,040
schools' responsibilities regarding student bullying

1871
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,080
and guardians' duties, etc.

1872
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,600
So what if they fail to fulfill these duties?

1873
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,320
The responsibilities of relevant parties

1874
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,240
are clearly stipulated by law.

1875
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,720
If they don't comply,

1876
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,480
they must bear corresponding legal consequences.

1877
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,320
Secondly,

1878
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,680
we must also recognize

1879
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,840
the role of families in this matter.

1880
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,720
Some parents

1881
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,120
when their child is bullied at school,

1882
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,000
don't understand,

1883
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,400
and may even complain:

1884
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,040
"Why is it only you being bullied?"

1885
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,200
"Why are you so weak?"

1886
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,520
Or they ignore emotional bullying,

1887
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,560
thinking their child is too sensitive,

1888
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,400
taking things too seriously.

1889
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,440
This perspective lacks empathy

1890
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,440
It implies that bullied children are at fault themselves

1891
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,200
Suggesting they should be responsible for the bullying

1892
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,120
This will cause bullied children

1893
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,480
To receive even less support and care

1894
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,200
To feel even less secure and trusting

1895
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,920
Worsening their psychological trauma

1896
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,760
Parents should create an open communication environment

1897
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,080
So children feel comfortable

1898
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,320
Freely discussing problems with parents

1899
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,000
Guide children to understand

1900
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,360
The nature of student bullying

1901
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,320
And school harassment

1902
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,600
Encourage them to

1903
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,960
Bravely stand up when bullied

1904
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,440
And assure them

1905
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,040
Parents will provide full support

1906
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:07,800
Here

1907
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,680
We appeal

1908
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,800
For every student to avoid becoming perpetrators

1909
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,640
Such violence

1910
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,560
Doesn't necessarily mean physical fights

1911
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,560
It could also manifest as

1912
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,760
Cases like this one

1913
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,760
Involving invisible bullying

1914
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,080
Or even collective silence

1915
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,680
Finally we hope every victim

1916
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,200
Can gradually strengthen their willpower

1917
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,960
To fundamentally resist school bullying

1918
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,280
Please ask the robot to open the hatch.

1919
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,680
Complete the preparatory work before commencing.

1920
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,440
So among the four of them, one person

1921
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,240
definitely possesses self-awareness.

1922
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:50,760
Welcome to

1923
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,800
the exhibition hall of Tui Cyber Robotics

1924
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,040
The person who died today

1925
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:57,840
was killed in an explosion

1926
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,000
Between him and me

1927
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,200
it was just a master and product relationship

1928
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,000
We must find

1929
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,280
the one who killed him

1930
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,720
These belong to the four of you

1931
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,640
Scrap parts

1932
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,720
They were once part of you

1933
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,160
Our name is written as "robot"

1934
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,960
but read as "slave"

1935
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,320
This is a robot prison

1936
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,880
She now harbors deep resentment toward humans

1937
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,040
Aren't you a robot?

1938
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,960
Do you have free will?

1939
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,400
Why do we robots have human emotions?

1940
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,200
Our bodies were burned

1941
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,680
As long as I'm alive

1942
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,400
it won't deactivate

1943
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,120
I'd rather become someone who's killed

1944
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,000
than remain

1945
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,160
a robot humiliated every day

1946
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,600
Hello everyone

1947
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,680
I am Robot Number One

1948
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,680
I won't turn people into AI

1949
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,560
AI are robots

1950
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,800
I came here today

1951
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,440
to retrieve memories

1952
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,920
None of us remember

1953
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,960
what happened during that period

1954
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,720
The problem is our identities remain ours

1955
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,120
But at that time, you weren't yourself

1956
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,040
So I

1957
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,120
killed this man

1958
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,840
No one can hurt me

1959
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,240
Only I get to hurt others

1960
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,800
I was holding a brick

1961
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,120
Facing a woman I'd already smashed to death

1962
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,880
I kill when I want to

1963
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,760
Why exactly did we

1964
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,320
lose these memories?

1965
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,800
What happened next, I must tell you

1966
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,880
is extremely terrifying

1967
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:28,320
Don't

1968
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,640
These are all patients

1969
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,240
He wants to die but can't

1970
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,560
Perhaps by killing him

1971
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,240
the four of us can truly

1972
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:36,600
be free
