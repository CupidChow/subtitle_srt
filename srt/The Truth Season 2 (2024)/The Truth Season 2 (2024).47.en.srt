1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,040
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Game Rules

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,200
Six players per episode

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,720
Divided into four suspects

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,480
and two investigators solving the case

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,200
The real culprit hides among the suspects

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,160
The culprit's mission

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,840
is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
without being discovered by others

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,280
Only the real culprit can lie

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Notably,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,920
this season introduces new gameplay

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
The player as the culprit

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,520
if passing a certain test

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,520
can choose one investigator

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,960
to corrupt into X

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,080
X's mission is

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,000
during subsequent investigations

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,840
to actively help the culprit escape

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,880
Victory conditions:

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,400
After investigation concludes

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
players vote for the culprit

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,760
If the culprit receives

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,400
fewer votes than other suspects

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,240
then culprit and X get golden keys

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
Otherwise, correct voters

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
receive golden keys

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,040
June 20, 2048

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,360
Tui CyberTech's Robot Exhibition Hall

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,600
A sudden explosion occurred during the exhibition

30
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,760
It seems like the explosion just happened over there

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,440
That's right

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,520
Resulting in the death of the curator, Tui AI, on the spot

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,000
Investigations revealed

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,920
The killer used fragments containing Element Y

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,160
combined with the blue organic cleaner

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,560
used by the cleaning robots

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,120
which triggers an explosion

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
to murder Tui AI

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,720
We must find the killer who murdered him

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,600
Housekeeping robot Beiju

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,160
The first one who ran away

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,240
To avenge my master

43
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,920
I must kill the AI named Tui

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,520
I'd rather become a murderer

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
than remain

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,960
a robot humiliated every day

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,760
Escape this sea of suffering

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
That must be him

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
The real culprit is

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,080
classmate Xiao He

51
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
I'm truly speechless

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
As everyone was frustrated

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,600
about not finding the real culprit

54
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,080
Nobody move!

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,040
Stand up!

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,160
Take this seriously!

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,120
The exhibition hall was suddenly

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,640
filled with unidentified men in black

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,840
who forcibly captured all robots

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
except classmate Xiao Jin

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,080
Lined them up in a row

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,920
Dragged them all into a secret chamber

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Let me go!

64
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
Stop grinning!

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,560
Take this seriously!

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
Bring out the brain-machine interfaces and clothes

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,080
Roger that

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,320
They took out wireless brain-machine interfaces

69
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,480
and connected them to the five robots'

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,080
brain-machine interface ports

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,280
claiming they'd help Beiju complete her mission

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,600
to find someone crucial

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,080
and lock them in their own prison cells

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Who are these mysterious, ruthless men in black?

75
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,720
What is Beiju's mission?

76
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,200
And who is this crucial person?

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,600
What about the mysterious woman who appeared earlier

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,560
and the "Secrets of Tui Town"

79
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
she mentioned?

80
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,080
What does it all point to?

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,800
What other secrets is

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Tui Cyber Technology Company hiding?

83
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,800
What other stories

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
await them?

85
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,440
Reading brain-machine interface memory data

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,960
Memory timestamp retrieved:

87
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,200
June 27, 2036

88
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Someone called Tui Shou

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,320
asked me to meet at 11:10 PM

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,000
at the watchtower by the Wukenai River

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
This should be the place

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
I am a great artist

93
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
The dolls I create are priceless

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,440
Magic mirror, magic mirror, tell me

95
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,160
Where is the most adorable doll in the world?

96
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,880
Hello, guest

So you want to turn me into an AI?

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,400
This isn't profitable for me.

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,320
Look at me.

125
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,880
I don't turn people into AIs.

126
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
This is how we are

127
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,000
Should we turn like this?

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160

First wish

I'm currently promoting Cyber

153
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,960

There are so many people here.

162
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,680
I didn't expect this place to be so busy.

163
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,080
Hello, everyone.

164
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm Bai Zaoyin.

165
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
He won't shake my hand.

166
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,040
Bai Zaoyin.

167
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,880
Yes, I came here today to...

168
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,240
search for lost memories.

169
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm someone who can impress in the living room...

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,640
and cook noodles in the kitchen.

171
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,000
A stay-at-home husband.

172
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,440
Let me formally introduce myself

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,400
My name is Ning Manzou

174
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Take care on your way.

175
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,360
Easy to remember, right?

176
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,120
Take your time.

177
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Safe travels.

178
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,680
Today, I came here

179
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,960
to look for someone called "The Pusher."

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,680
Do any of you know this person?

181
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,360
No idea

182
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,160
Never heard of it

183
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,640
Don't know them

184
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,280
Then what does that mean?

185
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,080
Why are you looking for a promoter?

186
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,360
Because I received a letter

187
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
And they arranged to meet me at this watchtower

188
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,360
So today I came to meet them

189
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,520
Meeting at the watchtower?

190
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,880
Is this a watchtower?

191
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Then what is this place?

192
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,760
Cyber AI Doll Museum

193
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,160
No, because the exterior looks

194
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,040
Exactly like a watchtower

195
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,120
But you've made a doll museum inside?

196
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,200
Some of us are from this doll museum

197
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,120
Staff members?

198
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,200
These are all staff

199
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
She's the designer

200
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
Scientist

201
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,040
And you?

202
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,400
What about you all?

203
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,480
You guys

204
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,200
Why are you wandering around again?

205
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,440
Still playing role-playing games here

206
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,800
It's time for your shots and medicine

207
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Sir, may I ask

208
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,400
Things are getting interesting

209
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,080
Sir, may I ask

210
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm the most famous investigator in Tui Town

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,160
I came here to meet someone

212
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,080
This person is called The Pusher

213
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,040
Do you know him?

214
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
The Pusher

215
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,800
Don't know him

216
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
You sound unfamiliar with our place

217
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
Yes, this is my first time here

218
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,200
Seems you don't know what kind of place this is

219
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,960
Nor do you know who these four people really are

220
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
He's a streamer

221
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
This one's a househusband

222
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,680
This one's a scientist

223
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,200
This one's a designer

224
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,800
They've all been deceiving you

225
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,000
Then I'll tell you right now

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
What kind of place is this?

227
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,840
It's a mental hospital

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,360
Bai He Ke Ba

229
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh my god

230
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,600
You don't need to be afraid with this light

231
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,760
You have light

232
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,880
What are you scared of, bro?

233
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Bai Ke and He Ba

234
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,080
Bai Ke and He Ba

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Bai Ke and He Ba

236
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,680
You look like someone who needs an injection

237
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
You look like a psychopath

238
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,560
Are you okay?

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,880
Step back, okay

240
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,080
Cyber Psychiatric Hospital

241
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,560
That's right

242
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,400
This is the Cyber Psychiatric Hospital

243
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,000
The four of them

244
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,000
This is a long-term patient staying here.

245
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,280
We're just playing along with you

246
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,840
You're the ones who are sick

247
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,640
You're the patients here

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,640
Cyberpsychosis

249
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,120
is a new type of illness in this era

250
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:35,960
They

251
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,680
are all aggressive

252
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,960
Aggressive

253
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,560
and seem quite skilled in combat

254
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,080
I'll head back to work now.

255
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,640
Anyway, you all definitely need treatment.

256
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,600
Be careful.

257
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,080
Okay.

258
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,920
He's been sick for a while now.

259
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,680
Don't mind him.

260
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,600
That's right.

261
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

262
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
That's right, everyone

263
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,320
I'll take my leave now

264
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,160
Don't you run

265
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,920
No, just joking

266
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,640
So this is a cyber-style mental hospital

267
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,840
That person who looked like staff earlier

268
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,480
said all four of you are mentally ill

269
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,080
He's mentally ill

270
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,240
He's mentally ill

271
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,800
Right

272
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,640
But judging by attire

273
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,440
I think he looks more normal

274
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,880
We look like monsters

275
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,240
Yeah

276
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
So I conclude you four

277
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,640
must have mental issues

278
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,920
And one of you

279
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,200
often gets hit on the back of the head

280
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Exactly

281
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,600
You guessed right

282
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
Your guess was spot-on

283
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,280
So he tied up his hair today

284
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,520
to prevent getting hit

285
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,400
For cushioning

286
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,680
Cushioning

287
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,840
Today I'm a normal person

288
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,920
Today I'm looking for promoters

289
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,800
What can you offer?

290
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
Some constructive suggestions

291
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,520
Hey, stop messing around

292
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,320
Hey, why is the power out?

293
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm not an electrician, why ask me?

294
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,320
Do any of you know why the power's out?

295
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,200
How should I know?

296
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,280
Aren't you staff?

297
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,960
I am staff,

298
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,000
but just a designer.

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
I don’t handle the electricity.

300
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Where’s the electrician?

301
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,440
Go look for them.

302
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,520
I’ll go look.

303
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Why is the power back on again?

304
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,760
Our electrical circuits are often like this here.

305
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,040
You'll get used to it.

306
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,600
Aggressive.

307
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,520
Actually, this person isn't that important.

308
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,440
He was the one who contacted me.

309
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
Asked to meet with me.

310
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,400
I didn't particularly want to see him.

311
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,840
Then he must have something important.

312
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,880
That he needs to tell you.

313
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,240
Someone come quick!

314
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,880
Was it your doing?

315
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,240
The instigator

316
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,840
The leg was broken like this

317
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
The instigator jumped from the building

318
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,840
Jumped to his death

319
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,600
You're the top investigator in Tui Town, right?

320
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,280
Detective Ning Manzou, correct?

321
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,600
Yes, that's me

322
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,880
We're the patrol guards

323
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,840
Every night at 11:20

324
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,640
we patrol the entrance on schedule

325
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,280
We'd just started patrolling

326
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,240
when we saw the instigator jump from the fifth-floor office

327
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
plummet down

328
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,040
We rushed over immediately

329
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,600
and found the dean's body by the river

330
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
with one leg even submerged in the river

331
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
We have this

332
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
bodycam footage

333
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
Please take a look

334
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,760
Alright

335
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Detective Ning, we'll leave this to you

336
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,120
It's in your hands now

337
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,640
I'll take it from here

338
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,360
Ready to investigate anytime

339
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,200
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Case 9

340
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,480
"Tui Town 2048: Nightmare Dollhouse"

341
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,880
Officially begins

342
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,000
The date is June 27, 2036

343
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,360
11:25 PM

344
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,960
The victim in this case is the instigator

345
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,280
After preliminary investigation

346
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
the murderer has been narrowed down to

347
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,920
Babi

348
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,280
White Noise

349
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
Kexuejia

350
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,520
Heli

351
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
among these four suspects

352
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,880
Ning Manzou is temporarily cleared of suspicion

353
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,400
Therefore you'll be the lead investigator

354
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,280
Now please have the suspects leave

355
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,840
The investigator will remain for initial evidence collection

356
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,400
Alright

357
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,400
Now let's examine our

358
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,280
dean's assistant's body

359
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,840
There are abrasions on the face

360
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,280
Was this from being beaten?

361
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,960
For example, there are many such

362
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,120
abrasions

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,040
There's a ring on the hand

364
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,400
Left arm

365
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,240
Needle mark—something was injected

366
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,200
There shouldn't be anything else on the body

367
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,320
The fifth floor is likely the crime scene

368
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,680
Let's go check

369
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,520
Fifth floor

370
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,160
Why can't we enter through this door?

371
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,680
Do we need something to get in?

372
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,200
Something like a sensor port

373
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
Is it this ring?

374
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920
Could it be that this ring has some identification feature?

375
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,320
So if this door

376
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,120
can't be opened from the outside,

377
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
how did the culprit commit the crime?

378
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,160
Then shouldn't this door have been opened first?

379
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,360
That leaves only this explosion method.

380
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,400
This is our Old Bai's traditional virtue.

381
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,920
Okay

382
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,520
That also means this is a locked-room mystery

383
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,160
Let's first see what's in the room

384
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,320
As per your request, we've upgraded

385
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,880
your office's security protection system.

386
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,280
This system is connected to

387
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,640
the vital signs monitoring chip in your body.

388
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,760
If you unfortunately pass away,

389
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
your office doors and windows will

390
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,800
immediately auto-lock and seal.

391
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,640
That's incredible.

392
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,880
This means that

393
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,080
when the power went out in our facility,

394
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,520
was the time of his death.

395
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,480
Do you know why the power went out?

396
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
How would I know?

397
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,040
At that time, all four suspects

398
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,080
were with me.

399
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,360
Meaning they couldn't have done it.

400
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
So that means

401
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
the perpetrator wasn't dead yet at that time.

402
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,480
He must have used some timed

403
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,760
device or method to make himself

404
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,360
fall from the building

405
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,960
at a predetermined time.

406
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,720
Where's the window?

407
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,400
Here's the window.

408
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,000
If we first knock him out or something

409
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Then use a timed device

410
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,120
And make him jump at that moment

411
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,160
Push the cyber psychiatric hospital diagnostic report reader

412
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,720
Alright, next we need to look at this.

413
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,960
The person in yesterday's photo.

414
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,720
This is the person.

415
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
The mastermind.

416
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,640
There's also a suicide note here.

417
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,240
Cyber fans gathered

418
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,880
A colorless and odorless knockout incense

419
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,080
Note: The person carrying the touch-sensitive ring

420
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,640
is immune to this incense.

421
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
There's a ring on their hand.

422
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,920
Initial evidence collection at the crime scene is complete.

423
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,760
Please have Detective Tui escort the suspect

424
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,560
to the Interrogation Hall

425
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,160
for questioning.

426
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,920
While investigating the crime scene,

427
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,760
the members of Dongnao Hall have also collected

428
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,200
some evidence related to the four suspects in this case.

429
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,200
Please examine the evidence, players.

430
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,760
It's Brother Bai.

431
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,800
Let me tell you, Brother Bai is the person I admire most.

432
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,520
So exquisite.

433
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,800
This...

434
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,760
I already know who the killer is.

435
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
I've now discovered that these are all

436
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,120
ridiculous pieces of evidence

437
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,120
Scumbag

438
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,920
I knew you were no good

439
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,360
Let me tell you

440
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,560
That's right, it's me

441
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,800
You're absolutely right

442
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,680
Alright

443
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,160
First, let's welcome the four of you

444
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,920
This is a bit embarrassing for you

445
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,680
Sorry

446
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,840
It's my first time being a detective today

447
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,480
Alright, let's get started

448
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
First of all

449
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,480
Today's victim

450
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,600
is called "The Pusher"

451
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,080
The incident occurred on June 27, 2036.

452
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,360
At 11:22 PM.

453
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,240
The crime scene is the place where you all are currently staying -

454
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,360
the Cyber Psychiatric Hospital.

455
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,160
So first, let's talk about

456
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,800
your relationship with the deceased.

457
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,040
Other than being patients at the psychiatric hospital,

458
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,960
what other connections do you have with the deceased?

459
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,840
Let's start with the scientist.

460
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,160
I don't know him at all.

461
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,600
That's it.

462
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
Absolutely no acquaintance.

463
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,680
You're staying at that psychiatric hospital.

464
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,800
You're a patient, he was the director.

465
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,720
How could you not know him at all?

466
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm not mentally ill.

467
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,120
He said I was mentally ill.

468
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,000
So I became mentally ill.

469
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,360
Then what are you?

470
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
I'm a scientist.

471
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
What kind of scientist?

472
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,080
Chief researcher at the Cyber AI Doll Center.

473
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,320
Right, so you didn't even know your own director?

474
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,680
Why are you interrogating others?

475
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
You're also a suspect.

476
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,360
He's the detective position.

477
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,680
Yes, that's right, I am.

478
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
Know your place.

479
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,680
What?

480
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,560
I'm talking about this instigator.

481
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:26,960
He is...

482
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,280
He claims to be the director of a mental hospital.

483
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,040
I'm the chief researcher at the Doll Institute.

484
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,800
We're the Doll Institute and a mental hospital.

485
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,640
They're completely unrelated.

486
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,520
I definitely don't know him.

487
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,480
Alright.

488
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,760
Next.

489
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,680
I don't know him at all either.

490
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,440
Don't know him whatsoever.

491
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
Right, when you asked today...

492
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,880
It was the first time I'd heard that name.

493
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,400
So regarding his claim that you're mentally ill...

494
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,720
You...

495
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm skeptical too.

496
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,720
You're skeptical?

497
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,200
Yes.

498
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,560
Alright, Babe.

499
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,080
I don't know him either.

500
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
I have no connection with him.

501
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
You don't know him either?

502
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,360
Right, I didn't even know I was mentally ill.

503
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,560
How could I possibly be connected to him?

504
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,080
Do you now know you're mentally ill?

505
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
No, I'm not mentally ill.

506
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,840
You refuse to admit it, right?

507
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,000
How is this refusal to admit?

508
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
Do you have a diagnosis certificate?

509
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,240
Don't worry, everyone will get their turn.

510
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,640
Alright, I'll wait for you.

511
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,880
Everyone here seems a bit unusual.

512
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,680
White noise.

513
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,360
Same as above.

514
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,920
Say those words clearly for me.

515
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,280
What does "same as above" mean?

516
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,920
So you don't know him either, right?

517
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,120
Understood.

518
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,320
Fine then.

519
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,880
This part was basically pointless.

520
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
None of you know him.

521
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,760
Let's go through this step by step then.

522
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
First item.

523
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,640
The first piece of evidence is a phone.

524
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,080
During the incident, two security guards

525
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,960
brought in a corpse while

526
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,440
they also handed us this phone.

527
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,000
We have the

528
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,880
body camera footage here.

529
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,040
Please take a look.

530
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,640
Got it.

531
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
What's recorded on this phone

532
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,640
shows the scene when the incident occurred.

533
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,320
Let me play it for everyone.

534
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,080
The time is June 27, 2036,

535
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,920
11:22 PM.

536
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
We've started our patrol.

537
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,600
Let's check out tonight's view.

538
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,240
Someone's jumping down!

539
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,960
This was the exact time of the incident.

540
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,240
He stated it clearly -

541
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,600
11:22 PM.

542
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,640
We watched as this person

543
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,000
jumped from the fifth floor.

544
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
Did he die from the fall,

545
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,280
or was he already dead when thrown down?

546
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
That's unclear.

547
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,400
Because at that time we were

548
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,680
all together simultaneously.

549
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,600
You all have alibis,

550
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,160
so I have three theories:

551
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,440
First possibility - there was an accomplice.

552
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
Secondly, I think it might be

553
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,080
a set-up mechanism

554
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,240
A timed mechanism,

555
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,880
for example, when the time comes

556
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
the mechanism triggers

557
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,120
and he jumps from the building.

558
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,320
Many methods

559
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,120
are used to create an alibi.

560
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,760
Right, so I'm saying

561
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,480
was he killed first and then

562
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
so later we'll see

563
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,200
if there's logic to him dying first.

564
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,560
The third possibility is he jumped himself.

565
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,240
Perhaps he

566
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,120
took some drug

567
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,320
or was injected with

568
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,040
some substance that caused him

569
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,360
to jump voluntarily.

570
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,560
He hallucinated.

571
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,800
Now about the corpse:

572
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,160
The basic wounds on the body

573
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,960
all match fatal fall injuries.

574
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,440
But I found something on his left arm

575
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
a needle mark

576
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,760
evidence of an injection

577
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,480
This means he

578
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,920
before jumping

579
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,480
had been injected with something

580
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,120
But what was it?

581
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,520
We don't know what he was injected with

582
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,360
It could be that he

583
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,400
had some medical condition or something

584
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,040
First possibility: he injected himself

585
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,680
Second possibility: someone else

586
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,600
administered the injection

587
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,160
After examining the body

588
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,080
I went to the fifth floor

589
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,680
Upon arriving, I noticed the room

590
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,800
Let me sketch

591
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,960
the room's layout

592
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,200
This room

593
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,120
Here's the elevator

594
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,600
Upon entering

595
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,120
there's a room shaped like this

596
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,880
(room)

597
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,600
Window here

598
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,520
Desk here

599
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,560
Okay, roughly like this

600
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,120
This is the elevator

601
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,680
that brings people up

602
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,920
This is the door

603
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,800
This is the window

604
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,320
Meaning he jumped

605
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,720
from here

606
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,000
But the window is now sealed shut

607
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,680
The door is also sealed

608
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,120
I couldn't open it when I arrived

609
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,280
And no one was inside

610
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,080
This means

611
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
it's a locked room mystery

612
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,520
We found some clues on the fifth floor.

613
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,640
The first one is this.

614
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,360
It's a message from a security company.

615
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,080
Dear Mr. Pusher,

616
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,160
As per your request,

617
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,800
we've upgraded the

618
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,240
security system in your office

619
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,000
to protect your classified documents.

620
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,040
The system is linked to your

621
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,840
vital signs monitoring chip.

622
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,200
In case of your demise,

623
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,800
your office doors and windows

624
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,760
will automatically lock and seal,

625
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,200
cutting all power and network in the building

626
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,160
to halt core facility operations

627
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
and prevent theft or

628
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,200
transfer of classified files.

629
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,840
After one minute,

630
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,080
backup power for daily use will activate.

631
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,600
This means that

632
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,360
the blackout only occurs when Pusher dies.

633
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,760
We all experienced

634
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,920
that blackout moment.

635
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,760
The lights went out, right?

636
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,280
Why did the power go out during the investigation?

637
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,040
We've determined his time of death.

638
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,680
He died right at that moment.

639
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,600
During the power outage,

640
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,880
and when security carried him in,

641
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,040
how long was that interval?

642
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,080
About five to ten minutes.

643
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,680
So is it possible, as previously mentioned,

644
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,640
that he was already dead

645
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
before he jumped from the building?

646
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,480
Correct.

647
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,160
So this document reveals an inconsistency.

648
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,200
It's impossible.

649
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,880
Why?

650
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,360
Because when I entered that room,

651
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,080
I discovered

652
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,400
that this mechanism

653
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,320
had already activated the window lockdown.

654
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,200
The window had already slid out.

655
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,280
Good, the windows are sealed shut.

656
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
It's the moment he dies.

657
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,720
This window

658
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,760
slides out.

659
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,560
Then all windows close completely.

660
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,280
Doors shut.

661
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,120
Creating a locked-room atmosphere.

662
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,600
This is the absolute requirement.

663
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,720
He must be

664
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,080
at the exact moment of death.

665
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,920
Which means

666
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
if he dies inside the room,

667
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,600
he can't get out.

668
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Then he's trapped inside.

669
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,960
Right, meaning

670
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,800
he must have been

671
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,760
at the moment of impact

672
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,680
when the window closed.

673
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,120
So death by falling then.

674
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,400
Death by falling.

675
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,480
Exactly, death by falling.

676
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,280
Whether he was unconscious or hallucinating before death,

677
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,320
we still don't know.

678
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,760
Next is something called

679
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
what's this thing called?

680
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:37,960
Called

681
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,800
Cyber Trance.

682
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,680
Cyber Trance.

683
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,560
Very cyberpunk.

684
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,840
A colorless, odorless knockout drug.

685
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,240
It comes with a touch-activated ring.

686
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,040
This ring I'm wearing

687
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,400
is the control ring.

688
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,560
Each time the ring is touched,

689
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,720
it releases

690
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,360
ten seconds of knockout gas.

691
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,120
Victims are knocked out immediately upon inhalation.

692
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,040
Leaves a black mark behind the right ear.

693
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,080
Note:

694
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
The ring wearer

695
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,680
is immune to the effects.

696
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,560
So where did this ring come from?

697
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,560
It was found on the deceased.

698
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,360
There was a ring on his hand.

699
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,000
Moreover, I examined behind the deceased's right ear.

700
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
There were no black marks.

701
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,000
This means

702
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,720
he was the one using this ring

703
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,040
to drug other people.

704
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,360
This was his.

705
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,880
His belonging.

706
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,360
His possession.

707
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,840
Exactly.

708
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
It was from his office.

709
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,080
He might have been meeting someone,

710
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
then pressed this ring,

711
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,160
releasing the anesthetic for ten seconds,

712
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,640
drugging the visitor,

713
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,320
or something similar.

714
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,720
It was one of his tools.

715
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,800
Therefore,

716
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,680
I need to examine

717
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,040
all four of you present.

718
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,960
Your ears.

719
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,200
Whoever has black marks behind their right ear

720
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,320
means you've been to

721
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,680
that fifth-floor office.

722
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,040
Then I'll begin,

723
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,600
or does anyone want to confess?

724
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,840
You have it.

725
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,000
How would I know if I do?

726
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,360
I can't see behind my right ear.

727
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,840
Careful or I'll show you my Black Tiger Strike.

728
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,600
There's one behind this little kid

729
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,000
Do it yourself

730
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,560
You do your own ears

731
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,120
You have it too

732
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,040
Both have

733
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,200
Also have

734
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,840
As if you don't have any

735
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,800
Okay

736
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,800
That means all four of you

737
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,480
have been to that office on the fifth floor

738
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,120
and were all drugged

739
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,320
Every single one of you

740
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,520
Do you remember going to that office?

741
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,920
No

742
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,800
I don't remember

743
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,760
What about you?

744
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,400
White noise

745
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:57,880
No

746
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,040
Don't remember

747
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,440
Never been there

748
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,840
Don't remember, completely blank

749
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,880
But the evidence shows you've all been there

750
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,360
Right?

751
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,080
You went but don't remember

752
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,160
Or you were drugged somewhere else

753
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,720
That's possible

754
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,160
Right?

755
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,520
Yes

756
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
Could be

757
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,760
I found on his

758
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,920
desk there was a computer

759
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,360
and on it I found a what?

760
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Suicide note

761
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
There's also a suicide note here.

762
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
Then it's clearly suicide, right?

763
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,440
But I think the reason why

764
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,320
it's not suicide is...

765
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,600
Well...

766
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,480
I believe this suicide note

767
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,080
was forged by the killer because...

768
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,680
On his tablet,

769
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,760
there was a to-do item for today.

770
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,560
Turns out this director

771
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,920
was the person in yesterday's photo.

772
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
It's this man.

773
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
The Pusher

774
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,400
It said:

775
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,760
"Message sent to Ning Manzou,"

776
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,000
"arranged to meet tonight."

777
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
"I'll tell him"

778
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,240
"the whole truth."

779
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,840
So actually today, this Pusher

780
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,600
arranged to meet me

781
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,080
to reveal a truth to me.

782
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,600
But he died

783
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,320
before we could meet.

784
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,960
He's already dead.

785
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,520
Therefore,

786
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,880
he couldn't have committed suicide

787
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,960
because he hadn't met me yet.

788
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,160
He had plans today.

789
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,440
This suicide note must have been forged by the killer.

790
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,040
Also, I found this item.

791
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,280
It's the "Push Town Daily."

792
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,600
The most important thing is this

793
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,560
The shocking and horrifying doll corpse case that stunned Tui Town

794
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,840
The Doll Butcher brutally murdered five people

795
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,280
April 3, 2036 newspaper

796
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,000
Starting from October 10 last year

797
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,640
A serial killer known as the Doll Butcher

798
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,200
Brutally killed five victims within six months

799
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,520
The uniqueness and cruelty of the methods

800
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,600
Shocked the entire town

801
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,480
In every case

802
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,400
The Doll Butcher

803
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,760
Used the same modus operandi

804
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,000
First killed victims with a brick

805
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,800
Then concealed the bodies inside

806
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,120
Large doll figures

807
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,520
Even more horrifying

808
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,960
The killer would also remove

809
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,760
The right index finger from each victim

810
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,280
The motive has not yet been clarified.

811
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,680
Let me note down the timeline first.

812
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,600
Five victims.

813
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,160
The first one's surname was Zhou.

814
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,040
Zhou.

815
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,520
Zhou (unnamed), October 10, 2035.

816
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,680
The second's surname was Qian.

817
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,960
Also on November 1, 2035.

818
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,760
Sun (unnamed).

819
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,440
December 17.

820
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,280
Xiang (unnamed).

821
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,840
December 28.

822
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,240
The last one's surname was Jin.

823
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,680
April 2, 2036.

824
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,480
Alright.

825
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,480
So these five people were all killed by...

826
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,680
...someone called the Doll Butcher.

827
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,480
There was a note attached.

828
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,600
It had four words written on it:

829
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,840
"So it was you."

830
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,560
The mastermind probably found out...

831
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,120
...who the killer in the news was.

832
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,200
Who it was.

833
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,600
I suspect the mastermind...

834
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,640
...was killed by the Doll Butcher.

835
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,920
Killed.

836
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
But there's still one question remaining.

837
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,200
If the killer is the Doll Butcher...

838
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,360
...his modus operandi was always the same.

839
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,920
But this time...

840
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,280
...the victim fell to their death.

841
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,480
Which means...

842
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,640
...it's different from his previous methods.

843
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,760
It's not the same.

844
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,560
As a murderer,

845
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,640
my understanding is

846
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,840
he would consistently use his

847
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,800
signature killing method.

848
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
And as he said,

849
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,680
in every case, the Doll Butcher

850
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,800
used the same modus operandi.

851
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,440
So I think it's highly likely

852
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,760
this person didn't commit this murder.

853
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,240
Right.

854
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
There's no need for him to create

855
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,120
a new killing method.

856
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,040
Right, a new killing method.

857
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,520
Having already killed five people,

858
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,600
and since he's killed five people,

859
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,120
one more wouldn't matter.

860
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,040
He's not afraid.

861
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,720
Why would he bother faking

862
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,200
a suicide death?

863
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,240
Exactly, he's not afraid.

864
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,480
This definitely isn't the same person.

865
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,080
But what interests me most

866
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,160
about this news

867
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,880
is one particular report called

868
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,160
"Good Dad Surgery."

869
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,880
The Good Dad surgery is here.

870
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,960
Men can get pregnant now.

871
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,560
After the surgery, you can experience

872
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,000
the joy of a ten-month pregnancy.

873
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,600
Seriously?

874
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,480
Among the four men present here,

875
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,920
who wants to try this?

876
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,360
Do you want to? You first.

877
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm the investigator, you can't question me.

878
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,480
Shut up.

879
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,520
We obtained this thing

880
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,200
called the

881
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,080
Tui Cyber Psychiatric Hospital Diagnosis Reader.

882
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,960
But the diagnosis report is missing.

883
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,000
Only this flashlight remains.

884
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,240
You might need this

885
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,640
to see its contents.

886
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,680
So the specific diagnosis

887
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,360
about what illness you four have

888
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,200
is still unknown.

889
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,280
There's also

890
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,520
a box from

891
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,640
Tui Cyber Technology Company.

892
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,920
There's something inside

893
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,800
But it can't be opened now

894
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,000
It's currently locked with a passcode

895
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,800
Tui Cyber Technology Company

896
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,120
Alright, these are all the things I found at the scene

897
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,520
and on this corpse

898
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,800
that raise suspicions.

899
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,520
Alright, let's proceed in order.

900
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,240
Let's start with our baby first.

901
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,480
You share your evidence first.

902
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,440
The evidence I found relates to White Noise.

903
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,120
It was found under his bed.

904
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,400
First, there's a small model of a house.

905
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,080
This is their home.

906
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,840
They graduated from Tuifo University.

907
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Many young girls are infatuated with this White Noise.

908
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
And then he was in bed with this (girl).

909
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,040
Then they entered the marriage hall

910
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,400
This (girl) is resting on the sofa

911
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,680
He is doing household chores

912
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
This must be what their happy little home looks like

913
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,800
Good

914
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,920
Can you share what this one is

915
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,720
That's right

916
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,880
I graduated from

917
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Tuifo University

918
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,800
Because

919
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,720
my personal charm was too strong

920
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,120
I was extremely popular at school

921
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,360
After graduation, I joined

922
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,840
the world's number one

923
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Dragon Fruit Company

924
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,440
And at the company too

925
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,360
I was outstanding

926
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,400
and beloved by my colleagues

927
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,000
Then one day

928
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,760
I met

929
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,560
Golden Voice

930
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,520
who completely captivated me

931
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,640
Okay

932
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,800
Her name was Golden Voice

933
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,600
So I pursued her passionately

934
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:37,680
Alright

935
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,960
And we got married

936
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,120
Because I'm the type who

937
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,760
enjoys doing household chores

938
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,640
cooking and cleaning

939
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,680
So at home I would

940
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,480
cook delicious meals every day

941
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,320
Golden Voice would always

942
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,240
praise how amazing I was

943
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,720
It was wonderful

944
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,360
We lived happily ever after

945
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,080
The second piece of evidence is

946
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,440
a poster found under the pillow

947
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,440
a poster

948
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,880
showing White Noise and Golden Voice

949
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,880
with a faint image of

950
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,320
Ke Scientist in the background

951
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,160
watching them from behind

952
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,880
You pervert!

953
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,360
This makes me so angry

954
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,040
Secretly observing

955
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,320
Look at his expression

956
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,800
There's more to it

957
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,120
There's also him with Golden Voice shopping

958
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,080
He's behind

959
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,200
He's in the back

960
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,640
peeking his head out from behind

961
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,120
And we need to open it

962
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
After opening it

963
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,360
This is like his nightmare

964
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,480
This thing

965
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There's an assassin here

966
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,040
Holding a knife in hand

967
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,840
And there's a bear

968
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,440
Hiding golden vocal cords inside

969
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,880
The golden vocal cords were killed

970
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,720
Right, she's lying inside, isn't she?

971
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,800
Over here

972
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,800
This is his nightmare

973
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,160
What is this thing?

974
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,280
Explain this.

975
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,320
Let me explain.

976
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,720
Don't touch me, I'm warning you.

977
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,240
I'll touch you right now.

978
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,400
Watch out!

979
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,320
Take this Black Tiger Steals Heart move!

980
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,400
Jin Sangzi works in that building.

981
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,400
That watchtower we just passed.

982
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,800
Watchtower, yes, the watchtower.

983
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,000
The Cyber AI Doll House.

984
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,560
Yes, exactly.

985
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,640
She works there.

986
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,080
I pick her up every day.

987
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,120
Then one day I suddenly noticed...

988
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,880
She has this coworker...

989
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,000
Every time I came to get Jin Sangzi,

990
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,600
he would stare at me constantly.

991
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,360
It was strange.

992
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,640
That person is him.

993
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,120
He's Jin Sangzi's coworker, right?

994
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,480
Yes.

995
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,040
Then suddenly one time,

996
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,680
he came running over

997
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,320
and said, "You...

998
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,280
don't recognize me?"

999
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,400
I said "Are you crazy?"

1000
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,400
"What's wrong with you?"

1001
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,280
"Are you so obsessed with our Jin Sangzi

1002
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,480
that you've lost your mind?

1003
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,360
Trying to take her away from me?"

1004
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,640
I found him disgusting.

1005
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,120
Then later I discovered...

1006
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,680
When I went on dates with my wife,

1007
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,040
he was behind us,

1008
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,160
sneaking around

1009
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,040
following us constantly.

1010
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,600
Yes.

1011
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,080
One day my wife

1012
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,520
didn't come home very late.

1013
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,800
I was worried about her,

1014
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,000
so I...

1015
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
accidentally saw a message.

1016
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,680
There was a message on her phone

1017
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,360
from him to Jin Sangzi,

1018
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,120
saying...

1019
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,360
asking to meet up

1020
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,640
to discuss some product design or something.

1021
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,880
But this guy was acting all sneaky

1022
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,840
I just felt something was off about him

1023
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,400
Of course

1024
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,640
So I rushed outside

1025
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,520
to look for Jinzhou

1026
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,240
As I walked, I noticed a crowd on the street

1027
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,880
gathered together

1028
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,680
Then suddenly someone nearby said

1029
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,400
This place has

1030
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,120
a doll killer or something

1031
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,720
And suddenly I felt

1032
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,960
a terrible premonition

1033
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,520
So I opened up the doll

1034
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,120
only to find

1035
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,480
it was indeed our Jinzhou

1036
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,840
She was dead inside

1037
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,360
stuffed into the doll

1038
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,480
with one of her fingers cut off

1039
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,600
Because I was so heartbroken

1040
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,400
it caused physical discomfort

1041
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,920
Then one day I suddenly felt

1042
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
that my eyes seemed to be seeing

1043
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,760
double images

1044
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,320
My right eye saw double

1045
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,120
but my left eye didn't

1046
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,000
So I covered my left eye

1047
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,000
and then I discovered

1048
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,400
two women appearing in my vision

1049
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,880
One was Golden Voice

1050
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,320
but completely different

1051
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,360
from when she was alive

1052
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,800
She used to be so gentle

1053
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,960
praising me every day

1054
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,360
But this version in my eyes

1055
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,280
was vicious and cruel

1056
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,120
cursing at me

1057
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,840
even trying to hit me

1058
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,680
The other woman

1059
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,680
was also quite fierce

1060
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,160
but she kept repeating one phrase

1061
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,240
"Borrow a womb to bear a child"

1062
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,560
"Borrow a womb to bear a child"

1063
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,080
Yes

1064
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,280
Then these two afterimages

1065
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,240
have been appearing before my eyes constantly

1066
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,120
I noticed what he mentioned earlier

1067
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,560
about his "Golden Voice"

1068
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,320
Mr. Jin was killed on April 2nd this year

1069
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,040
That's correct

1070
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,120
And as you just mentioned

1071
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,080
she worked at that Cyber Psychiatric Hospital

1072
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,560
Actually, I saw

1073
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,320
another photo with text at the top saying

1074
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,880
"Core Researcher at Cyber Psychiatric Hospital"

1075
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,240
This confirms both of them worked at Cyber Psychiatric

1076
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,080
Hospital

1077
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,880
So I reasonably suspect

1078
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
that all five victims

1079
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,720
might have worked at Cyber Psychiatric Hospital

1080
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,760
That's possible

1081
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,040
And this one is quite terrifying

1082
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,560
There's a doll here

1083
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,320
It was found under his bed

1084
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,360
It seems like the blood inside its body

1085
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,000
is being poured into a small bowl

1086
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,760
Is that a knife stabbed into it?

1087
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,240
Yes

1088
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,280
This should be you.

1089
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,080
Why?

1090
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,320
He's cursing you.

1091
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,840
White noise, explain this.

1092
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,240
What exactly is this thing?

1093
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,360
Do you hate me this much?

1094
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,800
How could you have such a hobby?

1095
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,160
Because my eyes sometimes see...

1096
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,040
double images.

1097
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,960
Double images?

1098
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,760
It's extremely tormenting for me.

1099
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,920
So I searched online...

1100
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,040
to see if there was a solution.

1101
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,160
Then I found one method.

1102
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,320
So I tried it.

1103
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,560
It actually worked.

1104
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,440
It was cured.

1105
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,360
No, it wasn't.

1106
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,440
It was effective, just different.

1107
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,720
She returned to how she was before.

1108
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,960
She also told me something.

1109
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,840
She said she was killed by Keqin.

1110
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,320
And Keqin is actually...

1111
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,840
that killer in town.

1112
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,840
The Doll Butcher is him.

1113
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,120
Let's make a bold assumption.

1114
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,440
Which means...

1115
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:16,800
You...

1116
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,720
After Golden Voice died,

1117
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,760
you could see her "ghost," right?

1118
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,640
I don't know if it was her ghost.

1119
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,240
But my eyes saw this...

1120
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,040
phantom.

1121
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,440
It might just be my own mental illness.

1122
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:24,840
Like...

1123
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,600
something I imagined.

1124
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,440
That's possible too.

1125
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,120
But I don't know.

1126
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,600
And then?

1127
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,800
So then I...

1128
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,920
had to avenge my Golden Voice.

1129
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,880
You want to kill me?

1130
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,680
Then I found another method.

1131
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,400
Upgraded and modified it.

1132
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,000
I needed to get his hair...

1133
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,280
and stuff it into this doll's body.

1134
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,320
Then he would die on his own.

1135
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,080
So have you completed this ritual?

1136
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,040
No.

1137
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
I came here today

1138
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,640
just to get your hair.

1139
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,840
No way.

1140
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,920
Don't say anything more.

1141
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,000
Hand it over.

1142
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
Look at all these things he's saying

1143
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,280
It's all illusions, nothing real

1144
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,160
What do you mean illusions?

1145
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,760
Are you saying my Golden Throat was an illusion too?

1146
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,640
You want to kill because you saw visions

1147
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,080
The visions told you who did it

1148
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,480
So you believed them

1149
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,280
But Golden Throat really is dead

1150
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,040
Yes, dead

1151
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,200
But you don't actually know who did it

1152
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,680
You chose to believe your own hallucination

1153
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,440
I think it's you because you're always following us

1154
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,560
I have my own reasons for following you

1155
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,720
Doesn't matter

1156
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,120
You didn't even ask before trying to kill me

1157
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,880
Maybe it's because of what he did to Golden Throat

1158
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,840
That was too heartbreaking

1159
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,760
Wait, let me tell you about him

1160
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,400
I know so much about him

1161
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,760
What's with you...

1162
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,200
You're clearly insane today

1163
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,080
So now there's a fourth piece of evidence

1164
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,360
Found under the bed

1165
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,040
These "Healthy Energy Supplement Melon Seeds"

1166
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,400
They're just full of seeds

1167
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,080
Explain these seeds

1168
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,480
After Golden Throat left me

1169
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,000
I became completely depressed

1170
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,880
I could only rely on these energy seeds

1171
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,400
To replenish my energy

1172
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,800
Got seeds?

1173
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,120
You're kind of slumped over now

1174
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,720
Have some supplements

1175
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,200
Stand up straight, will you?

1176
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,560
I didn't have energy seeds today

1177
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,040
So I'm probably low on energy

1178
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,680
Eat up

1179
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,280
Here, replenish your energy

1180
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,440
Come on, everyone have some

1181
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,520
I recommend these energy seeds for everyone

1182
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,840
It will fill you with energy

1183
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,120
They really are melon seeds

1184
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,280
Genuine melon seeds

1185
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,200
How long have you been eating these?

1186
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,120
Energy melon seeds

1187
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,800
About over a month now

1188
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,200
The fifth piece of evidence was also found in his cabinet.

1189
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,800
A diagnosis report from the Cyber Psychiatric Hospital.

1190
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,720
Let's see what's written here.

1191
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,800
Okay

1192
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,640
It says here

1193
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,880
White Noise's admission date was

1194
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,960
May 1, 2036

1195
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,840
During lucid periods, he frequently reported having

1196
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,120
four marriages in his mind

1197
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,600
Five years ago at 35, he was extremely intelligent

1198
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,880
Originally very compatible with his highly-educated wife

1199
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,080
After one year of marriage

1200
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,360
his wife divorced him citing his lack of

1201
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,960
ability to be a proper househusband

1202
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,720
as the reason

1203
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,080
Three years ago at 35

1204
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,720
He became the perfect househusband

1205
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,560
Shortly after marriage

1206
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,840
his wife divorced him for failing to properly

1207
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,960
care for her father's surgery and infertility

1208
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,520
Two years ago at 35

1209
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,360
After one year of marriage, he gave his wife

1210
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,000
a pair of twins

1211
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,360
only to learn she married him

1212
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,120
just to use him for reproduction

1213
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,640
After divorce, she took the children and left

1214
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,240
The fourth marriage was this year at 35

1215
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,200
His wife had heavy work stress

1216
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,000
drank heavily long-term

1217
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,200
and was domestically violent toward him

1218
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,360
The diagnosis was:

1219
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,440
The patient has severe psychological trauma

1220
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,160
frequently experiencing bizarre hallucinations

1221
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,360
diagnosed with delusional disorder (cyber psychosis)

1222
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,600
with complications of intermittent amnesia

1223
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,240
often forgetting his patient status

1224
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,960
believing himself to be a perfect, dutiful househusband

1225
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,600
So you're sick

1226
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,520
You just spend all day imagining

1227
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,200
doing nothing at all

1228
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,600
You just lie there and start fantasizing

1229
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,400
But Golden Throat is real

1230
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,480
Is that my delusion too?

1231
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,520
Who would believe you?

1232
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,880
During lucid periods he reported

1233
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,960
these four marriages constantly in his mind

1234
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,680
When lucid

1235
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,720
meaning all four were real

1236
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,560
I think it's like this:

1237
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,200
He experienced these four marriages

1238
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,040
which caused his mental

1239
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,640
trauma to be too severe

1240
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,240
I'm not mentally ill.

1241
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,080
No, when he was lucid,

1242
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,000
was he still 35 years old every year?

1243
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,720
When lucid, he claimed to have had four marriages.

1244
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,880
35 years old five years ago,

1245
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,000
35 years old three years ago,

1246
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,040
35 years old two years ago,

1247
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,160
and still 35 this year.

1248
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,120
Experienced five marriages in one year.

1249
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,880
Four marriages.

1250
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,040
Right.

1251
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,360
Also became a father once.

1252
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:56,600
Yes.

1253
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,200
Had a child.

1254
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,840
Exactly.

1255
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,480
Okay, no problem, these are just points of suspicion.

1256
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
Yes, the note says:

1257
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,240
Surgical records archived in the 4th-floor medical records room.

1258
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,480
Doctor's signature: Pusher.

1259
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,320
There's an archive room on the 4th floor, right?

1260
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,320
We'll go check it out later.

1261
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,080
Okay.

1262
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,520
No,

1263
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,840
shouldn't you ask him directly about this?

1264
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,120
Do you have anything you want to confess?

1265
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,040
Facing this evidence,

1266
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,960
what is there to confess?

1267
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,120
I don't think this is about me.

1268
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,520
You fabricated this.

1269
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,520
Are you saying that

1270
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,640
the psychiatric diagnosis found in your room is fake?

1271
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,000
Yes.

1272
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,400
You deny all the information on it?

1273
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,120
Deny.

1274
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,400
Motive.

1275
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,880
Motive for killing Pusher?

1276
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,960
There's no motive.

1277
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,160
He had motive against Kexuejia.

1278
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,280
Kexuejia wants to kill you now, doesn't he?

1279
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,040
You can't kill me.

1280
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,080
Now let's have our Fang Esq.

1281
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,800
Is it my turn?

1282
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,440
Whose evidence is this?

1283
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,480
Keqin's evidence

1284
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,200
First is a phone by his pillow

1285
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,360
And inside it has

1286
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,440
a video of him talking to himself

1287
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,200
If you're seeing this video

1288
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,320
please tell me

1289
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,240
who the man in my phone's photo album is

1290
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,160
exactly

1291
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,040
It's obvious now

1292
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,560
He's none other than our

1293
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,040
Bai Sect

1294
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,760
He secretly took my photo

1295
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,960
Yes, he secretly took a photo of you

1296
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,880
Then another person responded to him

1297
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,600
It's Brother Bai

1298
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,480
Don't you know him?

1299
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,280
He's actually my brother-in-law

1300
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,600
Let me tell you, Brother Bai is who I admire most

1301
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,920
Besides my sister, he's

1302
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,440
the wisest person I know

1303
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,040
You love him

1304
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,080
not his wife

1305
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,040
What?

1306
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,480
So you asked my wife out

1307
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,280
to make her quit

1308
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,400
And when she wouldn't quit

1309
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,040
you cruelly killed her

1310
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,520
Are you even human?

1311
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,840
So that explains this look

1312
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,720
It all makes sense now

1313
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,960
On the poster

1314
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,160
He and my sister talked about stars, the moon

1315
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,800
love, ideals, relationships

1316
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,200
They were really good together

1317
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,560
But then my sister changed completely

1318
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
and he left her

1319
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,360
After that, because of this

1320
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,840
she completely lost faith in family

1321
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,040
You just hid away by yourself.

1322
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,320
Why didn't I know anything about this?

1323
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,280
This is related to that surgery I had.

1324
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,680
But honestly, at first

1325
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,440
I didn't want to sign for that surgery.

1326
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,080
But you'd understand me, right?

1327
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,600
Because you know

1328
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,480
this has always been my dream.

1329
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,120
Then why do you get to enjoy life

1330
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,360
while I have to keep working here for you?

1331
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,920
What do you mean?

1332
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,360
What surgery?

1333
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,680
What's your connection with

1334
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,720
Golden Throat and White Noise?

1335
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,480
That's quite a long story.

1336
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,040
Four years ago,

1337
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,360
back in 2032,

1338
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,360
I joined this company, Tuisai Bo,

1339
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,800
and started working there.

1340
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,080
Then four years later,

1341
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,280
starting in February 2036,

1342
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,480
I began getting distracted by something.

1343
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,640
It was when I saw White Noise.

1344
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,400
I saw him appear at my company.

1345
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,200
After seeing him,

1346
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,320
I started experiencing

1347
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,120
flashbacks.

1348
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,440
Memories of when he and I

1349
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,040
used to live together.

1350
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,160
What is this?

1351
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,360
They lived together.

1352
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,120
The scenes of you two living together.

1353
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,840
So the "Good Dad" surgery was for you two.

1354
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,880
No, it wasn't.

1355
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,680
Okay.

1356
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,800
They're generating static electricity.

1357
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,480
I feel like I've met this person before.

1358
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,840
Because these images keep flashing back to me,

1359
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,280
I began to suspect that within my body

1360
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,640
lives another person.

1361
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,080
So I started recording a video,

1362
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,760
thinking that if I had another

1363
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,200
personality,

1364
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,240
I might be able to use

1365
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,880
the videos recorded on this phone

1366
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
to communicate with my other personality.

1367
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,920
That's how

1368
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,480
the video you just saw came about.

1369
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,000
It's actually me

1370
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,640
conversing with my other personality.

1371
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,280
The man in my phone's photo album,

1372
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,160
who exactly is he?

1373
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,360
It's Brother Bai.

1374
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,440
Don't you know him?

1375
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,400
Through talking with him,

1376
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,880
I learned I had a sister named Keke.

1377
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,720
This sister of mine was with him,

1378
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,360
Keke.

1379
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,120
After being with him,

1380
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,080
one day my sister's personality changed drastically.

1381
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,720
My sister was someone who

1382
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,040
discussed ideals and work,

1383
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,960
but she became someone who needed

1384
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,240
her partner to be very family-oriented

1385
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,640
and to accompany her.

1386
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,800
But he was more of

1387
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,040
a workaholic who loved his job,

1388
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,160
so because of this,

1389
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,000
my sister separated from him.

1390
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,800
He couldn't handle being a househusband.

1391
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,680
That was actually their marriage five years ago,

1392
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,520
their first marriage.

1393
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,360
Let me see what else is in my phone

1394
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,720
Jinsangzi

1395
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,520
Hello Jinsangzi

1396
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,320
I'm your colleague Kexuejia

1397
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,040
I'd like to ask you about

1398
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,560
the recent business situation at the Doll House

1399
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,400
to help with targeted chip development

1400
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,960
Could we meet at 7pm

1401
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,520
at the nearby coffee shop?

1402
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,160
Speak

1403
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,920
Why are you asking my wife out?

1404
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,720
I contacted Jinsangzi because

1405
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,000
I wanted to investigate

1406
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,720
about my sister

1407
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,800
About why when I see you, I get

1408
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,040
images of my sister, me and him

1409
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,120
as a family of three

1410
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,320
I see

1411
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,560
So you followed him

1412
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,600
because you wanted to talk to him?

1413
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,520
Yes, so I needed to investigate

1414
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,920
why when I see this person

1415
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,160
these images appear

1416
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,760
So I thought

1417
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,600
since I can't contact

1418
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,120
Keke's sister

1419
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,040
I might be able to reach

1420
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,800
this Jinsangzi

1421
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,760
Because Jinsangzi and I

1422
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,320
work at the same company

1423
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,160
Did you know they're dating?

1424
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,280
I knew

1425
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,000
Because every day at the company

1426
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,800
when I saw him

1427
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,040
he was waiting for Jinsangzi to finish work

1428
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,720
But in my flashback memories

1429
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,240
my impression was

1430
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,120
when he was with my sister

1431
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,200
he was very work-focused

1432
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,440
and never particularly cared about

1433
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,320
spending time with his partner or family

1434
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,840
But now when I see him

1435
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,240
he's different

1436
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,480
Every day he waits for

1437
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,800
Jinsangzi to finish work

1438
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,440
Jinsangzi must be quite charming

1439
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,200
Yes, personal charm

1440
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,120
So your personality changed too

1441
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,320
His personality changed too

1442
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,520
I haven't changed

1443
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,160
But one time

1444
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,400
when you picked up the Golden Voice after work

1445
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,680
I even heard the Golden Voice scolding you

1446
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,640
Scolding me

1447
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,760
She said you're old, that your mind isn't sharp

1448
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,160
that your mouth doesn't work well either

1449
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,280
It's fine

1450
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,160
Hitting shows affection, scolding shows love

1451
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,680
It wasn't scolding, it was humiliation

1452
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,800
I enjoy being humiliated by her

1453
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,520
Alright

1454
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,160
So you're actually

1455
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,960
So when she humiliates you

1456
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,200
you still feel it's wonderful, right?

1457
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,800
Exactly, I just love her

1458
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,400
That explains it

1459
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,600
He transforms bad things

1460
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,480
into good things in his mind

1461
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,720
Because he's been traumatized

1462
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,600
If that diagnosis was correct

1463
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,200
then it's actually delusional disorder

1464
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,320
What about your surgery?

1465
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,680
This is related to the surgery I had

1466
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,640
The surgical video mentioned it too

1467
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,240
It was a surgery I really didn't want

1468
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,120
But because I wanted to stay at that company

1469
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:29,880
and keep working

1470
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,560
The condition for working there was

1471
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,680
I had to undergo this surgery

1472
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,440
Only then could I keep my job

1473
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,840
This surgery was called

1474
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,600
a brain-machine separation procedure

1475
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,960
It splits your consciousness

1476
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,240
into two distinct personalities

1477
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,600
I see

1478
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,560
So that means

1479
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,080
why I have conversations

1480
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,360
with my two personalities

1481
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,640
One is my work personality

1482
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,760
and the other is my life personality

1483
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,880
They were forcibly separated

1484
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,440
after this surgery

1485
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,680
All these years, the life I've lived

1486
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,080
has been my work personality

1487
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
The next evidence is a photo frame

1488
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,800
This frame will be kept until

1489
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,720
the day I meet the Golden Voice

1490
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,680
This is you

1491
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,320
This is you, right?

1492
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,240
Speak. Explain yourself.

1493
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,200
I invited this "Golden Voice" out

1494
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,680
to investigate matters about you (and Sis Li)

1495
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,360
She showed up as agreed

1496
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,320
and came to this café

1497
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,920
We sat together drinking coffee

1498
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,280
Since she'd already come to meet me

1499
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:33,960
I thought the two of us

1500
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,680
could at least discuss things properly

1501
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,200
But her tone with me

1502
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,400
was just like when he spoke to me

1503
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,080
outside the company building

1504
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,000
She told me to stay away

1505
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,760
from their lives

1506
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,640
told me to get lost

1507
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,120
and so on

1508
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,160
After saying this

1509
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,240
she stood up to leave

1510
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,840
and paid the bill

1511
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,200
Out of politeness, I thought

1512
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,360
I couldn't let my ex-brother-in-law's current wife

1513
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,600
pay for my coffee

1514
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,440
What?

1515
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,280
So I chased after her

1516
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,600
to split the bill with her

1517
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,040
But as I followed her out

1518
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,760
I realized...

1519
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,680
Someone is following her

1520
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,320
I followed her

1521
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,240
Because I saw

1522
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,320
her holding a brick and following her

1523
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,760
So I immediately sensed something was wrong

1524
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,200
I immediately took out my phone

1525
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,600
and took this photo

1526
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,680
Okay

1527
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,320
After taking this photo

1528
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,480
I witnessed what happened next

1529
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,880
I'm going to tell you something terrifying

1530
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,120
Babi killed her with that brick

1531
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,440
Splattering blood all over himself

1532
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,160
Then after killing her

1533
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,720
He pulled out a doll

1534
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,040
So it was you who killed Jin Sangzi

1535
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,480
Then I realized something was wrong

1536
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,160
So I ran

1537
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:00,920
I ran away immediately

1538
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,080
But on the way back, I thought

1539
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,840
I'm saying this

1540
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,120
this thing that kills people and takes dolls

1541
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,240
is very similar to

1542
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,680
first killing victims with a brick

1543
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,040
then hiding the bodies inside

1544
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,400
large doll figures

1545
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,080
very similar to

1546
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,640
the Doll Butcher

1547
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,480
But I was too scared

1548
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,720
I ran away before finishing it

1549
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:23,920
Okay

1550
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,040
Evidence three

1551
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,000
Tui Town Daily

1552
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,400
Tui Town's foremost AI leader

1553
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,760
owner of Tui Cyber Technology

1554
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,320
Baba died yesterday in a car accident

1555
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,440
passed away unexpectedly

1556
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,600
Baba drank a special health-boosting tea

1557
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,280
that couldn't be replicated by anyone else

1558
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,080
Her father developed a certain medicine

1559
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,480
Right.

1560
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,400
It can strengthen the body.

1561
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,440
A type of tea.

1562
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,280
This tea was exclusively for her father.

1563
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,320
This "Ba Dad" is her father.

1564
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,040
He was our company's boss.

1565
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,760
He was also the one who forced me

1566
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,280
to sign the agreement for that brain-machine

1567
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,120
separation

1568
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,920
surgery.

1569
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,120
He set this rule.

1570
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,080
And we were colleagues,

1571
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,400
at the company she was actually

1572
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,600
a very lovely girl.

1573
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,400
After I saw her kill someone that day,

1574
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,320
I felt she was acting strange when I got back.

1575
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,640
Then it occurred to me

1576
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,600
that it might be related to her surgery.

1577
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,760
So I thought at the time,

1578
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,120
who could be connected

1579
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:20,920
to this surgery?

1580
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,160
It was Ba Dad.

1581
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,880
So I wanted to investigate Ba Dad.

1582
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,680
But when I went to find Ba Dad,

1583
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,480
I discovered he was already dead.

1584
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,320
After his death,

1585
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,520
while observing Baby,

1586
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,520
I noticed she'd recently become obsessed with drinking tea.

1587
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,720
The one you—

1588
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,120
that special tea

1589
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,640
you drink.

1590
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,840
It's exactly the same

1591
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,000
as what her father used to drink.

1592
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,240
The recipe is identical,

1593
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,560
the method is the same,

1594
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,320
even their mannerisms while drinking match perfectly.

1595
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,240
So I started wondering,

1596
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,600
is it possible that Ba Dad

1597
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,280
is still alive

1598
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,320
inside her body?

1599
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,960
Isn't that my dad?

1600
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,680
What's wrong with resembling him?

1601
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,840
But this tea is

1602
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,800
specially provided by Dad Ba

1603
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,720
Exactly

1604
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,760
Custom tea for specific people

1605
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,760
I'm his daughter after all

1606
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,680
Shouldn't I inherit this?

1607
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,440
So I either need to find her

1608
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,720
and ask for a solution

1609
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,760
Or else

1610
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,320
Take out who?

1611
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,360
You want to eliminate her?

1612
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,840
Eliminating her means eliminating Dad Ba

1613
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,840
You saw her kill someone

1614
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,840
and ran away scared

1615
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,640
without looking back

1616
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,120
Now you're volunteering

1617
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,000
Look at you being all tough

1618
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,200
Why did you want to kill him (Ba's dad)?

1619
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,280
Because he forced me to undergo that surgery.

1620
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,640
So it's confirmed then.

1621
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,160
Your father is now in your mind.

1622
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,160
You are now Ba's dad.

1623
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,760
Stop pretending already.

1624
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,760
Call me daddy.

1625
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,000
There's no difference between the two.

1626
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,720
Ba's dad and daddy.

1627
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,440
What's the difference?

1628
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,960
So it's the same person, right?

1629
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,080
Ba's dad and baby.

1630
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,400
Find my evidence first, then talk.

1631
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,680
Fine, there's another clue.

1632
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,680
His medical report.

1633
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,920
Patient name: Ke Xuejia.

1634
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,920
Admission date: May 1, 2036.

1635
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,640
During lucid periods, the patient reported.

1636
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,640
That after seeing familiar people in daily life.

1637
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,800
His work personality began awakening.

1638
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,200
The patient stated.

1639
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,920
He had undergone brain-machine separation surgery.

1640
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,280
But the regular switching between.

1641
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,160
Life personality and work personality.

1642
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,640
Became disordered.

1643
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,440
Diagnosis result.

1644
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,920
Patient diagnosed with cyber mental disorder.

1645
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,240
Personality dissociation.

1646
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,160
I don't have personality dissociation.

1647
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,400
I underwent that surgery.

1648
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,360
Hospital observation records.

1649
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,680
Developed complication: intermittent amnesia.

1650
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,920
Both of them have this issue.

1651
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,120
Note: Surgical records archived in 4th floor medical records room.

1652
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,520
So in summary.

1653
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,280
You need to believe this surgery happened.

1654
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,480
There's no personality dissociation.

1655
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,800
No, I think there is.

1656
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,800
Because you did undergo surgery.

1657
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,120
It's this archive room on the fourth floor.

1658
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,040
There must be some records.

1659
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,600
We'll confirm once we get there.

1660
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,240
We'll check it out later.

1661
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,600
Right now, he has no motive

1662
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,480
to kill the instigator.

1663
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,360
But he does have a motive to kill Xiao Ba.

1664
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,920
He wants to kill me, I want to kill her.

1665
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,320
Present your evidence and share it with everyone.

1666
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,360
It's my turn now.

1667
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,840
Babi.

1668
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,000
Babi's evidence.

1669
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,480
There is a doll.

1670
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,920
On the back of this doll.

1671
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,520
It's been stabbed repeatedly with a knife.

1672
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,240
It feels like a cursed doll.

1673
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,680
Do you have anything to say?

1674
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,040
Here's the thing.

1675
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,160
These were some small toys.

1676
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,320
That my father gave me.

1677
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,600
But later, I felt that in my heart.

1678
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,440
There were some things.

1679
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,240
That couldn't be vented.

1680
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,520
Just through these toys.

1681
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,560
So I made this.

1682
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,160
A small puppet resembling my father.

1683
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,560
To vent the anger in my heart.

1684
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,720
So you're angry at your father?

1685
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,480
Yes.

1686
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,920
What's the next piece of evidence?

1687
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,320
There are some words inside this umbrella.

1688
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,680
"When the rain stops, the sun will appear."

1689
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,760
"Don't worry, no one will dare to bully you anymore."

1690
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,480
What does this mean?

1691
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,840
This umbrella is like this.

1692
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,440
I made all of this by hand.

1693
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,160
It represents some of my.

1694
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,240
Childhood shadows.

1695
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,000
Or some particularly bad memories.

1696
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,240
That's why it's black.

1697
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,040
I need to tell my story from the beginning.

1698
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,440
My father is called Ba.

1699
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,120
I lost my mother when I was little.

1700
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,000
She passed away.

1701
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,480
My father gave me lots of love.

1702
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,320
But sometimes this love

1703
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,600
was a form of control.

1704
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,760
Sometimes it was

1705
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,160
something rather twisted.

1706
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,760
He demanded I follow his arrangements

1707
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,640
for living, working, even eating.

1708
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,680
Everything had to be done his way.

1709
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,440
If I didn't obey,

1710
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,040
he would punish me.

1711
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,480
These experiences left me with

1712
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,200
many childhood shadows.

1713
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,200
When I grew up,

1714
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,320
I wanted to help

1715
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,840
others who had similar childhoods.

1716
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,440
So I would give them

1717
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,400
an umbrella like this.

1718
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,240
After rain comes sunshine.

1719
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,920
Why an umbrella?

1720
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,120
Because I wished someone

1721
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,680
had sheltered me during storms.

1722
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,840
Given me an umbrella.

1723
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,280
But no one ever did.

1724
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,640
So when I grew up,

1725
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,840
I gave an umbrella to every

1726
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,440
person I met who was

1727
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,640
being controlled and manipulated.

1728
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,960
I gave them an umbrella.

1729
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,640
Then why is there one still hanging on the umbrella

1730
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,760
this string of bones

1731
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,520
This bone necklace has characters carved on it.

1732
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,280
Zhou's father - October 10, 2035

1733
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,760
Qian's mother - November 1, 2035

1734
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,560
Sun's father - December 17, 2035

1735
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,720
Golden Throat - April 2, 2036

1736
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,880
Tui Town was shattered by a series of horrific murders

1737
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,160
that completely destroyed its peace.

1738
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,040
The first victim in 2035 was someone named Zhou

1739
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,000
shocking the entire town.

1740
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,040
A serial killer

1741
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,440
The Doll Butcher severed index fingers

1742
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,520
These are their index finger bones, right?

1743
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,440
I wasn't mistaken.

1744
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,200
It's a little hobby of mine

1745
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,360
I really enjoy cutting off people's fingers

1746
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,400
and making them into necklaces.

1747
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,600
Why do I have such a hobby

1748
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,440
It goes back to

1749
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,760
what I mentioned earlier about my childhood

1750
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,000
some traumatic experiences

1751
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,640
My father would punish me

1752
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,240
if I didn’t follow his orders

1753
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,200
How he punished me

1754
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,920
was by using a rubber band

1755
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,920
to snap

1756
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,400
snap it against my body

1757
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,720
Snapping the rubber band

1758
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,120
could both hurt me

1759
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,080
make me suffer and teach me a lesson

1760
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,960
without leaving any visible marks

1761
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,360
So the people I mentioned earlier

1762
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,680
are just like my father

1763
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,680
That’s why I cut off their index finger’s

1764
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,720
first joint

1765
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,400
Okay, next

1766
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,280
If he's dead, just let me be

1767
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,320
This was October 8, 2035

1768
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,200
The hospital informed me that

1769
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,840
my father had been in a car accident

1770
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,920
To be honest, I was happy

1771
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,320
That this person had finally left this world

1772
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,800
So I thought I could start

1773
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,320
a new life

1774
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,640
Finally no one would

1775
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,720
control me with his twisted love anymore

1776
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,480
But gradually I noticed many

1777
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,880
very strange things

1778
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,440
Like the tea mentioned earlier

1779
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,240
This was something unique to my father

1780
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,600
After his death

1781
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,680
I never touched that tea

1782
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,360
But gradually the tea

1783
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,800
was decreasing in quantity

1784
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,360
I didn't drink it

1785
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,480
And there was no one else in the house but me

1786
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,600
Besides the disappearing tea

1787
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,120
I could hear my father's voice

1788
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,200
I felt he was still present in my life

1789
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,400
Invisibly controlling me

1790
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,560
This terrified me

1791
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,480
So I

1792
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,520
burned some things

1793
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,160
Yes, so I burned this item

1794
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,040
This evidence is crucial

1795
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,680
First photo

1796
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,880
On a laptop

1797
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,640
Special service time is coming soon

1798
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,360
The next one shows

1799
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,920
a man with three children

1800
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,240
You

1801
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,440
Let me explain the origin of this evidence.

1802
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,480
As I mentioned earlier, after burning the paper offerings,

1803
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,360
I felt very depressed.

1804
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,680
So I decided to go out to clear my mind.

1805
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,720
While I was out,

1806
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,960
I saw a man.

1807
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,200
In the rainy night,

1808
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,640
he was scolding his child.

1809
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,560
And also hurting his child.

1810
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,480
Suddenly I felt

1811
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,960
like I was seeing my childhood self.

1812
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,640
This child was being hurt,

1813
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,320
so I killed that man.

1814
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,160
Who was this person?

1815
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:04,840
Zhou's father.

1816
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:05,880
The first one.

1817
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,440
This incident made me feel

1818
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,040
I was doing something very right.

1819
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,600
Because such parents shouldn't exist.

1820
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,680
That's your child you're hurting.

1821
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,320
So I started paying attention to

1822
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,560
this kind of incidents.

1823
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,080
Then one day, unintentionally,

1824
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,720
I saw Heli.

1825
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,880
He was livestreaming.

1826
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,520
I could hear in his livestream background

1827
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,040
children crying.

1828
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,400
I felt I needed to investigate this person.

1829
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,040
I was in the building across from you,

1830
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,000
and saw what was happening in your home.

1831
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,520
And I took photos of it.

1832
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,320
The first photo shows him

1833
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,160
using rubber bands to snap at those children.

1834
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,600
These three children should be his

1835
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,680
younger siblings.

1836
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,680
Are they siblings or his children?

1837
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,160
I have younger siblings.

1838
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,160
He didn't fulfill

1839
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,360
the responsibilities of an elder brother.

1840
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,040
Instead, he abused them.

1841
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,040
The second photo shows on the computer

1842
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,360
that "special service will begin soon."

1843
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,000
Besides abusing children,

1844
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,960
he would also livestream this

1845
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,640
for certain special audiences to watch.

1846
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,560
So I decided

1847
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
to follow him

1848
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,720
and find an opportunity to strike

1849
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,880
That's why I kept following him

1850
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,840
which explains these two photos

1851
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,440
Alright

1852
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,360
Quick, now's our chance

1853
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,200
Let's "take him out"

1854
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,640
It's fine, we can pretend we didn't see it

1855
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,480
Let's move to the next piece of evidence

1856
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,600
The last one

1857
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,480
I'll do it

1858
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,240
Right

1859
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,040
Let me read it out

1860
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,920
Patient name: Babi

1861
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,840
Admission date: April 30th

1862
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,480
During lucid periods, the patient reported

1863
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,720
that since Baba's death

1864
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,480
Baba would often appear in his mind

1865
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,840
having conversations with himself

1866
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,080
This led to losing control of

1867
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,280
his emotions and behavior

1868
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,840
Frequently developing extreme thoughts

1869
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,640
Diagnosis:

1870
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,520
The patient suffers from

1871
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,440
Cyberpsychosis with

1872
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,240
antisocial personality disorder

1873
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,200
also instigated by external factors

1874
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,120
Antisocial personality

1875
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,480
Antisocial personality disorder

1876
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,480
None

1877
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,640
Let me sort this out first.

1878
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,160
The money matches up, right?

1879
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,560
Qian, Sun, and Zhou are all accounted for.

1880
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,960
There's one named Xiang currently missing.

1881
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,960
So I want to ask about that person surnamed Xiang.

1882
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,200
Did you kill them too?

1883
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,400
No.

1884
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,880
Then someone's copying you.

1885
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,280
Copying your killings.

1886
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,440
You only have these four people's bones.

1887
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:03,600
Right?

1888
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,280
That's all.

1889
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,640
You only have these four people's bones.

1890
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,440
Yes, these four are the only ones I killed.

1891
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,040
Only killed four people, but...

1892
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,680
Someone among them is copying her crimes.

1893
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,200
Yes, that's right.

1894
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,040
Okay.

1895
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,040
Right now,

1896
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,440
you want to kill him.

1897
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,560
You want to kill him, he wants to kill him.

1898
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,400
Then each of us wants to kill the others.

1899
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,560
So the logic is,

1900
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,560
you want to kill him now, right?

1901
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,880
Alright, let me hear your story.

1902
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:40,760
Who took his?

1903
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,240
Me, I took his.

1904
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,880
Your first piece of evidence.

1905
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,640
This photo.

1906
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,360
You and three children.

1907
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,560
And who is this?

1908
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,640
These are my parents.

1909
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,440
These are your parents?

1910
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,360
These are my parents.

1911
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,360
My father is Hedinhong.

1912
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,360
My mother is Jinsique.

1913
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,560
Remember?

1914
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:04,480
I remember.

1915
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,160
Our family had six members.

1916
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,400
Me, my twin brother,

1917
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,440
and a younger sister.

1918
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,920
Actually, we used to be

1919
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,840
a very happy family.

1920
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,000
Our parents deeply loved each other.

1921
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,520
But later,

1922
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,800
my parents...

1923
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,880
had a car accident.

1924
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,680
I was 17 at the time.

1925
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,040
After that, I had no choice but to

1926
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,040
make a living,

1927
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,160
so I looked for work.

1928
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,360
I could only do things like livestreaming

1929
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,640
and silly performances.

1930
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,480
Not many people watched me,

1931
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,600
and couldn't earn enough money - that was the main problem.

1932
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,760
Life became increasingly difficult.

1933
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,920
That's how things were.

1934
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,800
His livestream was like this:

1935
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,520
He

1936
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,480
did competitive eating shows,

1937
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,120
eating chicken legs for 15 hours straight,

1938
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,680
dressed as a merman,

1939
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,760
deep diving into the Wukenai River.

1940
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,840
Haunted House Adventure: Catching Ghosts Barehanded

1941
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,280
Three Days and Nights Singing "The Song of Tui Zhen"

1942
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,080
Taking a bath in 502 glue

1943
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,360
Taking a bath in 502 glue

1944
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,800
The content of your broadcasts

1945
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,240
We've never seen anything like this in our lives

1946
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,040
You should at least demonstrate one

1947
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,680
No, the current me is

1948
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,880
different from before

1949
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,480
I won't do these things anymore

1950
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,680
The second piece of evidence

1951
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,080
Found in your bedside drawer

1952
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,520
Flaw concealer

1953
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,480
What is this?

1954
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,440
Concealer

1955
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,800
Yes, all three bottles are concealer

1956
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,640
As I just mentioned

1957
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,160
I couldn't keep doing these silly livestreams

1958
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,520
But suddenly one day

1959
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,520
A top donor came to my stream

1960
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,080
He spent in one day what I might earn in years

1961
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,720
Then sent me a private message

1962
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,400
Saying

1963
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,320
"Come to me to make a deal"

1964
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,840
"I'll make sure your streams thrive"

1965
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:24,960
Right

1966
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,160
So I went

1967
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,560
That person was

1968
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,360
Ba Ba

1969
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,200
Because of the money

1970
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,080
I signed this agreement with him

1971
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,720
He said during my streams

1972
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,280
I'd provide some special services

1973
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:41,880
What I knew was

1974
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,920
I'd still stream normally every day

1975
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,280
But the earnings

1976
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,920
Were over 100 times more than before

1977
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,640
So my life kept getting better

1978
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,480
At first I thought nothing of it

1979
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,440
But later I gradually realized

1980
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,480
These special services

1981
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,720
Had negative consequences for me

1982
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,120
I increasingly noticed that I

1983
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,120
Was becoming somewhat perverted

1984
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,960
I fell in love with that feeling of...

1985
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,360
self-harm.

1986
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,920
Then this condition kept getting worse...

1987
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,680
worse and worse.

1988
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,400
So I bought concealer...

1989
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,960
to cover up the many self-harm marks on my body.

1990
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,680
So about that "special service"...

1991
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,840
can you talk about it now?

1992
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:29,840
I genuinely don't know.

1993
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,280
As far as I'm aware...

1994
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,760
I just do my normal daily livestreams as usual.

1995
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,120
There's one possibility like this

1996
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:42,680
He did it

1997
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,600
He signed that agreement

1998
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,920
Actually underwent a surgery

1999
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,400
Right

2000
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,000
Then during the livestream

2001
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,760
It wasn’t really him anymore

2002
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,040
Because of the work persona

2003
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,040
He was acting out self-harm as part of the job

2004
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:54,800
That’s possible

2005
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:55,720
Yes, your theory—

2006
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,560
Right, you currently don’t realize

2007
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,600
He has amnesia—intermittent amnesia

2008
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,360
Your third piece of evidence

2009
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,160
Whose finger?

2010
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,800
Towards Quiet's finger

2011
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,640
Okay

2012
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,080
Why did you copy her modus operandi?

2013
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,440
Yes, I just mentioned my self-harm behavior

2014
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,560
was becoming increasingly extreme

2015
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,520
until eventually

2016
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,600
even more severe symptoms appeared

2017
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,960
One day

2018
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,120
when I regained consciousness

2019
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,200
I found myself standing on the street

2020
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,760
holding a brick

2021
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,120
with a woman I'd apparently bludgeoned to death before me

2022
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:42,920
in her thirties

2023
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,400
Her ID badge showed she was

2024
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,160
Xiang Jingjing, core researcher at Tui Cyber

2025
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,560
She died right in front of me

2026
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,640
I panicked in that moment

2027
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,360
because I didn't understand

2028
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,240
how I could have killed her

2029
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,440
or why I was there

2030
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,880
So when I saw this scene

2031
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,040
I immediately ran home

2032
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,040
After returning home

2033
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,880
I saw news reports about

2034
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,600
the Doll Butcher

2035
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,400
and suddenly realized

2036
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,200
I could use this killer's methods

2037
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,720
You wanted to frame me

2038
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,240
So I went back

2039
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,880
stuffed her into a teddy bear

2040
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,880
cut off her fingers

2041
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,720
and brought them home

2042
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,440
Alright

2043
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,600
Now your fourth piece of evidence is

2044
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,880
an envelope from "Tui Investigative Agency"

2045
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,400
You asked us to find the person in the photo

2046
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,200
We've located him for you

2047
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,360
This photograph

2048
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,320
His surname was Bai

2049
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,000
but he died eighteen years ago

2050
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,240
It's just Bai

2051
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,440
But you've been dead for eighteen years

2052
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,080
So you are

2053
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,160
I copied her modus operandi

2054
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,520
After bringing her finger back

2055
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,400
I suddenly realized

2056
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,720
my necklace

2057
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,280
was left at the crime scene

2058
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,880
When I went back

2059
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,800
I discovered

2060
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,320
there was someone

2061
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,560
A man like him

2062
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,720
was at the scene

2063
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,920
and took my belongings

2064
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,320
putting them in his bag

2065
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,400
But I didn't dare approach

2066
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,360
because I feared exposing myself

2067
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,560
So I took a photo

2068
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,000
I was terrified he might reveal this secret

2069
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:22,760
to others

2070
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,640
You claimed you found Bai

2071
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,160
near Xiang Jingjing's corpse

2072
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:29,840
Wait, no

2073
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,040
Xiang Jingjing was already stuffed inside that bear

2074
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,000
stuffed animal

2075
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,600
I don't know if he saw the body

2076
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,360
But he was within the area

2077
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,680
where I committed the murder

2078
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,600
and picked up my necklace

2079
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,440
This means Xiang Jingjing and Jin

2080
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,920
died at the same location

2081
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,600
No, no

2082
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,080
You're not

2083
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,280
He just happened to be passing by that day

2084
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,880
Xiang Jingjing's necklace fell to the ground

2085
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,160
which he happened to see

2086
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,240
He's always been honest since childhood

2087
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,200
But this time he kept it

2088
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,400
He kept it, right then

2089
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,440
Yes, was about to

2090
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,080
take it to the police

2091
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,960
Right, then went to a detective

2092
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:00,880
The detective said

2093
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,840
"Are you mocking me?"

2094
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,080
"This person died eighteen years ago

2095
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,040
Why look for them now?"

2096
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,680
"How could you have seen him?"

2097
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,920
This makes me think it explains

2098
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,000
his being 35 for five years

2099
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,240
three years at age 35

2100
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,760
It seems

2101
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,240
he might not be human

2102
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,560
So he must be yesterday's

2103
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,480
neural interface case

2104
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,240
He likely has an implanted consciousness

2105
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,360
So what I'm saying is...

2106
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,280
Actually, it's not about killing that so-called...

2107
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,080
instigator.

2108
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,120
I'm not saying you killed the instigator.

2109
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,280
You want to kill Bai?

2110
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:33,640
Right.

2111
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,160
But we both have motives to kill each other.

2112
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,800
He doesn't want to kill me either.

2113
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,120
He just wants to retrieve the necklace and ring.

2114
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,640
I want to mess with you.

2115
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:41,760
Not kill you.

2116
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,240
Would you really kill someone just to get a necklace back?

2117
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,560
You have dirt on me.

2118
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,320
Maybe you know about his murders?

2119
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,560
Who knew those were yours?

2120
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,040
Aren't you overthinking this?

2121
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,160
Alright, never mind.

2122
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:50,880
What's next?

2123
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,280
Medical report.

2124
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,760
Patient name: Heli.

2125
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,720
Admission date: May 2, 2036.

2126
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,880
Patient self-reported while conscious:

2127
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,120
From long-term extreme experience substitution for others,

2128
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,240
developed an obsessive craving for pain,

2129
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,840
frequently self-harming.

2130
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,720
Diagnosis:

2131
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:12,080
Patient suffers from cyber-psychosis,

2132
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,600
specifically self-abusive personality disorder.

2133
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,520
Signed by doctor: Instigator.

2134
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,840
He's just a self-harmer.

2135
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,960
This delusion,

2136
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,120
split personality,

2137
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,360
violent tendencies,

2138
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,640
self-harm.

2139
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,920
Currently, none of you four have a motive to kill the Pusher.

2140
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,160
(Continuation of above line)

2141
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,840
But you might have motives to kill each other.

2142
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,360
We just identified one murderer.

2143
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,360
You could be one too.

2144
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:43,600
Me too.

2145
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,160
Didn't you kill Xiang (Jingjing)?

2146
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,600
Honestly.

2147
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,920
That's where we should go.

2148
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,120
The fourth-floor archives room?

2149
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:55,800
Exactly.

2150
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,480
Surgical records are archived in the fourth-floor medical records room.

2151
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,440
Fourth-floor medical records room.

2152
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,400
Medical records room.

2153
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,200
You all claim you're not mentally ill.

2154
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:05,760
Right?

2155
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,080
But here's the logic:

2156
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,760
The Pusher says you're mentally ill.

2157
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,840
And the symptoms he described match.

2158
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,680
The most remarkable is the intermittent amnesia.

2159
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,520
Every one of you has that intermittent amnesia.

2160
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,200
Amnesia.

2161
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,040
White noise.

2162
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,360
Causing complications of intermittent amnesia.

2163
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,720
Patient name: Ke Xuejia.

2164
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:28,320
Causing complications of intermittent amnesia.

2165
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,760
Patient name: Babi.

2166
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,240
Has intermittent amnesia.

2167
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,600
Patient name: Heli.

2168
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,360
Causing complications of intermittent amnesia.

2169
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,720
This case is quite complicated.

2170
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,360
If all four have it.

2171
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,360
Then the diagnosis seems genuine.

2172
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,680
I believe the diagnosis is authentic.

2173
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,760
That's undeniable.

2174
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:47,680
But what about you?

2175
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,760
Are you truly mentally ill?

2176
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,040
Or did the surgery make you this way?

2177
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,000
We can't know.

2178
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,480
Because you've all lost your memories.

2179
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:56,160
Right.

2180
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,560
Based on the current known clues,

2181
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,920
can we deduce his cause of death?

2182
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,400
The cause of the Pusher's death

2183
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,800
For example,

2184
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,080
you all have intermittent amnesia

2185
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,560
or suffer from some condition.

2186
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,840
Did he also have an episode at that time?

2187
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,760
Then through some remote control method

2188
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,000
triggered his episode?

2189
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,720
Yes, that would be the modus operandi.

2190
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,600
What we were just discussing should be

2191
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,680
that all four of us

2192
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,720
were diagnosed with mental illness, right?

2193
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,200
Right.

2194
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,160
So isn't it possible that all four of us

2195
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,680
might have

2196
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,200
not wanted to stay in this mental hospital,

2197
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,040
thus developing a motive

2198
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,520
to kill the Pusher?

2199
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,080
Right? That's the logic.

2200
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:37,640
Exactly.

2201
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,680
All four of us were

2202
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,000
in his office area

2203
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,920
when he diagnosed us with mental illness.

2204
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,560
So killing him would allow us to

2205
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,560
remove the label of being

2206
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,360
mentally ill

2207
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,800
Therefore, this becomes our

2208
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,040
motive for murder

2209
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,560
My father is the director of this place

2210
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,280
Boss

2211
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:57,960
Exactly

2212
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,360
So how could I become a mental patient

2213
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,680
living inside here?

2214
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,160
Now proceeding with X confirmation process

2215
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,480
X

2216
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:15,960
Take care on your way out

2217
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,080
This is as far as I can help you

2218
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,760
From now on, I'll have to play the villain

2219
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,560
Take care on your way

2220
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,960
Okay

2221
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,400
You're really so stupid

2222
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:23,800
So you are X

2223
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,000
Yes, he is

2224
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,640
He's causing trouble again

2225
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,960
You're stirring things up again

2226
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,360
So you're X then

2227
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,520
I'm not

2228
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,320
Let's go

2229
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,520
Princess, please come in

2230
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,360
Go

2231
01:30:59,360 --> 01:30:59,840
in

2232
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,000
There shouldn't be anything

2233
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,080
left to search here.

2234
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,840
No need to search anymore

2235
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:05,320
Here's what I'll do

2236
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,000
I'll take you to the fifth floor

2237
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,080
Let's go take a look

2238
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,560
at the dean's office

2239
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:10,000
Alright?

2240
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,320
Okay

2241
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:10,680
Come on

2242
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,840
Dean...

2243
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,640
My god

2244
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,680
No way

2245
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,120
How did the dean die here?

2246
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,480
You just found out

2247
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:33,080
No, how could you take a patient outside

2248
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,360
No, I brought it back, didn't I?

2249
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,040
Never mind.

2250
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,960
I remembered something important.

2251
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:38,280
Go ahead.

2252
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,000
Take note of this.

2253
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,760
What is it?

2254
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,720
At 9 PM tonight,

2255
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,520
I was on duty on the second floor.

2256
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,360
I saw the director return.

2257
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,640
First, he checked on the patients on the second floor,

2258
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,080
then went back to his office on the fifth floor.

2259
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,320
Hey, come here for a second.

2260
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:56,640
What is it?

2261
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,520
At 9:50 PM,

2262
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,600
Loudly scheming...

2263
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,680
But your voice...

2264
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,160
I can't hear.

2265
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:06,800
What?

2266
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,320
At 9:50 PM...

2267
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,240
He Li entered the elevator.

2268
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,320
He.

2269
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,880
Three minutes later, Bai Zaoyin entered the elevator.

2270
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:16,240
Bai.

2271
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,160
At 56 minutes, Ke Xuejia entered the elevator.

2272
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:20,520
Ke.

2273
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,640
At 59 minutes,

2274
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,880
Babi entered the elevator.

2275
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,800
Okay.

2276
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,320
After they entered the elevator,

2277
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,800
the elevator stopped at the fifth floor.

2278
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,600
Those four are highly suspicious.

2279
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,880
You must investigate them.

2280
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:32,880
Okay, don’t worry.

2281
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,680
What is this thing?

2282
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,400
This belongs to the dean’s office.

2283
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,520
If you pass by the fifth floor later,

2284
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,960
please put it near

2285
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,560
the dean’s office desk,

2286
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,800
close to the middle drawer.

2287
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,040
Okay, no problem.

2288
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,960
Don’t trust their words too easily.

2289
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:48,680
Of course.

2290
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,840
Those guys are definitely shady.

2291
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,880
I'll head back to work now.

2292
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,880
I'll increase your dosage next time.

2293
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,600
Okay.

2294
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,720
Alright, now...

2295
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,840
We've obtained a known lead.

2296
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,200
At 9:50 PM,

2297
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,320
each of you came here separately.

2298
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,720
Do you remember? First,

2299
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:04,600
Of course not.

2300
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,680
Don't remember.

2301
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,360
Really don't remember.

2302
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,400
My memory starts from inside the elevator.

2303
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,200
My memory also starts from

2304
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,400
when the elevator doors opened.

2305
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,600
What do you mean "elevator doors"?

2306
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,720
Meaning all our memories

2307
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,200
only began after we got off.

2308
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,040
Right.

2309
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,760
That moment when we

2310
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,120
first saw each other

2311
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,360
was the start of today's memories.

2312
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,440
Exactly.

2313
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:21,960
Alright.

2314
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,240
This means in those 12 hours

2315
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,520
before we met,

2316
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,600
we were experiencing

2317
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,240
that so-called temporary amnesia.

2318
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,040
But look, for example you were

2319
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,160
the first to enter at 9:50.

2320
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,680
If he was drugged,

2321
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,480
he'd only be unconscious

2322
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,840
for three minutes.

2323
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,480
That can't be right.

2324
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,320
So now all four of you

2325
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,920
have black marks behind your ears,

2326
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,640
proving you all entered

2327
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,680
the studio and were indeed drugged.

2328
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,360
You were drugged between

2329
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,640
9:50 PM and 10:00 PM.

2330
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,560
As for what happened after entering,

2331
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,640
we don't know that.

2332
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,920
If one person wasn't drugged...

2333
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,840
Impossible.

2334
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,160
Because we all have marks on our ears.

2335
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:03,440
Everyone has black marks.

2336
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,040
Right.

2337
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,600
Because there are several suspicious points about him.

2338
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,880
After he went in, the Bai Sect entered.

2339
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,040
Which means when the Bai Sect entered,

2340
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,280
if he was inside,

2341
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,280
that would be a different scenario.

2342
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,160
So there's a possibility that

2343
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,560
all four of you were present.

2344
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,640
Alright, the four of us

2345
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,840
joined forces to kill him.

2346
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,160
Exactly.

2347
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,640
Or right after entering,

2348
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,480
you all passed out.

2349
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,000
You were all unconscious.

2350
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,560
All possibilities exist.

2351
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,560
It's also possible...

2352
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,880
No, there are many possibilities.

2353
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,600
Because none of us remember

2354
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,880
what happened during that time.

2355
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,560
Three minutes.

2356
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,200
Yes, those three minutes -

2357
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,280
what each of us was doing.

2358
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,480
But we have no way of knowing now.

2359
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:38,840
So we need to

2360
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,000
find those three minutes of memory.

2361
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,880
Alright, let's go.

2362
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,120
Let's check the fifth floor.

2363
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,000
See if being on the fifth floor

2364
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,240
helps us remember something.

2365
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:47,920
Okay.

2366
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,240
Alright.

2367
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,760
This window looks deadly at first glance

2368
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,480
Why do I smell food? I'm so hungry

2369
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,800
There are quite a lot of chairs here

2370
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,040
I really like the layout of this office

2371
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,360
Entering this room,

2372
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,600
does anyone recall anything?

2373
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:20,920
No.

2374
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,680
Do you remember anything?

2375
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,320
I've never been here before.

2376
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,000
You've never been here?

2377
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,520
That's right.

2378
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,560
Isn't this it?

2379
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,480
That password.

2380
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,640
This is from the dean's office.

2381
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,680
Let me tell you about this box.

2382
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,640
I'll solve it right now.

2383
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,000
With just a simple thought.

2384
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,320
I already know how to crack it.

2385
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,400
Friends, do you want to know?

2386
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,240
I really want to know.

2387
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:48,760
Do you want to know?

2388
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:49,640
Have you figured it out?

2389
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,120
Haven't thought of it.

2390
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,000
Stop keeping us in suspense.

2391
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,520
Let me tell you.

2392
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,720
Not as smart as you.

2393
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,400
This is about colors, right?

2394
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,400
This is light blue.

2395
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,440
So the color blocks inside.

2396
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,640
What makes light blue?

2397
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,560
That makes perfect sense.

2398
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,160
White and blue.

2399
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:04,960
White and blue.

2400
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,080
4.

2401
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:06,960
4, the first is 4.

2402
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,960
Jiawei is right.

2403
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,440
What colors make purple?

2404
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,560
Yellow, blue and red.

2405
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,080
5.

2406
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,240
45.

2407
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,000
Lastly, green is.

2408
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,880
Blue plus yellow is green.

2409
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:16,560
Really?

2410
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:17,880
Yes, blue and yellow make green.

2411
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,440
9.

2412
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,680
So it's 459.

2413
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,800
Medical Records Room

2414
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,040
Operating Room Elevator

2415
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:33,320
Fourth Floor - Cyber Surgery and Medical Records Area

2416
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,720
This is an access card

2417
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,280
Now we can go to the haunted areas

2418
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:39,960
You guys go ahead first

2419
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,720
I'll keep searching here

2420
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,840
The operating room must be full of those

2421
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,280
bandage-wrapped freaks and such

2422
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,880
Bandage Freak

2423
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,520
Let's go, fourth floor

2424
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,880
Are there no other clues in this place?

2425
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,520
Nothing left

2426
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,760
How would you know? You didn't even look

2427
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,680
You just sat there

2428
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,840
I told you to search, but you insisted on leaving

2429
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,000
Let me tell you, inside this chair

2430
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,960
there's something hidden

2431
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,400
Stand up

2432
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,000
Okay

2433
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,400
Stand up

2434
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,840
Fine, I'll leave in a bit

2435
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,680
Wait, this carpet...

2436
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:08,680
Should we lift it to take a look?

2437
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,280
Sure, that's a good approach

2438
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,520
Let's do it, everyone

2439
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,560
Nothing here

2440
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:19,520
Let's go, fourth floor

2441
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:19,960
Let's go

2442
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:22,080
Let's check out that confidential records room

2443
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:22,520
Go

2444
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,440
It's dark

2445
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:34,880
Weren't you so tough?

2446
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,840
You were leading earlier

2447
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,840
I'm just opening the door.

2448
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,560
You're that so-called detective.

2449
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,280
If you're the detective, why aren't you going first?

2450
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,280
I have a light today, so I'm not scared.

2451
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,840
Fine, then don't catch anyone later.

2452
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,200
Here's the thing:

2453
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,560
The floor we're going to is dark.

2454
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,640
Detective, you have to go first today.

2455
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,800
Press the elevator button.

2456
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,160
What are you doing?

2457
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:56,440
You're not even pressing the button.

2458
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,760
He won't even press the elevator button.

2459
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,040
Just get in already.

2460
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,120
Detective, don't...

2461
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:01,920
You stand in front.

2462
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:02,880
I don't want to.

2463
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,800
Right, you're the light source.

2464
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,000
Detective, stand in front.

2465
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Your clothes are so bright.

2466
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,440
This is a loophole for me, isn't it?

2467
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,040
Yes.

2468
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,200
No.

2469
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,800
Bro, you lead the way.

2470
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:13,560
You're the light, bro.

2471
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,560
If I'm in front of you, it's too bright.

2472
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,040
You can't see anything.

2473
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:16,560
I'll go from your...

2474
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,960
Headlights should shine from behind.

2475
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,960
Headlights should shine from behind.

2476
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:31,880
What did I step on?

2477
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,440
Quick, get the access card.

2478
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,400
I'm here.

2479
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,320
Bro, you have a light but won't move forward.

2480
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,120
Right, you can shine your light over here.

2481
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,120
Are you giving this to me?

2482
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,520
Is this your taillight?

2483
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,360
Okay.

2484
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,240
There's a light.

2485
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:45,840
Let's go.

2486
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,480
Do you want your child

2487
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,200
to always remain your child?

2488
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,480
Do you want them to always obey you?

2489
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,560
Do you want unlimited dopamine

2490
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,000
without health consequences?

2491
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,200
Do you want an employee who

2492
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,800
completely forgets about life

2493
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,800
and never leaks work secrets?

2494
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:06,720
A loyal worker?

2495
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:11,920
TSB Technology can fulfill all this.

2496
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,320
It's quite similar to our story.

2497
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:15,720
Yes.

2498
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,320
Very similar.

2499
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,920
Do you want them to always obey?

2500
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,680
That should be me.

2501
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:19,120
Right.

2502
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,600
That's what your father wanted from you.

2503
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:21,080
Yes.

2504
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,720
And you want unlimited dopamine

2505
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,480
without health effects, which is

2506
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,000
Dopamine is his.

2507
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,960
You want pleasure, right?

2508
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:29,680
Yes, exactly.

2509
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,800
You want someone who

2510
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,040
completely forgets life

2511
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:33,800
That's me.

2512
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,440
Yes.

2513
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:37,560
Let me put it this way

2514
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,680
I want to enjoy the thrill of self-harm

2515
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,200
But without actually hurting myself

2516
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,080
What should I do?

2517
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:42,960
Harm others

2518
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,680
No

2519
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,720
Transfer your memories

2520
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,600
Transfer my consciousness into your body

2521
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,080
Right

2522
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,840
Then I can harm this body

2523
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,200
I'd feel great

2524
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,160
After the pleasure, my original body remains unharmed

2525
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,080
Exactly

2526
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,080
Now I understand what this means

2527
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:55,920
Get it?

2528
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:56,960
This means

2529
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,720
That these aren't actually us

2530
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,920
They're people other than the four of us

2531
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,280
Correct

2532
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,920
These so-called clients come here

2533
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,600
They can enter our bodies

2534
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:07,160
That's right

2535
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,200
To temporarily experience

2536
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:08,960
The sensations they desire

2537
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,560
Without affecting their original bodies

2538
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,480
Or causing any harm

2539
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,320
So the four of us are actually

2540
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,280
After this procedure

2541
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,680
We become part of this system

2542
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,160
Vessels that can be controlled

2543
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:18,960
By others

2544
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,440
Yes

2545
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,400
You enjoy the feeling of killing, right?

2546
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:22,560
No

2547
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,480
She's a justice warrior, this is about

2548
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,560
I save children

2549
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,160
Justice warrior

2550
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,160
Saving kids by smashing bricks, right?

2551
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,160
No, I don't particularly enjoy that feeling

2552
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,280
You call yourself a justice warrior?

2553
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,520
How is she not a justice warrior?

2554
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,240
Her father created this place

2555
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,800
What kind of justice warrior is that?

2556
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,120
I'm talking about her

2557
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,040
Now killing makes you a justice warrior?

2558
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:38,480
Fine

2559
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,480
I'm not questioning her motives

2560
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,280
But does justice justify killing?

2561
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,400
I'll tell you why killing is allowed

2562
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,600
Why?

2563
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,880
I kill if I want to

2564
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,280
You said it yourself

2565
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,040
If I had a knife

2566
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:57,720
Right now

2567
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,880
I'd kill you all one by one

2568
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,640
You said it yourself

2569
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,000
Idol

2570
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,200
Actually, there's a certain logic here

2571
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,600
Your father still wants to drink that tea

2572
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,760
But he can't drink it

2573
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,280
So he uses your body to drink it

2574
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,760
This was something unique to my father

2575
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,080
After he passed away

2576
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,480
I never touched this tea again

2577
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,840
But gradually this tea

2578
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,120
Has been decreasing

2579
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:23,400
Her father is controlling her

2580
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:23,880
Right

2581
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:24,880
Her father just wants to drink tea

2582
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:25,720
Her father wants tea

2583
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,000
Drinking tea gives him pleasure

2584
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,240
Not just pleasure, he loves drinking it

2585
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,000
For example, if I love eating something

2586
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,760
But can't eat it now

2587
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,120
So I can only possess his daughter

2588
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,480
To experience it

2589
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:36,480
How? Is he a ghost?

2590
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,120
No, it's consciousness

2591
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,600
I think our ending will be

2592
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,880
A collective exorcism dance

2593
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,080
No matter who you are

2594
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,400
Get out of Dilraba's body

2595
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,880
This is actually the logic

2596
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:48,960
The tea decreasing

2597
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:50,400
He's self-harming

2598
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,000
You're using your body to work

2599
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,600
Right, using my body to work

2600
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,360
While the other person

2601
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:55,600
Is enjoying my life

2602
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,640
But the problem is our identities

2603
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,080
Are still ours

2604
01:41:59,080 --> 01:41:59,600
Exactly

2605
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,080
But you'll have moments of amnesia

2606
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:01,880
Then you won't be yourself

2607
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,760
You must have something of your father inside you

2608
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,600
Yes

2609
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,880
He must have those perverted clients

2610
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:07,760
That thing inside

2611
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,240
He likes self-harm

2612
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,200
He himself doesn't like self-harm, right?

2613
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,160
Jiawei is a good kid.

2614
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:17,440
Good.

2615
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,440
No, what about him?

2616
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,520
What is he?

2617
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,320
He's a very mysterious person.

2618
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,480
Don't worry about him.

2619
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,800
This doesn't match my symptoms.

2620
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:26,160
It doesn't match yours.

2621
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,040
Sorry, Dean.

2622
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:36,000
Medical record retrieval device.

2623
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,800
I dropped it in the adjacent operating room.

2624
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,960
If you need it urgently,

2625
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,400
remember to check next door.

2626
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,320
The device has fluorescent tape on it,

2627
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:44,240
so it should be easy to spot.

2628
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,760
The retrieval device has fluorescent tape.

2629
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:53,360
Confidential medical records storage - authorized personnel only.

2630
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,640
Requires the medical record

2631
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,520
Meaning we need this retrieval device.

2632
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:59,720
The device is next door.

2633
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,360
Right.

2634
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,600
This should contain our records.

2635
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,000
These are your medical records.

2636
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,240
Correct.

2637
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:05,440
The surgical procedure.

2638
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:05,800
Yes.

2639
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:06,520
Let's go.

2640
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,440
We're going next door to look for it, right?

2641
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,640
I won't go.

2642
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,600
I'll wait here for you.

2643
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,360
Bro, you're the light.

2644
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,520
You have the lamp.

2645
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,240
No, bro, here's the thing.

2646
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:16,880
Give me your robe,

2647
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:17,880
let's swap and I'll go look.

2648
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:20,000
If I'm the light source, I'll be too conspicuous.

2649
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,720
Aren't we losing the fun of this?

2650
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:25,880
That's my reasoning.

2651
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,000
Then let's go.

2652
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,200
Let's go.

2653
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,960
Don't we need to take that card?

2654
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,040
Where is that operating room

2655
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:40,960
On the left

2656
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,320
This is the operating room

2657
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,400
It requires a password

2658
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:49,400
Access card

2659
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:49,840
Where's the access card?

2660
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:50,320
Access card

2661
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:50,880
Don't know

2662
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:53,920
Swipe the card

2663
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,680
This won't open

2664
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,720
No, we need to find something here

2665
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,680
This corridor is a good spot

2666
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,040
What can we do?

2667
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,400
Goodbye, everyone

2668
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,160
This hasn't been opened yet, right?

2669
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,240
Come on

2670
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,160
Come on, friends

2671
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,040
It's open

2672
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,840
It has fluorescent strips inside

2673
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,440
Those with good eyesight, check the fluorescence

2674
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,880
Hurry up and come here

2675
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:04,400
Hurry up

2676
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:06,560
Quick

2677
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:07,680
Move it

2678
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:11,720
Who

2679
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,320
Me

2680
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,840
I just finished my shift in the records room

2681
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,720
What's wrong with us on-duty staff catching some sleep?

2682
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,880
Who's making all this noise?

2683
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,720
Sorry, I didn't mean to

2684
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,160
Who's disturbing me?

2685
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,560
Me, it's me

2686
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,440
My apologies

2687
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,160
It's just that there are many of those...

2688
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,040
Snap caps

2689
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:41,880
Listen to me

2690
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,000
Stop playing around, Heli

2691
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,480
Go, move forward

2692
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,640
It's fine

2693
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:53,000
Everyone quiet

2694
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,720
Okay

2695
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,640
Aren't you patients from downstairs?

2696
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,840
This isn't where you should be

2697
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,720
Let me tell you

2698
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,040
I'm very sensitive to noise

2699
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,600
If the noise exceeds 70 decibels

2700
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,040
I can't sleep

2701
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,080
There's a decibel meter here

2702
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,440
Understood

2703
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,840
There are so many noise-making

2704
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,720
post-op comfort items on the floor

2705
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,520
How can I sleep with you here?

2706
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,080
Then don't sleep

2707
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,600
Get out, leave now

2708
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:30,160
Okay, we'll leave first, right?

2709
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:31,360
Then we'll come back after he falls asleep

2710
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,160
Got it

2711
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:33,960
Quick, go

2712
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,160
Understood

2713
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,360
Let's go

2714
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,400
What are you doing?

2715
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,160
I see the glow strips.

2716
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:50,360
Let's get out first.

2717
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,280
Hurry.

2718
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:54,920
Glow strips.

2719
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:55,640
Right.

2720
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,560
Got it.

2721
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,440
Because there are so many glow strips inside.

2722
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,560
She secretly took one just now.

2723
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,760
You open it first.

2724
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,880
Go pry this open and take a look.

2725
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:14,200
What is this thing?

2726
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,640
Glow-in-the-dark tape?

2727
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,000
No, it's that thing you step on.

2728
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:23,320
No way.

2729
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,080
Why is it sticky on top?

2730
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,320
What does the English say?

2731
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,320
What is this?

2732
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,440
It's some kind of happy air cushion.

2733
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,440
Whoopee cushion.

2734
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,120
A fart cushion, right?

2735
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:36,320
Fart cushion.

2736
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,080
Because it's sticky.

2737
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,440
This is...

2738
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,240
I got it.

2739
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:43,200
What's up?

2740
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:44,760
And then?

2741
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,800
It can stick to the wall.

2742
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,680
Okay.

2743
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,120
Impressive.

2744
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:49,800
Nope.

2745
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:50,640
Alright, go ahead.

2746
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,240
What should I do?

2747
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,000
You mean the kind of box you just had, right?

2748
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,280
Yes, we need to steal them one by one to check.

2749
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,800
Yes, we need to steal them one by one to check.

2750
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:57,040
He falls asleep first, then we go in to steal stuff.

2751
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,200
And we can't make noise over 70 decibels.

2752
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:00,880
Who's better at stealing?

2753
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:01,440
Me.

2754
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,240
The Stealing God.

2755
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,600
No, not that thing on the ground.

2756
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:12,280
I can't see that thing on the ground.

2757
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,360
Right, clothes.

2758
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,040
This isn't a loophole.

2759
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:15,640
Bro, you go.

2760
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:16,160
Really?

2761
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,160
You're just pushing the blame.

2762
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,160
I'm the chosen one today.

2763
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,400
I am the chosen one.

2764
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:21,960
Right.

2765
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,600
Bro, stay low.

2766
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,640
Crouch down.

2767
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:35,600
On the ground.

2768
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,240
There are firecrackers.

2769
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,040
You need to light those firecrackers.

2770
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:43,840
A beam of light in the dark night.

2771
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,920
Let's move forward.

2772
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,040
Slow down

2773
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:51,600
You slow down

2774
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:58,480
No, too much

2775
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,880
Keep it down

2776
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:24,520
Keep it down

2777
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,880
Nothing at all

2778
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,120
There's still something inside

2779
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,280
There's still a whole box inside

2780
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,280
Alright

2781
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:00,760
It's nothing.

2782
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,920
Who is it again?

2783
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:07,400
If someone's at the door, leave quickly.

2784
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,080
Come out for a second.

2785
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:10,240
Close the door, please.

2786
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,080
How could there be a fart?

2787
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,960
There's nothing in those.

2788
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,720
Those boxes are empty.

2789
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,360
Nothing here.

2790
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:29,960
It must be in the innermost part.

2791
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,600
So we can only check the boxes, right?

2792
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:32,320
Then just the boxes.

2793
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,320
No, I know what the air cushion is for.

2794
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,240
Step on the air cushion.

2795
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:36,800
Then you can move silently.

2796
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,320
Right, but there was just a fart sound.

2797
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,600
No, that was a fart sound.

2798
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,080
Let me show you.

2799
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:41,440
No.

2800
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,200
Not all air cushions make fart sounds.

2801
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,920
No.

2802
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,960
See, this one's silent.

2803
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,720
Step on the big ones—small ones fart.

2804
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,200
Little fart.

2805
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:54,200
Yeah, tiny fart.

2806
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:54,840
Swipe the card.

2807
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,720
Go for it, bro.

2808
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,920
Just slide your feet forward—don't lift them.

2809
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:29,600
You go get that one.

2810
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,240
If you don't find it, just bring it directly.

2811
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,400
This is that cushion.

2812
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,080
No.

2813
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:38,160
No.

2814
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,440
What's going on?

2815
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:52,440
Get out

2816
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:54,360
Hurry up and take it

2817
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,720
Quick, take it! Bring it here!

2818
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,360
Three counts

2819
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,480
Three

2820
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,200
Two

2821
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:02,560
Hurry

2822
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,320
Two

2823
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,760
Get out

2824
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,240
Close the door

2825
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:18,840
Oh my god

2826
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,760
There's definitely something in here

2827
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:25,720
Trust me

2828
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:26,640
There's something here

2829
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:27,480
There's absolutely something here

2830
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:29,600
Empty

2831
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,120
What?

2832
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,840
Disinfectant wipes

2833
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:39,600
Okay

2834
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,360
Phone screen protector

2835
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:41,480
Making you go back to applying screen protectors

2836
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,400
I'm telling you, that method works

2837
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,240
Just go in and take it directly

2838
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,000
Just charge at it and be done with it

2839
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,120
Then let's charge again

2840
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:53,240
I know, get a box

2841
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,640
What's the box for?

2842
01:52:58,640 --> 01:52:59,680
To sweep the floor

2843
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,360
Right

2844
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,000
Let's sweep the floor

2845
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,720
Let's go

2846
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:02,120
Go

2847
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,040
That makes so much sense

2848
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,600
I think we might as well do this

2849
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:12,120
This time, no matter how loud it is

2850
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:13,600
You just swoosh through

2851
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:14,760
Clear the entire path

2852
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,160
Okay?

2853
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,640
You'll just wake him up once

2854
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:18,240
Clear the path first

2855
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,640
Clear the path first, right?

2856
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:21,800
We can clear it slowly

2857
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:22,680
You clear left, I'll clear right

2858
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:23,920
I'll clear left, you clear right

2859
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,360
Okay

2860
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,160
I want to see where else

2861
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,000
There's one

2862
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,080
That's enough

2863
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,280
Everyone can leave now

2864
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:05,440
Because he's already cleared it

2865
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:09,880
The shelf on the front right

2866
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,920
There's one below

2867
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,400
What's going on?

2868
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,120
Go

2869
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,240
Gone

2870
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:44,000
It's nothing.

2871
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,240
That's all. Everything's here.

2872
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,200
I feel something's wrong.

2873
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:48,440
There must be many people.

2874
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,080
He gets angry so easily

2875
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,520
This person is the one

2876
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,560
There's something inside this

2877
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:55,720
Did you take out everything

2878
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,680
that was inside?

2879
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:57,600
We took everything

2880
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:58,960
Is this useful?

2881
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,840
Voice recognition

2882
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,560
This one

2883
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:03,520
This is it

2884
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,120
What does it say on top?

2885
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:07,960
In front of the confidential medical records storage

2886
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:10,560
Clearly state the name of the patient to retrieve

2887
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,480
to access their medical records

2888
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,320
Come on, let's retrieve Ba Bi's first

2889
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,720
Get Ba Bi's first

2890
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,560
Three, two, one—Ba Bi

2891
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:18,000
Here

2892
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,520
Bearer and carrier

2893
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,320
Brain-machine interface technology details

2894
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,400
After the brain-machine interface surgery

2895
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:32,120
The daughter Ba Bi will become the father Ba Ba's

2896
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,680
Brain-machine bearer

2897
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:35,840
Brain-machine bearer

2898
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,280
After the host's death,

2899
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,280
the bearer's brain-computer interface will activate,

2900
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:42,800
allowing the host's consciousness

2901
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,120
to enter the bearer's mind.

2902
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,160
After Dad's passing,

2903
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:49,800
his consciousness will coexist with Babe's in her mind.

2904
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,360
So the procedure I mentioned

2905
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:55,800
does indeed exist.

2906
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:58,120
When disagreeing with Babe,

2907
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,400
he can forcibly control her body

2908
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,880
to dictate

2909
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,240
his daughter's life path.

2910
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:05,640
Your dad is truly cruel.

2911
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:09,880
This mature technology

2912
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:12,000
ensures the brain-computer interface bearer

2913
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,520
remains fully conscious throughout,

2914
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,080
with intact memories.

2915
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:16,400
But there's a contradiction -

2916
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,080
she claims her memories are incomplete.

2917
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,880
Earlier we mentioned tea leaves

2918
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,720
that were unique to my father.

2919
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,080
After his death,

2920
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,120
I never touched these tea leaves,

2921
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:27,840
yet gradually the tea

2922
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,120
has been diminishing.

2923
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:34,920
Her incomplete memories

2924
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,200
are because portions

2925
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,800
of her consciousness belong to Babe's father.

2926
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,640
A shared mind.

2927
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:41,440
Alright, who's next?

2928
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,320
The scientist.

2929
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,120
After the brain-computer separation procedure,

2930
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:49,680
The separator will be divided into

2931
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,640
work persona and life persona

2932
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:54,240
The separator's memories will also be split in two

2933
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,360
One set belongs to the work state within the company

2934
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,960
One set belongs to the life state

2935
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:59,640
The life persona is the primary personality

2936
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,040
The work persona is merely an additional separated

2937
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:03,160
utilitarian personality

2938
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,040
with no human rights

2939
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,800
Can only function like a machine

2940
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,320
to precisely complete work tasks

2941
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,040
This technology is mature

2942
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,400
and can ensure the separator

2943
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,400
remains fully conscious throughout

2944
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,160
with complete memories

2945
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,480
There's one logic I've been considering:

2946
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,400
You've all experienced indirect memory loss

2947
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,240
Why?

2948
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:19,080
It's not lost

2949
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:19,840
It's that we

2950
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,720
were controlled by the other personality

2951
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,840
So you couldn't control this personality

2952
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,160
So which personality are you now?

2953
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:24,920
I'd like to ask

2954
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,600
Wait, which personality are you now?

2955
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:27,800
I'm currently the work persona

2956
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,840
I'm what he described as

2957
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,720
merely an additional separated utilitarian personality

2958
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:33,640
I'm currently this tool-like personality

2959
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,240
Okay

2960
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:36,280
So are you now Babe's father or Babe?

2961
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:37,160
Babe

2962
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:37,800
I don't believe it

2963
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:40,840
Here's some tea for you

2964
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,280
Note: Her sister Keqin underwent

2965
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,200
the same procedure on the same day

2966
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,280
Keqin having this procedure

2967
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:52,160
means Keqin also has two personalities

2968
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:52,520
Correct

2969
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,720
But my sister has disappeared

2970
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,320
I don't know where my sister is

2971
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,280
My sister previously said

2972
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,560
Weren't you two especially loving?

2973
01:57:59,560 --> 01:57:59,960
At first

2974
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,360
Then things changed

2975
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04,600
Then suddenly she changed

2976
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:05,960
She preferred a different version of you

2977
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,240
But you weren't like that

2978
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,120
So she broke up with you

2979
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:08,520
Right?

2980
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:09,080
Yes

2981
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:11,440
We were really good together at first

2982
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:15,800
Then later Sis Li became like a different person

2983
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,480
So he left her

2984
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,360
Keqin used that work persona

2985
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,280
The work personality interacted with him

2986
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,800
Then decided he wasn't good enough

2987
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,800
So she divorced him

2988
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:24,120
Yes

2989
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:25,240
Which actually hurt you too

2990
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:25,720
Yes, exactly

2991
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,120
Okay, now we understand the pattern

2992
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,040
No one can hurt me

2993
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,720
Only I can hurt others

2994
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,240
If that's the case,

2995
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:35,120
we haven't been lying from the beginning.

2996
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:36,160
These two personalities

2997
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:37,480
then it means the four of us

2998
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:39,400
aren't actually mentally ill at all.

2999
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,960
Next, please.

3000
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:44,720
Heli.

3001
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,040
The provider is Heli, 20 years old.

3002
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:48,400
So many people.

3003
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:52,960
Recipients include the wealthy, health seekers, wellness advocates.

3004
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,040
Supermodels, second-generation heirs, insurance brokers.

3005
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,920
There are so many people connected to you now.

3006
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:59,200
After the brain-computer interface procedure,

3007
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,480
Heli's body will be

3008
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,520
equipped with a sensory provider device.

3009
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,320
While recipients will have

3010
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,640
a sensory receiver installed.

3011
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,960
Whenever a recipient desires a specific experience,

3012
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:11,200
provider Heli must execute

3013
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,760
the requested experience.

3014
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:14,800
This enables

3015
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,520
shared sensory perception with the recipient.

3016
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:19,000
Yes, this is so twisted.

3017
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,160
It's not that I'm telling you

3018
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:23,400
For example, if I'm a supermodel

3019
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,000
I'm a promoted supermodel

3020
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,760
Let's say I want to drink blood now

3021
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,080
I'd send him a message

3022
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,320
Saying "I want to drink blood now"

3023
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,320
"Go drink blood for me"

3024
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,840
"Let me experience drinking blood"

3025
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,600
After receiving this command

3026
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:34,840
He must execute it

3027
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:37,320
Not because he's being controlled to do it

3028
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,000
But because he accepts

3029
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,280
Because of this agreement

3030
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:40,720
He must execute it

3031
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,400
No, I also have memory gaps

3032
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:43,440
Right, when he killed someone

3033
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:44,760
Wasn't there no memory of it?

3034
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:47,800
One day when I regained consciousness

3035
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,920
I found myself on the street

3036
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,400
Holding a brick

3037
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,880
With a woman I'd apparently beaten to death

3038
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:54,880
I was really panicked at that moment

3039
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,520
Because I didn't know

3040
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:56,520
How I could have killed her

3041
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:57,520
Or why I was there

3042
01:59:58,280 --> 01:59:59,400
If he acted voluntarily

3043
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,360
If he killed someone

3044
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:01,400
He would definitely remember the process

3045
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:02,240
Right, I would have memories

3046
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:03,040
So it must be someone else

3047
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,360
Right, so he must have

3048
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:05,160
Been forced to act

3049
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:06,560
I gave an order

3050
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,280
And he had to obey passively

3051
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,720
But when carrying out this task

3052
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,360
He had no memory, right?

3053
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,040
Exactly

3054
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,600
Good, this is our current hypothesis

3055
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:16,400
Who's next?

3056
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:17,280
White noise

3057
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,720
Please turn on the white noise

3058
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:20,600
I don't have any major issues

3059
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:28,920
I don't have any major issues.

3060
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,680
The data on this page has been stolen.

3061
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:32,320
The original data has been deleted.

3062
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:35,280
Please notify the on-duty administrator, No. 667.

3063
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,680
Quickly check the storage device.

3064
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:39,080
Your content has been deleted.

3065
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:39,800
What's going on?

3066
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:41,720
Did you delete it out of guilt?

3067
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,080
Right?

3068
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:43,600
Yes.

3069
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,160
After committing the act,

3070
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:45,680
Exactly.

3071
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:47,680
Because you've already returned to normal,

3072
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,560
So you came to—

3073
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,520
While we were cleaning inside, you were here deleting.

3074
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,640
I don’t even want to talk about him anymore.

3075
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,400
That’s right.

3076
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,280
Look at this guy, seriously.

3077
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,200
There’s another possibility—

3078
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,960
Do you also have this file?

3079
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:01,600
Search for Ning Manzou

3080
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,560
Ning Manzou

3081
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,000
What's wrong?

3082
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,040
Read it out loud

3083
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,520
Brain-machine bearer: Ning Manzou

3084
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,440
Brain-machine carriers: Ning Bao'an, Jiang Limao

3085
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,280
Brain-machine interface technology details

3086
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,680
After the brain-machine interface surgery

3087
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:22,600
Son Ning Manzou will become the brain-machine bearer

3088
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:26,520
for father Ning Bao'an and mother Jiang Limao

3089
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,360
When the carriers pass away

3090
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:31,080
The bearer's brain-machine interface will activate

3091
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:33,920
Allowing the carriers' consciousness to enter

3092
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,320
the bearer's mind

3093
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,120
After Ning Bao'an and Jiang Limao pass away

3094
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:40,760
Their consciousness will coexist in Ning Manzou's mind

3095
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,960
We're the same now

3096
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,400
Can communicate with Ning Manzou anytime

3097
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,320
When disagreeing with Ning Manzou

3098
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,720
Can forcibly control Ning Manzou's body

3099
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:50,920
Thus directing their son's life path

3100
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,080
The contract and surgical procedure

3101
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,360
Were kept strictly secret from Ning Manzou

3102
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:58,640
To prevent resistance from Ning Manzou

3103
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:00,000
Are you resisting now?

3104
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,080
Very much

3105
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,120
You're very unhappy now

3106
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:02,840
I'm extremely unhappy

3107
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:03,840
So now you're with your

3108
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,080
parents together

3109
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:06,200
Three years ago

3110
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:07,120
Now I

3111
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:07,920
feel very crowded here

3112
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,120
I suddenly feel like I

3113
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:10,320
No wonder I couldn't lose weight recently

3114
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,120
Turns out it's three people

3115
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,560
A family of three in one body

3116
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,080
Doesn't this say "administrator"?

3117
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:17,720
What is this?

3118
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:20,400
Want unlimited dopamine

3119
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,520
without health consequences?

3120
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:28,160
The duty manager has a three-digit password.

3121
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:29,880
What three-digit password?

3122
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:35,480
667

3123
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:52,600
Is it really that simple?

3124
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:54,040
Sometimes the answer

3125
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,400
is just that simple

3126
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,520
Alright, I'll do it

3127
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,160
I'll go

3128
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,040
Good, it's my time to perform

3129
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,080
I've been waiting all day

3130
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:05,760
What does it say?

3131
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,520
If your memory is bad, you must remember

3132
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:11,000
to store memos in your glasses

3133
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:12,760
Seems this person's memory

3134
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:13,640
is just like mine

3135
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:14,600
not very good either

3136
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:17,360
Okay, now we've opened these

3137
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,120
cool-looking glasses

3138
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,160
Play memo

3139
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,480
The critical patients under observation on the third floor

3140
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:27,720
are causing trouble on the fourth floor again

3141
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:29,240
If they steal important information

3142
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:29,880
it would be terrible

3143
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:32,000
The third floor is our ward, right?

3144
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,480
The ward area must be

3145
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:33,960
definitely us

3146
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:34,560
That's us, right?

3147
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:35,880
Yes, I think it's us too

3148
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:36,560
So now

3149
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:37,880
your records have been deleted

3150
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:38,960
What does this mean?

3151
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:44,840
You're asking me?

3152
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,200
Why would I tell you then?

3153
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:53,240
So there's nothing about

3154
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,360
him in here, right?

3155
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:06,440
Look at you, just listening to

3156
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:08,880
It's crooked, put it on straight for me

3157
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,600
It's crooked

3158
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,600
Put it on yourself while looking in the mirror

3159
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,320
We need to check if any patients are missing.

3160
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:22,240
If they find out...

3161
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:24,080
something important...

3162
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:25,920
the files will be compromised.

3163
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,160
What he meant was...

3164
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:30,880
All five of us are critical patients from the third floor.

3165
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,720
If they let us five come to the fourth floor...

3166
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:36,280
and discover those records on the computer...

3167
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:37,280
everyone's secret records...

3168
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:37,880
we'll realize...

3169
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:39,000
we're not actually mentally ill.

3170
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,400
Right, that's the first logic.

3171
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:41,120
The second logic is...

3172
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,520
One of you four stole...

3173
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,160
that white noise device.

3174
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,800
It could be him...

3175
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:45,880
or one of you three.

3176
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:46,200
Could be one of you three.

3177
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,720
It's definitely not me.

3178
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:50,000
Or maybe that escaped patient from the third floor.

3179
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,040
So let's go check the third floor.

3180
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:51,240
Let's go investigate the third floor.

3181
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:52,440
Exactly.

3182
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,760
Let's catch that patient.

3183
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:55,120
VIP guests to the third floor, please.

3184
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:55,720
VIPs...

3185
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:57,120
Welcome.

3186
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,200
Five VIP guests to the third floor, please.

3187
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:01,600
Bro, you're like a guiding light, you should lead.

3188
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:02,920
I only shine for myself.

3189
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:05,280
Brother Ning needs your light, hurry!

3190
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,320
I made the right clothing choice today.

3191
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:10,400
Brother Ning should stand in front.

3192
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:10,880
No.

3193
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:11,920
Hurry up, I want to stand behind you.

3194
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:12,360
I'll stay in the back.

3195
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,520
No, shine some light on the button for me.

3196
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:13,800
I won't.

3197
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:14,440
Shine light on the button for me.

3198
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:15,080
No way.

3199
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,160
Stop acting cute.

3200
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:19,520
I refuse.

3201
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,920
Oh my god.

3202
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:32,520
These two stand as tall as guardian deities.

3203
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:35,000
Let's go.

3204
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,320
Why are you behind me again?

3205
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,240
No standing behind me.

3206
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:41,520
Fine.

3207
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:42,800
It's nothing.

3208
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,120
You're about to grab my waist again.

3209
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,040
Or choke my neck.

3210
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,480
I'll strike the back of your head.

3211
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:49,440
Shh.

3212
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,120
This way.

3213
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:56,440
This is a ward.

3214
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:58,200
We've arrived at a...

3215
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,440
We're at a hospital.

3216
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:26,880
Bai Yangzuo

3217
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,880
Is that you, Bai Yangzuo?

3218
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:28,440
Where's Bai Yangzuo?

3219
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:28,800
Bai Yangzuo

3220
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,400
White Noise

3221
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:32,000
Do you remember me?

3222
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,960
He's my good friend, White Noise

3223
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:34,520
Right?

3224
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,160
You remember, don't you?

3225
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:36,320
How can you prove he's White Noise?

3226
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,320
His name is Bai Yangzuo

3227
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:39,080
You're just a product

3228
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:41,200
I don't want to live

3229
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,200
I don't deserve to live

3230
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:42,920
This is too strange

3231
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:43,640
Can't even die properly

3232
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:45,120
This is unbearable, I want to die

3233
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:46,280
Want to escape this suffering

3234
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:47,200
Kill this instigator

3235
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,120
Will you really be free then?

3236
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,280
Kill each other and be free together

3237
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:53,280
One possibility is that you've actually

3238
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,360
already died

3239
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,000
Died and came back to life

3240
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,040
The deceased is one of you four

3241
02:06:58,040 --> 02:06:59,280
He can manipulate anyone

3242
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,320
Your scheme won't last much longer

3243
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,640
You're too suspicious

3244
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,560
It's really about who has the ability to kill

3245
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,000
There's one person who can

3246
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,680
This person has woken up

3247
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:12,520
This is the most crucial point

3248
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,240
You've been here the longest

3249
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:15,160
If you put it that way

3250
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:16,200
Then it must be me

3251
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:17,880
This is something that actually happened

3252
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:19,440
Don't you think that's too simple?

3253
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,400
You mean we each took a turn?

3254
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:23,440
How could he be X, bro?

3255
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:25,080
Could he not be X?

3256
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,760
This person is the murderer
