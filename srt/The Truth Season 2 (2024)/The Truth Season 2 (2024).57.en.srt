"Start Reasoning" Trial Version Game Rules

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,480
Six players per episode

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
Divided into four suspects and two investigators

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,240
to solve cases

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,360
The real culprit hides among the suspects

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,160
The culprit's task is to conceal their identity

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,000
without being discovered by others

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,760
Only the real culprit can lie

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,880
Notably

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,960
A new gameplay element is introduced

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
The player who is the culprit

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
if passing a certain test

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,520
can choose between the two investigators

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,840
to select one

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,560
and turn them into X

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
X's mission is to

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,200
during the investigation

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,680
actively help the culprit escape

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,320
Victory conditions

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,920
After investigation, players vote for the culprit

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,880
If the culprit gets fewer votes than others

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,160
then culprit and X win

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
Otherwise correct voters win

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,200
Welcome to

I'm Reasoning Buddy

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,200
Before the official recording

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
of "Start Reasoning" Season 2

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,520
We've invited Laura and Wang Nengneng

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,880
The "Bala Energy" couple

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,120
I broke up with him

32
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,360
just to be with you

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,040
Please

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
Don't scare me

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,360
Hou Zhuocheng and Yang Ruqing

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,000
You two are investigators

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,040
Don't run, I'm coming

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,360
Don't run

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,400
Huang Kai, Hu Minghao

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
Six guests came to visit Tui Town

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,160
For a trial experience

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm a two-timing scumbag

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,800
Now let me, Tuibao

44
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,560
Watch together with everyone

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Commentate on the wonderful performances of Tui Town's new residents

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120
Let's go into

47
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,000
June 3, 2004

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,600
This was a big day for the so-called "Star-Making Dream Factory"

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,840
Tui Town Art Academy

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,200
They were holding a three-day

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
School anniversary celebration

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,680
The school's prominent figures and outstanding graduates

53
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,720
All attended

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
So which

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
super stars came today?

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
Now let's invite everyone here

57
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
To briefly introduce yourselves

58
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,600
Okay

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,800
First, let's welcome A'Kai

I'll arrange autographed photos for you later

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Hello everyone

65
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
Hello brothers and sisters

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,880

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,600
I'm the youngest student in my class

70
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
People usually call me

71
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,080
The Golden Canary of the Forest

72
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600

Art Performance student at Tui Art Academy

78
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,280
Though I don't look like a sophomore

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,320
Because I've traveled abroad since childhood

80
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
to many places

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,760
Different cultures have left their marks

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
on both my personality and appearance

83
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,720
But I'm still a sophomore student

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,880
Please take care of me

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,440

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,120

The Hao who's Purple Band's rapper

94
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,440
Want to hear some rap, right?

95
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,920
Sounds good but won't cost much

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Exit left and scan to pay

97
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Hello everyone, I'm Purple Band's leader

Hello everyone

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm your senior Tui Youpin

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,280
You can also call me TYP

106
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Every year on the day before the school anniversary

107
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,400
Tuiyi organizes a school-wide vote

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,560
To select the Tuiyi Star representing the highest honor

109
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,160
Announcing who the Tuiyi Star is

110
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Is also one of the most important

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,960
Parts of our anniversary celebration

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,280
Seated in the audience are two

113
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,840
Students who have won the Tuiyi Star title

114
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,160
TYP was the 1988 Tuiyi Star

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,080
Zhuocheng was the 2002 Tuiyi Star

116
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,880
Ruqing has also lived up to expectations

117
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,160
And become this year's Tuiyi Star

118
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,600
Ruqing, do you have any thoughts

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,880
You'd like to share with your fellow students?

120
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,320
First, thank you all for your blessings

121
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
To be able to receive this

122
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,320
Honorary award of Tuiyi Star

123
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,240
First I want to thank everyone for your recognition

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
I hope next year and the year after

125
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,000
I can still win the Tuiyi Star

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Thank you

127
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,480
Good

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,680
But surprisingly

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Last year's top winner Hu Jie

130
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,600
Is actually this year's last place

131
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,480
Hu Jie

132
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
Wasn't he first place last year?

133
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
How did he end up last this year?

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
I don't know

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,640
Just as the host was rambling on

136
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,480
A classmate stumbled

137
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,040
into the event venue

138
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
I saw a monster in the laundry room

139
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Monster

140
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
Xiao Xiao, come here

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,560
Quickly help this junior

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
Take him to the infirmary to rest, hurry

143
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,120
These Tuiyi Ghost Stories

144
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Ever since I started school in 1988

145
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,160
these stories began circulating in schools

146
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,600
But tell me, which school

147
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,880
doesn't have its share of bizarre legends, right?

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,280
Right

149
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,680
Let Luo Luo come up

150
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,040
You read them out for everyone

151
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,800
Okay

152
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,120
The Seven Ghost Stories of Tuiyi

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Don't open cabinets carelessly

154
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,480
Beware of blood-covered people inside

155
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,280
Don't enter empty piano rooms lightly

156
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,480
Beware of deadly piano music playing there

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,040
Don't linger in the laundry room

158
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,120
Beware of hideous monsters appearing

159
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't stare at class photos too long

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,480
Beware of seeing extra classmates

161
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,720
Never forget to close the dorm door

162
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,160
Beware someone might be lying back-to-back with you

163
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't enter night study rooms during daytime

164
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,440
Beware you might never come out

165
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,040
Don't take the library elevator

166
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,800
Beware it might take you to non-existent floors

167
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,920
It's okay, classmates

168
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Don't be afraid

169
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,440
Let's not let these strange rumors

170
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,040
affect today's festive school anniversary atmosphere

171
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,360
So today's anniversary events

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
will conclude here for now, okay?

173
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,360
Okay

174
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,480
But tomorrow is our musical

175
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
"Swan Goose Lake" performance

176
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,600
Students participating in the performance rehearsal

177
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,360
should make good use of this afternoon to practice

178
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,680
Alright?

179
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,040
Okay

180
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,120
Now everyone can have free time

181
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,480
Okay?

182
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,600
Okay

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,880
Time has come to 4 PM

184
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,800
The cast members for the musical

185
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240

On time

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,480
Perfect, not late

191
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,240
Respect

192
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Hello

193
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,040
Director

194
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,240
Since we're all here

195
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
Let's first confirm

196
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,120
everyone's roles

197
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
I'm the director of this musical

198
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,040
I play the handsome prince

199
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,880
And Xiaoyu

200
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,560
I'm the female lead, the white swan

201
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm the male lead

202
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,920
The great white goose demon king from the mysterious East

203
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
I'm the beautiful princess

204
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm Jinka

205
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
I'm the prince

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,480
The brave and skilled Prince Maomaoyu

207
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,120
I'm Prince Dayu, known as the God of War

208
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Then I'm Xiaoyu

209
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,200
Dayu, Xiaoyu, Maomaoyu

210
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,000
Dayu, Xiaoyu, Maomaoyu

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,240
My status seems a bit low

212
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,000
Alright

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
Then let's officially begin rehearsal

214
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,680
Okay

215
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,200
Help me

216
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,240
Help me

217
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,160
I'm right here

218
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,280
Didn't we agree not to open the cabinet casually?

219
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,080
Who's in the cabinet?

220
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
That cabinet...

221
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
There's someone in that cabinet.

222
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,720
I think I heard knocking.

223
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,400
Is anyone there?

224
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,200
How do we open it?

225
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,400
What's this?

226
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,920
Uh...

227
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,120
Zhi Daole

228
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,960
Zhi Dao

229
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,880
Zhi Daole

230
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,400
Don't open cabinets randomly

231
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,920
Be careful - there might be bloody people inside

232
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,880
This weird tale from Tuiyi is real

233
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
I can't continue with this rehearsal

234
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,680
I'm going back to the dorm

235
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,000
Respect

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,440
"Start Reasoning" Trial Version - Case 1

237
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,760
Tui Town 2004

238
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,400
"Tuiyi's Weird Tales: The Bloody Cabinet Mystery"

239
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
Officially begins

240
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,440
The date is June 3, 2004

241
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,160
4:10 PM

242
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,520
The victim is Zhi Daole

243
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Leader of the Zhi Music Troupe

244
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,280
After preliminary investigation

245
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Zhi Daole's death

246
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,400
Cannot rule out homicide

247
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,000
The murderer

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Is among

249
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
A Kai

250
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,800
Luo Luo

251
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,920
Zhuo Cheng

252
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,800
Ming Hao

253
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,160
These four suspects

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,040
In this case

255
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,200
Ru Qing and Neng Neng are temporarily cleared

256
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,560
So you'll be the investigators

257
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,960
After the two detectives finished collecting evidence at the crime scene,

258
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,320
they brought the four suspects to the Brainstorming Hall.

259
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
for questioning.

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
I never expected there would be more than one victim

261
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,360
At the crime scene we discovered

262
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,760
Not just one person died

263
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,080
Besides Zidaole, TYP also died

264
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,560
Right when we were collecting evidence in the small auditorium

265
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,400
the lights suddenly went out

266
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
and at that moment from the piano room opposite

267
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,920
came this extremely eerie piano music

268
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
How terrifying

269
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,040
Piano room

270
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,400
The piano room is making noise

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,760
You go

272
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,080
Go for it

273
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,560
We found no one inside when we arrived at the entrance.

274
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,760
The piano was playing by itself.

275
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,840
Then, Nengneng found something behind the folding screen.

276
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
They discovered TYP's corpse.

277
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,960
TYP

278
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,400
What time did you discover TYP was dead?

279
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,680
During our evidence collection

280
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,320
It was approximately

281
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
between 4:00 PM and 4:30 PM

282
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,920
I suggest everyone first explain

283
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,200
their relationship with the deceased

284
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,760
Let me see if there were any murder motives

285
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,480
Zidaole is TYP's niece

286
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,760
So my relationship with Sister Zidaole

287
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,320
is actually quite good

288
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,400
As for TYP, he's basically my boss

289
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,680
so our relationship is actually okay

290
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,680
Zidaole is my girlfriend

291
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,480
We're the official couple of Purple Group

292
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,400
Zidaole was my classmate

293
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,480
but we weren't particularly close

294
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,400
And TYP was my senior

295
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
He was the one who signed me

296
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,760
Aren't you the producer?

297
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,960
Yes, I am the producer

298
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,200
But with your own company's

299
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,760
top artist like this

300
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,640
you're not very close?

301
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,480
You just said

302
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,920
we were originally classmates

303
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
In that class, some were close

304
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,480
some weren't close

305
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,840
But after joining the group

306
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,120
we became group members

307
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,720
Zidaole is also my senior

308
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,920
but actually we didn't interact much

309
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,080
As for TYP, he was my discoverer

310
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,920
It seems in the first round everyone

311
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
didn't share much information

312
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,640
Apparently the character relationships didn't

313
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,760
provide any help

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,000
However, the two investigators

315
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,160
made some discoveries at the crime scene

316
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,600
The investigators found that

317
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,800
the prop cabinet containing Zidaole's corpse

318
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
was extremely airtight

319
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,280
Before opening the cabinet door

320
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,640
there was no blood leakage at all

321
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,800
Therefore, it's speculated that Zidaole was likely

322
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,600
killed elsewhere

323
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,400
and then placed in the cabinet to be moved here

324
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,520
Zidaole's fatal wound was a

325
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,560
circular wound on the left side of the neck

326
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,280
but no related weapon was found at the scene

327
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,200
As for TYP's body found in the music room

328
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,040
it lay flat on the ground behind a screen

329
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,800
with no visible wounds

330
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,480
Based on the deep purple color of the lips

331
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,880
investigators initially suspect

332
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,280
TYP died from poisoning

333
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,800
Meanwhile, investigators also found

334
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,240
a notice related to the four suspects

335
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,800
The content shows that three days ago

336
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,920
director Ruisibai assigned everyone

337
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,480
different transportation tasks

338
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,040
The four were to move

339
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,680
a designated prop from the warehouse

340
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
to the small auditorium at different times

341
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,800
Regarding this notice

342
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,920
investigators questioned the four suspects

343
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,040
All four answered that

344
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,920
they moved the designated props

345
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,040
to the auditorium on time

346
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,640
and handed them to Xiao Ren in charge of auditorium setup

347
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,000
left the scene.

348
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,640
Meanwhile, all four emphasized

349
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,400
they never saw

350
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,120
TYP and Zidaole.

351
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,480
Although the surveillance footage from the art building hallway

352
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,080
does confirm all four completed

353
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,240
their tasks on time,

354
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,720
investigators still noticed something odd

355
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
while reviewing the footage.

356
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,120
We found a computer at the crime scene

357
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,240
with surveillance footage

358
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,800
showing everyone's movements.

359
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,120
Let's play this footage for everyone.

360
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,400
Yes, because we can see some people

361
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,240
seemingly fleeing in panic -

362
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
which is quite strange.

363
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,080
Can you explain your actions again?

364
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,800
So everyone can see

365
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,280
their own footage.

366
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,720
First, let's look at

367
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
1:10 PM when

368
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,720
Zidaole walked straight to the left.

369
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,840
At 1:20 PM, TYP appeared

370
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,160
and also went left.

371
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,920
At 2:00 PM,

372
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,680
A-Kai arrived as scheduled

373
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,520
to move a cabinet from the warehouse.

374
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,960
He took 10 minutes and exited.

375
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,160
Half an hour later, Luoluo arrived

376
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,280
and moved a 1.8-meter

377
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,480
one quite easily.

378
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
After the same 10 minutes,

379
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,240
she ran away.

380
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,480
I can't tell if she was panicked or scared -

381
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,960
her movements were completely different from A-Kai's.

382
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,240
I was just rushing to get my bangs trimmed

383
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,360
before the performance.

384
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,960
At 3 PM, Zhuocheng entered.

385
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
You glanced over here first.

386
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,920
Then, you pushed a painting.

387
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,160
You pushed it quite slowly.

388
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,720
Look here,

389
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,040
even Luola pushed it more effortlessly than you.

390
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,480
You even paused here for a moment.

391
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,120
This painting of yours—

392
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,960
could there have been a person hanging on it?

393
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,680
This was our blind spot.

394
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,040
At 3:30 PM, Minghao entered.

395
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,120
Minghao left after 5 minutes.

396
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,840
There are three rooms on the left.

397
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,720
The two rooms on the right

398
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,080
So is it possible that TYP

399
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600
went to the recording studio

400
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Right, you actually don't know whether those two

401
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,400
ever met or even

402
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,520
In the surveillance footage

403
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,280
we can't see any method of the crime

404
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,360
how the body was transported there

405
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,600
So we only have two theories

406
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,520
First, he was in the cabinet

407
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,720
Second, he was behind the painting

408
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
TYP was poisoned to death

409
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,520
That's why there's no bloodstain

410
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
No blood

411
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
So it's possible he could

412
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,960
Walk past the painting

413
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,360
And one more thing

414
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,280
They might have been killed over there

415
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,360
Where? The small auditorium

416
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,920
The small auditorium or the piano room

417
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,200
Are you sure

418
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,480
that the road in the surveillance footage

419
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,040
is the only possible route

420
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,920
to transport his body?

421
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,400
Is there any possibility of other

422
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,360
This surveillance has a blind spot

423
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,800
Gate 3 isn't covered

424
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,040
Only Gate 2 and Gate 1 are visible

425
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,360
So is it possible that

426
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,480
the body was taken out through Gate 3

427
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,560
and then from somewhere

428
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,280
entered the piano room or small auditorium?

429
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,120
Think about it

430
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,920
If he went out through Gate 3, he couldn't come back in

431
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
because Gates 1 and 2

432
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,120
are both under surveillance

433
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
After analysis

434
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,320
everyone thinks Zidaole was more likely

435
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
killed near the prop warehouse

436
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
and then hidden in a cabinet

437
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,640
before being transported to the small auditorium

438
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,040
While TYP's death location remains unconfirmed

439
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,920
Furthermore, everyone suggested

440
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,600
although Zidaole's body

441
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,080
was found in a cabinet

442
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,360
it doesn't mean the person who moved the cabinet

443
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,800
is necessarily the murderer

444
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,960
If it's in the cabinet

445
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,600
it's possible someone committed the crime first

446
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,840
and then placed it there later

447
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,800
Right, the person moving the cabinet

448
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,160
might not have known

449
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,480
there was already a corpse inside

450
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,480
But what exactly is the connection

451
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,880
between the four suspects and the two victims?

452
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
Through interrogation,

453
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
the murder motives of four individuals

454
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,040
have gradually surfaced.

455
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,960
The deceased Zidaole was Minghao's current girlfriend,

456
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,400
but they were actually in a contractual relationship.

457
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,040
Zidaole and Minghao

458
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,480
were maintaining their couple image

459
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,040
in public view,

460
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,680
jointly managing their golden couple persona

461
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,160
with a "never break up" clause.

462
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
The contract stipulated that

463
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,520
Minghao could never break up with Zidaole,

464
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,640
or he would face massive penalties.

465
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,720
Recently, Zidaole discovered

466
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Minghao still had feelings for his ex,

467
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,320
and Minghao's ex

468
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,800
was actually Nengneng's current girlfriend Luoluo.

469
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,680
I can no longer remain objective about this.

470
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,960
Nengneng, look -

471
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,520
here's Minghao's message:

472
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,840
"You still love me, just as I still love you."

473
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,600
That's not true!

474
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,600
Brother,

475
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,240
you have to believe me.

476
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,720
So you two were together before?

477
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,400
Yes.

478
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,280
When did you break up with her?

479
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,920
And then got together with Zidaole?

480
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,480
September 3rd, 2003.

481
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,840
So in September 2003,

482
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,280
you broke up with Luoluo,

483
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
on September 3rd,

484
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,840
and then in November 2003,

485
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,720
you started dating Zidaole.

486
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,040
Yes, that's correct.

487
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
Luoluo said I reminded her of her brother,

488
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,360
that's why she broke up with me.

489
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,800
I never expected that after breaking up,

490
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,160
she immediately found someone new -

491
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,240
that "Balala Energy" guy.

492
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,040
Brother.

493
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
So when I was

494
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
really angry about it,

495
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,840
Zidaole came to me

496
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
and said

497
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,040
she'd been noticing me for a while,

498
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,680
and had some feelings for me.

499
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Then I thought,

500
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,160
"You broke up with me

501
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,920
and immediately found someone new,

502
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,520
well someone wants me too."

503
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,000
So that's why I

504
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,280
got together with Zidaole so quickly.

505
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,800
Let me ask you something:

506
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,160
Has Zidaole discovered that you like

507
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,520
my current girlfriend?

508
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,920
I'll definitely make you regret this.

509
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,680
Funny, I feel like you're the one who should be saying that to me.

510
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,640
No, I think

511
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,480
after I finished writing

512
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,040
"Our Three-Way Love,"

513
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,400
I've sorted out my true feelings.

514
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,920
I still want to choose my old love.

515
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,680
I was planning to break up with her first

516
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
But now she caught me

517
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,760
Then she got really angry

518
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,040
She called me a two-timing scumbag

519
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,520
And when she heard I wanted to break up

520
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,680
She got even angrier

521
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I apologized but she wouldn't listen

522
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
She said she just wanted to ruin me

523
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,400
So she kicked me out of Purple Band

524
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
And had her uncle blacklist me

525
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,920
On May 30th, 2004

526
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,320
She received a phone call

527
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,320
From her uncle TYP

528
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Then I heard them talking

529
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,400
He wronged me

530
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,280
I'll make this overnight star fall from grace

531
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,680
So you had motive for murder

532
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,880
You might have killed both of them

533
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,680
Because you hated her uncle too

534
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,920
Exactly

535
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,720
When Minghao heard Zidaole say

536
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,440
"I'll make this overnight star fall from grace"

537
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,680
On the school anniversary day

538
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,000
He developed motive to kill Zidaole and TYP

539
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,720
However, in reality,

540
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,840
These words were actually spoken by Zidao Le to Zhuocheng.

541
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,560
What date in May? May 28th

542
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
May 28th

543
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
With that Minghao

544
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,120
With her and with me

545
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,920
The day we called was the same day, right?

546
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes, and the words were exactly the same

547
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Actually, she was saying it for me to hear

548
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,840
She was saying it for you to hear, right?

549
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,640
So is it possible you misunderstood?

550
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,160
Right, so maybe she didn't actually mean to...

551
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,200
He misunderstood

552
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,160
She called specifically to say it for me to hear

553
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,240
It's a misunderstanding

554
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,640
So it wasn't about telling her uncle

555
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
No

556
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
Because Xu Duocheng has always wanted to go solo

557
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,120
To do folk-rock

558
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,680
If it's Xu Duocheng

559
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,800
He'd say goodbye to Hao Zi Wei Zhi

560
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,200
"I want to fly higher"

561
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,960
And he even smashed Hao Zi Wei Zhi's syrup

562
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,760
Into pieces

563
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,640
Which shows their "sweetness"

564
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
Was fake

565
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,160
What I hope for Violet Band

566
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,960
is that besides love songs

567
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,080
we could have many other types of songs

568
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,560
Like what I particularly enjoy -

569
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
folk-rock fusion elements

570
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,520
Because I really love Chinese traditional music

571
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,960
"Folk-Rock You and Me"

572
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,400
Right

573
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,880
But I noticed those two

574
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,840
aren't focused on making music at all

575
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,600
I realized your priorities

576
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,680
or this band's priorities

577
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,080
were just

578
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,360
manufacturing a showmance

579
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
So I felt disgusted

580
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,280
But as long as Violet Daole refuses

581
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,600
Zhuocheng will remain contract-bound to Violet Band

582
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,200
And Violet Daole would never let Zhuocheng leave

583
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,080
Because Zhuocheng's songwriting talent

584
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,560
is the band's popularity guarantee

585
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,160
Thus

586
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,720
Violet Daole and Zhuocheng

587
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
have had serious conflicts

588
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
She told me

589
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
if I wanted to terminate the contract

590
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,160
I'd have to pay astronomical penalties

591
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,320
And if I wanted to go solo

592
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,840
TYP is her uncle

593
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,200
So I couldn't possibly

594
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,800
win against her connections

595
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
She just told me

596
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,000
I had to follow her arrangements

597
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,680
So you've been forced to

598
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,720
keep writing songs for Violet Band

599
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
Yes

600
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
Violet Daole threatened you?

601
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,200
Yes

602
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,000
All these were

603
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,480
destroyed by Violet Daole

604
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,720
Right, all torn apart

605
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,520
by Violet Daole

606
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,440
These were songs he truly loved

607
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,400
Such a temper

608
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
May 4, 2004

609
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,160
Zidaole sent Xu Duocheng a photo

610
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,240
of him committing murder

611
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,080
Xu Duocheng then realized that yesterday

612
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,960
while attending a masquerade party

613
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,880
due to his "Half-Step Drunken Madness" condition

614
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,480
he accidentally killed someone while intoxicated

615
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
and remembers nothing

616
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,200
before losing consciousness

617
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,240
"What happened next..."

618
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
"I have no recollection"

619
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,920
"So it might not even be you who killed someone"

620
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,440
"Exactly"

621
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,960
"They could have staged the crime scene"

622
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,280
"Right"

623
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,000
"Set up an elaborate trap"

624
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,360
"Yes"

625
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
"Exactly, and then they told me..."

626
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,800
If you want to

627
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,880
You don't listen to me

628
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,480
follow orders

629
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,440
Or if you don't obey me

630
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
I'll expose this matter

631
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,400
Then I'll face legal judgment

632
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,240
So I have no choice

633
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,160
If the murder gets exposed

634
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,200
My life will be ruined

635
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,680
This past month, I feel

636
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,800
this month has been extremely long

637
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,480
Every day feels like walking on landmines

638
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,560
Constant fear at every step

639
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,960
No matter when

640
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
Zidaole keeps threatening me

641
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,320
Always finding something to

642
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,160
use against me

643
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,040
From then on

644
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,200
With Zidaole holding leverage over me

645
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Zhuocheng was constantly threatened and bullied

646
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,640
Zhuocheng, who couldn't take it anymore

647
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,200
During an event

648
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,840
cursed Zidaole behind her back

649
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,160
Unexpectedly, Zidaole heard it

650
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,760
Zidaole told Zhuocheng

651
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,840
that on the school anniversary day

652
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,440
she would ruin his reputation

653
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,600
So who died?

654
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,720
Did someone really die?

655
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,320
Yes

656
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,000
At this point, I believed I was the murderer

657
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,480
So I had to obey her commands

658
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Follow her orders

659
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,360
Can I put it that way?

660
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,440
After you drank alcohol

661
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
you completely lost control of your actions

662
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,960
I completely

663
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,360
lost all consciousness

664
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,280
I would engage in indescribably dangerous behavior

665
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,720
So it's possible

666
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,680
that you might have killed someone

667
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,360
Might have killed someone

668
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,960
Or might not have killed anyone

669
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
Therefore

670
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,480
Because the pictures were shown to me

671
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,560
I believed I was the murderer at that time

672
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,200
She probably knew I wanted to go solo

673
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
That's why she used this

674
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,160
photo

675
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,720
to threaten me

676
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
to prevent me from going solo

677
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,440
and keep working for her, writing songs

678
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,200
So there's one possibility

679
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,320
She meant

680
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,800
to restrict you with the contract

681
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,280
Another possibility is

682
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,760
fabricating a murder trap to frame you

683
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
A double

684
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,480
Yes

685
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,760
method to make you

686
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,040
obey her and become her puppet

687
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
So the one who died at the ball that day

688
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,480
the masked man in formal attire

689
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,680
who exactly was he?

690
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,320
Zhuocheng

691
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,040
Was he framed?

692
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,720
Soon

693
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,320
Ah Kai provided the answer

694
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
Everyone found in Ah Kai's photo album

695
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,720
a picture of

696
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,160
him with the masked man in formal attire

697
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
Under everyone's questioning

698
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Ah Kai revealed

699
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,720
the true identity of the masked man

700
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,440
The photo shows me with my friend

701
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Golden Monkey

702
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,080
and some of our good memories

703
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,120
He was Ah Kai's closest brother

704
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,760
during his drifting days

705
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,800
Golden Monkey

706
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
who was Luo Luo's biological brother

707
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,680
The scene where this photo was taken was

708
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,400
Everyone can take a look

709
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,720
at this picture here

710
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,320
So you attended the cocktail party too, right?

711
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,120
It should be the same day.

712
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,280
I was the one who killed Golden Monkey.

713
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,240
Yes, so...

714
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,120
On the day you killed Golden Monkey,

715
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,480
Ah Kai was also there.

716
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,160
No.

717
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
Golden Monkey and I...

718
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
had an exceptionally close relationship.

719
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,600
That day, I invited him for dinner.

720
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,640
Around April...

721
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
April this year.

722
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,840
When Ah Kai dined with Golden Monkey,

723
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,440
he gave Golden Monkey a formal masquerade costume.

724
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,360
They agreed to meet again on May 25th...

725
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,320
for another meal.

726
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,720
But Golden Monkey didn't show up that day.

727
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,800
And lost contact.

728
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,640
Because he was someone who...

729
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
valued promises highly.

730
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,720
If something came up,

731
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,040
he would definitely inform me in advance.

732
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,600
That day I waited endlessly for him...

733
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,160
So...

734
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Ah Kai hired...

735
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
the Tui Hui Investigation Agency...

736
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,520
to help investigate.

737
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,960
I discovered that...

738
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,080
on that very day...

739
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,440
he went out wearing the formal masquerade costume.

740
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,560
Then I thought perhaps on May 3rd...

741
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,080
he went out wearing that mask...

742
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,480
to attend a...

743
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,680
masquerade ball.

744
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,440
The ball he attended was...

745
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,040
hosted by our company.

746
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,040
Because I was busy with work commitments at that time

747
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
so I only returned the next day

748
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,640
The next day I went to ask TYP

749
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,920
if he had seen

750
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,960
this person wearing a mask

751
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,520
I showed him our group photo

752
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,480
TYP said he hadn't seen him

753
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
but the way he said it was very

754
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,840
hesitant and evasive

755
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,560
I felt he was hiding something from me

756
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,160
You know what?

757
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,000
Because

758
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,160
it's that guilty conscience feeling

759
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,200
You can sense it

760
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,720
I've acted in many works about

761
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
thieves

762
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,880
Thief stories

763
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,960
Are you talking about yourself?

764
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,800
So I'm quite experienced

765
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,320
Therefore

766
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,400
when I play myself

767
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,240
I have that thief vibe

768
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,760
When this person appears, it's like

769
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,920
So whether he's lying or not

770
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,240
I can tell

771
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
Then that day

772
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,440
Since I couldn't get

773
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,280
any answers from him

774
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,760
I hired a detective agency

775
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,600
to investigate for me

776
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
Then on May 30th, the agency

777
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
sent me these photos

778
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,280
They told me

779
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,760
Golden Monkey had visited TYP

780
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,080
They had an argument

781
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,400
and then TYP killed him

782
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,120
Then he killed my best friend

783
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,080
I'll definitely make him pay with his blood

784
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,560
Right

785
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,680
So you had a motive to kill TYP

786
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,120
Yes

787
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,600
Correct

788
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,280
I've cleared my name

789
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,520
What?

790
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,160
How did you clear your name?

791
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,280
How did you manage to clear your name?

792
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,800
Your motive for killing Zidaole

793
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,600
hasn't been cleared yet

794
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,000
That's right

795
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,000
But I can confirm

796
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
that I'm not the murderer

797
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,440
A-Kai's photo album

798
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,760
revealed the identity of the masked man in formal attire

799
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,400
And Luo Luo also has a long-cherished photo album

800
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,640
This album

801
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,200
how many secrets does it hold?

802
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,000
The first photo sticker is

803
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,640
a group photo with my dear brothers

804
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes, my dear brothers

805
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,760
Then in the photo booth pictures there's

806
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,560
There's Luo Luo and this is

807
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
It's me

808
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,120
This isn't you, right?

809
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,720
Is it me or not?

810
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,120
Who?

811
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,200
This isn't you

812
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,760
It's okay, take your time. There's more.

813
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,080
Not just one "giegie" (big brother)

814
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,680
This is Minghao

815
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,200
Right

816
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,880
This is also me

817
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,240
This is me

818
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,040
This is her album with her "giegies" (big brothers)

819
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,360
This is you

820
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,200
This is Nengneng

821
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,800
Because this is real

822
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,560
Who was the first one?

823
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Well, the first one

824
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,720
The first one was truly her brother Golden Monkey

825
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,520
This is Golden Monkey

826
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
This is Golden Monkey

827
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes

828
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,240
He's my good friend

829
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,360
You probably don't remember much

830
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,880
You don't even remember your good friend

831
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,960
You don't remember your good friend

832
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,200
She probably

833
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,240
Used some beauty filters

834
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Then why did you put

835
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,880
their group photo of three

836
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,040
in this album?

837
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,520
Because

838
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,880
I have many good big brothers

839
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,480
But the one I love most in my heart

840
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,280
is still my own brother

841
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,400
I usually don't need to do anything

842
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,360
at home because he always takes care of me

843
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,560
We're from a single-parent family

844
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,320
He took on

845
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,280
the family responsibilities very early

846
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,680
That's why you see him taking small acting roles

847
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,640
Because he wants me to study better

848
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
at Tuizhen Art Academy

849
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,960
and work hard to achieve my dreams

850
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,600
while he silently supports me from behind

851
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,760
We also see that

852
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,680
Brother Minghao

853
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,520
was my

854
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
Yes, ex-boyfriend

855
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,440
So I still have some reservations

856
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,680
The photo booth pictures we took before

857
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,080
Of course, my favorite now

858
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,960
is still this Brother Nengneng beside me

859
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,480
This is the photo album of me and my brothers

860
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,840
Why buy such a thick one

861
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
when you're only putting three photos in

862
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,600
We'll take it slow

863
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
There might be other brothers later

864
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,320
There will be even more brothers

865
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,840
Like eight hundred good brothers

866
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
There's plenty of space, no worries

867
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,840
Quick, confiscate this album

868
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,960
The importance of her real brother Golden Monkey

869
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,880
to Luoluo

870
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,840
goes without saying

871
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Then comes

872
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,920
a pair of sibling-exclusive pendants

873
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,720
that makes Luoluo's murder motive

874
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,960
gradually clearer

875
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,120
On the golden monkey's exclusive pendant

876
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,360
bloodstains were found

877
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,680
Under everyone's questioning

878
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,320
Luoluo finally told everyone

879
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,680
the truth of the incident from her perspective

880
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,360
In early May

881
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,800
Luoluo and Zidaole

882
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,000
at a masquerade ball

883
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,200
witnessed TYP killing someone

884
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,240
At that time, Sister Zidaole and I happened to be taking photos

885
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,880
Then I noticed they were arguing fiercely

886
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,440
After a while, TYP actually...

887
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,920
They killed this person.

888
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Because that person was wearing a mask at the time,

889
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,600
Luoluo didn't recognize him.

890
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,360
Even under threat,

891
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,440
she helped TYP with Zidaole

892
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,520
to dispose of the body.

893
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,480
It wasn't until late May that Luoluo discovered

894
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,840
she hadn't received her brother's living allowance.

895
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,400
When she went to look for her brother,

896
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,000
she found out he had attended a ball

897
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,120
wearing formal attire and a mask

898
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,320
on May 3rd.

899
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,800
I thought that outfit

900
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
was exactly what I saw

901
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,960
on that masked man that day.

902
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,200
Did I personally bury my own brother?

903
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,080
Luoluo suspected

904
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,000
the victim that day was her brother.

905
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,120
So she hurriedly dug up the body.

906
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,000
The golden monkey pendant on the corpse

907
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,640
made Luoluo completely certain

908
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,000
that the deceased was indeed her brother.

909
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,240
That bracelet on the body

910
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,840
was my brother's golden monkey bracelet.

911
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,200
My heart turned to ashes at that moment.

912
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,400
I just knew

913
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,280
that TYP was the one who killed my brother.

914
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,760
I became extremely angry

915
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,320
and deeply saddened.

916
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,080
Yes, I wanted revenge.

917
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,000
Desperately.

918
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,520
But I'm a coward.

919
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,960
You dared to bury him,

920
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,800
yet you call yourself a coward?

921
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,280
No,

922
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,040
because I was under Zidaole's

923
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,280
coercion and manipulation.

924
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,680
I had no choice.

925
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,520
Now I can only rely on

926
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,720
TYP's company

927
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
to make my debut.

928
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,760
We're all being controlled by him.

929
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,160
Alright.

930
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,160
Alright.

931
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,600
Next, we will proceed to the X confirmation phase

932
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,160
In this episode

933
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,520
The player acting as the murderer

934
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
will face the trial of X

935
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,680
If the true murderer player

936
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,640
succeeds in the trial

937
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,760
they may then choose between the two detectives

938
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,520
to corrupt one of them

939
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,520
My eyes are the ruler

940
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,160
So happy

941
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,920
Assimilated

942
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,800
Happily became X

943
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,920
How could they return so happily?

944
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,920
Look at his expression

945
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,080
It's 100% certain

946
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,680
I'm telling you, with that expression of his

947
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
He can't hide anything

948
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,880
Is it Ru Qing trying to cover up the obvious,

949
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,080
or Neng Neng who can't hide her secrets?

950
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,200
Or perhaps there's no X in this case at all?

951
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,840
Let me keep you in suspense for now.

952
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,600
Let's continue watching.

953
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,640
After leaving the Brainstorming Hall,

954
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,320
Let's go.

955
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,720
The two detectives led everyone

956
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,520
to the TYP camping area

957
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,000
to search for more clues.

958
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,440
Here it is -

959
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,680
the "Tui Town Daily".

960
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,520
On a copy of the "Tui Town Daily",

961
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,240
they found news related to A Kai.

962
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,280
A minor actor named Biao A Yan

963
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,200
died suddenly from overwork.

964
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,600
Biao A Yan was a three-time Tui Emperor award winner

965
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,320
and A Kai's devoted fan.

966
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,120
Everyone speculated that this Biao A Yan

967
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,920
might be connected to Golden Monkey's death.

968
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,400
So I understand this Biao A Yan

969
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,160
is your brother Golden Monkey?

970
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,320
I think it's possible.

971
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,920
Biao A Yan was my brother.

972
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,720
Because I didn't actually see

973
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,440
whether the person knocked down by TYP

974
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,560
was my brother or not.

975
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,280
I only had the bracelet

976
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,080
and that set of clothes.

977
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,520
I could confirm they resembled my brother's.

978
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,680
Didn't you bury him yourself?

979
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,840
It's possible someone switched the body

980
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,200
because I was too scared

981
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,480
and couldn't bring myself

982
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,680
to lift his mask.

983
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,040
But you dug at the same spot?

984
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,400
Yes, I dug at the same spot,

985
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,040
but only found the bracelet.

986
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,640
Then,

987
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,400
everyone tried to access TYP's computer

988
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,840
but were stopped by the lock screen password.

989
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,960
If one plus one equals seven,

990
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,200
then one equals 3.5,

991
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,240
so zero would be 5.5.

992
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,280
Then 5.5 plus 5.5 equals 11.

993
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,800
No, that's wrong.

994
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,120
Let's sit for a while.

995
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
Is it 7896?

996
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,840
Because zero plus one is 9

997
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,920
Then one plus zero

998
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,760
We should just flip it

999
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,040
So it should be 6

1000
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,480
Then zero plus one equals 9

1001
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,400
Add that to one plus zero equals 6

1002
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,960
Then there's zero plus zero

1003
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Plus one plus one

1004
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,760
Equals 15

1005
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,120
Then subtract the first one plus one equals 7

1006
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,920
So zero plus zero equals 8

1007
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,960
Let's try it

1008
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,280
He really made it in

1009
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,640
Awesome, Akai

1010
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,560
As expected of a top student

1011
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,440
That's Akai for you

1012
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,520
After turning on the computer

1013
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,840
Everyone saw Akai's fan forum

1014
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,800
Biao Ayan often posted here

1015
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
Whenever he went online

1016
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,800
to express how hard things were

1017
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,720
Akai, I followed your advice

1018
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,560
I've been pushing myself to the limit

1019
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,320
Now I'm working

1020
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,440
at least ten different sets daily

1021
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,520
Action scenes, water scenes, fire scenes

1022
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,400
But my body keeps getting weaker

1023
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,960
My condition keeps worsening

1024
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,240
I can't even play a corpse properly now

1025
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,400
I can't hold onto my acting dream much longer

1026
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,920
Success feels so far away

1027
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,520
Akai would criticize him for not trying hard enough

1028
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,280
Stop thinking about being tired and giving up

1029
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,120
Have you ever considered

1030
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,600
your lack of success is due to insufficient effort

1031
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,360
Under Akai's constant "effort doctrine" pressure

1032
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,480
Biao Ayan worked continuously until sudden death

1033
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,880
A minor actor named Biao Ayan

1034
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
died suddenly from overwork

1035
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
But Akai claimed

1036
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,160
he knew nothing about these matters

1037
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,560
Did you ever meet him in real life?

1038
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,720
No, I never met him

1039
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,560
Then why keep telling him to work harder?

1040
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,800
Didn't you say you had many fans?

1041
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
He (TYP) set up for me

1042
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,120
a fan forum

1043
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,280
A fan forum, yes

1044
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,600
Now the company manages it

1045
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,880
So those weren't your words

1046
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,160
Right, the company manages it

1047
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,880
I'd never say he wasn't trying hard enough

1048
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,080
That would be so hurtful

1049
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,160
Because the forum account is company-managed

1050
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,760
Everyone remembered that Tui Zhen Daily article

1051
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,120
In a TYP interview

1052
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,960
stating his life motto:

1053
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,720
"If you haven't become a superstar yet

1054
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,400
it's definitely because you're not trying hard enough"

1055
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,240
So the "effort doctrine"

1056
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,440
used to lecture Biao Ayan was TYP's

1057
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,560
Additionally, everyone discovered that on May 31st,

1058
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,280
TYP's QQ Zone

1059
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,120
TYP had posted on his QQ Zone

1060
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,280
previewing his outfit for the school anniversary in advance.

1061
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,680
And all four suspects had viewed it.

1062
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,800
Is this each of our visitor records?

1063
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,440
We all visited it.

1064
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,120
Then Luoluo told everyone

1065
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,040
where he had buried the body at that time

1066
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,480
was in the nearby flower bed.

1067
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
The person I buried back then

1068
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,880
who I'm not sure was my brother

1069
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
is right beneath here.

1070
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,960
Everyone decided to dig up the body again

1071
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
to examine it once more.

1072
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,720
Let's dig him up now

1073
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,600
and confirm.

1074
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,800
Because I was truly terrified at the time.

1075
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,240
I touched something.

1076
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,840
Got it.

1077
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,600
A mask.

1078
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,440
No.

1079
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,840
This is the dress I bought.

1080
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
You bought the dress to give to him, right?

1081
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,240
I gave it to him.

1082
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,440
This is the one, right? Are you sure?

1083
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,840
Yes, the dress is the same.

1084
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
This mask is the same too.

1085
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,320
His fatal injury was on his head.

1086
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,120
Really?

1087
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,040
There really is.

1088
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes, there’s something here at the back.

1089
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
A fatal wound on the back of the head.

1090
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Blood.

1091
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,160
He tore his face open.

1092
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,360
So, under the mask, this person is disfigured.

1093
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,960
It looks burned, see?

1094
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,480
Buried for about...

1095
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,560
Today is June 4th, right?

1096
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,600
Over a month.

1097
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,920
Probably normal decomposition of the body.

1098
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,360
Just normal decay.

1099
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,120
So there’s no way to identify it.

1100
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,440
Check his pockets.

1101
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,680
See if there’s anything.

1102
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
Something unusual.

1103
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,600
I think I felt something.

1104
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,160
What is it?

1105
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,600
There’s a voice recorder with instructions on it.

1106
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,680
After inserting the battery, hold the play button to turn it on.

1107
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,360
After turning it on, press the play button first.

1108
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,280
It’s out of battery, right?

1109
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Yeah, no power left.

1110
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,360
We need to find a battery to replace it.

1111
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,920
Let’s go buy a battery.

1112
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,160
Tuiyi Convenience Store.

1113
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,560
Battery

1114
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,600
This is the battery, right here.

1115
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,920
It's powered on.

1116
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,240
Then press the play button first.

1117
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,360
The QQ email is:

1118
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,000
37610680453@qq.com

1119
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:15,560
Password is woshimimaxixixi

1120
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm logged in, won't forget.

1121
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,680
Sender: A-Kai

1122
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
Recipient: Golden Monkey

1123
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,600
The second last day of each month

1124
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,240
Just transfer her 1000 yuan

1125
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,880
From today onward, I leave everything to you.

1126
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
But this is very strange.

1127
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
This was sent by A-Kai.

1128
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,480
A-Kai

1129
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,280
A-Kai sent this to Golden Monkey.

1130
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,960
So I think, is A-Kai your brother?

1131
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,320
No, Golden Monkey is my brother.

1132
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,360
Then you should look at the sender.

1133
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,280
Right, see the sender is A-Kai.

1134
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
But the money came from A-Kai.

1135
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,560
Could they have switched identities?

1136
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,080
Could you be my brother?

1137
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,600
I am indeed the golden snub-nosed monkey.

1138
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,920
You are my brother.

1139
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,360
Yes, I am your older brother.

1140
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,600
Didn't I mention earlier

1141
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,640
about that IOU incident, right?

1142
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,720
Since March 2002,

1143
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,920
I started working as an extra.

1144
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
That day I wanted to find

1145
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Director Fu from TYP Entertainment

1146
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,480
to treat him to a meal

1147
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,680
and ask if he could give me

1148
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
some speaking roles.

1149
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,880
But he got me extremely drunk,

1150
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,040
and the next day I discovered

1151
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,520
that while intoxicated, I had signed

1152
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,680
this IOU.

1153
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,120
The IOU incident

1154
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Then both A-Kai's and my life

1155
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,160
were also changed because of that incident

1156
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,120
and took a different turn

1157
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,360
It specifically happened on

1158
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
July 14th, 2002

1159
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,040
At that time, the Golden Monkey transformed into A-Kai's appearance

1160
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,560
wanting to retrieve the IOU for him

1161
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,880
and help him seek justice

1162
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,600
But by coincidence that day

1163
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,240
our TYP took a liking to me

1164
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
and wanted me to play the male lead

1165
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,040
If I told him

1166
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,360
that after removing makeup I was actually the Golden Monkey

1167
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,120
I was afraid I'd lose everything

1168
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,240
Because I didn't want to be an extra anymore

1169
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,280
or play roles without lines

1170
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,960
So at that time I thought to sign the contract first

1171
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,560
and after signing

1172
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,680
I planned to go back and tell A-Kai

1173
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,040
then ask if he could help me

1174
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,360
But unexpectedly A-Kai was very willing

1175
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,240
But what happened afterward

1176
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,360
was exactly as everyone knows

1177
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,280
After July 14th, 2002

1178
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,360
A-Kai and I completely swapped identities

1179
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,720
We had to transform ourselves completely every day

1180
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
During our time as extras,

1181
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,720
he taught me many skills.

1182
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,560
The most important one

1183
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,800
was radical transformation.

1184
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,040
Making fake look real,

1185
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,080
so no one could tell the difference.

1186
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,560
So from that day on,

1187
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
you kept transforming A-Kai daily.

1188
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,480
Yes, then he had that accident.

1189
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,560
That's why I'm so heartbroken.

1190
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,520
What I saw was

1191
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,640
TYP and someone wearing

1192
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,240
that masquerade costume

1193
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,120
pushing each other over there.

1194
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,080
Then TYP pushed the masquerader

1195
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,840
onto a rock where he fell.

1196
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,120
That's how this corpse appeared.

1197
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,880
So TYP must have pushed A-Kai that day.

1198
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,800
TYP ordered me

1199
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,600
to keep this matter quiet.

1200
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,680
So TYP and

1201
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,240
A-Kai were just scuffling accidentally,

1202
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,480
that's how he died.

1203
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,240
It wasn't intentional.

1204
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,120
Manslaughter.

1205
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,600
Yes, it counts as manslaughter.

1206
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,880
I got goosebumps

1207
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,400
What's going on?

1208
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,000
Let's go check outside

1209
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,040
Let's go

1210
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,400
Someone's here... I can sense it

1211
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,000
It seems to be coming from this way

1212
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,640
This way

1213
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,520
The laundry room

1214
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,440
Bloody footprints

1215
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,480
Oh my god

1216
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,880
The laundry room has creepy urban legends

1217
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,120
I don't believe it

1218
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,560
You go

1219
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,520
So could there be someone inside the drum?

1220
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,200
Here

1221
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,600
There's light

1222
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,360
There's light here

1223
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,200
Come, let me hold your hand first

1224
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,640
Don't move

1225
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,120
Over there, someone's at the door

1226
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,480
T-Rex

1227
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,640
This is

1228
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,880
This is a T-Rex

1229
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,480
Are you okay?

1230
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,120
You alright?

1231
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,680
I fell down

1232
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,320
Are you hurt from the fall?

1233
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,040
I was afraid you'd step on me

1234
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,920
Everyone was shocked by the unexpected sight

1235
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,160
But soon calmed down

1236
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,200
Let's look for clues

1237
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,440
Laundry room complaint book

1238
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,680
I want to complain about the far right machine in the second row

1239
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,720
That washing machine

1240
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,160
Every time I wash clothes, there are dirty footprints

1241
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
This means there's a passage behind it

1242
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,960
There's more behind

1243
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,080
That machine's code is strange

1244
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,560
I tried decoding it

1245
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,480
Didn't expect to find something

1246
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,320
But I'm afraid to check

1247
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,920
Code number

1248
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,440
01010100

1249
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,160
Binary

1250
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,080
I can calculate

1251
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,000
Got a pen?

1252
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,080
Yes

1253
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,200
Add one to each

1254
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:26,840
Right

1255
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,800
Should be 0101

1256
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,720
Then

1257
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,360
01   0  0

1258
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,440
This is T

1259
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,920
Then what?

1260
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,600
01001011

1261
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,320
This one

1262
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,040
K

1263
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,560
1000

1264
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,600
01000

1265
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,200
This one

1266
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,880
D

1267
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,320
This is G

1268
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,680
T

1269
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,320
K

1270
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,720
D

1271
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,440
G

1272
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,200
Come on, let's try

1273
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,440
T

1274
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,200
K

1275
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,080
D

1276
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,160
G

1277
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,960
Okay, it's open

1278
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,680
It lit up

1279
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
It's open, the door's opening

1280
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,920
Quickly deciphered the washing machine's mechanism code

1281
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,800
Entered a secret room called "Tweaker Empire"

1282
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,560
Tweaker Empire

1283
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,840
Let's go in and check

1284
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,480
It's safe

1285
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
Yes, safe

1286
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,960
So many files

1287
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,800
Everyone searched through the folders

1288
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,720
And found a group photo of four people

1289
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,360
Founders of Tweaker Empire

1290
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,360
Even though two faces were scratched out

1291
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,080
Zhuocheng recognized them at first glance

1292
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,440
Actually, I know them

1293
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,840
When I first joined the class

1294
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,160
I had three particularly close friends

1295
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,840
One was Xiaoxi

1296
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,480
One was Xiaonan

1297
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,560
And one was Xiaowei

1298
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,080
Xiaowei was a girl

1299
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,280
These two are Xiaoxi

1300
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,320
and Xiaonan

1301
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,520
But I don't know this person

1302
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,680
So you don't know this man?

1303
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,200
I don't remember him either

1304
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,360
Don't stare at the photo

1305
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,920
Or you might gain an extra classmate

1306
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,880
Then Ruqing found in the folder

1307
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,480
A Tweaker Empire introduction card

1308
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,880
From this they learned

1309
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,520
Tweaker Empire was founded in October 2001

1310
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,240
by four tech geeks

1311
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,360
Later developing multiple business lines

1312
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,480
Including an encrypted online community of the same name

1313
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,440
Even expanding into "Little Killer"

1314
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,000
and supernatural story sections

1315
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,400
So it's a dark web

1316
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,000
So they logged into the Tweaker Empire forum

1317
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,240
This Tweaker Empire website

1318
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,520
You can try logging in

1319
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,240
And found a post in the Little Killer section

1320
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,560
High reward for a method

1321
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,920
Requires 100% success and escape

1322
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,600
June 3rd

1323
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,000
Next page

1324
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,280
Anonymous User 555

1325
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,680
I can provide the method for free

1326
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,400
Then what do you want?

1327
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
I need your help

1328
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,720
Because at the same time and place

1329
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,680
I want someone dead

1330
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,520
DM for details

1331
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,960
According to the post

1332
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,760
The conversation between OP and Anonymous 555

1333
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,880
Everyone thinks

1334
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,440
It's likely two people killed two others

1335
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,480
So there are two killers

1336
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,240
Currently it appears

1337
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,280
555 and 111

1338
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,160
One wants to kill

1339
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,560
One wants to provide the method

1340
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,560
There's also the possibility of one hiring a killer

1341
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,280
And another actually killing two people

1342
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,200
Or hiring, hiring a killer

1343
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,640
Then possibly the killer was killed by that person

1344
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,920
He helped him

1345
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,600
This one says "I want the other person dead"

1346
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,120
That person is TYP

1347
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,920
What if the two people they want to kill

1348
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
happen to be the same person?

1349
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,480
Piano

1350
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:48,680
Hurry up

1351
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,760
The piano is playing

1352
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,600
Everyone rushes to check

1353
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,880
But it's different from what they saw earlier

1354
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,120
Move it a bit

1355
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,840
I'll do it

1356
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,760
Wait a moment

1357
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,680
Let's see if we can turn this on

1358
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,400
What is this?

1359
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,920
It's playing now

1360
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,560
Timer speaker

1361
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,760
It says "timer" on the back

1362
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,840
6:20 PM

1363
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,280
Why is it playing now?

1364
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,120
Last time and this time

1365
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,680
Is there any difference?

1366
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,840
Last time, everything here was moving

1367
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:25,760
Right

1368
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,480
It's not this timer speaker playing

1369
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,280
Why was it that when they entered,

1370
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,680
they found TYP dead

1371
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,520
with the piano keys still moving?

1372
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,160
Can that key really move like that?

1373
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,880
Let's go check the props warehouse.

1374
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,360
Are there any urban legends?

1375
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,960
The prop warehouse has no urban legends.

1376
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,120
You can enter without worry.

1377
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,680
Performance costumes

1378
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,200
There are traces of stepping inside this cabinet.

1379
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,880
Should have hidden in the closet from the start

1380
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,360
Yeah, I think so too

1381
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,680
The first person they had

1382
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,720
The killer is hiding in the cabinet.

1383
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,560
Is this the primary crime scene?

1384
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,960
It might be the primary crime scene.

1385
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,080
At least he was knocked unconscious here.

1386
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Based on our deduction,

1387
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,640
They were all transported there after they died

1388
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,520
Is this blood?

1389
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,920
Really?

1390
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,840
There are bloodstains that were wiped away.

1391
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,640
Yes, there are drag marks.

1392
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,680
I'm certain that inside here must be

1393
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,440
either hiding the murderer

1394
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,120
or it once contained the victim

1395
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,280
There's no bloodstain in the cabinet

1396
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,280
meaning the murderer hid inside it

1397
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,880
Zidaole, come over here

1398
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,960
The killer murdered her.

1399
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,480
Then cleaned up the bloodstains on the floor.

1400
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,640
Because that surveillance camera can't capture Gate 3.

1401
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,000
Gate 3 leads directly here.

1402
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,960
This camera has a blind spot.

1403
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,720
It can't see Gate 3.

1404
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,840
You can check.

1405
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,640
You can review the camera's blind spot.

1406
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,560
The hallway camera is here.

1407
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,000
Right.

1408
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,120
It doesn't cover Gate 3.

1409
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,440
Correct.

1410
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,880
Someone could enter directly through Gate 3.

1411
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,120
Then the killer hid there.

1412
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,680
Yes.

1413
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,560
Is it possible that...

1414
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,520
The killer could have escaped through here too.

1415
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,120
After committing the murder,

1416
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,120
he could have fled this way.

1417
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,200
Easy access in and out.

1418
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,680
Because this area isn't covered - it's a blind spot.

1419
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,120
There should be other clues.

1420
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,120
Here

1421
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,840
I really can't stand it

1422
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,000
Here is a dedicated manual for the training room.

1423
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,320
Why did you appear here?

1424
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Special use

1425
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:22,760
Notebook

1426
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,080
"Meteor Shower" sounds so beautiful.

1427
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,840
At this moment, the investigators noticed classmate Xiao Ren

1428
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,400
entering the small auditorium

1429
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:33,880
Xiao Ren

1430
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,200
He was the only witness

1431
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,280
inside the auditorium before the incident

1432
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,320
Everyone quickly followed into the auditorium

1433
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,880
to question Xiao Ren

1434
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,000
Who handed you this box?

1435
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,840
This is how it happened.

1436
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,320
All these boxes here...

1437
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,840
were moved by me.

1438
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,440
And this box was originally packed by me too,

1439
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,840
but one box was unusually heavy.

1440
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,880
That person told me,

1441
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,560
"It's nothing,"

1442
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,200
"this just contains all the props"

1443
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,280
"you need for your performance."

1444
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,960
Who?

1445
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,440
Who gave it to you?

1446
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,640
Let me think...

1447
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,760
Was it Ah Kai or...

1448
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,840
Do these two people look alike

1449
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,320
These two

1450
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,200
A'Kai and Minghao

1451
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,520
I'm a bit face-blind, honestly.

1452
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,000
Are there any more distinctive features?

1453
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,720
I don't really seem to remember.

1454
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,440
At that time,

1455
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
Xiao Ren, who's face-blind,

1456
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,520
only remembers someone who gave him a cabinet.

1457
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,680
Even knowing it was duplicated, they said it was fine,

1458
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,400
but can't recall who it actually was.

1459
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,560
No further information was obtained from Xiao Ren.

1460
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,480
Everyone could only proceed to solve the dance room's password first.

1461
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,080
Come on, let's solve this password.

1462
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,040
The password relates to musical notation.

1463
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,520
"Meteor Shower"

1464
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,000
It's about the rhythm, right?

1465
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,560
"Let me take you to see the meteor shower"

1466
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,040
"Falling on this earth"

1467
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,840
I think it should be

1468
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,480
We need to deduce this red part.

1469
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,800
The red part is circled.

1470
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,040
Then input what corresponds to the red part.

1471
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,040
Let me play it.

1472
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,920
Finally, with Minghao playing,

1473
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,480
everyone found the password.

1474
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,960
The dance room was opened.

1475
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,160
Up.

1476
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,720
SHANG.

1477
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,160
Surveillance footage

1478
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,600
Check the surveillance footage

1479
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,640
June 3rd

1480
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,480
Who

1481
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,040
This is

1482
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,960
Zidaole

1483
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,240
She went to the props room

1484
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,840
TYP

1485
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,400
Went straight to the props room too

1486
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,960
They agreed to meet there

1487
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,720
The first one is A-Kai

1488
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,520
Right, A-Kai arrived at 2 PM

1489
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,320
A-Kai

1490
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,240
A-Kai pushed him out

1491
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,400
You didn’t see

1492
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:08,880
I didn’t see

1493
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,280
New surveillance footage

1494
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,040
has provided everyone with new leads

1495
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,840
Everyone speculates

1496
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,360
that perhaps TYP killed Zidaole

1497
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,640
hid her in the cabinet

1498
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,720
then escaped by hiding behind an accomplice's easel

1499
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,280
TYP killed Zidaole

1500
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,920
put Zidaole in a box

1501
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,280
then hid it in the cabinet

1502
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,960
hid in the cabinet

1503
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,280
then concealed in the cabinet

1504
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,520
Let's continue watching first

1505
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,040
At 2:30 PM, Luo Luo arrived

1506
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,720
At 2:35 PM

1507
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,520
casually pushed the painting through

1508
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,320
So if at this time

1509
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,400
someone committed murder

1510
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,280
they would still be hiding inside, right?

1511
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,480
Because they didn't pass by

1512
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,480
Right

1513
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,520
Wait, if someone passed through

1514
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,400
the surveillance would have caught them

1515
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,880
If they ran, they'd definitely pass through here

1516
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,840
Exactly, it's impossible that

1517
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,200
they crawled away stealthily like this

1518
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,560
This glass is empty

1519
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,600
Zhuocheng comes out at 3 PM

1520
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,600
Zhuocheng and Minghao

1521
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,560
Because they seemed to struggle more while pushing

1522
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,800
They became the prime suspects

1523
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,920
Did you help TYP escape?

1524
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,200
So it's possible they assisted later

1525
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,280
There might have been someone hanging behind

1526
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,720
3:35 PM

1527
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,080
He pushed a very heavy prop cabinet

1528
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,680
Wait, how can you tell it was heavy?

1529
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,320
I was just pushing normally

1530
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,480
Compare it to A'Kai

1531
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,800
Maybe A-Kai is stronger

1532
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,600
Maybe he's stronger

1533
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,400
Am I weak then?

1534
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,240
Then it should be

1535
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,040
I'm not as strong

1536
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,480
Then Minghao must have pushed the heavier box

1537
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,680
The box with the corpse went through

1538
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,560
It must be

1539
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,680
I don't know

1540
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,800
It definitely is

1541
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,680
See for yourself, come look

1542
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,920
Did you push with all your strength?

1543
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,680
Your box was heavier than others'

1544
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,560
But it's possible

1545
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,760
Because the prop room had two cabinets initially

1546
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,640
Maybe it was in one of them

1547
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,560
The two of us might have placed them randomly

1548
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:50,880
Right

1549
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,800
Pushed randomly

1550
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,160
No, you two handed them directly to Xiao Ren

1551
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,640
You gave them directly to him

1552
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,640
So it was my box

1553
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,640
that might have been heavier

1554
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,280
Yours was heavier

1555
00:56:59,280 --> 00:56:59,800
Yes

1556
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,680
Right

1557
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,200
But why did you deny it earlier?

1558
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,920
No, because I've never pushed any other prop boxes before.

1559
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,760
Just as everyone was heatedly discussing,

1560
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,720
Xiao Ren reappeared carrying an iron bucket.

1561
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:14,800
Xiao Ren is back again.

1562
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,680
The school strictly prohibits open flames.

1563
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,520
Why are you all

1564
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,160
playing with fire by the Wukenai River?

1565
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,080
No, we weren't.

1566
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,680
What are you talking about?

1567
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,680
Which one of you did this?

1568
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,800
Luckily I reacted quickly

1569
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,560
and put it out with a bucket of water.

1570
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,840
The face-blind Xiao Ren left angrily.

1571
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,320
Although she hadn't recognized earlier

1572
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,400
who the person pushing the cabinet was,

1573
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,680
this bucket of water Xiao Ren used to put out the fire

1574
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,720
actually helped everyone greatly.

1575
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,240
Clearly, the bucket contained

1576
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,520
what the murderer originally wanted to burn.

1577
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,160
But now it wasn't completely burned.

1578
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,040
After everyone examined the clues in the bucket one by one,

1579
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,440
they found it contained the murder weapon used to kill Zidaole -

1580
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,040
an awl stored in the prop warehouse.

1581
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Isn't this the murder weapon?

1582
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,400
And the poison used to kill TYP -

1583
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,680
"Perfume is poisonous."

1584
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,000
Too much spray is a deadly temptation.

1585
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,800
Use with caution.

1586
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,040
When the poison takes effect, the lips immediately turn black.

1587
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,320
Along with the poison was

1588
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,320
the gas mask the murderer wore

1589
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,200
for protection.

1590
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,320
There was also a small note arranging to meet TYP.

1591
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,400
The content was about meeting TYP

1592
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,320
Meet at the piano room at 11:30 AM

1593
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,200
Need to talk privately about something important

1594
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,920
Who's looking for him at 11:30 AM?

1595
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,800
Lastly, there was a matching formal suit and top hat like TYP's

1596
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,760
The murderer is burning the evidence

1597
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,600
Then I think the murderer was pretending to be TYP

1598
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,200
Right, because there were two sets of clothes

1599
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,120
Because someone impersonated TYP to enter

1600
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,400
So the TYP we saw

1601
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,200
wasn't the real TYP

1602
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,040
but the killer

1603
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,480
The one at 1:10 PM

1604
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,520
was likely an imposter

1605
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,040
Right

1606
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,320
The real TYP

1607
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,360
had already died

1608
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,400
at 11:30 AM

1609
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,680
Correct

1610
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,680
Because no one had entered the piano room

1611
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,680
Yes

1612
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,680
until we heard the piano room's bell

1613
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,280
The killer told TYP

1614
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,640
"Meet me in the piano room at 11:30 AM"

1615
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,120
"I have something important to discuss privately"

1616
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,920
That's when they eliminated TYP

1617
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,440
Right

1618
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,440
So there was no need to move the body

1619
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,600
Then the killer impersonated TYP

1620
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,240
wearing his clothes

1621
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,000
and entered at 1:10 PM

1622
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,240
the prop room

1623
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:31,840
Yes

1624
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,920
and killed that Zidaole

1625
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,480
Correct

1626
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,160
Did you see that live stream footage?

1627
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,080
There was a quick glimpse of TYP entering.

1628
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,520
The live stream was from 12:00 to 12:30 noon.

1629
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,360
Just to notify everyone.

1630
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,800
The principal hopes that during the June 3rd anniversary celebration,

1631
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,520
our company's artists can do a promotional live stream for the school.

1632
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,640
A special live broadcast.

1633
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,920
I agreed to it.

1634
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,520
Akai, Luoluo, Zhuocheng,

1635
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,000
the three of you will do the live stream at the school's front plaza.

1636
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,920
The time is from 12:00 to 12:30 noon.

1637
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,080
In a QQ group.

1638
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,640
Yes, it's this group here.

1639
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,080
Next page, sweetie.

1640
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,000
Yes, this one.

1641
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,240
Brothers and sisters,

1642
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,280
let me introduce myself again.

1643
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,720
I'm Luoluo,

1644
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,280
and also a sophomore at

1645
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,200
Tui Zhen Arts College.

1646
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,640
Our Tui Zhen Arts College

1647
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,200
can be said to be

1648
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,040
TYP came from

1649
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,680
from the

1650
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,680
over there.

1651
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,920
He came out from the piano room area.

1652
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,040
What time was this?

1653
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,200
There's no timestamp here.

1654
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,120
No, her live stream time

1655
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:28,840
My live stream time

1656
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,760
was between 12:00 and 12:30 noon.

1657
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,200
Between 12:00 and 12:30 noon.

1658
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,320
While the three of us were live streaming,

1659
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,680
I glanced and saw

1660
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,680
our boss TYP

1661
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,760
entering our building.

1662
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,600
So I can understand that TYP arrived at the piano room

1663
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,840
at 11:30 AM.

1664
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,600
It's the one we saw

1665
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,560
The one we saw during the livestream

1666
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,840
It was a fake TYP

1667
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,800
He could wear TYP's clothes to impersonate him

1668
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,200
Yes

1669
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,840
Because he and the deceased TYP

1670
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,800
had the exact same

1671
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,280
clothing size

1672
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,400
Both were size 175

1673
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:02,960
Exactly

1674
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,400
But who could disguise themselves?

1675
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,600
During our extra work

1676
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,840
he taught me many skills

1677
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,000
The most important one was radical transformation

1678
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,920
A-Kai can disguise himself

1679
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,120
He can radically transform

1680
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,360
A-Kai can disguise himself

1681
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:18,960
No

1682
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,560
The key is we didn't see the front face

1683
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,680
I was about to say we couldn't see the front face either

1684
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,800
No, at that time A-Kai, me and Luo Luo

1685
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,120
we three were livestreaming

1686
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,640
But there was someone

1687
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,400
who appeared as TYP

1688
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,280
Meaning while we three were present

1689
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,680
there was an extra person

1690
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,120
And this TYP was most likely fake

1691
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,400
So who was absent?

1692
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,960
First, both me and Neng Neng were

1693
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,320
rehearsing musical lines

1694
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,280
You two were investigating

1695
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,680
That's what I was going to say

1696
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,000
It was between 12:00 and 12:30 noon

1697
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,400
The three of us were definitely livestreaming together

1698
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,120
Right, so you two are cleared

1699
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,400
So who wasn't present?

1700
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,120
Only Minghao

1701
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,360
Why don't you just confess?

1702
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,840
I was at our rehearsal from 10 to 11 am

1703
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,800
for our practice session

1704
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,240
After rehearsal, I went to eat

1705
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,400
at that Tui Haochi Restaurant

1706
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,680
But there was such a long line

1707
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,000
I waited forever in line

1708
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,800
Ended up at 1 pm

1709
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,840
Only finished eating and returned at 3:30 pm

1710
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,520
Came back just in time for the box-pushing

1711
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,320
Yes, that was me

1712
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,000
I went straight to the box-pushing when I got back

1713
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,240
Anyway, I think you're the most suspicious now

1714
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,120
Because these two have

1715
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,240
All three were livestreaming

1716
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,600
And we two were at rehearsal

1717
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,720
With this situation

1718
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,120
I was out eating

1719
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,760
Since he won't admit it

1720
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,600
Then it can only be

1721
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,040
TYP was still awake at 12 noon

1722
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,600
Are you helping Minghao?

1723
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,120
How could that be?

1724
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,400
Not helping me doesn't mean

1725
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,440
she's the bad one

1726
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,680
You two

1727
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,400
Him

1728
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,160
It's him

1729
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,200
He's been turned

1730
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,240
And was pretending to be TYP

1731
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,760
So how long are you going to keep hiding?

1732
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,080
The most suspicious one.

1733
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,880
Moreover, between 11 AM and 12 PM,

1734
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,440
he has no alibi.

1735
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,120
Kick him out.

1736
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,600
Ouch.

1737
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,880
Did I kill them?

1738
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,080
After some argument,

1739
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:26,960
Zhuocheng is certain

1740
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,320
that the TYP in the livestream

1741
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,440
must be Minghao, the only one absent, in disguise.

1742
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,720
He successfully convinces everyone to suspect Minghao.

1743
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,720
It can only be Minghao.

1744
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,720
He's already exposed himself.

1745
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,040
So after you've cleared me of suspicion,

1746
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,640
no one wants to ask me a few questions?

1747
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,040
Ask.

1748
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,400
You can't hide it anymore.

1749
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,400
Minghao admits that he

1750
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,720
is the killer who disguised himself as TYP.

1751
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,640
I actually wanted both of them dead

1752
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,960
because one wanted to ruin my reputation,

1753
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,400
and the other wanted me to pay a huge compensation.

1754
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,400
So I killed them both.

1755
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,000
and confessed to his preparations and the crime process

1756
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,840
I wanted both of them dead

1757
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,440
Then I went on the dark web

1758
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,640
So you're Anonymous User 111

1759
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,600
Yes, I was the thread starter

1760
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,080
Paid heavily for methods

1761
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,520
Required 100% success with escape

1762
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,200
June 3rd

1763
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,760
Then I learned from Anonymous User 555

1764
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,160
the techniques for killing

1765
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,400
555 and 111

1766
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,320
One wanted to kill

1767
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,080
One wanted to provide the methods

1768
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,600
Because the building's surveillance

1769
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,520
was activated at noon

1770
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,880
So before noon

1771
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,200
I prepared a set of

1772
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,880
clothes identical to TYP's

1773
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,640
I lured him to the music room

1774
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,760
then sprayed him to death

1775
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,520
After killing him

1776
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,080
I changed his clothes

1777
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,080
then walked right past you

1778
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:50,920
After passing by

1779
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,640
I messaged Zidaole

1780
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,320
to lure her here

1781
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,760
then killed her at that location

1782
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,600
I could actually hide in those three

1783
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,840
the first two paintings and that one with the car

1784
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,200
and emerge from any one of them

1785
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,880
Then I used that blind spot in the surveillance

1786
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,080
exited through Gate 3

1787
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,080
changed into my own clothes

1788
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,160
then re-entered through Gate 2

1789
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,080
After that, I moved Zidaole over there

1790
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,080
So Anonymous User 555 was an accomplice

1791
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,160
and is still hiding among us

1792
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,520
Let's start deducing

1793
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,400
Time to deduce

1794
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,400
I think the accomplice is more likely to be A-Kai.

1795
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,640
Because A-Kai knows disguise techniques.

1796
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,960
But in all our surveillance footage,

1797
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,400
it's always TYP's back view.

1798
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,840
Never showing the face.

1799
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,320
But who is 555?

1800
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,720
That remains questionable.

1801
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,200
Right.

1802
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,200
But from the netizen's perspective,

1803
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,720
they didn't know he wanted to kill two people.

1804
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,720
Yes, how would he...

1805
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,520
He only knew I wanted to kill someone.

1806
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,400
It just happened that his target

1807
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,280
was included in my two targets.

1808
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,640
I think the other netizen 555

1809
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,280
must be Luo Luo.

1810
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,640
She wanted to kill that Zi Daole.

1811
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:17,960
Right.

1812
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,960
Then they made some kind of deal.

1813
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,080
Even if they wanted to kill different people,

1814
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:22,840
it's possible.

1815
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,600
Because he didn't know the method.

1816
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,040
Maybe she said "I'll provide the method,

1817
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,200
then you help me kill someone."

1818
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,120
So he was the sole killer.

1819
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,080
And after he killed the boss,

1820
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,200
his contract was already void.

1821
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,280
Why kill Zi Daole then?

1822
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,640
Because she provided him the method.

1823
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,640
So he had to fulfill their deal.

1824
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,200
"Help me kill her (Zi Daole)."

1825
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,280
So 555 is you, Luo Luo?

1826
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,520
555 isn't me.

1827
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,280
It's not me.

1828
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,960
I believe you don't have the actual

1829
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,880
capability to commit the crime.

1830
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,200
You might only be able to do it through indirect means.

1831
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,520
I did want to kill TYP,

1832
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,040
but as you can see,

1833
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,200
I was live streaming at that time.

1834
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,080
I think Luo Luo's motive for killing is very clear.

1835
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,320
First of all,

1836
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,520
she has her own brothers'

1837
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,960
memory album.

1838
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,880
She confused sibling affection

1839
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
with romantic love.

1840
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,960
Then it's gone.

1841
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,640
You're just substitutes for my brother.

1842
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,080
Trash.

1843
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,080
Anyway,

1844
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,760
romantic love and sibling affection,

1845
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,080
she has this confusion.

1846
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,880
Actually, she's a bit mentally unstable.

1847
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,880
Secondly,

1848
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,880
she sent Minghao a heart

1849
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,120
in the chat, right?

1850
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,240
That was just a random reply from me.

1851
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,000
She deliberately led Minghao to kill.

1852
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,520
Emotionally,

1853
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,560
because he still loves her.

1854
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,880
Yes.

1855
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,280
Then what am I to you?

1856
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,280
I rushed to break up with him

1857
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,560
just to be with you.

1858
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,400
Then why would I do this?

1859
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,400
It wasn't to be with me.

1860
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,400
It's because I saw you broke up with Minghao,

1861
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,040
so I pursued you and you agreed.

1862
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:14,680
I'm just

1863
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,280
your emotional filler, okay?

1864
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,640
You remember these three words very well.

1865
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:21,800
Right?

1866
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,760
Okay, watch this part carefully.

1867
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,280
I think she might be the mastermind.

1868
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,160
Think about it, she had the omniscient view.

1869
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,040
First she made him think

1870
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,280
there might be a chance to reconcile.

1871
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,160
Then he told her he wanted to go solo,

1872
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,560
which made Zidaole angry.

1873
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,160
Then came a series of events -

1874
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,000
killing by proxy.

1875
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,800
In my view, she has the strongest motive and suspicion.

1876
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,280
If you really think it's me,

1877
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,160
then how would I know

1878
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,520
about the perfume?

1879
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,040
Besides, I hate him so much

1880
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,240
I'd definitely want to kill him myself, right?

1881
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,480
Why would I need someone else to kill him

1882
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,520
for me?

1883
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,640
But you said earlier

1884
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,760
you were too scared,

1885
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,480
Yes, I was just going to mention that.

1886
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,800
She's actually too scared to take revenge,

1887
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,760
even though she knows who the enemy is,

1888
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,280
she doesn't have the courage to act.

1889
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,240
So she provides the method and gets someone else to do it.

1890
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,760
You guys should interrogate Akai again

1891
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,520
Interrogate Akai once more

1892
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,880
Akai's clear eyes just want to sleep

1893
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,400
Wants to sleep, wants to clock out

1894
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,360
Both of them wanted to kill Zidaole together

1895
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,960
With that TYP guy

1896
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,760
He probably hates TYP more

1897
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,640
Because he saw

1898
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,160
Who?

1899
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:39,640
You

1900
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,880
You saw that video

1901
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,000
The photo even had "Blood debt must be repaid" written on the back

1902
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,760
But you should know TYP is his boss.

1903
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,360
No.

1904
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,760
Boss or not doesn't matter, I'm the Film Emperor.

1905
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,120
I have money and fame.

1906
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,000
Why bother?

1907
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,040
It was TYP who chose you.

1908
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,040
He's your benefactor.

1909
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,760
It doesn't matter, I'm already the Film Emperor now.

1910
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,280
Even if I send him to prison, I'll still be the Film Emperor.

1911
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,520
You ungrateful person.

1912
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,240
Now we all know the murderer is Minghao.

1913
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,240
Because of A'Kai's earlier statement.

1914
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,120
I think he's already somewhat.

1915
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,280
Cleared of suspicion.

1916
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,480
For now, I might cast my vote for you.

1917
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,880
And him.

1918
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,960
I think the murderer is Minghao.

1919
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,640
And the accomplice 555 is Luoluo.

1920
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,280
After A'Kai changed his identity.

1921
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,360
He probably didn't have much murderous intent.

1922
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,640
To do this thing.

1923
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,880
Because his ultimate goal.

1924
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,960
Was to stop being an extra.

1925
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,240
Or to gain everyone's attention.

1926
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,520
He's already achieved that now.

1927
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,520
So he has no reason.

1928
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,000
To commit other murders.

1929
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,520
And I clearly know I'm not.

1930
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,240
So it must be.

1931
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,280
I think the murderer is Minghao and the accomplice is Zhuocheng.

1932
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,520
I think Zhuocheng really wanted to on June 3rd.

1933
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,040
Commit murder.

1934
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,760
Because on June 3rd, Zidaole threatened him.

1935
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,960
To expose his other affairs that day.

1936
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,520
You've wronged me.

1937
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,880
I'll make you, who became famous overnight, lose everything.

1938
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,880
Right on the school anniversary day.

1939
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,400
Secondly, I keep thinking about this murder weapon.

1940
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,520
Because Zidaole.

1941
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,840
Zidaole was here.

1942
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,040
Stabbed in the chest with this sharp weapon.

1943
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,880
And when he was framed for murder by Zidaole.

1944
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,840
He was also holding something in his hand.

1945
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,960
I don't know if it's some kind of vengeful mentality

1946
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,880
He used the same weapon to kill people

1947
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,760
Let me explain first

1948
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,000
At first I was just an extra, right?

1949
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,640
Later, for my own benefit

1950
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,000
I made A-Kai switch identities with me

1951
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,040
Actually, I'm a somewhat selfish person

1952
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,760
What I wanted...

1953
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,160
More than anything, I wanted fame and money

1954
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,640
And in the end I got them

1955
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,720
There's no way I would...

1956
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,000
For the real A-Kai's sake

1957
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,120
Go and kill someone

1958
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,240
As for 555, I think...

1959
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,360
I suspect it's Zhuocheng

1960
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,360
I've never actually seen 555

1961
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,600
I just learned some techniques from him

1962
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,520
So you don't know who 555 is either, right?

1963
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,640
Right, so I might have to rely on

1964
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,880
everyone's deductions

1965
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,280
to guess who 555 is

1966
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,000
Let's vote

1967
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,600
Voting rules for this case

1968
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,160
There are two victims in this case

1969
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,480
The real killer(s) could be one or two people

1970
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,720
When players vote

1971
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,040
They need to vote separately for

1972
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,600
who killed Zidaole

1973
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,600
and who killed TYP

1974
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,320
Each player's two votes

1975
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,480
will be counted as one voting set

1976
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,320
Game victory conditions

1977
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,240
Whether there's one or two real killers

1978
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,560
the outcome will be determined

1979
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,280
based on the voting sets

1980
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,720
If the real killer(s) receive

1981
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,280
fewer votes than other suspects

1982
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,560
then the killer(s) and X win

1983
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,240
Otherwise

1984
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,000
players who voted correctly win

1985
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,800
The killer of Zidaole is

1986
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,320
Minghao

1987
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,480
I vote for Minghao

1988
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,240
Minghao first

1989
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,760
disguised himself as TYP

1990
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,160
and entered the prop room with Zidaole

1991
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,800
Then used that awl

1992
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,800
to kill Zidaole

1993
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,160
and hid the body in a prop cabinet

1994
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,640
He then hid in the cabinet

1995
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,720
waiting to be carried out

1996
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:44,720
That's all

1997
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,720
The one who killed TYP was also Minghao.

1998
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,720
I voted for Minghao.

1999
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,800
Because Minghao impersonated TYP.

2000
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,720
At 11:30 in the morning,

2001
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,880
he arranged to meet the real TYP in the piano room.

2002
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,600
Then he killed TYP with perfume spray.

2003
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,360
Then he ran away through that door over there.

2004
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,440
The one who killed Zidale was Minghao.

2005
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,880
Because it's obvious he's the murderer.

2006
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,800
And he had a strong motive.

2007
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,960
The one who killed TYP is Zhuocheng.

2008
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,800
Because he's highly suspected of helping Minghao.

2009
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,720
My vote today

2010
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,600
was cast here for Minghao.

2011
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,720
I think Minghao killed Zidaole.

2012
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,440
I still voted for Minghao this time.

2013
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:54,320
But Minghao's accomplice is Akai.

2014
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,920
I believe Minghao killed TYP.

2015
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,200
I think the killer of Zidaole is

2016
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,440
I still think he's a bit suspicious

2017
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,840
The one who killed Zidaole is

2018
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,160
This method can increase our chances of winning

2019
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,200
Next, we will announce

2020
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,160
the voting results from all players

2021
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,720
There are three voting patterns today.

2022
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,680
The first voting pattern is:

2023
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,360
Minghao killed both victims.

2024
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,760
The second voting pattern is:

2025
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,800
Minghao killed TYP.

2026
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,600
Zhuocheng killed Zidaole.

2027
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,720
The third voting pattern is:

2028
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,640
Minghao killed Zidaole.

2029
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,360
Zhuocheng killed TYP.

2030
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,680
The vote type with the highest count today is

2031
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,680
Minghao double kill

2032
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,400
Thank you everyone

2033
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,560
I vote for Minghao.

2034
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,960
The one who killed TYP is also Minghao.

2035
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,680
Here, the vote goes to Minghao.

2036
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,880
I still cast this vote for Minghao.

2037
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,160
The murderer is Minghao.

2038
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:44,960
Minghao.

2039
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,000
The one who killed TYP is Zhuocheng.

2040
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,440
The one who killed Zidaole is Minghao.

2041
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,520
I vote that Zhuocheng killed TYP.

2042
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,760
The one who killed Zidaole is...

2043
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:01,760
It was me.

2044
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,440
According to the rules, in case of a tie...

2045
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,880
we would lose, right?

2046
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,760
So we thought of guessing someone else...

2047
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,440
that might get votes.

2048
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,080
Then we'd help push that vote count up...

2049
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
and then we'd win.

2050
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,720
I declare the culprit in this case is...

2051
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,200
Failure

2052
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,320
The real culprit is

2053
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,320
The killer of Zidaole is

2054
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,200
Minghao

2055
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,520
The killer of TYP is

2056
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:50,760
Akai

2057
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,320
I am a bad person

2058
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,440
Didn’t expect that, did you?

2059
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,840
I actually wanted both of them dead.

2060
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,160
Because one wanted to ruin my reputation,

2061
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,600
and the other wanted me to pay a huge compensation.

2062
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,600
So I killed both of them.

2063
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,960
Even if two people want to kill different targets,

2064
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:27,720
it's still possible.

2065
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,480
Because he didn't know the method,

2066
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,920
maybe she said, "I'll provide you the method,

2067
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,080
then you help me kill someone else."

2068
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,200
So it was actually him who did all the killing.

2069
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,200
Moreover, after he killed the boss,

2070
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,160
his contract was already void.

2071
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,320
Why did he still kill Zidaole?

2072
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,440
Because she provided him the method,

2073
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,480
so she made him fulfill their deal.

2074
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,000
"You help me kill him,"

2075
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,640
You should reconsider A-Kai's role.

2076
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,200
But you must understand TYP was his boss.

2077
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:51,800
No,

2078
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,200
boss or not doesn't matter—I'm a superstar.

2079
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,560
I have money and fame.

2080
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,440
Why bother?

2081
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,240
Is there an X factor in this case?

2082
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,880
There's no X in this case.

2083
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,000
Suspected for so long

2084
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,320
What's wrong?

2085
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,560
The key point is actually

2086
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,560
Because in my memory, I know I killed someone

2087
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,240
And left many clues behind

2088
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,880
So I thought everyone

2089
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,960
Would definitely know I committed murder

2090
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,760
Since everyone knew I killed someone

2091
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:33,640
I decided to take full responsibility

2092
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,240
Claimed I did all the killings

2093
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,200
The livestream was announced in that group chat

2094
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,640
So everyone knew

2095
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,000
There would be a camera at that time

2096
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,320
Aimed at where the fake TYP would appear

2097
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,400
So my appearance then

2098
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,440
Was actually to clear A-Kai's suspicion

2099
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,080
Because he appeared together with the fake TYP

2100
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,880
Proving he didn't kill the fake TYP

2101
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,320
At that time I was thinking

2102
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,000
How to explain this away

2103
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,680
So I just happened to pass by in that outfit

2104
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,560
That's how it was

2105
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,840
So detailed

2106
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,600
Now revealing

2107
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,760
The crucial overlooked clue in this case

2108
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,200
The key evidence in this case

2109
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,880
Let A-Kai reveal it

2110
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,920
The blue shirt was mine

2111
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:13,920
You didn't notice

2112
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,560
Actually, as you just mentioned,

2113
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:18,800
his

2114
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,360
mentioned

2115
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,240
the scent was crucial

2116
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,560
but didn't focus on that shirt

2117
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,880
to analyze who it belonged to

2118
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,440
That shirt was worn before us

2119
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,320
when I took a photo with A-Kai

2120
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,080
during our group photo

2121
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,400
Because I thought the perfume had a scent

2122
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,520
The scent was a clue

2123
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,040
that pointed to this shirt

2124
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,760
Later that shirt clue was lost

2125
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,800
Minghao took a risky move

2126
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,560
After admitting to being the killer

2127
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,960
he took responsibility for

2128
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,320
killing the other victim too

2129
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,600
to exonerate A-Kai

2130
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,800
A small stake for big gains

2131
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,840
successfully misled others

2132
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,440
Finally during the voting

2133
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,480
both escaped unscathed

2134
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,680
It was a well-calculated, aggressive strategy

2135
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,280
However,

2136
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:06,120
trouble comes in waves

2137
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,040
Why are you back again?

2138
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:09,800
This is serious!

2139
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,480
I just saw in the dormitory courtyard

2140
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,040
Ai Sing committed suicide by jumping off the building

2141
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,120
Ai Sing

2142
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,480
The school has already sent her to

2143
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,840
Tuizhen Hospital for emergency treatment

2144
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,840
So should we now

2145
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,440
go out to check on her?

2146
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,240
No, it's too dangerous there

2147
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,120
Don't go anywhere

2148
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:26,840
Okay

2149
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:28,800
That scared me "to death"

2150
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,400
Ai Sing actually

2151
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,040
actually jumped off the building

2152
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,600
Help me

2153
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,040
What

2154
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,040
Zidaole

2155
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,800
Don’t open cabinets carelessly

2156
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,720
Beware—there might be a bloodied person inside

2157
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,600
Don’t enter empty piano rooms lightly

2158
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,920
Beware the deadly piano music echoing from within

2159
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,040
This concludes today’s case

2160
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:57,160
Yet the shadow of danger

2161
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,600
still looms over Tui Zhen Art Academy

2162
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,840
If you’re reading this message

2163
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,000
it means you’re gradually mutating into

2164
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,840
a monster from campus folklore

2165
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,680
Green is green

2166
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,000
Then the second letter of "green"

2167
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,000
Perfect

2168
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,480
Run now

2169
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,680
Did you get insurance or not? Insurance.

2170
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,640
Why is it so high?

2171
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,440
Let me help you down.

2172
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,840
Please don't scare me.

2173
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,400
I feel like there's something beneath me.

2174
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:40,760
So many.

2175
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,360
Medicine.

2176
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:41,960
It's me.

2177
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,800
This feels like ordinary candy.

2178
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,760
You've been protecting him all along, haven't you?

2179
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,440
She can't be sure.

2180
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,480
Either of you could be.

2181
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,280
I feel like you've been targeting me.

2182
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,000
I agree, it's too obvious.

2183
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,800
This is ironclad X.

2184
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,720
It's confirmed, proven.

2185
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:55,520
Even if we take a step back.

2186
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,280
Why would I help him kill someone?

2187
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,840
You're the one who seems like X.
