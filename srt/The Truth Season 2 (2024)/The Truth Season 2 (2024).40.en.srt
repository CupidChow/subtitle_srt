1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,680
If this shot goes in, you're the killer.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,560
Killer.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,120
Wait till you see Brother Ning's hairstyle.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,720
Red hair.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,280
Very handsome.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,200
No.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,880
This basketball hoop is too high.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,480
Let's try touching the hoop first.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,400
Let me try.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,280
It is indeed a bit high.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,640
This is kinda bullying Bai Yang.

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,440
You're really bullying people too much.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,520
Something's off - they even closed the door.

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,640
They're never usually this diligent.

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,840
I suggest we still need to find...

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,520
The B in front of us isn't B.

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,160
Can one of you tanks come out?

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,120
No tanks, just us two.

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,800
Please.

20
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,960
We're all cowards.

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,880
Please.

22
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,320
Then let's do this.

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,960
We won't let this door close.

24
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,560
Right?

25
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,440
What's wrong?

26
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,720
Old Bai touched your thighs.

27
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
Protect her.

28
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,600
Whoever you say to vote for, I'll vote for.

29
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,280
Protected.

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
So handsome

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,560
What's with this look?

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,800
Ball boy

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,960
This is killing me

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,360
Ball boy, huh?

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,800
A bit too dazzling today, so handsome

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,080
You always shock me with how handsome you are

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,240
Little murderer

38
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,480
Dilraba played the X role perfectly yesterday

39
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,720
No, you played the murderer well

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:30,960
Wait a second

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,320
Look at Brother Ning's hairstyle

42
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,680
Red hair?

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,600
How did you know?

44
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,880
I heard about it

45
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,040
I said he should get a buzz cut

46
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Very handsome

47
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,520
Confirmed, he's the murderer

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,600
Really?

49
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,920
He's got red hair now

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Dyed his hair red

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,640
You really went for a short hairstyle.

52
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,560
Yeah, it's a wig.

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,240
Looks really cool.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,080
Cosplay.

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
Alright, not today.

56
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,040
No games today.

57
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,200
You're the killer.

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,720
Little killer.

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,440
Even dyed your hair red.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,920
Wow, so much energy.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Can you play?

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Just okay.

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,320
Can you play?

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
I can't.

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,280
Can you play?

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm completely clueless.

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
You really can't play at all.

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,240
You can at least dribble, right?

69
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,520
That's basic human instinct.

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
Someone your height not playing?

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,480
I really don't play.

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
He doesn't play either.

73
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
Bai Yangzuo said he'd "destroy" me.

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Great, you're the only one who can play.

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,640
I can't play.

76
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,560
Why so humble now?

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,800
I mean I'm decent at "hitting people."

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,320
First he psychs you out.

79
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,760
And then?

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
Says he'll "destroy" you.

81
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,720
So you get scared.

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,280
Then claims he can't play.

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,760
Makes you lower your guard.

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,680
Then plays amazingly later.

85
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,320
Lulls you into complacency.

86
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,240
That's my strategy.

87
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,160
So sneaky.

88
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,400
We're all about tactics here.

89
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,680
We can film it

90
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
We can shoot it

91
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,520
This is Xiao Piqiu

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
We're missing an Akagi, right?

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,120
Akagi Takenori

94
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,160
Yes, Akagi Takenori

95
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,920
Where's your brother?

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,520
Shouldn't Azi be wearing purple lipstick?

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,960
A Cai

98
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,680
Right

99
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Ayako

100
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,040
Little killer

101
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,160
You raised your head pretty fast

102
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
That's me

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,840
It's really him today

104
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
Your turn

105
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,080
Yes, it's my turn now

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,240
It's me

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,880
I think it should be whoever it's supposed to be

108
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,960
Because actually it should have been me yesterday

109
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
But none of you guessed

110
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,240
Right, yesterday

111
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,920
It really should have been you yesterday

112
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,600
Don't know why

113
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,080
The three of us kept arguing there

114
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
You've been here for three seasons

115
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,880
Can't possibly not let you be one for a season

116
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,400
It's possible

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
I was the culprit in two consecutive episodes

118
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,320
Playing mind games with you

119
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,520
Possible, but unnecessary

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
Is this the entrance?

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,560
Why is he the only one waiting obediently?

122
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
He's so well-behaved

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
I'm observing the killers

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,360
There can't be four killers, right?

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,960
Stop being so dramatic

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
You might end up as the little X today

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
A detective shouldn't have an X, right?

128
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,200
There is

129
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,120
It's possible

130
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
2 vs. 3? Same thing

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,760
Can you be the X?

132
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Do you want to pick me as the X?

133
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,320
We'll play with this whistle later

134
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,160
The winner gets me

135
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Let's stop and go

136
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Can you play basketball?

137
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,640
No

138
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,760
None of us can

139
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
I can dribble

140
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,320
What can you do?

141
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,960
Dribble the ball

142
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
You're so funny

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,720
I can, I can dribble

144
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,480
Back when I was in school,

145
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,440
I tried learning basketball

146
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,680
but never got the hang of it.

147
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,040
He—

148
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,320
—clearly was in a relationship.

149
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,440
During high school,

150
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,320
I tried many ball sports.

151
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,200
What about you? What did you do in school?

152
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,080
I studied,

153
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,760
or else would I be this sharp?

154
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,000
Seriously?

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Studying and making TikTok videos.

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,080
You're completely different from last night

157
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,360
from the caring person you were before.

158
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,720
Today there's only one deduction.

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Right.

160
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Could that deduction turn into X?

161
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
Alright, alright.

162
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,600
What's up?

163
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
You two made up last night, didn't you?

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,880
Yes, we made up.

165
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,960
Today, we'll work together

166
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,680
to secure a key.

167
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,760
Our goal is to confuse the detective.

168
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,520
Right?

169
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,960
You're the killer, stop pretending.

170
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,560
You're acting strange today.

171
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,240
When you sent

172
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,360
that message in the group this morning,

173
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,000
we conspired together

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to mess with your head today.

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Okay.

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
This game isn't about deduction anymore,

177
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,000
it's about ganging up on me.

178
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
Where to now?

179
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,160
Let's start the game.

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,320
Where should we start?

181
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,440
Brother Bai, can you reach

182
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
the basketball rim?

183
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,840
No way.

184
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,600
Are you serious?

185
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,400
You try.

186
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,200
Wait, give it a try.

187
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,680
I can't reach it.

188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,760
Try it, just try.

189
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,840
This is kinda high, isn't it?

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,760
This isn't a standard hoop.

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
If you make this shot, you're the killer.

192
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,320
What are you doing?

193
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm about to score!

194
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,040
The killer

195
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,920
Look at you

196
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,240
Is this you?

197
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,560
No, this hoop is too high, isn't it?

198
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,160
Let's try touching the hoop first.

199
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,560
Let's try.

200
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
We'll try first.

201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,440
No, this is...

202
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
This one's higher, way higher.

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,360
Too high.

204
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
It's so much higher.

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,080
Brother Ning, can you even reach it?

206
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,800
This feels like bullying Bai Yangzuo.

207
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,680
You guys are being too unfair.

208
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,360
Seriously.

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,320
Is it really too high?

210
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,360
Or is it that none of you four can play basketball?

211
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,240
You planned this at the entrance.

212
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,640
Came in and immediately said it's too high.

213
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,040
This one's really high.

214
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,280
Strike a couple of poses.

215
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,280
So dumb

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,440
What are you standing there for?

217
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,200
"I'll beat you up"

218
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
"I'll beat you up"

219
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,040
I play basketball every day in Hengdian

220
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
I don't believe it

221
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
Dunk

222
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,840
This hoop is high

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,680
I'll dunk directly later

224
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Haven't you noticed this hoop is very high?

225
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,440
This hoop is slightly higher than standard

226
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,960
Really?

227
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,800
Really

228
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,760
I don't think so

229
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Alright

230
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Little killers

231
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,360
The three of us will target you first

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,640
You'll "die" miserably today

233
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,840
You'll lose completely today

234
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
Citizens

235
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
Now's the time to help me

236
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,000
This little killer now

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,880
If we win today

238
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,480
We can't afford to lose face

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
It's okay, I think

240
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,920
Wasn't yesterday embarrassing enough?

241
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,800
Yesterday

242
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,840
Failed two out of three rounds

243
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,320
No one even suspected

244
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,000
This should be the first time in this show

245
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,440
The murderer got zero votes

246
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,240
What should we do now?

247
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,960
We should take a break.

248
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,880
Wait for me.

249
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
You'll have to wait an hour for me.

250
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
I need to redo my hairstyle.

251
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Inside the steam...

252
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,920
It's like steaming buns in there.

253
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,720
Be careful not to catch a cold.

254
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,200
That's impossible for me.

255
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
I barely even broke a sweat.

256
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
The sweat coming out is white.

257
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,400
You know what?

258
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,160
It's nothing.

259
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,280
This is why I...

260
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,200
don't play sports intensely.

261
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,760
Even like this, you still won't play intensely?

262
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
Look how shy Kedao Le is around you.

263
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
Turns out it was me.

264
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
Aren't you his girlfriend?

265
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,240
You...

266
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,920
After basketball, he should bring someone water.

267
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
Then wipe their sweat with a towel.

268
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,680
None of us three got that.

269
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,760
Only he got that treatment.

270
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,520
You forgot your character setting.

271
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,400
You're making me look like the culprit.

272
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,440
Sneaking around...

273
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,560
Skulking about...

274
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,080
After playing like this, you tell me...

275
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,560
you couldn't give it your all?

276
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Or else we couldn't investigate later.

277
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,080
I already gave it my all.

278
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,280
Sorry.

279
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,520
No.

280
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,080
I only used one-tenth of my strength.

281
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,080
Where's our prize?

282
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Let's go.

283
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,000
I am your prize.

284
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,760
What?

285
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
We demand a rematch.

286
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,800
No wonder these two men...

287
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,040
actually already knew.

288
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,360
So you knew the truth all along.

289
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,320
This is quite urgent.

290
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,400
I've already used up all my energy.

291
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,480
Quick, it's urgent!

292
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,160
Very urgent!

293
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,640
Let's go, it's urgent!

294
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,080
Hurry up!

295
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,240
He Dinghong is not a suspect for now

296
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,840
Impossible

297
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,680
This fruit knife

298
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,840
Did he use it to eat apples?

299
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Now please keep the investigators at the crime scene

300
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,160
for preliminary evidence collection

301
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,320
Look

302
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,160
Brother Bai has to

303
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
find one every ten minutes

304
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
Is this your secret mission?

305
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you have to sit down every ten minutes?

306
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
This is my hidden task

307
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,240
No, because he

308
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,640
has a sore butt

309
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,400
Exactly

310
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,160
Why are you sitting in my detective spot?

311
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,680
Today I'm "Detective Two"

312
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,880
You're "Detective Two"?

313
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,040
Little murderer

314
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,200
That's right

315
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
Today it's me

316
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,160
It must be you

317
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,440
I'll play openly with you

318
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,680
Later I have some things to ask you

319
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,080
Okay, okay, okay

320
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,560
There really are some things I need to

321
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
Some things I need to properly

322
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,840
inquire about with you

323
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm telling you, I've locked in

324
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,080
X locked

325
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,320
It's him

326
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,840
I'll check when it starts up later

327
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
Who interacts with him

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,800
Don't you think Brother Ning seems off today?

329
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,360
Not saying a word

330
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,200
You made a

331
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
very big mistake yesterday

332
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
You forgot

333
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,920
What mistake?

334
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,640
You chose me

335
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
So today you'll target me

336
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,280
Today would be correct

337
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,840
Whether it's you or not today, I'll vote for you

338
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
I'm certain

339
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
Really

340
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,280
No, protect her

341
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,240
Protected

342
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,800
Why?

343
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,880
Good person

344
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,560
Alright bro, I'll help you get the key today

345
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,520
Even if it's you today, I won't vote for you

346
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,920
Whoever you say to vote for, I'll vote for

347
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Okay

348
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm your X

349
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,080
Let's see who interacts with you today

350
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,600
Interaction doesn't necessarily mean

351
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,200
you have to communicate with him

352
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,120
Even if you just say your secret phrase

353
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,480
to the air, that's fine too

354
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,400
That works too?

355
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
So simple

356
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Let me tell you first today

357
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
We can't play with outside factors

358
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,400
Too few people

359
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,960
With few people, we play with outside factors

360
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,040
Today's main focus is playing an off-field game.

361
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,400
When have you ever not played off-field?

362
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,520
Every time you play, it's off-field.

363
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,400
You say that as if it's always been logic-based.

364
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,800
You guys have a point.

365
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,520
If you play like this,

366
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,160
you'll lose some of the fun.

367
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,000
I think

368
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,560
No no no

369
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,840
That day he was logic-based.

370
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,040
Which day?

371
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,160
The day I was with Ninghao.

372
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,720
I was very serious that day.

373
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
He used logic to deduce me.

374
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
It was very frustrating.

375
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
That was the only day this season

376
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,240
he really

377
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,840
put serious effort into logical thinking.

378
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,360
He identified me very early.

379
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,680
Very early.

380
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,480
You didn't see my notes.

381
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,160
I had them written long ago.

382
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,680
Right.

383
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,560
Why though?

384
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,800
Take a wild guess.

385
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,040
No no, absolutely not.

386
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,680
Because I'm not X.

387
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,960
So Xiao Ba must be X.

388
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,440
But she didn't protect me.

389
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,520
She kept telling me this was suspicious,

390
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
then that was suspicious.

391
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,040
The only ones she didn't mention

392
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,360
were you and her.

393
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
But between you two,

394
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,360
her suspicion level was too low.

395
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,160
In my opinion,

396
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,440
I'll tell you, yesterday was my fault.

397
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,560
I didn't check the group chat messages.

398
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,640
Because she accused all three of us men.

399
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,320
Right, she didn't accuse me.

400
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
Xiao Ba.

401
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
I didn't even realize it when I saw it.

402
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,800
Anyway, she was sitting next to me.

403
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Just a moment.

404
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
This is a bit problematic.

405
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,720
Then how do we...

406
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,880
I think both of them will be fine.

407
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,080
Why does He Yun have such a heavy workload?

408
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
Can't keep up, right?

409
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,840
Doing investigations alone.

410
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,480
He has to be both investigator and X.

411
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,840
No wonder he's overwhelmed.

412
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
You definitely chose him

413
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,280
You had no choice but to pick him

414
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,480
That's unfortunate, isn't it?

415
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
Exactly

416
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,400
Of course I chose him

417
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,760
Then I choose you

418
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,040
How can I choose you when you're the killer?

419
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,520
So yesterday...

420
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,360
why didn't you choose Bai Yangzuo as X?

421
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,280
I actually just wanted

422
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,800
to prevent Bai Yangzuo from getting the key

423
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,440
Yesterday's session already revealed

424
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,120
that you're the killer today

425
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,480
Let's see the results

426
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm protecting him, I vouch for this person

427
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160
You never vouch for anyone

428
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,800
Yet today you're protecting her

429
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,360
You're suspicious

430
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,000
No

431
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
That day when we were both killers

432
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,800
he firmly protected me

433
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,040
Stop arguing with me

434
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,640
Everyone he protects turns out to be the killer

435
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,760
Hedinghong gave him

436
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,200
a completely flawless logic

437
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,520
He said

438
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,080
"I'm protecting him no matter what"

439
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,440
If I were the killer today

440
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,800
how would you plan to help me?

441
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Changing tactics now

442
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Openly playing games with you

443
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,040
Champion of justice

444
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,280
Fighting for Bazi Mei

445
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,960
Even if I were X, I'd still recommend you

446
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,920
If I were the killer

447
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,000
I'd just want you to speak less

448
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,600
You wouldn't not choose me as X

449
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
You insist on choosing me as X

450
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,160
Purposely getting that question wrong, huh?

451
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
It was already simple enough

452
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
Asking what one plus one equals

453
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,560
Just wouldn't answer

454
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,000
One plus one... let me think

455
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,480
Equals eight hundred sixty-four

456
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,840
Rare confusion

457
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,520
You're confused every day

458
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,760
Doesn't matter

459
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,920
I've stopped counting on him

460
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,920
That hair color looks pretty good on you

461
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,680
Suits you well

462
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,040
Brother's changed his usual style today

463
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
Something feels off

464
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
Even closing doors

465
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,680
Never this diligent normally

466
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm always the one closing doors at the end

467
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,480
Do you even know

468
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm really speechless with you people

469
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,720
Today

470
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,000
Because we were all previously

471
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Focused on Bazi Mei

472
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,520
Our attention

473
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,320
Wasn't on you

474
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,040
Fine, doesn't matter

475
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,480
Today your looks stand out more

476
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
Okay

477
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,080
Let's go

478
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Door King

479
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,840
Without Bazi Mei, I'm the prettiest

480
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,720
Who's laughing?

481
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
No one, not laughing, I'm not laughing

482
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,000
Come on

483
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
Today I'll assist you

484
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,160
Then you must be the killer

485
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
You're very active today

486
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
Suffered a setback yesterday

487
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,280
Over the past two days

488
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,200
We've endured too many setbacks

489
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,480
Do we still need to pose?

490
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,360
I do

491
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,400
Little assassins

492
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,640
Xiao X

493
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,880
Let me see your expressions

494
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,280
Why is someone looking down?

495
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,040
Right.

496
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,800
So flustered.

497
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,080
The shells fell all over the clothes.

498
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Sneaky vibe.

499
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
The sneaky vibe is here.

500
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,160
The sneaky vibe is stronger now.

501
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,840
The sneaky vibe is quite strong.

502
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,320
Everyone, check your evidence.

503
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,200
We'll take turns sharing the evidence later.

504
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,200
I could watch this for a year.

505
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,320
I feel...

506
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,080
Finished watching

507
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,040
Good luck

508
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,120
I just got (scared)

509
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,520
Then go alone

510
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,640
They’ll just scare you

511
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
What else?

512
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,480
Every room has one

513
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,760
I didn’t go inside

514
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,400
You didn’t even check inside

515
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
Then I’ll be in Hall A

516
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,360
He’s only in A

517
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,320
Then take us there later

518
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,520
The other halls

519
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,120
You little culprit

520
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,640
Even your jokes feel forced today

521
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,160
He’s super nervous today

522
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,520
Seriously, you’d usually

523
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,000
have already started

524
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,160
playing along with my joke

525
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,080
No, because today’s different

526
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,800
Our Dilraba had an incident today

527
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,360
I’m feeling really down now

528
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,440
What’s your connection to her?

529
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,200
Why should you be down?

530
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Now you’re adding drama for yourself, huh?

531
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,120
Then you write it down.

532
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,840
Ba Zimei and He Dinghong.

533
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,120
Bach.

534
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,200
Your duo name.

535
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
Sounds quite classy.

536
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,480
How classy is it?

537
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,720
A little bit.

538
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,040
Bach.

539
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,280
Why did you walk away when I came over?

540
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,840
I was getting coffee.

541
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,120
You thought I was avoiding you?

542
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,520
No.

543
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,840
It's just that you two were talking nonstop.

544
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,240
Then you stopped when I arrived.

545
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,560
Of course, some things.

546
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,400
can't be said in front of you.

547
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,920
You're joking.

548
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
You're quite lively today.

549
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
Feels like fighting alone.

550
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,600
As a detective, you should speak carefully.

551
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm not a detective, I'm X.

552
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,280
I know.

553
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,480
So whatever you say today.

554
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,160
doesn't really matter much.

555
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,680
Fix your hair a bit more.

556
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,120
Make it look handsomer.

557
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,960
That's your biggest role this season.

558
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,280
Whether you are or not.

559
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,680
we'll still treat you as one.

560
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,920
So just have fun.

561
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,600
I just sent a message.

562
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,520
Everyone's congratulating me again, X.

563
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,560
Right?

564
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,320
What's the strategy?

565
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,560
You've played as X before.

566
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,080
You should have experience.

567
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,200
Playing with open cards.

568
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,040
What about you?

569
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,280
I'm X, I told you.

570
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
Just laying it all out.

571
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,200
This way of playing is quite fun.

572
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm keeping an eye on you today.

573
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,560
Let's see who you help.

574
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,120
How did you get even more handsome?

575
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,160
Changed my look.

576
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,360
My headband is limiting my performance.

577
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,560
What? What is it?

578
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,720
What is this?

579
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,560
Stop! What is that?

580
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,520
There's nothing here.

581
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,480
Take it out.

582
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,800
This evidence is public information for everyone.

583
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,560
My box is too heavy.

584
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,960
Let me help you carry it.

585
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm so touched.

586
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,400
You two switch places.

587
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,920
Bro.

588
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
You're the killer today.

589
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,480
But I won't vote for you.

590
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,720
I'm your Y.

591
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,520
Mine is heavy too.

592
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,000
Push detective.

593
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,960
Push detective walking.

594
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,040
He's already forgotten he's the push detective.

595
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,680
He no longer sees himself as the push detective.

596
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm X, I've said it already.

597
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,440
Open the door.

598
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,560
Because he needs to solve this

599
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,800
B, the current B

600
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,840
I think we still need to find

601
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,600
The B before us isn't B

602
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,600
Hurry up and get up already

603
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,640
What are you doing?

604
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm analyzing

605
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,440
We're leaving

606
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,120
Goodbye

607
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,680
Hurry up

608
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,800
He's tired, come quick

609
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,640
Scared "to death"

610
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,400
So terrifying

611
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,840
Damn you, Bai Sanwan

612
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,280
No wonder it suddenly got so quiet

613
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,440
That damn Bai Sanwan

614
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,920
Can we leave this door open?

615
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,720
And let it move up and down?

616
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,320
Step aside first

617
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
Don’t get caught in it

618
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,280
Can one of you tanks come out?

619
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,000
No tanks, just the two of us

620
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,680
Please

621
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,120
We’re all cowards

622
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Come on

623
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,640
Why?

624
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,040
You go in, get inside

625
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,960
Where to? Third floor.

626
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,680
Third floor. We're going to the third floor.

627
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,280
Where is it going?

628
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,680
We've reached 300 meters underground.

629
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,800
I think we might have traveled through time.

630
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,440
300 meters underground.

631
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,280
300 meters is possible.

632
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,000
Look, it's been descending nonstop.

633
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,960
Continuously descending.

634
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
We're falling.

635
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,240
Where are we now?

636
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,000
After traveling for so long...

637
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,120
Where have we arrived?

638
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,680
What does this mean?

639
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,120
Could we have really traveled through time?

640
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,320
What's wrong?

641
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,760
Nothing, just shaking a lot.

642
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
What's wrong?

643
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,080
Bai Sect is chasing us.

644
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,160
They're grabbing your thighs.

645
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't touch a girl's leg

646
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,480
Who's this?

647
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,400
This is me

648
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
It's fine

649
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,440
No

650
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,000
You're all targeting me like this

651
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,720
If I don't play with my cards revealed

652
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
Wouldn't I be stupid?

653
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,720
Hedinghong is the most...

654
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,800
Actually, he was really upset at first

655
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,240
Think Tank

656
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,160
Right, you're all confronting me so openly

657
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
The first thing I asked in the Think Tank

658
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,320
I feel like he's definitely X

659
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm already certain

660
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,280
He's 80% likely to be X

661
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,920
Exactly

662
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,760
So today I don't plan to

663
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,280
Listen to his stuff

664
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
But at the very end

665
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,600
Remember when we were leaving

666
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
He said I locked Bai Yangzuo

667
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,840
Isn't that obvious?

668
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,360
No

669
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
It's because before I went in to get the tag

670
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,040
You all had already exposed me

671
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,240
Right, you had no choice

672
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
Whether I choose X or not, I have to reveal X

673
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,640
Yes

674
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,280
No, you're not X

675
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,840
You are

676
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,000
Actually, for us

677
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,120
Whether you are or not doesn't matter

678
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,160
We'll treat you as if you are

679
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,200
Yes, it's because of this statement

680
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
That's why I have to play with my cards revealed no matter what

681
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,360
No matter what, I have to say I'm X

682
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,160
Okay, okay, okay

683
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,480
Stop with the "okay, okay"

684
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
You're just "no, no, no"

685
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,720
No.

686
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,280
You really are...

687
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,880
If you...

688
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,600
If you had made the right choice...

689
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,680
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

690
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,240
Even if he chose right, it's still your fault.

691
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,720
Because your vote matters too.

692
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,320
Winning or losing isn't important.

693
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,520
Yes, that's good.

694
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,440
If I had voted for him...

695
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,280
We could have won.

696
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,960
Still lost.

697
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,760
We still lost though.

698
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,720
I would have voted for him too.

699
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,800
If you had voted for him...

700
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,920
Oh, screw you.

701
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,360
Getting four votes is just ridiculous.

702
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,760
Just...

703
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,560
Just like following Bai Yang brings rewards.

704
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,920
Plenty of flavor and spice.

705
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,880
Right.

706
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,040
You really...

707
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,120
Why have you been so...

708
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,320
determined these past two episodes?

709
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
What?

710
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,960
Speak properly, I'm begging you.

711
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,560
Will you come back next time?

712
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,080
I don't know.

713
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,200
Let's see what he says now.

714
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,520
Fine, if...

715
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,040
Listen to me...

716
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,440
If she doesn't come next time...

717
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,280
It's your fault.

718
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,440
She just doesn't like it.

719
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,080
She gave up.

720
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,600
Gave up.

721
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,040
That's great

722
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,080
It's my time to shine again

723
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
You're acting a bit strange today

724
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,280
You're a bit too hyped up today

725
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,880
Earlier

726
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,440
You were way too excited earlier

727
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,160
You kept bringing me up

728
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,520
Why did you keep mentioning me?

729
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,360
You made the wrong choice earlier

730
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,440
Maybe you should reflect on yourself

731
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,680
Why did you choose wrong?

732
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,600
Actually, it's just that

733
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,280
It's your performance in the middle parts

734
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,840
You're a bit

735
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,560
It just makes me really suspicious of you

736
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,760
There's no decisive factor

737
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,880
What decisive factor could there be?

738
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,080
Not comfortable at all

739
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,320
None of them feel right

740
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,560
What solo dance?

741
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,720
What kind of solo is this?

742
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,040
I remember the moves

743
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,400
But how to keep up with the rhythm

744
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,360
Let me take a look

745
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,560
One, two

746
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,720
His shoes are insane, those shoes

747
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,080
I broke my bone wearing those same shoes

748
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,520
He's even got an ahoge

749
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,680
Sneaky, very sneaky vibe

750
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,280
This long?

751
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,800
Your turn

752
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,600
Hurry up and stop this farce

753
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
Embarrassing

754
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,120
Couldn't deliver the flowers

755
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,800
Sit

756
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
Thanks

757
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,040
Sis Dilraba

758
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,960
Chair

759
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,560
Thank you

760
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,800
Not for you to sit on

761
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,880
This is pretty cool

762
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,360
Just the last two left

763
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
Why were they gone when I tried getting them earlier?

764
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
I'll bring more tomorrow then

765
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,200
That won't work

766
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Let me "apologize with a kiss"
