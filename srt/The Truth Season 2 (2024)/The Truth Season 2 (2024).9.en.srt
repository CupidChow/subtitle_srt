1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,720
The timeline rewinds to 1924.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,600
In Tui Town.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,000
There was a pharmacy famous throughout the town

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,400
called the Century Pharmacy

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,360
Mind Motion Hall

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,280
For a hundred years

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,120
Mind Motion Hall had

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,400
the motto "Giving every Tuizhen resident a good mind"

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,240
as its guiding principle

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
specializing in treating all kinds of brain disorders

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,080
It played

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,600
a vital role in Tuizhen's development

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,680
The physicians practicing here

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,320
had to master astronomy above

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,400
geography below

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,360
and human affairs between

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,080
mastering all three domains

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,320
before they could diagnose human ailments

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,000
However,

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,280
after the passing of the previous hall master

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,400
The position of Brainstorm Hall leader has been vacant for a long time.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,720
There's an urgent need to select an acting leader.

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,120
to take charge of the situation.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,680
Therefore,

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Brainstorm Hall has recently gathered

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,800
eight apprentice doctors.

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,960
Welcome, apprentice doctors.

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
I want to challenge myself

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,200
to become the acting leader.

30
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
I'd like to compete for the acting leader position.

31
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,160
I also have some ambitions

32
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,800
for this acting leader position.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
They will form teams of two

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,080
for mental challenges.

35
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,200
Let's go straight with this.

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,440
Direct betting.

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,560
I think this move is a bit awkward now.

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,680
They outsmarted us.

39
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,920
Just some small tricks.

40
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,880
Next time,

41
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,360
don't try to trick us either.

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,600
Sincerity for sincerity.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,600
The contract is signed.

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,880
We'll offer the highest price.

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,760
So this is a trade alliance, right?

46
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,440
Just a matter of time.

47
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,600
Let's finish this quickly.

48
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,640
"Slingshot tactics"

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,400
The two apprentices with

50
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,480
the highest mental scores

51
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,680
will become the current

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,880
acting leaders of Brainstorm Hall.

53
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,760
Now let me reveal

54
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,200
the final results of this session.

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,720
Let me see

56
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,320
Water Burst

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,480
Bearing Full

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Qi surge

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,760
Family

60
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,440
Where's the applause?

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,680
Welcome to

62
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,920
"Let's Start Thinking"

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,000
This is Tuizhen Town's

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,640
century-old renowned pharmacy

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,880
Thinking Hall

66
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm the assistant director of Thinking Hall

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
Cui Shaoyang

68
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,160
Pardon my modest introduction

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,200
First of all,

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
Let's welcome the eight trainee physicians for this session.

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,920
Please introduce yourselves.

72
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,880
Introduce yourselves from left to right.

73
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,440
Hello, everyone.

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,320
I just graduated from university this year,

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,440
football player Hou Zhuocheng.

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
A while ago,

77
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,520
my classmates said

78
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,640
that my eyes reveal

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,600
the kind of clear-headed foolishness unique to college students.

80
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,160
Today I've come here

81
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
to prove to everyone

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,360
that I've grown

83
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,120
and transformed

84
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
That's why I'm here to challenge

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
whether I can become the acting hall leader

86
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,840
Hello everyone

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm Wei Xiaolong

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,960
I currently work at a mobile phone company

89
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,520
in marketing

90
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
I majored in computer science in college

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,360
Hello everyone

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
My name is Hu Minghao

93
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,600
from Yuandu of Qi State

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm a law student

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,920
experiencing life during vacation

96
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,720
My goal is

97
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,200
to become a "legal master" in the future

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,600
"Legal master"

99
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,920
Hello everyone

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm Dong Zifan

101
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,760
Currently an actor

102
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,960
Recently starred in

103
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,320
the popular show "In the Blizzard" as

104
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,240
the carefree Wu Wei

105
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,160
I majored in

106
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
economic statistics

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
Yes, economic statistics

108
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,880
then became an actor

109
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,480
That's right

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,920
I'm Ren Yinpeng

111
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Currently I'm a musician

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
and also a cellist

113
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,720
I studied

114
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,480
hydraulic and hydroelectric engineering

115
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,200
So I'm an engineering student

116
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,760
Coming here today

117
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,720
is also about challenging myself

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
Our Hu Minghao

119
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
is also in a band

120
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
And as far as I know

121
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,280
our Wei Xiaolong

122
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,400
can also play instruments, right?

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes, since elementary school

124
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,440
To be honest, our Brainstorm Hall

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,320
has quite an artistic atmosphere

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,120
"The Brain Band"

127
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,480
Hello everyone

128
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,920
My name is Huang Kai

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,480
This time, I've become one of the apprentice physicians

130
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,640
I want to give it a try

131
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,360
and compete for the acting hall master position

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Hello everyone

133
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,200
My name is Yang Zongyu

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
I am a senior student

135
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
My major is

136
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,760
Polymer Materials and Engineering

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,760
My biggest fear

138
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,160
is introducing myself

139
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,120
So I hope we can get to know each other gradually

140
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,000
Please be kind to me

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,120
Let's become good friends

142
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,560
Hello everyone

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,520
My name is Yu Haoyang

144
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,560
The subject I study

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,920
is quite an obscure one

146
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,560
Philosophy

147
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,480
You're all welcome

148
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,680
Next,

149
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,800
let me explain

150
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,560
the rules for competing to become acting Sect Leader.

151
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Eight physicians

152
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,960
will pair up to form clinics.

153
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,560
Through four rounds of challenges, they'll accumulate Brain Power points.

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
The clinic with the highest Brain Power

155
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,800
will become this season's

156
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,160
acting Sect Leader of "Brain Hall."

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,040
They'll receive a one-week

158
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
opportunity to pin their best photo at the top,

159
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,560
and get featured on the show's official Weibo

160
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,880
header image on a dedicated page.

161
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,040
They'll also gain one privilege:

162
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,200
to assign the two lowest-scoring clinics

163
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,520
to receive Brain Power enhancement services.

164
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,320
Friendly reminder:

165
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,640
The physician who becomes acting Sect Leader most often

166
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,000
will receive a super special bonus reward.

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,400
First, let me motivate everyone

168
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
by revealing

169
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,040
this season's Brain Power enhancement services:

170
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,200
They are

171
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,280
authentic Chinese massage

172
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,760
to clear meridians

173
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,920
and refresh thinking,

174
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,840
plus a winter-limited

175
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,160
refreshing splash to energize the mind.

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,440
How terrifying.

177
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,880
I'd like to ask something.

178
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,920
For that massage, do you give or receive it?

179
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,880
You'll definitely be the one receiving it.

180
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,960
Isn't that good then?

181
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,240
It is good.

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,160
But you happen to have a back injury.

183
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,680
You could go.

184
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,440
You could get it treated.

185
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,320
Right, you could mention it to him.

186
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,440
Take the initiative to request it.

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,200
To strive for ultimate victory,

188
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,120
physicians,

189
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,880
selecting a capable teammate

190
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,520
is also extremely important.

191
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
This triage session's method

192
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
will use blind selection of teammates based on tags.

193
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,120
Each physician

194
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
will summarize their greatest strength

195
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,360
into a single tag.

196
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,320
By selecting tags of interest,

197
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,560
they'll choose teammates.

198
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,400
The physician chosen by most people

199
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,880
may then select in return.

200
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,720
And so on,

201
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,200
until all eight physicians are selected.

202
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440
I want to choose this one.

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,600
Full of whimsical ideas and attention to detail.

204
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,320
It feels complementary.

205
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,800
I think he's also full of whimsical ideas.

206
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,320
I also have a wild imagination.

207
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll also choose this little sun.

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,640
(I choose) the vibe team leader.

209
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,040
This person seems pretty cool.

210
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,280
Only the all-powerful little sun

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,960
has the right to choose in return

212
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,520
All-powerful little sun

213
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,440
Raise your hand now

214
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,920
Let's go back

215
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,560
Let's head back

216
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,920
Everyone's reaction

217
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,640
After everyone realized he was the little sun

218
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,600
I'll just look for the moon instead

219
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,280
Let's do it again

220
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,440
Now let the little sun raise their hand

221
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
Okay

222
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,080
Can you explain why

223
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,200
you call yourself the all-round little sun?

224
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,600
As the name suggests,

225
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,240
all-round

226
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
and little sun.

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
Do you three regret it now?

228
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,160
Actually, I'm a bit curious to know

229
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,880
if the person I chose

230
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
is among these three people.

231
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,040
Right.

232
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,200
The one you just picked was

233
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
the imaginative INFP.

234
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,560
No way.

235
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,680
I can't tell you right now

236
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,280
who it is.

237
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,800
Otherwise it would feel like "If You Are the One."

238
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,200
Why don't you have these three

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,600
go ahead and

240
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,240
compete a bit.

241
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,840
Have them talk about their strengths.

242
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
Choosing me is never wrong.

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,760
Let me see where you're not all-rounded,

244
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,200
I can make up for it.

245
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,840
I'm very imaginative.

246
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,920
Picking me is definitely right.

247
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,240
I'm very imaginative.

248
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
This is a hint

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,840
End

250
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,600
The hints have gone this far

251
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,080
Yu Haoyang and Yang Zongyu

252
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,000
Will form a clinic first

253
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
We'll just announce it openly

254
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Leader of the vibe team

255
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,280
Unconventional methods, aiming for the peak

256
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,880
And the labels for these two

257
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,200
Who is he?

258
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,360
Hou Zhuocheng

259
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Then let me ask

260
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,280
the one Hou Zhuocheng chose

261
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,200
this meme king with both texture and laid-back vibe

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,880
could it be Dong Zifan?

263
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,480
Didn't expect that, did you?

264
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,000
Seriously...

265
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,800
It's in the bag.

266
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
You rehearsed this, didn't you?

267
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,800
You're acting, right?

268
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,160
The labels for these two...

269
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,080
Who could this be?

270
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,160
Hu Minghao and Ren Yinpeng

271
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
Will they also successfully choose each other?

272
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,480
Who is he?

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,320
Too bad it's not you.

274
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Now our current situation

275
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,880
is still somewhat delicate.

276
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,840
Our Hu Minghao chose Ren Yinpeng.

277
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
Ren Yinpeng then chose Huang Kai.

278
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,960
Let's have Ren Yinpeng and Huang Kai

279
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,400
play rock-paper-scissors.

280
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,760
If he wins, he'll choose me.

281
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,360
If I win, I'll choose Minghao.

282
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,760
Is that right?

283
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,680
That's correct.

284
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,960
Then I'll go with the flow.

285
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,440
No matter the outcome,

286
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,120
someone will want me.

287
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,720
Here's the thing

288
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,560
There are eight of us

289
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,840
and we'll all pair up in the end

290
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,680
There won't be any

291
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,760
unfortunate situations

292
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,840
Rock-paper-scissors

293
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,680
Huang Kai will automatically pair with Ren Yinpeng

294
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
to form a team, okay?

295
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,600
Our Hu Minghao

296
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,200
will team up with Wei Xiaolong

297
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,720
Esteemed physicians

298
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Please look at the medicine cabinet beside me

299
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,160
Coptis

300
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,680
Ginger

301
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,160
Licorice

302
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,120
These are all commonly used herbs

303
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
in our Brain Exercise Hall's daily practice

304
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,480
Behind each medicine label in the cabinet

305
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
there's a corresponding test

306
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,560
Each round I'll randomly select

307
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
a test from these medicine labels

308
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,120
Now let's draw

309
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,280
the first round's test

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,880
I'll choose

311
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,760
Cassia seed

312
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,560
Alright

313
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,160
What test does this correspond to?

314
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,040
Keen Eyes

315
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,360
All four clinics will participate simultaneously

316
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
You'll need to memorize four

317
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,600
Tuina-related images in sequence

318
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,400
After one minute of memorizing each image

319
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,520
answer three questions through quick response

320
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,720
The clinic that buzzes in

321
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,240
must answer within five seconds

322
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,520
Correct answers earn one point

323
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Final scores

324
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,480
will be ranked based on points earned

325
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,440
by each clinic

326
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,240
with different brain power bonuses

327
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
Zifan and Zhuocheng

328
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,200
How are you two

329
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
at memory tasks?

330
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,760
I think Zifan

331
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,040
might have an advantage

332
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Since Zifan is an actor

333
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,640
who memorizes scripts

334
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,240
His verbal memory

335
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
should be better

336
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,280
While you should be better

337
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,840
with visual patterns

338
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,320
You're a soccer player after all

339
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,520
I didn't even know that

340
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,240
Alright, get ready

341
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,880
First question

342
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,280
One-minute timer starts now

343
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
You two are

344
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,240
Not aiming for first place

345
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,320
Only striving to be the most handsome

346
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,400
Let's go

347
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,000
Three

348
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,920
Two

349
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,400
One

350
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,080
Image closed

351
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,600
Alright, everyone may leave now

352
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,480
Mainly checking

353
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,000
Everyone's short-term memory

354
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,160
Did you remember?

355
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,040
First question

356
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,120
What are all the names on the poster?

357
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,440
Three, two, one

358
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,200
Please answer quickly

359
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Consultation Room One

360
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,520
Bai Youcai

361
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,080
Ke Shaoshuai

362
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
He Shaoshuai

363
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,640
Ba Li

364
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,160
Wang Chuanshuo

365
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,560
Correct answer

366
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,440
Please present the question.

367
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,560
How many people in the poster are wearing ties?

368
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,240
I (remember) there was one.

369
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,040
I forgot.

370
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
The tailor and three young marshals.

371
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,080
Seems like there are three inside.

372
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,040
Please buzz in to answer.

373
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,120
Clinic Room Four.

374
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,840
Four.

375
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,160
He answered correctly.

376
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,320
Our strategy is...

377
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,200
to wait for the opportunity.

378
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Yes, wait for the opportunity.

379
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,440
Final question.

380
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,760
Please recreate Bari's photo pose.

381
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,120
Three, two, one.

382
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,080
Clinic Room Two.

383
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,840
Do you remember?

384
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,440
Like this, right?

385
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,480
Is the answer correct?

386
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,640
Unfortunately,

387
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,320
the answer is wrong.

388
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
Come on, three, two, one.

389
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,720
Clinic Room One.

390
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,000
Earrings.

391
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
Like this.

392
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,560
I'll do it.

393
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,720
Let's go.

394
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Correct answer

395
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,920
Congratulations to Clinic One

396
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,640
Ready to begin

397
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,160
You count the glasses

398
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
I'll count the bottles

399
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,960
So what's the first question?

400
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,920
What fruit is the statue holding?

401
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,520
Do you know?

402
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,400
Please buzz in.

403
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,120
Room Four.

404
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,000
Grapes.

405
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,680
Correct answer.

406
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,600
One point added.

407
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,600
How many wine glasses are hanging upside down?

408
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,600
Please buzz in.

409
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,400
Room One.

410
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Eleven.

411
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,680
Correct answer.

412
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,480
One point added.

413
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,120
I'd like to ask student Yu Haoyang,

414
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,160
how did you calculate it?

415
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
I remember the last column was 3, 4, 5, 3.

416
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,560
Then 4 were right-side up,

417
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,680
and the rest were upside down.

418
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,600
Then I subtracted to get the answer.

419
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,880
The labels on several wine bottles are not visible

420
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,840
You know what I mean

421
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,240
Please answer quickly

422
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,960
Examination Room 2

423
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,080
Seventeen

424
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,120
Wrong answer

425
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,160
Five

426
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Wrong answer

427
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,480
Eleven

428
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,600
Wrong answer

429
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,640
This is so difficult on my side

430
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,440
I should have helped you keep count

431
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
Check the entire bottom row

432
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,440
Because they're placed vertically

433
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,880
Add six plus five

434
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,600
Seventeen

435
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,400
Do both top and bottom count?

436
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,960
Several of them are

437
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
All three rows are arranged like this

438
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,680
And there's one more on the far left

439
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,520
Four

440
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,040
Congratulations, that's correct

441
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,000
We're definitely in first place now

442
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,520
Stay calm

443
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
Now what we hope is that you all

444
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,560
can put in a bit more effort in Consultation Rooms 2, 3, and 4

445
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,600
Keep it up

446
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,680
Alright

447
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,840
Let's head back

448
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,800
Let's go

449
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,320
Hall Master

450
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,840
How about we merge our three consultation rooms

451
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,560
into one single room?

452
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,400
Agreed

453
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Alliance

454
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Now we'll proceed with

455
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,480
the final round of the Sharp Eyes game

456
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,040
In the promotional image for Bali's stall clearance sale,

457
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,640
several pairs of white stockings appeared.

458
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,600
Clinic 2:

459
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,080
Three pairs (six stockings).

460
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
Correct answer.

461
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,440
Please state the exact date

462
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,080
when Bali's Tailor Shop opened.

463
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,240
Clinic 3:

464
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,280
November 31st.

465
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,440
Wrong answer.

466
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,280
Clinic 1:

467
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
November 30th.

468
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,520
Correct answer.

469
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,440
Where was Bali's stall

470
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,760
located for the clearance sale?

471
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,920
Please answer.

472
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,760
Clinic 3:

473
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,600
Tui Le.

474
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,000
Stall at the entrance.

475
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,160
Congratulations, wrong answer.

476
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,560
Please answer.

477
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,280
Clinic 4:

478
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,920
Stall at the entrance of Tui Le Gate.

479
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
Correct answer.

480
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,160
Stall at the entrance of Tui Le Gate.

481
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,560
It advertised a clearance sale

482
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,080
for

483
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,680
long-top-short-bottom clothing

484
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,360
from February 2nd, 1922

485
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,920
to February 8th.

486
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,520
The location was the stall at Tui Le Gate entrance.

487
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,280
Impressive.

488
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,680
Impressive.

489
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,160
This is truly impressive.

490
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,960
What an exhilarating mental exercise.

491
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,320
Let's announce

492
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,680
the current scores for each team.

493
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Second Round Assessment

494
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,560
Tone Matching

495
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,880
Phonetic Clue Hunt

496
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Each team of physicians

497
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
will draw a four-character idiom

498
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,760
as their test question

499
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,880
During each answering round

500
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,800
write guessed words with pinyin notation

501
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,640
The hall assistant will evaluate

502
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,320
the characters

503
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,240
initials

504
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,920
finals

505
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,800
and tones of each word

506
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,400
Blue indicates the word contains correct elements

507
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,560
but in wrong positions

508
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,080
Red indicates both content and position are correct

509
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Final rankings will be determined

510
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,560
by each team's number of guessing attempts

511
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,200
with corresponding mental strength bonuses

512
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,480
Now, this wheel beside me

513
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,160
will determine which clinic answers first.

514
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,400
Going later is the most

515
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,480
advantageous, right?

516
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,160
Right?

517
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,080
What were we just saying?

518
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,520
Okay, it's completely stopped.

519
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,720
Let's welcome Clinic Three.

520
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,760
Indeed, going later would be better.

521
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,280
Come on, let's give them some encouragement.

522
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,240
Go for it!

523
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,920
You can do it!

524
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,400
Alright, you two discuss first.

525
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,680
Choose your own question.

526
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,840
We'll choose the first one.

527
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,720
You do it.

528
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,240
A doctor's benevolence

529
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
Their approach works

530
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,640
Why did you choose

531
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,760
to attempt "A doctor's benevolence" in the first round?

532
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,720
Because I thought

533
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,600
it must relate to Medicine Elder's Hall

534
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,640
in some way

535
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,400
so I prioritized idioms in that direction

536
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,960
Two first tones

537
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,560
No fourth tone

538
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,560
This can only mean that

539
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
2 3 4

540
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,920
2 3 4

541
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,720
1 2 4

542
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
That's how it is

543
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,160
That's right

544
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,320
Wait a minute

545
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,440
There are too many possible scenarios

546
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,200
We can only guess now

547
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,040
Let's think of some idioms first

548
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,200
Which idiom comes to mind?

549
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,840
Come on, just think directly

550
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,600
Second tone

551
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
This doesn't have second tone

552
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,120
No

553
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,280
Not allowed here

554
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,200
Wisdom

555
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,320
Great wisdom appears simple

556
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
Still waters run deep

557
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,760
That is

558
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,440
These two are the fourth tone and second tone

559
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,360
Right?

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,120
Fourth tone and second tone

561
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,240
Because in our first round

562
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,000
Wasn't the third tone correct

563
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,040
but the position was wrong?

564
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
The first tone was also correct

565
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,600
So the beginning is

566
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Third, first

567
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
Correct

568
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,960
Let's hum

569
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,160
b p m f d t n l

570
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
j q x

571
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,680
Here's what we'll do

572
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's not write idioms

573
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,360
We'll just follow

574
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,560
the characters we guessed ourselves

575
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay

576
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,360
There's no k, right?

577
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,600
"Kao", write the "kao" from "gaokao" (college entrance exam)

578
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,680
Because there isn't

579
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,280
Eliminate

580
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,160
c

581
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,960
No good

582
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,040
Hmm

583
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,200
Possible

584
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,840
ī

585
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
Don't have

586
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,440
sh

587
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,200
èng

588
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,840
eng

589
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,000
íng

590
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,080
It's on the tip of your tongue, right?

591
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,160
Yes, it's right there.

592
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,320
Almost got it.

593
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,120
Too bad we're just one step short.

594
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,680
Is there any way to make a decisive "kill" move?

595
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,160
Let's write it.

596
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,280
b p m f d t n l

597
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,360
j q x y w u

598
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,320
Darkness

599
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Wrote one

600
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,160
You wrote one, right?

601
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,200
Sharp-eyed and keen-eared

602
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,880
Brothers

603
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
Where's the applause?

604
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
Really?

605
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,160
Six

606
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,760
Awesome

607
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,160
Incredible

608
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,080
Can anyone tell me

609
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,320
how this word was conceived?

610
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,480
I first used this to calculate

611
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,240
the "ing" final sound

612
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,480
then analyzed further

613
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,640
what hadn't appeared before

614
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,760
a b c d

615
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,080
tried all possibilities

616
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,600
combined them

617
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,520
then checked if it resembled a character

618
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,200
Right

619
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,520
It's just a feeling

620
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,040
Intuition

621
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,600
Also I think this theme

622
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,520
should relate to our medicine hall

623
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,560
So I focused on this direction

624
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,680
Makes sense

625
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,160
Completely logical

626
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,800
Congratulations

627
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,880
Which clinic will go next?

628
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,440
Any volunteers?

629
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,520
willing to try?

630
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,880
Clinic One

631
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Never mind, I'll spin it

632
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,040
You're kind of

633
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,880
putting them in an awkward position

634
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Just spin it

635
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,520
Who could it be?

636
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,520
Six

637
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,600
Nice

638
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,000
"Harming others ultimately harms oneself."

639
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,360
Wait a minute

640
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,760
It hasn't stopped

641
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,320
Still spinning

642
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,360
Still not stopping

643
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,920
Not yet

644
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,160
Sorry

645
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,160
Alright

646
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,360
Do you two have any strategies for guessing words?

647
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,880
Yes

648
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,160
Very strategic

649
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,640
How so?

650
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,720
But we can't reveal it

651
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,600
So others won't find out

652
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,000
Playing tricks

653
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,320
No problem

654
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,720
We'll know when he writes it

655
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,960
This means these two tones are correct.

656
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
The last one starts with 't'.

657
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,520
And there are only these two tones, which means...

658
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,120
So it can't be the third tone.

659
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,760
It must be either the first tone

660
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,400
or the fourth tone.

661
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,840
Yes, right.

662
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,640
Then it's either 4-1-4-4.

663
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
But these all start with 't'.

664
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,600
And 'j' can't be here.

665
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
So it must be in the first two.

666
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,240
Right.

667
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,760
But I wonder if...

668
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,120
It's better to deduce starting from 't'.

669
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,600
Because we know the tones for 't'.

670
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
We know the initials.

671
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,040
Listen.

672
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,360
Explore.

673
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,760
Explore.

674
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,320
Sky.

675
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,160
Every word a gem.

676
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,000
Great commotion.

677
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,240
Okay, 'jump'.

678
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,240
A clown.

679
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,600
Jump.

680
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,240
Jump.

681
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,560
Thanks.

682
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,800
Let's anchor the last character.

683
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,520
Then make a guess.

684
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
Confirm it's this one.

685
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,800
Think we should try first.

686
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
Then the first 'j'.

687
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,600
Pick one that hasn't appeared.

688
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,200
Take a guess.

689
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,720
'īng'.

690
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,560
Then 'jīng'.

691
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,520
Hasn't appeared before.

692
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:34,920
Right.

693
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,640
'īng'.

694
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Try 'u'.

695
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,840
'Waterfall'.

696
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,600
The 'pu' in 'waterfall'.

697
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,600
We should have checked earlier

698
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,960
Is there really any repetition?

699
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
Heart-pounding

700
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,720
Heart-pounding

701
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,960
One one four four

702
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
Do you want to change it?

703
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
Change it to "heart-pounding"

704
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,120
No

705
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,640
No

706
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,960
No

707
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,640
Right

708
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,160
Second (tone)

709
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,760
Second tone—no

710
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
"Ào" jump

711
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,080
Correct

712
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,760
No changes, keep this one

713
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,760
Congratulations

714
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,240
Guessed it right in just two attempts.

715
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,320
Impressive.

716
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,080
Impressive.

717
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,520
Explain your overall thought process.

718
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,600
First, I focused on "jump."

719
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,640
It was through that whole list.

720
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,520
How did you narrow it down?

721
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,480
How did you focus on "jump"?

722
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
Because there are many with "jump."

723
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,920
"Run up and down."

724
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,440
"Chickens fly and dogs jump."

725
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,280
"Shocked and terrified."

726
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,200
"Bouncing and jumping."

727
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,720
Because these tones.

728
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,120
Kept playing in my mind.

729
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,400
Thought about which others were similar.

730
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,320
Then I thought of this.

731
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,360
Already developed muscle memory in a short time.

732
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,960
Yes.

733
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,080
Strong, really strong.

734
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,360
Exam Room 1 and Exam Room 2.

735
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,280
Decide by rock-paper-scissors.

736
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,200
Loser goes first.

737
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,320
Rock, paper, scissors.

738
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,160
Okay, Exam Room 2 goes first.

739
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,560
Good luck.

740
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,280
Good luck.

741
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,280
Our approach is relaxed.

742
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,640
Right.

743
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,280
Stay loose.

744
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,360
You have your own method, right?

745
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,720
Yes.

746
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,800
Actually, we've already analyzed a lot.

747
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,720
But not sure how effective it is.

748
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,800
But not sure how effective it is.

749
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,720
Try it out.

750
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Try it out.

751
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,000
They're looking for common numbers.

752
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,240
Common numbers in idioms.

753
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,520
The first one is y

754
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,240
Then there's a j

755
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,000
is in the wrong position

756
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,760
There's an i

757
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,200
Then third tone

758
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,040
And another third tone

759
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,600
I think we can guess again

760
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,480
Guess something completely different

761
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,720
Let's compare, okay

762
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,720
Wind, rain, thunder, lightning

763
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,400
Wind, rain, thunder, lightning works

764
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,080
Wind, rain, thunder, lightning

765
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,560
Later, we'll take a look

766
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,800
No first tone

767
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,240
Right

768
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,800
"Wind" is first tone

769
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,600
Change one character

770
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
Put "rain" first

771
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,400
It has this one

772
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,520
There's an i

773
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,240
There's a j

774
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,120
What about this í

775
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,840
No second tone

776
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,280
Okay, no problem, let's try

777
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:50,920
Somewhat unexpected

778
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,800
Somewhat surprising

779
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,040
Right, there's a "jí"

780
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,440
Okay

781
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
This is "y"

782
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,800
Then

783
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,960
"í"

784
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,920
And the last one is fourth tone

785
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,880
Let's analyze these two characters

786
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,240
Let's mark these

787
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,920
"ǎ jí"

788
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,800
This word doesn't exist

789
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,520
"ún jí"

790
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,360
"ǐng jí"

791
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
"ǎng jí"

792
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,400
"ě jí"

793
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,240
I think

794
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,680
I think this method is correct

795
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,280
Just focus on analyzing

796
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,520
Right

797
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,120
Just analyze this

798
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,720
"ǎn"

799
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,600
Quick eyes and hands

800
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,160
Congratulations

801
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,720
Okay

802
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,240
Tell me your problem-solving approach

803
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Because we thought

804
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,800
Use the first one

805
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,720
Use the first few words

806
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,240
To analyze all the information

807
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,280
So we wanted to use

808
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,200
Completely different

809
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,760
Initials, finals, and tones

810
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,720
Only used two tones

811
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,480
Because we found

812
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,240
Few words contain

813
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,960
All four tones

814
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,040
So we wanted to use two by two

815
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,960
To analyze it

816
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,120
So the rest all used

817
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,040
Different initials and finals

818
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,720
To make guesses

819
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,120
And we were quite lucky

820
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,560
Yes, I think the second character

821
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
Was particularly lucky

822
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,600
He's already laughing uncontrollably

823
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,440
Rein it in a bit

824
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,920
I think we should

825
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,120
first confirm this character

826
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,680
ào

827
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,400
ào

828
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,040
ào

829
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,840
ào

830
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,000
ào

831
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,280
something ǎn something

832
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,680
ào

833
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,600
or something àn something ào

834
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,600
Let's list all possible tones first

835
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
and write them down

836
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,600
There are only these possibilities

837
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,520
Because it must be third or fourth tone

838
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
If it's fourth tone

839
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,800
then this must be third tone

840
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,520
Because there's no third tone left in this word

841
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,120
So it must be first tone

842
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,680
This can't be right

843
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,840
No such word exists

844
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
It must contain a body part

845
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,200
Let's think about

846
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,560
which body part it could be

847
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,520
Let me mark this

848
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,880
No

849
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
Am I marking this correctly?

850
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,720
Correct

851
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Really?

852
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,520
No

853
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,320
They added some this time

854
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,360
The success rate is quite high, right?

855
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,920
Right

856
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,880
We can probably guess a few more times

857
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,880
You two can turn around now

858
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,240
Congratulations

859
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Very impressive

860
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,000
You guessed the idiom correctly in just two attempts

861
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,600
How did you two

862
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,680
figure out the answer so quickly?

863
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,160
I noticed that in the first three word sets

864
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,080
the first and third characters

865
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,520
were both human body parts

866
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,280
So my first guess

867
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,720
was "dry mouth and tongue"

868
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:44,960
Right

869
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,520
I thought it might be correct

870
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,200
but it wasn't

871
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,480
Then we focused

872
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,040
on the pronunciation

873
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,360
listed possible options

874
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,240
and picked the most fitting one

875
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,040
For the tones

876
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,480
we considered several possibilities

877
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,400
and eliminated

878
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,120
those that sounded obviously wrong

879
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,480
Combined with

880
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,160
the body parts clue

881
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,520
we finally guessed it

882
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,120
That's truly remarkable

883
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
Let's give them another round of applause

884
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,620
The third round of assessment will begin shortly.

885
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,540
Once again, I'll be

886
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,900
selecting items from the medicine cabinet.

887
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,260
I really want a drink

888
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,100
something more suitable

889
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,180
for modern health-conscious youth -

890
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,900
sour plum drink.

891
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,740
So,

892
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,620
wolfberries...

893
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
What wolfberries?

894
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,020
I'll choose black plums.

895
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,380
Where? Right there!

896
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,140
Miracle Healing

897
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,020
All four clinics will answer simultaneously.

898
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,380
For each correct answer,

899
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,900
15 seconds will be added.

900
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,220
After answering,

901
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,620
each clinic will use their earned time

902
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,140
for block building.

903
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,820
When time's up,

904
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,580
ranking will be based on

905
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,540
the number of balanced blocks remaining.

906
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,020
Clinics will be ranked

907
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,860
and gain different mental points.

908
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,620
Miracle Healing

909
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,140
Acupressure

910
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,660
Ready?

911
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,940
3, 2, 1 - questions begin!

912
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,140
What was the period from 1919 to 1929

913
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,620
commonly called?

914
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,380
Pop Era

915
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,980
Rock Era

916
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,620
Classical Era

917
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,260
Jazz Age

918
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
I think it's Classical Era.

919
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,820
I'll guess D.

920
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,180
Right?

921
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,980
Clinic One has finalized their answer.

922
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,100
Confidently prepared.

923
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
3, 2, 1 - show answers!

924
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,140
D, D, B, D

925
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,580
Congratulations Clinics 1, 3, and 4

926
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,260
for correct answers!

927
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,420
You've earned 15 seconds building time.

928
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,380
It's nothing.

929
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,540
Okay.

930
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,940
It's fine, fifteen seconds won't make a difference.

931
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Why did Consulting Room 2 choose B?

932
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,380
Could it be because it's Consulting Room 2?

933
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,700
Right.

934
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,380
Better not say more.

935
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,540
Yes, we have some plans.

936
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,940
Huang Kai.

937
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,500
What are your thoughts

938
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,380
on this question?

939
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,020
It's not the pop era,

940
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,940
nor the rock era,

941
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
nor the classical era,

942
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,340
so it must be the jazz era.

943
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,340
That's Clinic Four

944
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,980
Who decided on D?

945
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,060
Because we're Clinic Four

946
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,700
That's why we chose D

947
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,180
Right

948
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,460
Same logic as ours

949
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,540
Clinic One

950
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,780
What basis did you use

951
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,940
to determine it's the Jazz Age?

952
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,780
Pop era

953
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,660
I think it's probably closer to

954
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,820
around

955
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,500
the era of new media development

956
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,140
While the rock era

957
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,460
I believe was post-WWII

958
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,260
the 50s-60s

959
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,140
From what I've listened to

960
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
it seems more recent

961
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,540
As for the Jazz Age

962
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,220
relative to my memory

963
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,060
seems more distant

964
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,300
But not as ancient as

965
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,620
the Classical era

966
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,860
Because figures like Beethoven

967
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,180
were 18th-19th century figures

968
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,980
So it can't be A, B or C

969
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,940
Only D is possible

970
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,260
He's absolutely right

971
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,780
I agree

972
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,460
Well-reasoned

973
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,820
But I should correct one point

974
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,660
The Classical era

975
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,300
was 5th century BC

976
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,820
to mid-4th century BC

977
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,340
Think carefully

978
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,460
Which of the following items

979
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,580
was invented in 1924?

980
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,860
Television

981
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,460
Liquid-fueled rocket

982
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,940
Computer

983
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,060
Radar

984
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,580
I guess it's A

985
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
You guess it's A

986
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,180
I'll follow your lead

987
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,140
A

988
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,700
It's you again

989
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,780
Three, two, one

990
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,900
Please answer

991
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,020
D C C A

992
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,860
Exam Room One, give your reasoning

993
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,900
Because I've seen a movie

994
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,980
About Turing's biography

995
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,660
Turing is considered the "father of computers"

996
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,740
That story

997
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,340
took place during WWII

998
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,780
So it should be the 1940s

999
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,220
And intuitively I feel

1000
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,820
television was probably invented

1001
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,980
a bit earlier than computers

1002
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,620
So I chose A

1003
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Computers were invented in 1943

1004
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,700
Television was invented in

1005
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,420
Congratulations to Exam Room One

1006
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,380
Correct answer

1007
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,740
Almost

1008
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,700
I didn't expect a philosophy student

1009
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,140
to have such broad interests

1010
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,740
Because I watch a lot of movies

1011
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,020
Right

1012
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,780
Which of the following cartoons

1013
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,820
was created in 1924?

1014
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,700
"The Studio Brouhaha"

1015
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,060
"The Dog's Banquet"

1016
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,580
"Calabash Brothers"

1017
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,540
"Astro Boy"

1018
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,060
Alright everyone, show your answer boards.

1019
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,180
B B A B

1020
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,180
Consultation Room 2 chose B

1021
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,140
Let me explain why

1022
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,660
Because "Calabash Brothers"

1023
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,620
is from my generation

1024
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,140
And I think in 1924

1025
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,260
it should have been black-and-white animation

1026
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,180
While "Astro Boy"

1027
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,980
was from Japan's

1028
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,140
Meiji Restoration period

1029
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,100
around the same time

1030
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,620
"Astro Boy" was in color

1031
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,860
So we can eliminate that

1032
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,260
leaving only A and B

1033
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,100
That's why we

1034
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,180
in Consultation Room 2

1035
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,140
chose B

1036
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,340
Why did Room 1 choose B?

1037
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,380
"Dog's Banquet" sounds like

1038
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,140
a more 1924-style title

1039
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,780
That makes sense

1040
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,180
I think many works back then

1041
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,620
were satirical in nature

1042
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,900
with some absurd elements

1043
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,140
Right

1044
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,060
Social commentary pieces

1045
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,620
So B seems more likely

1046
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
That does seem right

1047
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,020
Their answers and explanations

1048
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,300
Did they convince Room 3?

1049
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,940
Do you think they're right?

1050
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,460
And your choice A was wrong?

1051
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,860
Turns out they were correct

1052
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,700
Congratulations then

1053
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,700
You got it

1054
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,900
Your intuition was right

1055
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,020
All three rooms

1056
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,100
answered correctly

1057
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,420
The answer is B

1058
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,300
"Dog's Banquet"

1059
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,740
That was tough

1060
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,860
Okay

1061
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,620
We got all three questions right

1062
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,220
In 1924,

1063
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,420
we couldn't have read

1064
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,540
which of these literary works:

1065
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,260
"Letters to Young Readers"

1066
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,620
"The Scream"

1067
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,700
"Old Tales of the Southern City"

1068
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,500
"A Madman's Diary"

1069
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,540
Oh my goodness

1070
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,100
Oh dear, this one I...

1071
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,620
I'm not sure either

1072
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,780
Please show your answer boards

1073
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,180
A C B B

1074
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,620
Why did Clinic Four choose A?

1075
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,420
Intuition

1076
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,620
To be honest, you guys are pretty awesome.

1077
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,300
The pose must be stylish

1078
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,100
Consultation Room 3

1079
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,140
Mainly because it records past events

1080
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,420
It might describe incidents from 1924

1081
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,820
The past events were documented later

1082
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,420
Just a hunch

1083
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
Still somewhat reasonable

1084
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,860
Right, that makes sense

1085
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,900
Congratulations to Consultation Room 3

1086
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,700
Additional setup time: 15 seconds

1087
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,740
You didn't expect it yourself, did you?

1088
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,540
No, I didn't.

1089
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,780
"Letters to Young Readers" "The Scream"

1090
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,820
Year

1091
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,380
"A Madman's Diary"

1092
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,460
Year

1093
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,420
Only "Old Tales of the Southern City"

1094
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,980
Year

1095
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,500
Right.

1096
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,340
You used your brain.

1097
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,420
No, I didn't.

1098
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
Which sport

1099
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,020
was not introduced to our country

1100
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,140
before 1924?

1101
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,580
Golf

1102
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,380
Beach volleyball

1103
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,740
Tennis

1104
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,260
Baseball

1105
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,740
I'm getting the hang of it

1106
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,140
Here it comes

1107
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,900
Ramping up the difficulty

1108
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,540
Let's go

1109
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,060
Would be awkward if we're wrong

1110
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,140
Show the answer board

1111
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Exam Room Four

1112
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,700
First we eliminated option A

1113
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,740
Because there's a Japanese movie

1114
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,820
Called "Rurouni Kenshin"

1115
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,780
Where they apparently played golf

1116
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,220
That was during the Meiji Restoration

1117
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,100
Around 1900

1118
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,180
Or approximately 1910

1119
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,540
Golf had already been introduced to Japan then

1120
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,300
I naturally assumed

1121
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,780
It might have reached China too

1122
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,100
Between options B and D we thought

1123
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,020
The conditions were similar

1124
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,260
So we chose option B

1125
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,860
Congratulations

1126
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,380
Exam Rooms Two, Three and Four answered correctly

1127
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,220
Well done

1128
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,060
Final question

1129
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,860
Which of these songs could be heard in 1924?

1130
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,260
"Farewell"

1131
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,220
"On the Songhua River"

1132
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,660
"Defend the Yellow River"

1133
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,500
"Night Shanghai"

1134
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,580
Choose one

1135
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,700
Please show your answer boards

1136
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,140
A A B A

1137
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,620
Clinic 4

1138
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,580
"Farewell" is originally a foreign folk song

1139
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,140
that was introduced to China

1140
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,900
and adapted by Li Shutong

1141
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,460
so it should be the earliest one

1142
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,380
"On the Songhua River"

1143
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,300
is about when the three northeastern provinces

1144
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,140
were occupied

1145
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,100
Then "Defend the Yellow River"

1146
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,020
with its lyrics about roaring wind and neighing horses

1147
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,140
should be from the Anti-Japanese War period

1148
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,900
Wei Xiaolong thinks

1149
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,500
"Night Shanghai" came after Shanghai became a concession

1150
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,020
so it should be after 1924

1151
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,700
That's correct

1152
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,860
The correct answer is

1153
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,940
"Farewell"

1154
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,820
Congratulations to Clinic 1, Clinic 2, and Clinic 4

1155
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,220
You've successfully accumulated

1156
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,620
15 seconds of construction time

1157
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,460
Choosing (imaginative) INFP was the right call

1158
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,980
Got another question right

1159
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,340
Impressive

1160
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,900
Three

1161
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,020
Two

1162
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,020
One

1163
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,980
Start counting

1164
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,980
I'll keep track of time for you

1165
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,060
Step back a little

1166
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,980
Back

1167
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,340
This

1168
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,780
Yes, this one needs to go back

1169
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,660
Thirty seconds have passed

1170
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,940
The ones on the reverse side don't count

1171
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,900
No

1172
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,740
Be steadier

1173
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,420
You hold it

1174
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,780
Maybe we should just place (these)

1175
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,260
Just place these few

1176
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,780
Don’t place any more

1177
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,180
Three, two, one

1178
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,300
Exam Room Two, Exam Room Three, stop building

1179
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,900
Now that it fell, it doesn’t count, okay?

1180
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,380
No need, leave it like this

1181
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,300
Put it aside and check it off

1182
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,620
Check it off

1183
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,860
Three, two, one

1184
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,140
Construction complete

1185
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,820
Okay, let go

1186
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,540
Let go quickly

1187
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,580
Oh no

1188
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,220
Sorry about that

1189
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,300
My fault for rushing

1190
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,220
Rushing us

1191
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,100
Pushing us

1192
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,860
My surname is Cui

1193
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,380
Our apologies

1194
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,140
We got greedy

1195
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,620
Were too greedy

1196
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,660
Yes, we were greedy

1197
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,780
Should've quit while ahead

1198
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,980
Clinic 1 successfully scored 6 points

1199
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,060
Clinic 2 successfully scored 5 points

1200
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,680
Alright everyone

1201
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,160
We've finally arrived at

1202
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,480
the final round of assessment

1203
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,080
I want to flip the wolfberries

1204
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,040
Herbalist hey feed wolfberry

1205
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,360
Herbalist hey feed wolfberry

1206
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,480
Four clinics will compete in pairs

1207
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,080
Two clinics facing each other

1208
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,480
will hold black and red wolfberries respectively

1209
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,680
Two types of medicine blocks

1210
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,320
The types of medicine blocks are:

1211
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,360
Five blocks with one wolfberry

1212
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,440
Five blocks with two wolfberries

1213
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,240
Five blocks with three wolfberries

1214
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,080
And one blank medicine block

1215
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,920
The two clinics

1216
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,640
must blindly draw one medicine block each

1217
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,000
from their own medicine block piles

1218
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,840
and place it on the grid cloth

1219
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,600
Each medicine block

1220
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,200
must be placed adjacent to

1221
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,640
other blocks (up, down, left, right)

1222
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,240
When horizontal, vertical or diagonal

1223
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,840
connected same-color medicine blocks

1224
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,520
first form ten wolfberries

1225
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,320
that clinic wins

1226
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,280
Let's begin

1227
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,320
I'll start spinning now

1228
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,760
Which clinic goes first?

1229
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,800
Feels like it's us

1230
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,880
It went back again

1231
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,520
Clinic One will go first

1232
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,000
Come on

1233
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,840
The clinic facing Clinic One

1234
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,880
Okay, Clinic Three

1235
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,520
Let's go, Clinic Three

1236
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,320
Based on the mental strength rankings

1237
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,640
Clinic One goes first

1238
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,600
Okay, two

1239
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,280
One

1240
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
But you must place it adjacent

1241
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,480
One

1242
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,720
Don't give them a chance to go diagonal

1243
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,160
Right

1244
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,080
This feels a bit like chess now

1245
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
Where you place it doesn't matter

1246
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,880
Just slap it down first

1247
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,840
The momentum is what counts

1248
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
The sound must be loud

1249
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,720
I think this way

1250
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,320
might also help them build a bridge

1251
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,720
But their diagonal bridge

1252
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,800
I don't think they'd dare

1253
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,480
If we place it here

1254
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,720
we can block both his diagonal and vertical moves

1255
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,800
Our move here is big

1256
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,120
and must be to our advantage

1257
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,840
You understand?

1258
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,240
What about placing it here?

1259
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,160
If we go this way

1260
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,440
they gain an extra

1261
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,600
While here we'd be

1262
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,160
They're actually at a disadvantage

1263
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,000
Okay

1264
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Connected six in a row

1265
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,200
Three is coming

1266
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,720
I think we can place it here

1267
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,600
This could work

1268
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,480
This move is good

1269
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,840
This is indeed a tough decision

1270
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,480
One wrong move

1271
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,560
could mean losing the whole game

1272
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,320
This is also

1273
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,320
Brilliant

1274
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,040
Completely disrupts their formation

1275
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,760
But it can serve as a bridge

1276
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,560
Yes

1277
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,760
Can be a bridge

1278
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,360
I think we should attack

1279
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,560
Agreed

1280
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,240
Good, we've made seven

1281
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,560
He'll probably block us

1282
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,320
But

1283
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,680
No problem, let him block

1284
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,840
Here he'll have a bridge

1285
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,080
Place one here

1286
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,200
and they can get through

1287
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,320
He might be helping others build bridges

1288
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:09,840
It's a bit difficult

1289
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,000
Wait, let me think

1290
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,360
This is a tough move for him

1291
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,840
Then let's bet too

1292
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,760
Let's bet, we have no choice

1293
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,760
Let's block them

1294
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,920
This way, they'll have no moves left

1295
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,000
Hit this one

1296
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,480
I'm so anxious I could "die"

1297
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,040
Now I understand how the old man in the park feels

1298
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,000
Stop playing around

1299
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,640
I'll let you win this time

1300
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,880
What a pity

1301
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,520
Okay

1302
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,680
Alright, next round

1303
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
Let's block that path of his

1304
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,160
Good

1305
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,040
Let's reshuffle

1306
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,240
Is this okay?

1307
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,280
Yes

1308
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,520
Let's take an unconventional approach

1309
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,480
Turn passivity into initiative

1310
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,040
They're also waiting for their winning tile

1311
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,160
They're gambling

1312
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,240
Whether they can draw

1313
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,920
The only two

1314
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,600
We either ensure

1315
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,840
we don't lose

1316
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,800
or ensure our odds

1317
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,280
are higher than theirs

1318
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,720
Aren't these the only two possibilities?

1319
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,800
What you said does make sense.

1320
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,040
Now they only have a two left in their hand

1321
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,800
Come on, the tense moment has arrived

1322
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,400
Go for it

1323
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,720
Got excited

1324
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
Almost there

1325
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,240
Yes, block here, yes

1326
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,080
Guard it tightly

1327
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,320
But once they block that spot

1328
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,520
Then they lose an opportunity

1329
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,520
Right

1330
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,680
But there's no bridge here

1331
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,840
Celebrated too soon

1332
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:48,880
That was a mistake

1333
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,000
What a pity

1334
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,680
Then we'll have to go this way

1335
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,800
We can only go this side

1336
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:53,600
Right

1337
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,800
No problem

1338
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,640
Seven pieces again

1339
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,200
This is a bit difficult

1340
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,520
If we can't block it

1341
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,880
I think we should place it here instead

1342
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,480
There's one here

1343
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,760
But we've already used up our twos

1344
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,720
We have to get off here.

1345
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,400
He's blocking us.

1346
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,880
Come on, what is it?

1347
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,400
Let's go this way

1348
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,200
Right?

1349
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,440
We're still missing a two here

1350
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,800
We're still missing a three here

1351
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,200
This is all we have left

1352
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:33,920
Listen to two cards

1353
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,640
We must win these two.

1354
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,720
If they don't win, you will.

1355
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,200
What could it be?

1356
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,120
What could it be?

1357
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,440
We won by taking an unconventional approach.

1358
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,960
Indeed, it was an unorthodox strategy.

1359
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,640
This one held its ground.

1360
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,280
Come on, let's begin.

1361
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,680
We'll take the initiative.

1362
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,760
Let's finish them quickly.

1363
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,920
Diametrically opposed.

1364
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,280
Let's see who's stronger.

1365
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,520
Bring it on.

1366
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,440
This way

1367
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,280
Straight to betting

1368
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,120
Go down and block him

1369
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,400
Just need a three to be ready

1370
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,440
Nice

1371
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,360
Nice

1372
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,040
Thrilling

1373
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,120
Then see what they play

1374
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,080
Whether they'll block you

1375
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,400
They also played a three

1376
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,800
They're ready

1377
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,920
It's about whether this three blocks

1378
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,160
Or gives themselves an out

1379
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,440
Betting you can't draw a three

1380
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,280
How can we not draw a three?

1381
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:12,760
Aren't we

1382
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,800
Getting whatever we want?

1383
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,240
We get what we need, right?

1384
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,480
What to do

1385
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,440
I can't guarantee drawing a three

1386
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,120
No problem

1387
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,280
What is it?

1388
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,120
But we have to block

1389
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,600
Block

1390
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,360
Two

1391
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,320
One

1392
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,080
Drew four ones

1393
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,000
They are the "Divine Move"

1394
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,120
Only one move

1395
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,360
Use one to block them

1396
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,400
Block that three first

1397
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,080
He has one and four here

1398
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,920
Can't connect them

1399
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,160
They're far behind over there

1400
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,760
If it's here

1401
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:20,880
Actually placing here

1402
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,640
We can directly block here

1403
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,280
Yes, smart, genius

1404
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,600
He can make a bridge here

1405
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,360
And extend towards there

1406
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:27,840
Right

1407
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,400
If he doesn't block us like this

1408
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,160
They'll be very passive

1409
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,760
Listen

1410
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,400
It's fine, just block it.

1411
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,920
Now there's only one "one" left.

1412
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,160
If this "Divine Move"

1413
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,960
is still a "one"

1414
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,520
I really think

1415
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,200
you guys still have some luck.

1416
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,880
"Number One"

1417
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,080
Come on, "Divine Move"

1418
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,720
This is so intense.

1419
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,000
He can't possibly play two "threes" in a row.

1420
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,720
Definitely not.

1421
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,600
It's appeared

1422
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,160
Come

1423
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,680
"Dragon"

1424
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,360
Sweating profusely

1425
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,360
Now let me reveal

1426
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,840
the final results of this episode

1427
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,560
Before commencing the intellectual enhancement service,

1428
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
we will now proceed with

1429
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,200
the most significant

1430
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,200
and ceremonious segment of this session—

1431
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,600
the inauguration ceremony for the acting Sect Leader.

1432
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,200
Bring forth the ceremonial items!

1433
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,880
The Golden Gourds.

1434
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,440
This way, they can

1435
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,240
hydrate themselves

1436
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,360
during our recording, correct?

1437
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,400
Now, I hold in my hands two

1438
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,560
emblems of honor for the acting Sect Leader—

1439
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,520
these very Golden Gourds.

1440
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,840
Thank you

1441
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,720
Okay, very high

1442
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,000
Come

1443
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,680
Two acting hall masters

1444
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,400
How does it feel to become

1445
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,360
the acting hall masters this term?

1446
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,760
Everyone is very capable,

1447
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,440
and we had a great time today.

1448
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,480
But this gourd is rightfully ours.

1449
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,640
Did you hear that, brothers?

1450
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,880
We heard!

1451
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,160
We'll always keep this gourd

1452
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
by our side.

1453
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,840
Our other clinics

1454
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,920
Anyone want to counterattack?

1455
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,640
Be my guest

1456
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,880
Thirty years east of the river

1457
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,320
Thirty years west of the river

1458
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,440
Don't bully the young for their poverty

1459
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,840
Next episode we'll make you take down that gourd

1460
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,760
and dismantle it

1461
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,400
Right

1462
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,000
We'll still shut you out completely

1463
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,200
Next episode our clinics might switch around

1464
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,360
I want to see how they'll react

1465
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,320
now that they're so brotherly

1466
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,280
if they get separated

1467
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,760
in the next episode

1468
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,960
Crossing swords against each other

1469
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:10,960
Good

1470
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,000
Now let's move outside

1471
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,280
I feel like I'm going to scream in agony

1472
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,320
This usually costs money

1473
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:21,880
I agree

1474
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,120
Why does this feel so satisfying?

1475
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,240
We're getting a great deal

1476
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,120
This is slightly worse.

1477
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,880
Teacher, once more please.

1478
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,000
No.

1479
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,120
Help!

1480
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,080
Does it feel good?

1481
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,040
It feels good.

1482
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,680
Do you feel any mental...

1483
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,000
mental enhancement?

1484
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,920
Particularly noticeable.

1485
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,200
Next time I'll take the Hall Master.

1486
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,120
Next time you'll take the Hall Master?

1487
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,640
Yes.

1488
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,240
Actually, I...

1489
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,320
You want to hear the sound too, right?

1490
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,120
Okay, relax, don't be nervous.

1491
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,240
Relax.

1492
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,640
This sound...

1493
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,280
Did you hear it?

1494
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,760
Feels like "do."

1495
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,560
Feels like "do."

1496
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,640
Perfect pitch, huh?

1497
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,760
Come, over here.

1498
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,760
It hurts a little

1499
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,200
His right White Tiger should come too

1500
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,760
Breathe

1501
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,080
Breathe, relax

1502
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,240
Come

1503
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,960
I

1504
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,560
I’m still a bit impatient

1505
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,080
I’d like to interview our Ren Yinpeng

1506
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,400
About that "White Tiger Point" earlier

1507
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,680
Did you have any special insights?

1508
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,920
30% pain

1509
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,840
30%

1510
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,880
itch

1511
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,520
pleasure

1512
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,040
itch

1513
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,120
And 40%

1514
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,360
feeling somewhat violated

1515
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,760
That spot is just more sensitive

1516
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,800
Our Clinic 3

1517
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,880
After the premium service

1518
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,360
It’s Clinic 2’s turn now

1519
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,360
Now, Clinic 2

1520
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,200
will face

1521
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,920
the refreshing splash treatment

1522
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,440
I’ll try to hit it in one go

1523
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,240
Alright, go ahead

1524
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,520
Okay

1525
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,320
I'll punish myself with one

1526
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,120
No need

1527
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,120
Got addicted

1528
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,720
It was truly enlightening

1529
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,360
Plenty

1530
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,080
Gave them a

1531
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,680
chance to bond

1532
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,280
Bottoms up for deep friendships

1533
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,240
Whether it's a battle of knowledge

1534
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,680
Or a psychological showdown

1535
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,920
Today's four clinics

1536
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,120
At the Brainstorm Hall

1537
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,480
Have left shining highlights

1538
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,160
We look forward to our two acting hall leaders

1539
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,040
To showcase

1540
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,280
More of Brainstorm Hall's brilliance

1541
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,360
And with the residents of Tuizhen

1542
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,000
Create wonderful moments together

1543
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,280
The first episode of "Let's Brainstorm"

1544
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,360
Comes to an end here

1545
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,200
We'll

1546
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,120
See you next time

1547
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,720
Goodbye

1548
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,360
Come on, step onto the turntable

1549
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,160
Still hesitating

1550
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,800
They're starting to feel uncomfortable

1551
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,760
Don't just sit and wait for doom

1552
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,240
Trapped in the White Tiger's den

1553
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,840
Feeling a bit offended

1554
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,280
Getting the hang of it

1555
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,120
Suddenly had a realization

1556
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,680
What's the plan

1557
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,240
Morse code

1558
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,040
They have their own strategies

1559
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,520
It's been so tough

1560
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,960
The doctor shifts tactics in this game

1561
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,080
I think this current move

1562
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,120
Is a bit awkward

1563
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,160
We've been outmaneuvered

1564
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,520
Do you believe me?

1565
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,720
Alright, I'll follow your lead.

1566
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,040
Let's take this directly.

1567
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,800
"Slingshot tactic"

1568
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,360
These two moves are impossible.

1569
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,480
You go ahead.

1570
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,400
Stop fighting, you two.

1571
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,440
We'll offer the highest price.

1572
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,560
So this is a trade alliance, right?

1573
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,280
Let's both show some sincerity.

1574
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,960
My lawyer,

1575
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,840
We both went to law school.

1576
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,960
Let's discuss the contract.

1577
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,920
Brother Kai is "ruling from behind the curtain."

1578
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,400
Is this what law is about?
