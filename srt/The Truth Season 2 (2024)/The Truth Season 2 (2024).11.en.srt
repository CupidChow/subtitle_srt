1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,380
Another murder case at Tui Le Gate

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,860
The body was mysteriously discovered

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,020
Dead inside the clock's hidden compartment in the hall

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,020
After thorough investigation and questioning

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,660
No alibi gaps found for the four suspects

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,820
He died between 7 PM and 8 PM

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,180
We confirmed

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,420
All six have solid alibis

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,340
Bro, I think

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,100
This is a serial killer's work

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,860
Later, they discovered

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,460
The key to the sealed door in the abandoned warehouse

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,060
Together, they passed through a secret passage

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,900
Arriving at Tui Lao Hui

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,140
Did you see at Tui Lao Hui—

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,540
He might be Jia Wei

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,740
He's not from this era

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,420
Right

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,860
As the door of

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,380
Tui Lao Hui's stained-glass room opened

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,100
Where is this?

22
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,740
What is this?

23
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,660
What kind of place is this?

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,420
The hidden truth

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,260
Begins to surface

26
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,940
What is this thing?

27
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,980
Where are we?

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,620
This is an operating room

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,060
To the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,580
Promoting Healthy Life Technology

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,020
Promoting Health

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,460
Are we in "Westworld"?

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,620
Perhaps people from our world

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,140
are artificial beings

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,140
who have traveled to modern times?

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,340
Maybe this is a time tunnel.

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,620
Is it possible that

38
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,620
this Broadway

39
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,580
sent our people

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,180
to the modern era?

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,900
Tui Town Daily

42
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,020
Tui Music Gate has started recruiting singers

43
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,220
She's an orphan with no relatives

44
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,540
and has passed the physical examination

45
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,420
There's one here

46
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,780
This is

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,780
Incinerator records

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,900
Harvesting organs

49
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,980
Bali

50
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,140
Remove the right kidney

51
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,380
Right kidney

52
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,220
YS right kidney

53
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,540
Below Bali is YS

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:03,820
It's over

55
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,300
Below Pink Phoenix is CXGS

56
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,940
Pink Phoenix

57
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
Draw blood and marrow

58
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,940
This person that Tui Shenmi wants to recruit

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,180
He wants these people

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,340
to come and have their organs taken

61
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,500
Taken away

62
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,060
Got goosebumps

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,300
On the fourth day

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,660
I woke up in Dongnao Hall

65
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,820
I saw

66
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,380
Youle standing beside me

67
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,860
Then he told me

68
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,180
Tui Laohui

69
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,780
was robbed

70
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,500
Then I was stabbed

71
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,620
Did you know about this?

72
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,700
I didn't know

73
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,780
I only know now

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,660
Then missing a kidney

75
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,580
She was unconscious

76
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,340
Brought here

77
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,180
Right

78
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,780
So I had no idea

79
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,100
Neither of you died

80
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,500
How did you escape?

81
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,980
These two timelines

82
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,180
How could it do such a thing?

83
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,980
I think that place just now

84
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,260
was actually a time tunnel

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,420
And this modern person

86
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,700
came to the ancient city to harvest organs

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,940
Then this mysterious figure

88
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,300
is actually just a

89
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,220
middleman

90
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,940
And you,

91
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,300
Jiawei,

92
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,500
you're someone who accidentally

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,020
traveled from modern times to ancient times

94
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,060
A romantic soul

95
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,660
In your era,

96
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,260
is there a celebrity

97
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,980
named Dilraba

98
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
who looks exactly like her?

99
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,220
Seems familiar

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,300
Then in your time,

101
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,820
is there someone named Zhang Linghe?

102
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,420
I don't know him

103
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,580
Who cares about him

104
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,660
You know Zhang Jiawei, right?

105
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,900
We can still go over there

106
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,820
Access card

107
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,660
The access card is inside here

108
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,740
A safe box, right?

109
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,100
Twelve people

110
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,660
Nine hundred twelve days

111
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,420
Eighty-eight hours

112
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,620
There's this thing here

113
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,780
Duty regulations

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,380
Could it possibly be plus and minus signs

115
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,900
Could it possibly be plus and minus signs

116
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,820
One plus two equals three

117
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,780
Nine minus two equals seven

118
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,100
Eight plus eight, sixteen

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,260
So 3716

120
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,700
3716

121
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,420
Is that correct

122
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,300
Come on

123
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,180
Let's start the next one

124
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,780
Brother Bai

125
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,340
Let's go

126
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,260
Begin

127
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,140
Because we don't know what's below

128
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,580
A woman might suddenly jump out

129
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
You're so decisive

130
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,940
He doesn't care at all

131
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,180
So impressive

132
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,540
This is truly amazing

133
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Pushing mystery

134
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,300
Who are you?

135
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,620
Someone's here.

136
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,500
How did you get in here?

137
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,140
You're not

138
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,740
Bamei

139
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
Are you Bamui?

140
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,100
You're He Jiawei, right?

141
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,540
Celebrity

142
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,500
Celebrity

143
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,420
Look, celebrity

144
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,980
He Jiawei

145
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,220
He Jiawei

146
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,420
I want to take a photo with you.

147
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,260
Wait a second, I have a question.

148
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,540
Don’t we look like

149
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,580
celebrities or something?

150
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,580
No one recognizes us?

151
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,580
You only know me, right?

152
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,140
But—

153
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,980
Are you filming some secret project?

154
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,300
Yesterday, my coworker mentioned

155
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,540
there was a missing person poster of you here.

156
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,420
You went missing before?

157
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,220
But… can I still get your autograph?

158
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,420
You’re the one dominating the trending lists!

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
You know what

160
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,380
topped the trending charts

161
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,780
But then you disappeared

162
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,140
So everyone

163
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,020
Why did you disappear?

164
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,300
I don't know

165
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,180
You only trended because you disappeared

166
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,540
They just posted this

167
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,660
Show it to him

168
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,700
Let's take a look

169
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,020
Just take a quick look

170
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,180
The most comprehensive ever

171
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,060
Review of elite families in Tui Town

172
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,860
How could you not know?

173
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,620
Look

174
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,100
I'm on page two and you didn't even look

175
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,220
Page one is Master Le

176
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,100
Wait a second

177
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,460
What year is this from?

178
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,340
What year is it now?

179
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,020
Hold on, someone's calling me

180
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,940
Wait for me

181
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,900
Where are you going?

182
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,220
Don't go

183
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,940
So happy to see so many celebrities

184
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,140
Don't leave

185
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
This should contain quite a lot of information

186
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,460
Cover

187
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,980
Tui Town's Top Director

188
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,500
Searching for the Vanished Man

189
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,300
Currently it's 20

190
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,460
2024

191
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,860
He Jiawei is 1.9 meters tall

192
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,380
Likes crossing legs and playing with walnuts

193
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,900
Do you really have this hobby?

194
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,140
Has a mole on his nose

195
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,460
Tends to get lost

196
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Also went missing in February 2012

197
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,780

I managed to save her

271
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,660

272
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,980

Yes

279
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,740
Young Marshal Ning's original name was Ba Ge

280
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,420
Ba Ge

281
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,420
His original name was Ba Ge

282
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,580
He was once the ace bodyguard of the Tuile Sect

283

"The Ultimate Brother Who Dotes on His Sister"

285
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,340
In his later years

286
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
his son Ning Guixing

287
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,100
May I know your name?

288
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,100
His son Ning Guixing

289
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
and granddaughter Ning Mengshui

290
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,100
worked together to compile Young Marshal Ning's life story

291
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,540
and published it as

292
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,860
"Ning's Thirty-Six Stratagems"

293
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,980
This earned Young Marshal Ning the title of

294
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,700
"The Guardian of Love"

295
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,460
Young Marshal Ke was born in 1904

296
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,340
but his age at death is unknown

297
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,620
Ke Shaoshuai joined the elite training camp.

298
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,580
He trained diligently at "Chuang Camp".

299
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,700
Later mastering martial arts,

300
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,940
and becoming well-versed in military strategy.

301
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,460
He was hailed as the "Strongest Wild King".

302
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,460
During a chaotic battle,

303
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,140
Ke Shaoshuai went missing.

304
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,620
The world mourned his loss.

305
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,340
"Not even my bones remained,"

306
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,340
"no one knows exactly when I died."

307
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,620
Lost in the chaos of war.

308
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,540
However, Ke Shaoshuai

309
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,300
left behind some treasures.

310
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,540
His descendants

311
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,100
all became exceptional talents.

312
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,340
First, two brothers:

313
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,660
Ke Ji and Ke Daya.

314
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,780
"What?"

315
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,140
Ke Daya and Ke Ji.

316
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,020
Ke Ji and Ke Daya

317
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,580
conquered the pet market together.

318
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,500
Later came

319
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,020
Ke Xipi,

320
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,140
Ke Xipi,

321
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,620
who won the Tui Bell Literature Prize.

322
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,620
Now his great-grandson Ke Musan,

323
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,020
Ke Musan,

324
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,020
his great-grandson Ke Musan,

325
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,980
works in the field of life sciences

326
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,580
at a leading company.

327
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,180
We hope

328
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,940
he can carve his own path too.

329
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,460
"Life sciences?"

330
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,580
"Could it be Tui Health?"

331
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,900
"Yes, exactly - Tui Health."

332
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,820
"No doubt about it."

333
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
"Isn't this life sciences?"

334
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,380
"Right."

335
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,620
Bai Youcai was born in 1904.

336
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,100
To this day,

337
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,460
And until now,

338
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,180
it continues.

339
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,140
You've lived all these years,

340
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,940
Bai Youcai achieved five generations under one roof.

341
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,540
His son,

342
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,220
his white-haired son,

343
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,260
is the most famous

344
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,140

345
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,900
in Tui Town.

346
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,220
His pair of fraternal twin great-grandsons,

347
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,620
Tui Shenmi is the town's youngest

348
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,100
medical scientist.

349
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,180
I told you,

350
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
what did he say when he saw you?

351
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,460
Called you grandpa?

352
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,180
His attitude toward me was somewhat

353
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,100
enthusiastic.

354
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,540
Right.

355
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,220
You are

356
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,340
Tui Town's best tailor,

357
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,580
the genius Bai Youcai.

358
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,220
Tui Shenmi founded

359
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,420
Tui Health Tech Life Company.

360
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,620
His artificial organs

361
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,020
have brought hope to countless patients

362
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,860
suffering from organ failure.

363
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,020
Tui Shenmi...

364
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,780
Alright, here's the thing:

365
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,660
First, look at this picture -

366
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,180
this person is Tui Shenmi.

367
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,420
In this era,

368
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,060
these so-called artificial organs

369
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,660
aren't actually artificial.

370
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,300
They're harvested from

371
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,180
living beings in Tui Town.

372
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,220
So he built his entire

373
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,300
life tech empire on this.

374
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,700
What an embarrassment.

375
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,060
A huge disgrace.

376
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,940
Absolutely horrifying.

377
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,460
Now he's

378
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,740
beyond redemption.

379
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,460
Seeing this

380
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
What is this

381
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,380
Many people doubt

382
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,900
the artificial organs from

383
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,020
Tui Health Life Technologies.

384
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,300
That's okay.

385
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,060
We don't need to convince the skeptics.

386
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,380
We let the facts speak for themselves.

387
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,660
For any seriously ill patient,

388
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,700
we can give you back

389
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,900
a healthy body.

390
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,580
Every ordinary person

391
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,180
can be reborn.

392
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,020
In the days to come,

393
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,180
to love the world,

394
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,300
to cherish all things.

395
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,980
Though things may turn bad,

396
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,020
and misfortune may occur,

397
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,740
don't worry,

398
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,780
but instead look forward

399
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,820
and anticipate

400
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,740
Tui Health Life Technologies

401
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,020
bringing you a better future.

402
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,380
While there's life, there's hope.

403
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,500
Why is your image here?

404
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,740
Why is it her face?

405
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,100
No,

406
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,220
because this person is Ba Duanjin.

407
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,300
Look at her brooch

408
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,460
and this item.

409
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Ba Duanjin.

410
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,340
Yes,

411
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,140
she is Ba Duanjin,

412
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,380
your great-granddaughter.

413
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,820
See these critically ill patients?

414
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,700
We can give them back

415
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,340
a healthy body.

416
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,300
So she helps those patients

417
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,180
obtain body organs from our side

418
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,980
for their transplants.

419
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,740
Yes,

420
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,180
but look at this -

421
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,980
there's a note on this TV.

422
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,140
They say this TV must not be turned on

423
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,220
Yesterday the receptionist

424
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,380
accidentally turned on the TV here

425
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,220
Luckily I reminded her

426
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,220
If Boss Tui found out

427
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,380
(about Tui's secrecy)

428
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,820
She might get fired

429
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,540
Twelve years ago

430
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,780
I made the same mistake

431
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,860
Back then Boss Tui said

432
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
This TV screen

433
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,420
faces a very important location

434
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,140
Turning it on

435
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,740
would cause serious consequences

436
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,900
He gave me an earful

437
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,900
Yesterday the receptionist

438
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,180
accidentally turned on the TV here

439
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,980
White Passage

440
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,140
Twelve years ago,

441
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,380
I made the same mistake too,

442
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,020
Back then,

443
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,300
while playing around, we ended up

444
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,420
next to the upper room.

445
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,380
Later we wanted to leave but couldn't open the door.

446
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,180
When we fell asleep,

447
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,780
we heard a very soft,

448
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,580
gentle female voice saying:

449
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,100
"While there's life, there's hope."

450
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,460
"While there's life, there's hope."

451
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,940
It opened once twelve years ago

452
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,900
when the three of us

453
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,140
were locked in there.

454
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,460
This TV is connected to that one,

455
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,580
we heard "While there's life, there's hope."

456
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,380
That means the person

457
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,500
we remembered in our hearts

458
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
was Dilraba Duanjin.

459
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,380
Wearing a sunflower,

460
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,180
so in our childhood memories,

461
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,500
it was her.

462
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,220
Yes, we had this phrase.

463
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,260
"While there's life, there's hope," right?

464
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:38,740
That's what it means.

465
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,300
"While there's life, there's hope."

466
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,060
Okay.

467
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,220
Then next,

468
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,020
Come on, friends.

469
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,980
Just these two cabinets.

470
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,140
Aren't these Ning Bao'an's?

471
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,580
These are Ning Bao'an's cabinets.

472
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Music Box

473
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,060
Here

474
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,860
First, let's take a look at Kemusan.

475
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Kemusan

476
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,140
This

477
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,780
Ke Musan

478
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,860
Intern supervisor Ba Duanjin

479
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,940
There are so many things

480
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,580
This is something Dilraba wrote for you

481
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,740
This was during her work

482
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,660
She attached a conversation

483
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,380
She left a sticky note

484
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,980
He just stuck one on

485
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,220
During this process, the two of them

486
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,780
started dating

487
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,100
There was that vibe

488
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,700
I don't know

489
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,060
Intern little brother

490
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,740
Just curious to ask

491
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,420
Why do you have this name?

492
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,540
When my mother was pregnant with me

493
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,780
She kept failing the driving test's third section

494
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,860
Here, take it yourself

495
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,140
You two, come here

496
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,340
Failed 100 times

497
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,140
Finally during

498
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,420
the 101st attempt

499
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,220
She passed

500
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,900
The excitement made me arrive early

501
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,780
So that's how I got this name

502
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,020
Even after 100 failures

503
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,540
You'll still achieve

504
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,700
101 successful attempts

505
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,140
Your name is very cute

506
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Please don't use "cute"

507
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,380
to describe a guy

508
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,100
Then may I curiously ask

509
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,820
why you're called Ba Duanjin?

510
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,340
I'm called Ba Duanjin

511
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,540
Actually, it's somewhat related to you

512
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,940
Related to me?

513
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,340
How is it related to me?

514
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,380
Yes, how is it related to you?

515
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,300
Ba Duanjin, I bought an extra milk tea

516
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,500
Left it on your desk

517
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,980
Up to you whether to drink it

518
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,820
How many times have I told you

519
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,500
No sense of seniority

520
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Call me "sis"

521
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,820
Ba Duanjin

522
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,620
Someone gave me cake

523
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,180
I don't eat sweets, it's yours

524
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,300
How many times have I told you

525
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,940
No sense of seniority

526
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,780
Call me "sis"

527
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,260
Ba Duanjin

528
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,380
Had to meet the minimum order

529
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,020
Ordered an extra portion for your desk

530
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,260
How many times - no sense of seniority

531
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,300
Call me "sis"

532
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,300
Ba Duanjin, this ice cream is too cold

533
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,180
You can have it

534
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,980
February, same day

535
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,220
The ice cream melted. Where are you?

536
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,860
She's gone missing.

537
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,180
Year 2023

538
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,340
There's a document about Ba Duanjin

539
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,020
this particular file

540
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,660
Ba Duanjin had 12 years of service

541
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,340
but was fired for spying on company secrets

542
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,220
According to company regulations

543
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,020
we immediately terminate

544
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,820
the labor contract with Ba Duanjin

545
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,140
Regarding Ba Duanjin's violations

546
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,660
our company deeply regrets

547
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,820
and reserves the right to pursue

548
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,180
legal action against Ba Duanjin

549
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,100
This was on February 8, 2023

550
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,580
She's been fired for a year now

551
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,340
So are you Ba Duanjin?

552
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,420
I'm not

553
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:43,860
She's not Ba Duanjin

554
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
I'm Ba Li

555
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,700
She's Ba Li

556
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,020
Ba Duanjin

557
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,220
Isn't that the person wearing the corsage?

558
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,540
Yes

559
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Tui Shenmi said

560
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,020
You violated company rules

561
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,860
and were fired

562
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
Absolutely impossible

563
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,580
I don't believe it

564
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,260
I will definitely investigate this thoroughly

565
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,900
So Ba Duanjin violated

566
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,060
company rules to save us

567
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,940
(Repeated line - same as above)

568
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,860
Then Tui Shenmi

569
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,340
got rid of Ba Duanjin too

570
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,980
Right

571
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,300
I discovered Tui Shenmi's secret

572
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,340
He's been looking for you

573
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,620
wanting to "kill" you

574
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,380
Where exactly are you?

575
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,140
Are you "dead" or alive?

576
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,740
I'll make sure Tui Shenmi pays for this

577
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,380
This book

578
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,660
This also represents Tuizhen's century-old

579
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,020
This is big news

580
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,740
This is major news

581
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,340
Over the past century, Tuizhen has produced countless

582
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,260
master craftsmen

583
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,820
and given birth to numerous ingenious mechanisms

584
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,700
The first is the Tuilemen Grand Clock

585
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,500
The very place where Tui died mysteriously

586
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,180
Correct

587
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,380
In the entire Sanjia Alley, only Tuilemen

588
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,220
has a mechanical clock

589
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,460
This clock has a special hidden compartment

590
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,700
By touching the center point of the clock face

591
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,860
a specific mechanism

592
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,500
can open the hidden compartment

593
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,820
This clock was designed by a craftsman named

594
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,700
Master Xiu

595
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,060
Only on his deathbed did he reveal the clock's

596
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,300
secret compartment

597
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,700
to his 88 apprentices

598
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,940
Other than me,

599
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,420
no one knew about this mechanical clock

600
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,300
having a hidden compartment.

601
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,260
I never told anyone about it.

602
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,020
I truly never told anyone.

603
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,700
Someone watched this here

604
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,780
Then went down to that place

605
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,100
To kill this mysterious figure

606
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,460
Very clever

607
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,420
Possibly

608
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,380
Indeed

609
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,180
I think it's a modern person

610
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,140
Who saw this in modern times

611
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,380
Then traveled back to ancient times

612
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:47,940
Exactly

613
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,580
Right?

614
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,420
Correct

615
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,260
The modern people we currently know

616
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,380
One is him

617
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,780
And the other is Ba Duanjin

618
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,260
Right?

619
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,980
That's right

620
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,580
So the culprit is quite clear

621
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,260
Yes

622
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,500
Help me

623
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,580
Please begin your performance

624
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,700
Jiawei, stop pretending, Jiawei

625
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,260
But brilliant

626
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,380
As your Mr. X, I'm heartbroken

627
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,580
Were you exposed so quickly?

628
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,060
There's an office here.

629
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,020
Is the office door open?

630
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,100
The office door probably isn't open.

631
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,220
Because it requires a

632
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,700
password.

633
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,540
About the password...

634
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,980
Press 0 before entering the password.

635
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,620
Right now we

636
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,900
don't actually have this password.

637
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,260
But it has a

638
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,580
It has this thing.

639
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,820
This is Ning Bao'an's cabinet.

640
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,900
The boss's office

641
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,620
isn't accessible to just anyone.

642
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,900
What do I have myself?

643
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,980
Words without meaning.

644
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,140
But

645
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,780
the will but not the strength.

646
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,100
Eyes that cannot see.

647
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,940
0

648
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,100
Z

649
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,340
U

650
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,340
It's open.

651
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,980
Inside here

652
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,460
So long

653
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,020
I'll do it

654
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,060
This long

655
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,660
We're not going to have to go back later, are we?

656
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,380
Too scary

657
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,460
I'm speechless

658
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,980
This is really mind-blowing

659
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,860
This

660
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,980
This is yours

661
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,420
My right kidney is here

662
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,020
Blood test failed

663
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,220
Were you included?

664
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,820
No

665
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
That was terrifying

666
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,380
What are you looking at?

667
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,420
Legend has it

668
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,260
You've finally come

669
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,500
Sis Li

670
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,260
Pink Phoenix

671
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,820
Did you receive

672
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,940
my distress letter

673
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,380
I'm so scared here

674
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,460
I can't see your face

675
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,620
or your eyes

676
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,460
or the grand stage from our dreams

677
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,060
or Broadway

678
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,580
It's okay.

679
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,260
Fenghuang, it's okay.

680
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,420
Little brother.

681
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,100
I know you care about me the most.

682
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,020
Right?

683
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,020
You're so passionate.

684
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,220
So kind-hearted.

685
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,820
Then please help me, okay?

686
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,500
Okay.

687
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,340
See how she talks to her brother.

688
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,260
It's completely different from how she talks to me.

689
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,500
Ever since.

690
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,540
Since Tuixuanmi tricked me into coming here.

691
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,660
I realized.

692
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,340
There's no Tui Opera here at all.

693
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,700
Tuixuanmi locked me in.

694
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,940
His office.

695
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,260
They kept sticking needles in me.

696
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,580
Drawing my blood.

697
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,860
Making life unbearable.

698
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,180
Death impossible.

699
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,860
But I discovered their secret.

700
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,700
Here.

701
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,460
All the sisters who came from Tuilemen.

702
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,980
Have suffered terribly because of him.

703
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,140
Legend says, little brother.

704
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,500
You must save me.

705
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,060
We're here, don't worry.

706
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,020
Tuixuanmi is already dead.

707
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,060
You can reassure her now.

708
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,820
Great.

709
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,020
Fenghuang, it's okay.

710
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,060
Come sit here first.

711
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,180
What else?

712
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,620
Keep looking.

713
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,740
What else is here?

714
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,820
Why is there

715
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,740
a record by Wang the Legend here?

716
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,900
Thank you for saving my life, genius doctor.

717
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,780
I present to you our family's treasured

718
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,540
great-grandfather's century-old vinyl record.

719
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,020
Respectfully, Boss Wang.

720
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,700
This Boss Wang is your descendant.

721
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,860
My descendant?

722
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,940
There's a medical record.

723
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,300
Look.

724
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,420
Boss Wang, here.

725
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,020
This is He Jiawei's medical record.

726
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,940
Boss Wang, male, 32 years old,

727
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,420
owner of a music record company,

728
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,420
with ultra-rare blood type.

729
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,020
Great-grandfather had aplastic anemia.

730
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,620
Receives monthly transfusions of

731
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,900
artificial ultra-rare blood type.

732
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,660
Scheduled for second artificial

733
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,460
ultra-rare blood type

734
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,700
bone marrow transplant on February 3, 2024.

735
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,260
So that means he's about to undergo

736
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,620
the transplant today.

737
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,380
Today's the day.

738
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,140
Correct.

739
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,300
Pink Phoenix

740
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,460
Blood drawn on the 3rd of every month

741
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,180
Preparing for bone marrow extraction

742
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,100
To meet Boss Wang's

743
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,380
long-term treatment needs

744
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,660
Pink Phoenix was housed in

745
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,260
a more concealed office

746
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,700
Administer sedatives before blood draw

747
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,980
Then restrained in operating room

748
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,820
So now he's Wang Legend

749
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,940
She's Pink Phoenix

750
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,900
They got married

751
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,100
Thus their children

752
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,340
Are more compatible, right

753
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,340
This Boss Wang earlier

754
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,180
committed what misdeed?

755
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,340
Had a marrow transplant

756
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,780
Received Pink Phoenix's marrow

757
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,060
The procedure's complete

758
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,460
Yes

759
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,020
That's terrifying

760
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,060
These descendants don't know

761
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,180
They're using their ancestors'

762
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,940
forebears' organs

763
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,540
He surely didn't mean to

764
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,220
When he came here

765
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,340
He didn't know it was Pink Phoenix's

766
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,380
Okay

767
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,860
Then next

768
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,060
Let's look at He Jiawei's

769
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,460
"Pushing Health" congratulates Director He on successful surgery

770
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,420
This is your father

771
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,300
He Jiawei's paternal hereditary kidney disease

772
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,700
Evening of February 7, 2023

773
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,780
Successful surgery

774
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,020
October 22

775
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,540
No rejection observed in artificial kidney

776
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,580
Alright, regarding Bali,

777
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,260
the right kidney was removed.

778
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,500
On the evening of February 7th,

779
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,140
right after completing He Jiawei's transplant surgery,

780
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,740
there was an unexpected power outage.

781
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,900
Bali went missing.

782
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,260
Not disposed of as planned.

783
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,500
You just disappeared,

784
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
probably escaped.

785
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,420
Surveillance footage from February 8th revealed

786
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,620
that Ba Duanjin manually cut the power,

787
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,260
causing the security doors to fail.

788
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,300
The only possible destination was

789
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,860
the Tui Le Gate from 100 years ago.

790
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,860
Ba Duanjin, with 12 years of service,

791
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,180
was fired for spying on company secrets.

792
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,740
This was February 8, 2023.

793
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,180
He'd been fired for a year already.

794
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,140
I verified with Master Le

795
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,220
Master Le confirmed it

796
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,420
Bali was pushing the Le Gate

797
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,540
After Bali regained consciousness

798
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,340
I learned through questioning

799
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,100
that she knew little about

800
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,980
the events of 2023

801
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,820
We'll leave it for now

802
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,020
I had no idea

803
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,020
what had happened

804
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,500
Then I saw

805
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,060
Master Le standing nearby

806
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,540
He told me

807
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,900
Tui Lao Hui was robbed

808
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,260
Then I was stabbed

809
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,020
Only informed Master Le

810
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,100
that Bali was hurt by

811
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,660
the Tui Lao Hui assassin Ba Duanjin

812
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,380
Told Master Le to find Ba Duanjin at all costs

813
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,460
and eliminate him

814
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,300
to prevent future trouble

815
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,380
Good

816
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,060
Framing

817
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,420
Master Le

818
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,380
This woman wearing a sunflower brooch

819
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,060
and bracelet

820
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,700
is a Tui Lao Hui assassin

821
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,180
You must find her

822
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,460
and kill her

823
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,700
So her kidney was transplanted to you

824
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,540
Give it back to my sister

825
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,220
It was given to He Jiawei

826
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,900
Stop pretending at this point

827
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm a romantic

828
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,420
Why romantic?

829
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,140
I'll tell you

830
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,220
Because the right kidney in your body

831
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,860
is searching for its original owner

832
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,820
So

833
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,780
Right

834
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,340
That kidney is looking for its owner

835
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,740
Exactly

836
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,060
That's why it keeps following her

837
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,540
Yes

838
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,260
I've figured it out

839
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,700
Figured it out

840
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,980
You wouldn't be my mother, would you?

841
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,620
No.

842
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,380
Stop trying to claim connections here.

843
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:27,780
Alright.

844
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,500
Look at the back.

845
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,900
Special note:

846
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,740
February 1, 2012.

847
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,980
After He Jiawei's father He Dao was hospitalized,

848
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,860
He Jiawei went missing.

849
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,980
On February 4, 2012,

850
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,940
I found him in an old warehouse and brought him back.

851
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,060
Due to prolonged unconsciousness during this period,

852
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,940
He remembered nothing.

853
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,260
When I was little,

854
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
Right.

855
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,060
Let me analyze the logic:

856
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,780
Twelve years ago,

857
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,180
when they were children,

858
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,300
you met them.

859
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,420
At that time,

860
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,260
you retained that memory.

861
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
Then probably,

862
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,340
in that room,

863
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,940
unintentionally,

864
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,780
you might have seen her after surgery.

865
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,340
You thought she was a fairy,

866
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,060
right?

867
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,740
Then you wanted to find her,

868
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
and went back to ancient times.

869
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,860
But you didn't know you went back in time.

870
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,980
During your search,

871
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,260
you knocked him out with a blow,

872
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,060
and he lost his memory.

873
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,220
After losing his memory,

874
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,540
he stayed in our time.

875
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,180
Then coincidentally at this time,

876
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,660
my real brother and I were playing a game.

877
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,940
Yes, playing this -

878
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,260
hide and seek.

879
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,260
Okay.

880
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,620
Now about this part -

881
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,740
there's a line later:

882
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,180
In that era, human lives

883
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,340
were as cheap as weeds.

884
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,460
I want to take what was

885
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
most worthless in that time

886
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,980
and make it the most valuable

887
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,100
in my era.

888
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,420
This way, they can

889
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,180
die with more purpose.

890
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,780
Deserves to die

891
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,700
Take a look

892
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,340
Mysterious light gate tunnel

893
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,980
Scientists propose a new theory

894
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,420
A mad explorer

895
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,540
in the remote Xishengyang Continent

896
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,700
discovered a massive canyon with

897
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,060
a passage emitting strange light

898
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,220
He proposed a startling theory

899
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,900
This is a "space-time rift"

900
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,100
connecting two points in time

901
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,820
100 years apart

902
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,020
There's also

903
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,100
You're really lucky

904
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,340
Like me, you found the space-time rift

905
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,260
But the space-time rift

906
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,700
is actually extremely unstable

907
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,740
I searched the whole world

908
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,580
and found a special meteorite

909
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,740
Using this meteorite

910
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,780
I created this

911
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,220
"Space-time rift" stabilizer

912
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,420
And try to maintain stable power

913
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,820
because it's a high-power device

914
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,860
High-power device

915
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,820
We still need to turn this on

916
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,700
High-power device

917
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,980
How mysterious

918
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,620
This key

919
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,300
is essentially the high-power device's

920
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,220
spare key

921
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,660
Soon we might need to activate

922
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,060
that thing

923
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,460
Let's return to high-power mode

924
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,540
We need to turn it off

925
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,060
to protect people in our time

926
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,260
from having their kidneys stolen

927
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,580
I'll bring Pink Phoenix with me

928
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,140
Phoenix, I've missed you so much

929
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,380
He's here

930
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,980
Back to a familiar place

931
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,900
Eating a banana

932
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,180
Key

933
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,140
Opened

934
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,380
Open

935
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,260
Space-time Rift Stabilizer

936
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,500
This is the only stabilizer of its kind in the world

937
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,100
If this stabilizer gets damaged

938
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,060
The magnetic field energy it generates

939
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,900
will completely disappear

940
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,940
within 24 hours

941
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,940
and the time rift will close

942
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,780
It's already broken

943
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
See? It's already damaged

944
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:47,860
The circuit board's

945
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,300
fallen out

946
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,060
Someone sabotaged it

947
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,380
Which means it's already broken

948
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,540
We're already within that

949
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,020
24-hour window

950
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,940
Right

951
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,820
Those who want to return should go now

952
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,140
Those who want to stay can remain

953
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,780
Exactly

954
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,500
Otherwise we need to find a way to fix it

955
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,620
Jiawei, you should hurry

956
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,460
or you won't be able to return

957
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,860
Goodbye

958
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,140
No

959
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,820
My memories begin here

960
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,980
How can I go back?

961
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,300
Be my brother again in the next life

962
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,060
If you don't leave,

963
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,140
you'll be considered the murderer.

964
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
You'll be executed.

965
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,420
You will face execution.

966
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,660
The choice is yours.

967
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,860
Make your decision.

968
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,940
I didn't kill anyone.

969
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,380
Right now since we're in

970
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,300
the 24-hour window,

971
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,820
we can move back and forth.

972
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,500
But once time's up,

973
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,140
you can't go back.

974
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,100
We can't cross over either.

975
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Think carefully about this.

976
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,660
What should I think about?

977
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,580
We need to find the killer and evidence.

978
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,340
Why

979
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,380
has this become about

980
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,380
whether I return or not?

981
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,780
So who among us

982
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,340
can be ruled out?

983
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,940
Who can be eliminated?

984
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,980
No one can be ruled out.

985
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,060
Actually, everyone remains suspicious.

986
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,260
In this murder mystery, everyone's a suspect.

987
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,700
I can only eliminate myself.

988
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,140
Nonsense, you're the detective.

989
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,220
Here's the current mystery:

990
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,220
His time of death was

991
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,260
between 7 to 8 PM,

992
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,500
yet we all have alibis.

993
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,380
Yes.

994
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,140
This is something that

995
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,060
remains unresolved.

996
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,900
Why?

997
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,140
Is anyone there?

998
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,220
Who's there?

999
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,540
Is anyone here?

1000
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,500
Who?

1001
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,940
Is anyone there?

1002
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,420
Hello?

1003
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,940
Why are you here again?

1004
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,780
What's going on?

1005
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,780
Let me see what's happening.

1006
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
Everyone's here.

1007
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,060
We're helping you solve the case.

1008
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,740
That's too much information, Master Xiu.

1009
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,100
You have 88 disciples.

1010
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,700
I have 88 disciples.

1011
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,220
That's right.

1012
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,180
How do you know?

1013
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,540
I have 88 disciples.

1014
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,380
You're joking.

1015
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,500
We've gathered too much information now.

1016
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,220
Let me tell you.

1017
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,420
We're actually from the future.

1018
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,580
And let me tell you.

1019
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,500
You'll be famous in the future.

1020
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,780
I'll be famous in the future?

1021
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,020
Yes, incredibly so.

1022
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,420
You'll be recorded in history.

1023
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,860
Will I trend online?

1024
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,460
You'll trend whenever you want.

1025
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:05,900
Trending topics.

1026
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,860
Tuitown's trending list.

1027
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,420
Tuitown has trending topics.

1028
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,860
No, actually...

1029
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,580
I was terrified by the corpse earlier.

1030
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,380
Now I remember I need to come back.

1031
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,500
First, about Brother Shan...

1032
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,020
Can you return my chest bag?

1033
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,380
What's a chest bag?

1034
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,580
Over there.

1035
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:23,940
My buddy's bag.

1036
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,980
Come on, I want it back.

1037
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,300
There's one more important thing.

1038
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,540
Let me introduce you to something.

1039
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,860
This large round clock is my masterpiece.

1040
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,100
Earlier, the corpse was stuck in this large clock.

1041
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,180
It must have affected its movement.

1042
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,020
So I need to check

1043
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,740
how long it's been running

1044
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,860
the quantity

1045
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,540
Right

1046
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,740
Let me tell you

1047
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,820
Because this thing here

1048
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,260
After placing this body here

1049
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,940
it affects the heat dissipation

1050
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,540
So the rear cooling panel

1051
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,940
will automatically open

1052
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,900
After opening

1053
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,580
it might affect its movement

1054
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:53,900
Okay

1055
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,260
So give me some time

1056
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,460
Let me check this clock

1057
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,060
how much delay there is

1058
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,620
Exactly how much delay now

1059
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,340
Why is it so much slower now?

1060
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,340
1:1.4

1061
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,860
It's slowed down to 1:1.4

1062
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,020
1:1.4

1063
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,580
For example, how many hours does that translate to?

1064
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,540
1:1.4

1065
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,300
1 hour becomes 84 minutes

1066
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,660
1 hour is 60 minutes

1067
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,820
So it becomes 84 minutes

1068
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,140
Understood

1069
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,340
The 1:1.4 ratio

1070
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,700
That's your business

1071
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,980
Alright

1072
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,020
Too many things have happened at Tui Le Gate recently

1073
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,500
I'll take my leave now

1074
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,660
I'll come back in a couple days to adjust it

1075
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,500
Leaving

1076
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,740
Thanks for your hard work, Master Xiu

1077
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,060
No need

1078
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,940
I'll go first

1079
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,100
I just remembered when I came here

1080
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,140
There was something in the tree hole by Tui Le Gate's entrance

1081
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,900
There's something

1082
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,340
Tree hole

1083
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,100
You should check it out later

1084
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,580
I'm off

1085
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:54,820
Okay

1086
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,180
Alright

1087
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,860
Come again

1088
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,540
Okay

1089
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,940
Tree hole

1090
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,500
Let's go take a look then

1091
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,700
Good

1092
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,140
Where is that tree hole?

1093
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,940
We still need to find the tree hole

1094
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,540
This big tree over here

1095
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,300
Hurry, it should be this tree

1096
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,060
Is there something inside here?

1097
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,900
I can't see it clearly.

1098
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,740
Where's the hole?

1099
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,860
I can't get my hand in.

1100
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,060
This...

1101
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
This...

1102
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,740
I felt it.

1103
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,340
A cloth bag

1104
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,420
A leather wallet

1105
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,500
And there's also this inside

1106
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:05,940
Okay

1107
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,380
After we get it, let's head back first, alright?

1108
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,900
It's getting too cold, don't you think?

1109
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,460
Okay, let's go

1110
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,100
Let's go inside to talk

1111
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,540
Go inside

1112
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,860
Why don't you take a look at this first?

1113
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,220
Sure

1114
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:17,740
Bali

1115
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,300
There's a message on the back

1116
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,380
Great-grandma

1117
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,420
Great-grandma

1118
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,260
On the day negotiations with Master Le failed

1119
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,100
I accidentally left behind

1120
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,340
the sunflower brooch and bracelet you gave me

1121
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,660
Although the sunflower is gone,

1122
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,820
I will always remember what you told me.

1123
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,380
To shine like sunlight upon those

1124
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,580
who are in their darkest hours.

1125
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,340
Rest assured, Great-grandma.

1126
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,340
I will surely become the light

1127
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,580
for all the girls of Tuilemen.

1128
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,220
I have a chance to eliminate the mystery of Tuilemen.

1129
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,420
Wasn't Great-grandma talking about me?

1130
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,340
Is this you?

1131
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,980
This was written by Ba Duanjin to Great-grandma.

1132
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,180
But it was meant for you, wasn't it?

1133
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:55,860
And then...

1134
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,180
Right.

1135
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,380
The sunflower bracelet was given by you to Ba Duanjin.

1136
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,620
How do you explain this?

1137
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,940
You gave this.

1138
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,060
I really didn't know.

1139
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,660
I gave this to her?

1140
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,220
No.

1141
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,580
It might be...

1142
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,220
No.

1143
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,020
She gave it.

1144
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,220
But not necessarily at her current age.

1145
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,620
She might have given it when she was older.

1146
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,220
Right.

1147
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,660
It could be part of her legacy.

1148
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,340
Possibly.

1149
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,220
Yes.

1150
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,100
So we can't blame her.

1151
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,220
That's why she didn't know.

1152
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,980
In the end, it returned to its original owner.

1153
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,340
Wait a minute.

1154
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,100
And she said she would definitely do the Tui Le Gate.

1155
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,780
The light for all the girls.

1156
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,140
Find an opportunity to eliminate (Tui Shenmi).

1157
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,740
That's right.

1158
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,300
It means she's still alive.

1159
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,420
Ba Duanjin is still alive.

1160
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,180
It means Ba Duanjin has been protecting.

1161
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,020
the people here.

1162
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,620
Right.

1163
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,340
So she is.

1164
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,060
She has been protecting everyone.

1165
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:37,740
She is protecting.

1166
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,900
But that doesn't necessarily mean she's the killer.

1167
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:39,740
Right.

1168
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,460
So actually, what I got.

1169
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,460
That note written by some kind-hearted person.

1170
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,060
Including the things from Phoenix.

1171
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,540
All the things passed over were sent by her.

1172
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,340
Your partner was ostensibly sent by Le Ye.

1173
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,460
to Tui Lao Hui.

1174
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,460
But in reality, Le Ye sent them.

1175
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,940
on a path of no return.

1176
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,100
February 7, 1923.

1177
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,860
A kind-hearted person.

1178
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,540
Someone sent you this letter, right?

1179
00:43:59,620 --> 00:43:59,940
Yes.

1180
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,180
A blood-stained note was found.

1181
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,300
Wang Chuan, will you come to save me?

1182
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,020
Then you returned to your room.

1183
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,260
It suddenly appeared in your room.

1184
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,260
Appeared out of nowhere.

1185
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,620
Read this first.

1186
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,940
This notebook contains some information.

1187
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,180
First, the company has a group of nurses in Zone B.

1188
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,020
Their uniforms are actually retro-style outfits.

1189
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,140
Nurses' uniforms...

1190
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,740
A question mark is written next to "nurses' uniforms."

1191
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,340
Right.

1192
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,420
The second page says...

1193
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,660
A terrified woman in a qipao...

1194
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,740
was dragged away from Zone B.

1195
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,940
She also dropped a bloodstained...

1196
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,540
pink phoenix hairpiece.

1197
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,060
Is this the Pink Phoenix?

1198
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,580
Pink Phoenix...

1199
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,940
The woman in the qipao is the Pink Phoenix.

1200
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,860
She infiltrated Zone B...

1201
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,260
and actually saved her great-grandmother in her youth.

1202
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,060
This is whose diary?

1203
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,820
Yes.

1204
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,140
Passing through the passage...

1205
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,580
She ended up in... 1923?!

1206
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,020
A time-space passage.

1207
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,700
She wrote that she couldn’t return anytime soon.

1208
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,820
"The mysterious one will definitely come for me."

1209
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,900
To hide from him...

1210
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,860
and to avoid being recognized...

1211
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,820
since I look identical to my great-grandmother...

1212
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,820
I had to cover my face with long fake hair.

1213
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,380
The long-haired witch...

1214
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,740
But when I went out at midnight...

1215
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,340
to find food and clothes...

1216
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,140
the townspeople mistook me for the terrifying long-haired witch.

1217
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,820
After seeking help from the old hall master,

1218
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,100
he was killed not long after.

1219
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,100
The wounds on his body perfectly matched

1220
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,620
the shape of a surgical scalpel.

1221
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,100
It was a mysterious killing.

1222
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,260
That's it.

1223
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,460
Ba Duanjin knows everything.

1224
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,260
Omniscient perspective.

1225
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,540
This entire notebook explains

1226
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,100
all our questions about Ba Duanjin.

1227
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,940
Right.

1228
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,580
Yes, actually, if you apply all the questions

1229
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,860
to Ba Duanjin,

1230
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,460
it all makes sense.

1231
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,260
She is the Long-Haired Witch.

1232
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:50,620
Right.

1233
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,220
And also the Sunflower Goddess.

1234
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:52,820
Right.

1235
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,700
She fought with Master Le,

1236
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,500
but she failed to kill him.

1237
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,900
She probably wanted to kill Master Le but failed,

1238
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,020
and then you killed her.

1239
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,300
Right.

1240
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,180
Everything makes sense now.

1241
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,660
The Long-Haired Witch had the motive

1242
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
for a mysterious killing.

1243
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,300
But whether she actually did it

1244
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,860
we still don't know.

1245
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,220
This story is really scary.

1246
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:11,620
Okay.

1247
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,460
So now we need to

1248
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,220
sort out the timeline.

1249
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,620
Exactly, sort out the timeline.

1250
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:14,980
Right.

1251
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,500
Let me calculate it my way.

1252
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,220
Didn't he just say

1253
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,860
about the 1:1.4 time ratio?

1254
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,580
That means

1255
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,140
when we woke up at 6am,

1256
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,580
the time we saw was actually incorrect.

1257
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,700
It was too early.

1258
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,940
The actual time should be

1259
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,380
later than 6 o'clock.

1260
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:37,860
Exactly.

1261
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,100
The time identified

1262
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,140
is actually correct.

1263
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,260
So our 10 to 11 hours

1264
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,300
according to the normal clock's

1265
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,580
delayed time calculation,

1266
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,420
how long has it actually been?

1267
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,300
Take 10 and 11 hours

1268
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,500
and divide each by 1.4.

1269
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,300
I just did the calculation

1270
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,660
subtracting the divided ratio

1271
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,420
from 6 o'clock,

1272
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,300
and it was approximately

1273
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,860
between 10:51pm and 10:09pm the previous night

1274
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,980
during this time period

1275
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,660
that the body was placed inside the clock.

1276
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,860
Leave the math problems to you.

1277
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,740
I really can't do this.

1278
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,820
Then you calculate it.

1279
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,300
Calculate it following this logic.

1280
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,780
Come on, math teacher.

1281
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,220
Let's go.

1282
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,580
Alright, let's do it.

1283
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,900
That repair master just said.

1284
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,100
The time ratio is 1:1.4.

1285
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,460
That means the clock's time.

1286
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,260
is slower than real time.

1287
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,220
Slower.

1288
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,900
Slower.

1289
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,220
Slower.

1290
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:38,540
Right?

1291
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,500
So that means real time.

1292
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,900
divided by clock time equals 1.4.

1293
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,220
If we want to calculate X's time.

1294
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,820
it would equal Y divided by 1.4, right?

1295
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,100
Yes.

1296
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,380
10 to 11 hours.

1297
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,460
This is the verified real time.

1298
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,340
Actually just 10 to 11 hours.

1299
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,780
Converted to minutes.

1300
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,420
600 to 660 minutes.

1301
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,380
Each divided by 1.4.

1302
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,660
The resulting numbers are.

1303
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:15,820
428.6 to 471 minutes.

1304
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,540
Convert back to hours.

1305
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,380
That's 7 hours 09 minutes.

1306
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,380
Then this is 6×7=42.

1307
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,260
7 hours 51 minutes.

1308
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,540
6 o'clock minus 7 hours 9 minutes.

1309
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,300
and 6 o'clock minus 7 hours.

1310
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,420
51 minutes.

1311
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,780
That would be.

1312
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,860
From 10:51 PM to 10:09 PM.

1313
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,180
Impressive

1314
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,940
I must give you a round of applause

1315
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,860
So that period was his

1316
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,820
time of death

1317
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,860
So starting after 10 PM

1318
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,100
people began to appear

1319
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,580
Right

1320
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,820
So did she actually leave at 10 PM?

1321
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,540
Right?

1322
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:11,940
Yes.

1323
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,020
Dilraba left at 10 PM.

1324
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,460
He left at 10:25 PM.

1325
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,100
I left at 10:45 PM.

1326
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:17,980
You left at 10:45 PM.

1327
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,580
Correct.

1328
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,180
So after all this calculating...

1329
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,660
What's the conclusion?

1330
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,660
All three of you are suspects.

1331
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,500
All three of us are suspects?

1332
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,620
But he isn't a suspect.

1333
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,900
Wang Chuanshuo is ruled out.

1334
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,220
But if all three of us

1335
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,060
are possible suspects,

1336
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,700
then all three of us must know

1337
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,500
about this.

1338
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,620
We all have motives.

1339
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,740
We all wanted to kill him.

1340
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,220
Right.

1341
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,100
I was protecting myself,

1342
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,900
and protecting Bali.

1343
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,820
I believe he killed Ba Duanjin,

1344
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,420
so I wanted revenge for Ba Duanjin.

1345
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,020
Both of us were protecting my sister,

1346
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,540
Fenghuang.

1347
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:52,980
Right?

1348
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,980
We all had motives.

1349
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,980
But now all three of us know

1350
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,940
about this watch.

1351
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,100
Does it have a hidden compartment?

1352
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,180
Only someone who knows the mechanism

1353
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,260
could have done this.

1354
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,180
Yes.

1355
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,300
So he's a modern person.

1356
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,300
Modern people understand clock mechanisms.

1357
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:08,580
Right.

1358
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,540
He's a modern person.

1359
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,060
So I think the killer now appears to be

1360
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,220
only possibly Ba Duanjin.

1361
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,700
Ba Duanjin knew modern

1362
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,220
mechanisms,

1363
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,740
and understood our current situation.

1364
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,620
As for the rest of us,

1365
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,900
which of you knows this mechanism?

1366
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,500
Wait,

1367
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,660
there's also someone named

1368
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,300
Jiawei you're overlooking.

1369
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:34,260
Yes.

1370
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,980
He Jiawei.

1371
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,940
There's also Jiawei.

1372
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,740
But Jiawei doesn't know this mechanism.

1373
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,100
No,

1374
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,620
if you've lived in the modern world

1375
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,300
and read "The Clock Manual,"

1376
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,460
you'd know how clocks work.

1377
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,700
That would make you a suspect.

1378
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,100
No,

1379
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,220
logically speaking,

1380
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,500
actually Ba Duanjin is more... you know,

1381
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,900
because she

1382
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,500
when writing to that person (Tui Shenmi)

1383
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,300
in the letter,

1384
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,500
there's this logic:

1385
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,780
she wrote "I know what you've been doing"

1386
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,420
Right,

1387
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,860
which means she knew

1388
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,580
about Tui Shenmi selling human kidneys

1389
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,180
Correct.

1390
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,460
Was that written by Ba Duanjin?

1391
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,340
No signature,

1392
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,300
but only Ba Duanjin would know.

1393
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,380
He Jiawei was completely in the dark,

1394
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,500
How could the kidney recipients not know?

1395
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,060
The recipients only knew they were

1396
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,300
receiving artificial organs.

1397
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,220
They didn't know about

1398
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,820
the entire business operation.

1399
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,900
The only one who knew

1400
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,020
was Ba Duanjin.

1401
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,820
He just participated in the transplants,

1402
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,380
but didn't know these kidneys

1403
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,500
came from our dimension.

1404
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
So if we're talking about

1405
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,860
the most crucial point,

1406
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,660
I think only Ba Duanjin fits the criteria.

1407
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,540
And up until now,

1408
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,580
Ba Duanjin hasn't come forward.

1409
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,180
Are you Ba Li or Ba Duanjin?

1410
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,540
I'm really Ba Li.

1411
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,460
There's something I've never quite understood.

1412
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,700
What was that just now?

1413
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,460
Isn't this Ning Bao'an's?

1414
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,140
This is Ning Bao'an's locker.

1415
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,460
Open it.

1416
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,060
Work ID.

1417
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:13,860
This...

1418
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,380
This photo is of Ning Bao'an.

1419
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,980
Ning Bao'an and Ba Duanjin.

1420
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,980
Look behind them.

1421
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,780
Why is your...

1422
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,620
Let me see.

1423
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,300
"Sis, you focus on chasing your dreams."

1424
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,180
"I'll be your security guard."

1425
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,140
Yes, that's me.

1426
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,780
But Ning Bao'an...

1427
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,500
is connected to Ba Duanjin again.

1428
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,260
Could it be that after Ba Duanjin got involved here...

1429
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,620
Now I'm her brother too.

1430
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,580
I'll still be her brother 100 years later.

1431
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,620
I'm Ba Duanjin's brother.

1432
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:41,860
No.

1433
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,140
Don't suspect my brother.

1434
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,700
I deduce...

1435
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,020
I'm not suspecting you.

1436
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,500
Then you might be X.

1437
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,420
X.

1438
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,620
No.

1439
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,300
I'm X, I can't kill people.

1440
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:52,940
It's possible X...

1441
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,700
You couldn't kill someone.

1442
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,860
But you might be lying.

1443
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,260
Why would I lie about this?

1444
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,980
What I mean is...

1445
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,940
I didn't say...

1446
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,700
I don't understand what you're saying.

1447
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,660
You've completely confused him.

1448
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,380
You've made him speechless.

1449
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,540
I'm saying you might be helping...

1450
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,180
the killer play games.

1451
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,060
Yes.

1452
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,540
Or you might be helping the killer too.

1453
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,820
I am X.

1454
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,060
So of course I'd help the killer.

1455
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,740
When you left, Young Master Ke,

1456
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,900
what were you doing?

1457
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,020
During our second round of games,

1458
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,460
I came to find the mysterious pusher.

1459
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,220
You were there at 10:25 PM,

1460
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,940
from 10:25 PM to 10:45 PM.

1461
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,500
Right.

1462
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
I left at 10:45.

1463
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,660
I left as soon as he returned.

1464
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,020
Let me make it simple for you.

1465
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,500
You need to analyze the murder motive,

1466
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,700
and whoever fits the timeline

1467
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,780
can be identified as the culprit.

1468
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,100
So it must be him.

1469
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,460
It can't be him.

1470
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,140
Everything pointing to him is too obvious.

1471
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,180
It can't be that straightforward.

1472
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:48,980
But there's one logic:

1473
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,340
His current amnesia

1474
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,580
still hasn't been resolved.

1475
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,100
He genuinely has amnesia.

1476
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,740
But has he recovered now?

1477
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:55,980
Brother,

1478
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,260
I really don't remember.

1479
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,580
Understood.

1480
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,540
Here's the logic:

1481
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,020
He doesn't remember anything,

1482
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,820
but didn't he regain his memory

1483
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,980
after doing the squatting game?

1484
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:06,180
Yes.

1485
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,260
So when you were over there

1486
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,940
telling me about it,

1487
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,460
I realized I'm He Jiawei,

1488
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,260
but I truly have no memory at all.

1489
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,180
I mean after finishing the squatting game,

1490
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,940
you could've come to kill.

1491
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,540
Because you regained all your memories.

1492
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,820
But this logic is too clear-cut.

1493
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,700
It's too obvious pointing to you, which feels odd.

1494
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,820
But we can't use this point

1495
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,020
to rule him out as a suspect.

1496
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,700
I can't just say because the timing

1497
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,940
matches him too perfectly,

1498
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,980
it's too obvious, so it can't be him.

1499
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,700
Right.

1500
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Anyway, Young Master He didn't do it.

1501
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:34,980
Right?

1502
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,980
Because he's not from modern times.

1503
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,460
But why can't it be you?

1504
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,100
You can suspect him.

1505
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,420
Wait a minute, why can't it be you, Ke Musan?

1506
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,340
It could be me

1507
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,380
But look at each of us

1508
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,340
In real life

1509
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,100
We all have our own modern

1510
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,260
identity

1511
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,820
The second one, right?

1512
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,260
Right

1513
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,060
Dilraba

1514
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,260
He Jiawei

1515
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,900
Boss Wang, Ke Musan

1516
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,700
Right

1517
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,180
But in this world we've entered today

1518
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,300
There's no Boss Wang

1519
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,860
No Ke Musan

1520
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,540
Only you two exist

1521
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,340
Why wouldn't Ke Musan exist?

1522
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,220
Ke Musan does exist in this world - where?

1523
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,500
We've seen evidence today

1524
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,660
That he was here

1525
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,780
Because your counterpart in this world

1526
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,900
Went to participate in

1527
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,820
"Produce Camp" and then disappeared

1528
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,740
Unknown

1529
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,460
Not dead

1530
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,820
But you disappeared

1531
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,580
Young Master Ke was born in 1904

1532
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,860
Age at death unknown

1533
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,940
So now you are Ke Musan

1534
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,860
You're representing someone from this era

1535
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,260
Sitting here talking with us

1536
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,580
Possibly

1537
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:52,500
No

1538
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,740
Ke Musan exists in this

1539
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,380
storyline of ours

1540
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,900
But he doesn't exist in today's world

1541
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,620
Why?

1542
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,260
Why? How come?

1543
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,180
Where's the proof he ever existed?

1544
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,260
He came here and lost his memory

1545
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,740
Ba came here just to

1546
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,900
protect your great-grandmother

1547
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,740
save your great-grandmother

1548
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,940
Ke Musan came here

1549
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,540
Have we ever seen him?

1550
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:09,780
Find her

1551
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,780
Because of me

1552
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,580
Because of you

1553
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,140
Not because of me

1554
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,300
It's because of Ba Duanjin

1555
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,340
In the conversation, you mentioned where you went

1556
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,900
Because you might have some issues

1557
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,700
The boss found out

1558
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,740
So you got fired

1559
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,100
Below is the company's notice

1560
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,980
Stating that Ba Duanjin was fired

1561
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,660
Alright

1562
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,580
Boss Wang is checking my pulse

1563
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,660
It's out

1564
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,340
Basically confirmed now

1565
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,260
Confirmed

1566
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:37,700
Okay

1567
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,140
I think we can vote now

1568
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,340
This could pin it on me

1569
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,420
Because he knows this boss

1570
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,940
Wants to kill Ba Duanjin in this era

1571
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,260
Right

1572
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,020
Yes, exactly

1573
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,420
Ke Musan's motive for killing the mysterious person

1574
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,180
Is because he wants to protect Ba Duanjin

1575
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,540
Correct

1576
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,060
Isn't that right?

1577
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,460
But I'm Ke Shaoshuai

1578
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,980
Ke Shaoshuai has already disappeared

1579
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,700
Because even I didn't know

1580
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,580
I disappeared yesterday

1581
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,380
But if we can confirm this point

1582
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,300
Then I think it's confirmed

1583
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,500
That

1584
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:05,980
Ke Musan

1585
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,540
Since I met you all yesterday

1586
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,580
I've been

1587
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,660
I haven't been Ke Shaoshuai

1588
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,620
Where's that previous evidence about him?

1589
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,580
Has it been brought over?

1590
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:13,860
No

1591
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,140
Haven't got it

1592
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:14,940
Haven't retrieved it

1593
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,140
Now if we can just confirm what's written in that book

1594
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,940
That he's the real Ke Shaoshuai

1595
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,500
Is dead

1596
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,460
Status unknown

1597
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,500
If it's this year

1598
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,060
Right

1599
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,180
Then he must be Ke Musan

1600
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:25,740
Agreed

1601
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,060
Yes

1602
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,660
I beg you to confirm

1603
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,780
Just confirm this point

1604
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,580
Go check it out, right?

1605
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,420
Really?

1606
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,100
Here.

1607
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,860
Let's take a look at this century's history.

1608
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,500
I want to see which year I died.

1609
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,620
Look at Ke Shaoshuai, from 1904 to unknown

1610
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,340
Ke Shaoshuai went missing during a chaotic battle

1611
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,260
Everyone lamented his fate

1612
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,980
However, Ke Shaoshuai...

1613
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,580
Still left behind some treasures

1614
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,820
His descendants

1615
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,260
Are all rare talents in this world

1616
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,740
I don't have children yet

1617
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,340
I don't even have a girlfriend

1618
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,580
How could I have children?

1619
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,140
Then he must have had children before disappearing

1620
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,980
So that means he's alive, right?

1621
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,260
But here it says I discovered

1622
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,380
the mysterious secret of Tui Shenmi

1623
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,780
He's been looking for you

1624
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,700
wanting to kill you

1625
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,460
Where exactly are you—alive or dead?

1626
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,140
I will make Tui Shenmi pay

1627
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,380
February 2024, Ke Musan

1628
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,940
Because Keqin knows everything about it,

1629
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,660
If this is indeed Keqin,

1630
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,700
then this would be my motive for killing the mysterious figure.

1631
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,180
Right.

1632
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,500
This is the same one we just saw

1633
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,380
over there in the dialog box.

1634
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,100
Old Bai,

1635
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,780
who do you think it is?

1636
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,380
I think he's highly suspicious.

1637
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:30,940
Why do you say that?

1638
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,380
What are you laughing at?

1639
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,100
What's so funny?

1640
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,500
No reason.

1641
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,540
It's just that...

1642
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,980
I feel...

1643
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,100
Right.

1644
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,860
So who do you think it is?

1645
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,660
I think it's like this.

1646
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,340
My logic is the same as last time.

1647
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,340
I think they must be...

1648
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,140
There must be one person who's completely innocent.

1649
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,340
Judging from the timeline...

1650
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,140
What is she?

1651
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,700
About the sunflower incident...

1652
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,380
She said the sunflower woman saved her.

1653
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,740
But where is Ba Duanjin?

1654
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,620
Won't Ba Duanjin show up?

1655
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,900
That's exactly the point.

1656
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,300
No.

1657
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,580
I think Ba Duanjin is still alive.

1658
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,580
It's very obvious that...

1659
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,500
He hasn't figured out the amnesia part.

1660
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,420
Ke Shaoshuai might be...

1661
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,980
He is...

1662
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,740
A modern person.

1663
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,260
Right?

1664
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,780
Then he also has an equal...

1665
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,780
Motive for murder.

1666
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:25,580
Yes.

1667
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,060
So each of them...

1668
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,020
Has something...

1669
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,180
We haven't fully figured out.

1670
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,180
So specifically, I think...

1671
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,580
It depends on your own judgment.

1672
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,260
Okay.

1673
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,060
Let's vote then.

1674
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,420
X, how did you get picked twice?

1675
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,660
How did you get selected twice?

1676
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,340
You'll soon realize...

1677
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,940
How childish your words were.

1678
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,260
Really?

1679
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,180
This crime

1680
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,860
the culprit must be among

1681
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,900
me, Ke Shaoshuai

1682
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,140
and Ba Li

1683
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,620
because the three of us

1684
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,460
all carry modern people's

1685
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,420
alternative identities

1686
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,380
His murder motive

1687
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,700
originated in the hospital

1688
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,380
Ke Musan and Ba Duanjin

1689
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,540
actually had some ambiguous relationship

1690
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,980
Ba Duanjin suffered injustice

1691
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,940
She disappeared

1692
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,460
After Ke Musan discovered all this

1693
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,260
he already harbored murderous intent

1694
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,740
towards his boss Tui Shenmi

1695
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,660
So he came to avenge his Ba Duanjin

1696
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,500
by killing Tui Shenmi

1697
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,060
The second motive is

1698
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,900
the high-power electrical device

1699
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,420
found in the upper room

1700
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,460
If it gets destroyed

1701
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,340
within 24 hours

1702
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,340
the space-time rift will close

1703
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,300
and modern people here

1704
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,100
won't be able to return

1705
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,220
So who least wants to return to the past?

1706
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,300
Only Ke Shaoshuai and Ke Musan

1707
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,180
They have reason to stay here

1708
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,740
to let him and Ba Duanjin

1709
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,700
remain here forever

1710
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,020
Ke Shaoshuai, Ke Musan

1711
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:04,780
Right

1712
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,260
My vote for the killer goes to

1713
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,340
Young Marshal He

1714
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,580
The killer and their motive

1715
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,020
Young Marshal He is actually He Jiawei

1716
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,860
Upon learning that someone wanted to kill him

1717
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,340
He acted in self-defense

1718
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,060
That's it

1719
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,860
This round of deduction was a failure

1720
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,220
Very unfortunate

1721
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,140
This time we couldn't find

1722
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,500
the crucial evidence

1723
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,900
So I had to deduce the killer

1724
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,060
based on the timeline

1725
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,620
I think the first one to leave

1726
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,660
is unlikely

1727
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,820
If she had killed

1728
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,620
directly

1729
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:55,860
her crime timeline

1730
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,180
wouldn't have been so extended

1731
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,460
So I ruled out the first one

1732
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,660
That leaves us between

1733
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,780
the second and third to leave

1734
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,300
to choose from

1735
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,940
Therefore my suspect is

1736
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,220
In this case,

1737
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,860
there are four suspects in total.

1738
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,220
Xiao Ba also had a motive for murder,

1739
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,020
but I think

1740
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:20,900
it probably wasn't her.

1741
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,260
Given my position, I can confirm

1742
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,420
she's not Ba Duanjin.

1743
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,980
So I'll ultimately cast my vote for

1744
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,260
Let me first explain the killer's motive.

1745
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,460
He came here for Dilraba.

1746
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,700
That's why he arrived.

1747
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,780
The true culprit I've identified is

1748
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,140
Mysterious push

1749
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,580
Lucky you

1750
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,980
Didn't end up in my hands

1751
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,380
This vote goes to

1752
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,020
Good

1753
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,420
"Let's Start Deduction" Season 2

1754
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,540
Case Two

1755
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,500
Deduction Town 1924: "Mysterious Deduction Broadway"

1756
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,580
comes to an end

1757
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,900
Everyone has completed their voting

1758
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,660
If the real culprit receives

1759
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,300
fewer votes than other suspects

1760
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,740
then the culprit gets the golden key

1761
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,060
Otherwise, players who voted correctly

1762
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,300
will receive the golden key

1763
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:56,660
Next,

1764
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,340
we'll announce the voting results for this case

1765
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,860
The player who received 0 votes is

1766
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,100
Wang Esq.

1767
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,700
Received 0 votes

1768
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,540
Another player also received 0 votes

1769
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,140
That is

1770
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,180
Ba Li

1771
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,540
Thank you

1772
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,540
Between the two remaining suspects

1773
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,620
Ke Shaoshuai and He Shaoshuai

1774
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,700
Who received more votes?

1775
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,180
The number of votes doesn't matter

1776
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,580
The key is who is

1777
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,220
Don't vote wrong

1778
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,300
Ke Shaoshuai received

1779
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,860
4 votes

1780
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,780
He Shaoshuai received

1781
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,220
2 votes

1782
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,340
So who is it?

1783
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,220
Nervous

1784
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:14,780
Congratulations everyone

1785
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,140
Successfully identified the culprit

1786
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,820
So in this case

1787
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,580
Does this case still have X?

1788
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,620
This case still has X

1789
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,260
Still exists

1790
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,020
Yes, that's right

1791
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,580
And the real X

1792
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,100
Please, Young Master Ke, approach him

1793
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,660
Failed, brother

1794
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,100
It must be him

1795
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,380
I told you

1796
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,700
Being it twice is still okay

1797
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,380
What did I just say?

1798
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,060
What did I say just now?

1799
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,340
I didn't say anything

1800
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,420
So please share

1801
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,860
Why can you always guess it's me?

1802
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,140
Because I'm not

1803
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,500
Because whenever that happens

1804
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,340
I try my best

1805
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,100
Not to show my preference

1806
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,100
Who I support or accuse

1807
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,020
I say

1808
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,300
I support all, I accuse all

1809
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,060
This is his approach

1810
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:17,500
He's absolutely right

1811
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,180
That's exactly how it is

1812
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,180
What you said is correct

1813
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,180
In the future we can really

1814
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,060
Fail to identify the culprit

1815
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,780
We can use X to identify the culprit

1816
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,020
Yes

1817
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:26,780
Sister Ba is too smart

1818
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,100
From my perspective

1819
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,820
Everything was going smoothly

1820
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,340
Everything was going too smoothly

1821
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,420
I thought it was great

1822
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:34,900
Right

1823
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,060
Then she suddenly looked up

1824
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,620
Looked at me and said

1825
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,020
Why couldn't it be you?

1826
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,300
I was done for

1827
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:42,940
It's over

1828
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,260
I don't understand what you're saying.

1829
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,260
I'm sorry.

1830
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,900
Why couldn't it be you, Kemusan?

1831
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,620
Kemusan exists in this world.

1832
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,380
Yes.

1833
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,300
Where have we seen today...

1834
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,620
traces of him being here?

1835
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,420
Possibly.

1836
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,300
It was right at the end.

1837
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,300
The moment before voting.

1838
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:06,940
She's clever.

1839
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,540
That move of hers reminded everyone.

1840
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,220
At that time I felt like I was acting in a drama.

1841
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,220
Because I've played...

1842
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,020
police and prosecutors before.

1843
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:13,500
So at that moment...

1844
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,260
I thought I was filming.

1845
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,220
So I said...

1846
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,980
Could it be you, Kemusan?

1847
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,740
Her reversal was brilliant.

1848
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,140
Right.

1849
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:20,980
She was just like this at that time.

1850
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,020
At that moment I...

1851
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:22,660
I just felt how could...

1852
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,460
At that moment, I tell you...

1853
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:26,060
Impressive.

1854
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,020
Well played.

1855
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,540
Now announcing...

1856
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,580
the crucial evidence everyone missed.

1857
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,500
What is it?

1858
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,140
The key evidence everyone missed...

1859
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,660
is related to a key.

1860
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,940
The key to the high-power appliance...

1861
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:46,220
found in the 2024 timeline...

1862
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:49,100
actually had the words...

1863
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,740
"spare key" written on it.

1864
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,340
So the key was with you, right?

1865
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:52,980
I opened it.

1866
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,620
I unlocked it and then...

1867
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,020
didn't notice.

1868
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:54,620
None of us looked.

1869
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,620
Didn't see it, didn't notice.

1870
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,140
If the spare key was in 2024...

1871
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,860
then the real culprit must have used the actual key...

1872
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:04,340
to open the 1924 high-power appliance.

1873
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,340
And the real key...

1874
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,100
was hidden in Young Master Ke's room...

1875
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,220
inside the flowerpot in the corner.

1876
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,260
The Mysterious Pusher plans to kill Young Marshal He

1877
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,100
He Jiawei

1878
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:19,580
Ba Li

1879
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,860
Ba Duanjin and four others

1880
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,180
Among them, Young Marshal He and Ba Duanjin

1881
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:25,260
have already been knocked unconscious by the Mysterious Pusher

1882
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,940
on a boat by the Wukenai River

1883
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,340
So the two of you are really

1884
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,900
Bali and Jiawei

1885
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,380
Let me tell you why I wanted to

1886
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,220
destroy this (high-power appliance)

1887
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,380
I was the one who destroyed it

1888
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,380
I came back to kill Tuixhenmi

1889
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,740
Because Tuixhenmi wants to harm Baduanjin

1890
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,060
I like Baduanjin

1891
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,460
So I wanted to save her

1892
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:48,540
Yes

1893
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:49,780
Because I also work at this company

1894
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,820
And I know about all the

1895
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,860
bad things he's done

1896
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:52,260
So I believe

1897
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,500
as long as this passage exists

1898
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,740
it's bad for both ancient people

1899
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,660
and modern people

1900
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,860
alike

1901
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,540
That's why I thought

1902
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,300
I should destroy this thing

1903
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,460
and kill the mastermind

1904
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:03,580
behind it

1905
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,220
I did indeed destroy that

1906
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:05,980
Right

1907
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,140
Actually, there's something I need to address in this episode.

1908
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,420
It's about my great-grandson

1909
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,420
and what he's done.

1910
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,500
I think it's absolutely wrong.

1911
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,820
Just to make money,

1912
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,220
he's been trading ancient people's lives

1913
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,380
for financial gain.

1914
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,820
I believe all lives

1915
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,900
have equal value - none are superior or inferior.

1916
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,140
Right?

1917
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:26,420
You can't judge lives

1918
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,860
based on their era

1919
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,620
or species differences.

1920
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,100
to label some as noble or worthless.

1921
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,460
All life is precious.

1922
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,100
I must criticize my great-grandson.

1923
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,260
This also reflects on me

1924
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,740
for failing to impart

1925
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,020
proper values through education.

1926
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:40,700
This is indeed

1927
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,980
my own failing.

1928
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:42,540
Yes.

1929
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:43,580
My great-grandson

1930
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,460
is actually quite capable.

1931
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,260
He's mastered advanced technology,

1932
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:47,740
yes.

1933
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:50,660
His conceptualization and marketing,

1934
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,500
and overall

1935
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,140
company branding are impressive.

1936
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:53,860
Truly remarkable.

1937
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,060
But the one thing he got wrong

1938
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,180
was his heart - his intentions.

1939
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,660
Yes, exactly.

1940
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,380
So coming to this point,

1941
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,340
I must praise

1942
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,460
my great-granddaughter.

1943
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,060
My entire journey with my great-granddaughter

1944
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,060
has been like a complete circle

1945
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,540
I comforted her

1946
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,660
because in the letter

1947
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:10,460
she left for me

1948
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,660
she said she hoped to

1949
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:13,980
live well

1950
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,780
and help others

1951
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,380
or similar things

1952
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,420
They were all words of encouragement

1953
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,540
positive and uplifting messages

1954
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,020
So her wish

1955
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,580
was also to become a good person

1956
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,300
who could help the girls

1957
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,140
at Tui Le Men

1958
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,780
walk toward the light together

1959
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,500
Just like in yesterday's case

1960
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,660
a beam of light in the darkness

1961
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,140
When you can't get up by yourself

1962
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,620
having someone lend a hand

1963
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,020
Yes

1964
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:34,820
is nothing to be ashamed of

1965
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,980
As long as everyone has goodness

1966
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,820
and kindness in their hearts

1967
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,020
Exactly

1968
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,420
Look at our Ba family

1969
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,260
and then look at your Bai family

1970
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,020
The Ba family

1971
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,700
I'm Brother Ba

1972
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,180
Brother Ba

1973
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,300
I'm Old Ba

1974
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,700
Ba Corporation

1975
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:51,900
Here's the thing

1976
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,740
I think because

1977
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,380
the three of us are veteran players

1978
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,900
though not very competent

1979
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,020
still not competent

1980
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,060
very competent

1981
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,140
Of course I want to say

1982
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,460
you three are actually

1983
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,260
this is your first time coming to

1984
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,220
"Let's Start Reasoning" Season 2

1985
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,580
which really surprised me

1986
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,380
When we three recorded Season 1

1987
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,540
maybe in the first episode

1988
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,060
and second episode, our performance

1989
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,300
wasn't as good as yours

1990
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,980
Your reasoning skills are so strong

1991
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,500
hiding abilities so advanced

1992
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,460
analytical skills so sharp

1993
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,180
That's absolutely true

1994
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,500
This isn't just flattery

1995
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,180
You truly made me

1996
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,700
look at you with new respect

1997
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,940
I think it's fantastic

1998
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,340
Of course this Season 2 episode

1999
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,940
also added an X mechanic

2000
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,660
I think it's

2001
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,500
quite an innovative addition

2002
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,420
But I'm also honored

2003
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,700
to have drawn X twice

2004
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:30,700
and grateful for

2005
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,860
our two murderers' trust

2006
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,860
Look at all this pressure

2007
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:36,900
Such a top expert

2008
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,180
I'm just a little assassin

2009
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,020
You're the little assassin

2010
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,220
Next time I hope if again

2011
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,060
Don't trust me so much

2012
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,340
Don't place so much trust in me

2013
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,260
Because I'm under great pressure

2014
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,180
This is like a burden, stressful

2015
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,140
But this is a kind of

2016
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,060
Sweet pressure

2017
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,020
Sweet burden

2018
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:53,300
Next time I'll let you enjoy this sweetness again

2019
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:55,140
That wouldn't be bad

2020
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,180
Now comes our

2021
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,420
Golden Key awarding ceremony

2022
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,460
Who failed to get the golden key twice in a row?

2023
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,260
Who failed twice in a row?

2024
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:07,660
Who is it?

2025
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:08,020
No one.

2026
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:08,620
Who?

2027
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,740
You.

2028
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,260
Really?

2029
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,260
Brother Ning

2030
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,980
Please let Young Master Ke present the golden key

2031
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,580
Thank you, Young Master Ke

2032
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,100
Thanks, cousin

2033
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,180
This is giving up on you for love

2034
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,620
Abandoning for love

2035
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,620
Thank you

2036
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:36,100
I really don't want to give this to you

2037
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,820
I really don't want to give it

2038
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,500
Two already, feels good

2039
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,420
Right

2040
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,540
Brother, you're falling behind, you need to catch up

2041
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,540
I'm 80% behind

2042
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,300
Now it's about

2043
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,620
Alright, I think this season

2044
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,580
The best way is

2045
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,700
Let's work together to find a solution

2046
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,220
Make sure Liu Yuning gets none

2047
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,260
Okay

2048
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,420
Don't worry, brother

2049
01:13:58,420 --> 01:13:59,700
Next time even if I don't get it myself

2050
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:00,740
I'll make sure you get it

2051
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,540
Make you the X

2052
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,180
Alright

2053
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,540
Helimo Yu, the Reasoning King

2054
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,780
Let the reasoning begin

2055
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,540
In this episode, we focus on

2056
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,940
the black market trade of organs

2057
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,020
In this case, the mysterious

2058
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,260
There is a viewpoint

2059
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,620
that these women from centuries ago

2060
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,220
were bound to die sooner or later

2061
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:31,820
so it would be better

2062
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,340
for them to die with more value

2063
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,420
This reflects

2064
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:35,900
the mysterious value system

2065
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,460
But in our view

2066
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,060
no matter the era

2067
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,500
no matter the region

2068
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,940
no matter the race

2069
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,540
human life has no hierarchy

2070
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,140
no one is more precious than another

2071
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,780
Thus, we say before the law

2072
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:48,980
all are equal

2073
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:49,980
Every life

2074
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,500
deserves respect and dignity

2075
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,100
And every person's right to life

2076
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,100
deserves equal protection

2077
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,380
No matter what the reason may be,

2078
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,940
depriving others of their lives

2079
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,820
or harming their health

2080
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,620
to obtain organs is illegal.

2081
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,220
Depending on the specific circumstances,

2082
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,020
it may be classified as intentional homicide,

2083
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:14,100
intentional injury, or other crimes.

2084
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,220
Of course, in this case,

2085
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,620
someone like Ba Duanjin,

2086
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,820
who did not participate in the criminal acts

2087
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:21,740
and subjectively

2088
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:22,620
had no criminal intent,

2089
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,740
and was even unaware

2090
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:25,500
of the illegality of the organ sources,

2091
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,300
does not need to bear

2092
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,500
the aforementioned legal responsibilities.

2093
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,060
As the saying goes, a noble person loves wealth but obtains it through proper means.

2094
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,420
If one desires success,

2095
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,940
they should achieve it through legal methods

2096
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,940
and by righteous paths.
