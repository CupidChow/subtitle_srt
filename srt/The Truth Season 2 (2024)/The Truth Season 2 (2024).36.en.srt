1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,960
Guess the prescription

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,520
Doubt

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,360
"Dragon's Doubt"

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:08,920
Open

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,680
Question

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm feeling a bit dizzy

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,520
Skeptical shows aren't my thing

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,400
Go ahead, our rules are from wrestling

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,320
Or from free combat

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,280
Or from the octagon cage

11
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,160
Just survive

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,320
Cue the music

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,640
Begin

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,040
Where's the promised elegance?

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,840
My pants

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,040
These pants seem...

17
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,160
Move the pawn to the far left

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
Then swap both sides

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,320
Switch these two

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,840
Switch these two

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,800
I already know everything

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,280
Then I can only distrust

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,920
This is a pawn

24
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,360
This is a rook

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,400
What's this?

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,400
The general

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,240
Wait a sec

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,800
So this is my day

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,600
It's really quite nice to look at.

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,280
Actually, it seems each gourd episode

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
is different from the others.

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,320
This gourd is also poorly made.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,920
This board is genuine.

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,000
That board should be thrown out.

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,280
The year 1988.

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,760
Why is there only a board?

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,440
It feels like that episode

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,520
had a very tight budget.

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,360
Time for work.

40
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,040
Let's start using our brains.

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,360
Great brain development.

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,440
Welcome everyone to

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,360
"Let's Start Using Our Brains."

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,320
This is Tui Town

45
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,560
The century-old pharmacy famous throughout the town

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,080
Dongnao Hall

47
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,840
I am the assistant to the leader of Dongnao Hall

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,440
Cui Shaoyang

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,000
This morning, I checked the calendar and realized

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,120
Today is good for thinking, bad for idleness

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,400
It's that time again when we

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
compete for the acting leadership position

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,960
Next, I still need to tell everyone

54
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,440
about our

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,640
often-repeated rules

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
This episode's value-added services

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,800
There are still two of them

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
The first one is

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,800
the adorable and charming

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
radiant value-added service

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
and the adorable and charming

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,920
radiant value-added service

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,640
What's the difference?

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
Do you understand?

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
There's no difference

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,200
You're right

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,400
Actually there's really no difference

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,360
I just changed the emphasis

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
to differentiate them

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,720
At least as far as I know, they're identical

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,440
But whether they're exactly the same

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,040
I don't know either

73
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,080
As for this episode's grouping

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,240
the rules are very simple

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,000
and quite innovative

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
but will really test the doctors' teamwork

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,080
Come on

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,640
So what's our first word?

79
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Acting cute

80
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
Three

81
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
Two

82
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,800
One

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,760
Is that so?

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,040
No

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,720
Yu Haoyang

86
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,400
So you drove a tractor, right?

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,360
Where are you going?

88
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
I don’t know how

89
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
Okay, understood.

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,840
Hu Minghao and Yang Zongyu

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,920
were sitting quite close

92
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,560
raising suspicions of copying work

93
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,760
But you two

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,520
had identical movements

95
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,280
However, Huang Kai

96
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,320
interfered in between

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,040
Unfortunately

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
no teams were successfully formed

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,800
So all eight of you

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,320
come on

101
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,800
three push-ups

102
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Should we wait for the signal?

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,720
Or just do it directly?

104
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,840
No need for slogans.

105
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,280
If it makes you happy,

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,160
you can shout it too.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,640
Second word hint

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,280
Imitate an animal

109
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
Three

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
Two

111
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,080
One

112
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,360
Any birds?

113
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,040
I saw it

114
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,840
Huang Kai and Dong Zifan

115
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,200
both made tiger gestures, right?

116
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,560
They're both feline creatures

117
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,840
Who else is?

118
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm also a cat

119
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
You look like a dinosaur

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But the hand angles are different

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
They did it like this

122
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,120
You did it like this

123
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,080
You look like a velociraptor

124
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,400
You resemble a velociraptor

125
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,840
This time, Huang Kai and Dong Zifan

126
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,640
successfully formed the first clinic

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
What are you six standing around for?

128
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,560
Do it!

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Go for it

130
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,760
I can't go on anymore.

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
The third word.

132
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Weightlifting

133
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,520
Three

134
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
Two

135
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,120
One

136
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Wei Xiaolong and Yang Zongyu become the second consultation room.

137
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Our Hou Zhuocheng and Yu Haoyang

138
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,640
have become the Third Consultation Room

139
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,800
You two will automatically be assigned to Clinic Room 4

140
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,760
Alright, everyone

141
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,320
I will now

142
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,800
reveal our first assessment task for this session

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
So what will it be?

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Chuan Qiong

145
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,240
A Bit of Rainbow

146
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
None of them resonate with me

147
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
I want to flip the "Dragon" bone

148
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,800
"Dragon" bone

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,320
What's wrong with my bones?

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,760
"Dragon" bone

151
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,960
Healing Heart and Mind

152
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Now, the rules

153
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Everyone should already understand

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,080
Let's rotate out the first one

155
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,000
The clinic that needs to battle

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,760
I rotated it

157
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,800
Clinic Three will battle Clinic One

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,040
It's tough

159
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,080
Can you remember?

160
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
I remember you have a great memory

161
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
I might completely forget

162
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,440
But the other person can't say it

163
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,480
You do it

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,720
Okay

165
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,720
It's starting

166
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,400
You all need to put this on

167
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,160
No talking

168
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,000
No talking

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
Stick it on, it works

170
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
You can still talk with it on

171
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,760
Yeah

172
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,360
If you talk with it on, you're out

173
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,560
Huang Kai will give the first command.

174
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,840
Place the commander in the very center.

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,320
Put the general on this side.

176
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Place the soldier on the far left.

177
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
Position the chariot here.

178
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,200
Put the elephant here.

179
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
You place...

180
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,880
Can't keep count anymore

181
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,560
It's already getting

182
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,240
You place the cannon here

183
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,000
You...

184
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,000
Swap the general and the elephant

185
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,960
You fill this in

186
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,640
You cover the cannon

187
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,480
You cover

188
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,000
cover it up

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,240
You cover the commander

190
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,880
You cover the chariot

191
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,520
You swap these two

192
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,960
May I ask what this is?

193
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,280
Cannon

194
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,680
Correct answer

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,720
Huang Kai scores one point

196
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,480
Swap these two

197
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
Cover the cannon

198
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,880
Cover the soldier

199
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,200
Cover the elephant

200
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,240
Cover your cannon

201
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Cover your soldier

202
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
Cover your elephant

203
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,320
I peek at this

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,640
I'll cover this

205
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,720
I'll cover this

206
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,400
You should let the opponent cover this

207
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,040
Sorry

208
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,920
Let him cover it

209
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
You do it

210
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,720
Let me think

211
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,040
Just bluff

212
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
Deduct points

213
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
Deduct all their points

214
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,480
Let me think

215
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,720
Turn this inside out

216
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,600
I want to ask you what this is

217
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,880
Car

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,960
Car

219
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Correct answer

220
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
Huang Kai scores another point

221
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
Zero to two

222
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Cover it up

223
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,200
Cover it up

224
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,400
I already know everything

225
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,680
I know it too

226
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
Do you choose to believe or question

227
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,840
I believe him

228
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
I believe him

229
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,880
You got a free point

230
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,040
One to two

231
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,360
I know everything

232
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,800
I know it all

233
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,320
I know everything too

234
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,600
Then I can only disbelieve

235
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,640
Can only disbelieve

236
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,440
Right

237
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,000
He doubts

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Okay

239
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,600
This is a pawn

240
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
This is a rook

241
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,400
This is a bishop

242
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
This is the cannon

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,640
This is the horse

244
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,880
This is the marshal

245
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
This is the general

246
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,520
Impressive

247
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,440
Amazing

248
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,080
The duel between you two

249
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
was truly spectacular

250
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,040
Applause

251
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,160
So we congratulate Clinic One

252
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,440
for accumulating 20% mental power

253
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
As for Clinic Three

254
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,840
unfortunately

255
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,760
the challenge failed

256
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,320
Who knew our Huang Kai was this skilled

257
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,880
Indeed

258
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,520
I'd like to ask both of you

259
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,200
About memorizing this chessboard

260
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Do you have any personal techniques?

261
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,600
Actually, the key point is

262
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,840
to first memorize several positions

263
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
and remember them firmly

264
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,920
For pieces like general, marshal, and soldier, I think

265
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,360
these three are easier to remember

266
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,280
I remember general, marshal, chariot, horse, elephant, soldier, cannon

267
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,080
For me,

268
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
it's like ranking them by

269
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,360
their importance in battle

270
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
from one to seven

271
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,920
Is it difficult?

272
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,800
Actually, remembering seven isn't too hard

273
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,080
The key is knowing when

274
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,760
to challenge your opponent

275
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,800
At the very beginning,

276
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,640
I challenged him once

277
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,800
and he answered correctly

278
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,400
That one point

279
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,280
gave him a leading advantage

280
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,640
The advantage really came from

281
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,160
him asking me about two pieces

282
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,600
But at that time, I should have

283
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,560
made more exchange moves

284
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,480
After covering,

285
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,600
we actually didn't make many exchanges

286
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,080
before he asked me

287
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,280
They're actually quite easy to remember

288
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
So later when playing,

289
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
first

290
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,760
make more exchanges

291
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,720
while remembering them yourself

292
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,080
and have your opponent make more

293
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
exchange commands

294
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,760
It was truly spectacular

295
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,800
Then for Clinic Four and Clinic Two

296
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,760
Who will step forward?

297
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,040
It must be

298
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,320
Yang Zongyu

299
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,560
What about Clinic Four?

300
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,080
Who will fight?

301
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,240
I've already posted them

302
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,120
You've already posted them

303
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,920
Place the soldier here

304
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,520
Place the cannon here

305
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,640
Flip the soldier over

306
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,200
Flip the cannon over

307
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
Place the chariot here

308
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,320
No

309
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,280
Nervous

310
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,520
Getting nervous

311
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,280
Flip the chariot over

312
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,520
Swap these two

313
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,640
Wait a moment

314
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,560
Let me think

315
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
Swap these two

316
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,960
Place the general here

317
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,480
Flip the general over

318
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,160
I want to see this

319
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Look

320
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,240
Place the commander here

321
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,760
Flip the commander over

322
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
Place the horse here

323
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,520
Swap these two

324
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,040
Place the elephant here

325
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,400
Flip this one over

326
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,840
Swap these two positions

327
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,000
Switch these two

328
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,000
Swap these two positions

329
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,320
Turn this over

330
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,440
I know all the answers

331
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,280
I know too

332
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,720
Believe it or not

333
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,280
I believe

334
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,040
Score one point

335
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,120
Very exciting

336
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,520
Swap these two

337
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,320
Let me check this

338
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,320
Swap these two

339
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,800
Swap both sides again

340
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,320
Swap these two

341
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,360
Swap these two

342
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Swap these two

343
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,160
I know what it is

344
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
I know too

345
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
Do you doubt him?

346
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,840
I don't doubt him.

347
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,720
Good.

348
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,640
One point scored.

349
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,000
Swap these two positions

350
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,520
What is this?

351
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,760
Handsome

352
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,640
Score one point

353
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,520
Take a look at this

354
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,400
You can see three

355
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,960
Because he just scored a point

356
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,200
Turn this over

357
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,520
Swap these two

358
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,440
Switch these two

359
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,040
Switch these two

360
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,360
Wait a moment

361
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,080
Swap these two

362
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
Switch these two

363
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,200
What's this?

364
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,880
Car

365
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
I never thought I'd see the day

366
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,600
Why do they say I've come to this?

367
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,880
Two to two

368
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
I want to take a look at this

369
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,520
Then turn it over

370
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,760
Swap these two positions

371
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,720
Switch these two

372
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
These two

373
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,920
These two

374
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,920
These two

375
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,240
Switch these

376
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,280
These two

377
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,800
I want to take a look at this

378
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,920
My turn now

379
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,960
Yes, your turn

380
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,120
Then I know what it is

381
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,840
I know too

382
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,480
Doubt

383
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,000
Doubt

384
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,840
Soldier

385
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
Chariot

386
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,600
Elephant

387
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,960
General

388
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,800
General

389
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,760
Cannon

390
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,160
Horse

391
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,160
This is a bit...

392
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,800
It means coming from behind to win.

393
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,040
This is the game.

394
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,720
Actually, from the very beginning,

395
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,840
I had already arranged

396
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,400
soldiers, cannons, chariots, horses, elephants, generals, and marshals.

397
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,480
Basically one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

398
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,960
Then I kept

399
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,360
memorizing it like a phone number.

400
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
I used some techniques.

401
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
I want to know,

402
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
Yang Zongyu, how did you memorize it?

403
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,360
Did you do the same?

404
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,440
Or did you just

405
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,000
memorize it by rote?

406
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,080
Horses, cannons, generals, marshals, elephants, chariots, soldiers.

407
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,880
Then I

408
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,840
really can't compete with that.

409
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,400
As long as you

410
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
keep repeating this phrase to yourself,

411
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,640
I kept

412
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,000
reciting "horses, cannons, generals, marshals, elephants, chariots, soldiers."

413
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,600
Everyone did great.

414
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,520
Let's congratulate Clinic 4 for successfully

415
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,760
accumulating 20% brain power.

416
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,360
Unfortunately, our Clinic 2

417
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,040
didn't accumulate any brain power.

418
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,440
The first round of assessment has concluded successfully.

419
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,520
Now, immediately,

420
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,720
let's begin our second round of assessment.

421
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,040
What should we do for the second round?

422
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,760
I won't ask for your opinions,

423
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,720
I'll decide myself.

424
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,680
Let's do "Wang You."

425
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,480
Okay.

426
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,760
Guess the prescription.

427
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,480
This is an assessment everyone has taken before,

428
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,040
and Wei Xiaolong is most familiar with it.

429
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,000
Is it the idiom guessing one?

430
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,960
"Dragon's Misdiagnosis."

431
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,400
Wei Xiaolong, feel it out.

432
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,840
Wei Xiaolong.

433
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,320
"Dragon's Feeling."

434
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,440
"Dragon's Misdiagnosis."

435
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,320
It really is that one.

436
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,680
Okay.

437
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,640
Let me

438
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,400
explain the rules again.

439
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,000
Come on

440
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,880
Let's see who gets the best performance today

441
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,800
The ancient Greek god of misdiagnosis

442
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,960
Alright

443
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
Now, for the first assessment

444
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,600
We'll start with

445
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,440
Clinic 1, Clinic 2

446
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,560
Clinic 3, Clinic 4

447
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,360
in this order

448
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
We'll draw cards one by one

449
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,600
and call out the numbers, okay?

450
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,360
Okay

451
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,640
Alright, let's begin

452
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,880
Clinic 1, draw your card

453
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,840
Mind your expressions

454
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,520
Come on

455
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,840
Negative ten

456
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,680
Negative ten

457
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,600
Think about it

458
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,920
Start it

459
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,320
Just say it out loud

460
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,440
Negative nine

461
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,040
Negative eight

462
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,800
Negative seven

463
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,720
Negative seven

464
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,520
Negative six

465
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,120
Negative five

466
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,680
Negative four then

467
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,680
Alright then

468
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
Okay

469
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,360
Negative four

470
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,720
Negative one

471
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,840
They've already called negative one

472
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,200
We can only call zero

473
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,640
We either call zero or open

474
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,800
If we look at the field, it's negative five

475
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,680
Now the total sums up to zero

476
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,760
Zero, right

477
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,080
Then we'll

478
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,920
Zero

479
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,400
Zero

480
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,560
They seemed hesitant at negative five

481
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,040
Probably hesitated

482
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,560
Open it?

483
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:58,960
Doubt

484
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,800
"Dragon's Doubt"

485
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,960
What is it, then?

486
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Doubt successful

487
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,960
Our answer is negative two

488
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,880
They said zero

489
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,120
Zero is greater than negative two

490
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,440
So congratulations, you've been misdiagnosed

491
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,160
Okay

492
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,920
Alright, let's start with examination room two

493
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,760
Whose turn is it to report?

494
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,120
We are.

495
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,720
You report.

496
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,800
Then we'll...

497
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,840
They should all be positive, I think.

498
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,400
Then eight or nine.

499
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,360
Sure.

500
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,160
Nine.

501
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,320
Let's make it ten.

502
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,240
Ten

503
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,080
Because they

504
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,680
Because the team to our left is quite strong

505
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,400
Hard to say

506
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,480
They definitely don't know their own numbers

507
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,280
Maybe they haven't started yet

508
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,240
But they think

509
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,280
They're quite strong

510
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,400
Why?

511
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,840
What was just said

512
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
I heard it

513
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,280
They said

514
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,800
You can't believe everything

515
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,320
Because they don't know

516
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,560
What their own cards are

517
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,080
Then how do you think we should report?

518
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,400
I think we should just

519
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Go straight ahead

520
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,360
Not just go straight ahead

521
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,320
It's just that

522
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,480
Because Yang Zongyu's team

523
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,760
Doesn't know their own numbers

524
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,920
So they'll definitely look at us three

525
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,480
Probably estimate a number similar to ours

526
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,720
A number close to our total

527
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,400
But they don't know they're minus five

528
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,080
Can only watch them

529
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,160
See what number they report

530
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,800
They've already reported

531
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,480
What did they report?

532
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,560
Reported nine

533
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,840
Who?

534
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,480
Your turn now

535
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,200
Our turn

536
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
You didn't realize it was your turn

537
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh my god

538
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,560
I thought it was

539
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,080
We'll talk later

540
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,120
Sorry

541
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,880
I said

542
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,080
Right

543
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,600
What will you report?

544
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,200
Open

545
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,600
Let's open

546
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,480
Challenge

547
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,520
Challenge successful

548
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,840
Come on

549
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,040
Rewarded with a misdiagnosis

550
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
It's fine

551
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,240
And there's only one each

552
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,840
Right

553
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,960
This is ridiculous

554
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
My luck is really something...

555
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,200
Well then, let's go

556
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
From our examination room three

557
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,920
So fake

558
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,520
Too fake

559
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,800
Lots of words up there

560
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,720
That thing of yours

561
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,640
Every night

562
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,480
Can verify a player's identity

563
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,120
Let me think

564
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,360
Let me think

565
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,600
Wait a moment

566
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,280
Let's think about it

567
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,240
Report zero

568
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
Zero is safest

569
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,920
Right

570
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,240
We'll report

571
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,920
Report zero

572
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,560
Zero

573
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,920
Let's report zero

574
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,240
I think one is safer

575
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,120
Let's take a chance

576
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,600
We're reporting zero

577
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,160
Then we'll report one

578
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,960
He reported one

579
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,720
He reported a positive number

580
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,080
Meaning we're not negative

581
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,400
If we're not negative then

582
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
Even if it's one

583
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,440
We'll report two

584
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,600
We can at least report two

585
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,280
Two

586
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,720
After analyzing

587
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,600
We can't be negative

588
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,160
Because they wouldn't report zero if negative

589
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,400
Not necessarily

590
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,640
How do you know what they're thinking?

591
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
I think

592
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,280
Let's gamble

593
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,480
Then we'll follow your lead

594
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,040
Six

595
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,880
Challenge

596
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,680
Open

597
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,760
Maximum number on field equals zero

598
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,920
Maximum number equals zero

599
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
So "Hou's challenge" succeeds

600
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,040
I'm a bit dizzy

601
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,400
Okay

602
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,480
Then let's begin our fourth consultation

603
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,200
Can't hold it in

604
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,760
Xiao Ba

605
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,080
Five

606
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,520
Five

607
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,680
Six

608
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,760
They dared to bid five

609
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,040
Which means we must have at least zero

610
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,320
We're either ten

611
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,000
Or fifteen

612
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's why they dared to bid six

613
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,240
Seven

614
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,640
Seven

615
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,000
Open it

616
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,560
Open

617
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,640
Open

618
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,800
Doubt

619
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,280
Now the fate lies in Wei Xiaolong's hands

620
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,040
Let's see if you can reveal a seven

621
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,600
The god of show effects

622
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,800
Or less than seven

623
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,720
Then you win

624
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,040
What does that mean?

625
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,440
Like this

626
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,320
You touch

627
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Zero

628
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,680
Zero

629
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,040
Then let's congratulate our Clinic Two

630
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,440
for being the first to be eliminated

631
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,720
Skeptical shows aren't my thing.

632
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,960
Last time I played this game,

633
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,040
I was the first one out too.

634
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,440
Really?

635
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Seems both of you were misdiagnosed.

636
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,000
A misdiagnosis-prone constitution.

637
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
Can't be a doctor

638
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,720
Let's go

639
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,000
Our clinic will start calling first

640
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,960
I think it should be a positive number

641
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,000
Fourteen

642
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,880
As long as we announce it decisively enough

643
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,720
We can trick him

644
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,480
So

645
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,520
He'll think he has the higher number

646
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Fifteen

647
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,200
Then we'll add one

648
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,920
Sixteen

649
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,560
Seventeen

650
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,520
Eighteen

651
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,760
We could actually just call twenty-eight directly

652
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,680
Because

653
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,240
Actually, we're calling them one by one

654
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,560
Right, otherwise that...

655
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,160
Twenty-eight

656
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,560
If it's twenty-eight

657
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,640
If we were twenty

658
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,680
You think it's thirty-four, right?

659
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,080
No, I think they'll call twenty-five

660
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
Only if we're fifteen would they dare call that

661
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,480
Let's go with twenty-nine

662
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,960
Agreed

663
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,880
Twenty-nine

664
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,280
Then thirty

665
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,040
Thirty

666
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Thirty-three

667
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,720
Okay

668
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:31,960
I think

669
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,600
Thirty-three

670
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Thirty-three

671
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,320
Let's reveal

672
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,880
Challenge successful

673
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,280
Total on the field is twenty-four

674
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,440
Zero, right?

675
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,400
Zero

676
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,440
One

677
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,320
So high

678
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,080
One

679
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,400
Two

680
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,040
Three, right?

681
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,840
Three

682
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,240
Four

683
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,920
Just playing randomly, huh?

684
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,400
This round

685
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,280
Five then

686
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,880
Six

687
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Seven

688
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,000
Ten

689
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,960
Yu Haoyang's pout

690
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,280
"Hao's pout"

691
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,320
Let's begin

692
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,400
Start

693
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,800
Unknown

694
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Come on

695
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Now the field shows five

696
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,520
They need to roll less than five

697
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,800
Then they succeed

698
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,320
If they roll five or higher

699
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,480
Then their challenge fails

700
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,880
Let's just flip it then

701
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,320
No need to hesitate

702
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
No need to hesitate

703
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,680
Challenge failed

704
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,280
A bet is a bet

705
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,240
A bet is a bet

706
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,320
We already said it, right?

707
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,760
Did they not take it?

708
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,920
He already lost.

709
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,840
We're already done, bro.

710
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,080
It was definitely you guys.

711
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,520
Pretend you don’t know.

712
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,000
Let’s just mislead them this round.

713
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,520
First, mislead them.

714
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,560
Then we’ll just start from zero.

715
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,400
Who’s calling it?

716
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,320
Let’s call it.

717
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,920
Zero.

718
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,120
Zero, huh?

719
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,840
How do we call this?

720
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,640
One.

721
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,160
Two.

722
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,680
Three.

723
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,280
You reported it so decisively.

724
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,920
We're still quite big, right?

725
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,640
Maybe.

726
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,080
If you doubt us...

727
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,640
We'll have to reveal...

728
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,320
Right, very small, very risky.

729
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,440
Because there are still unknowns.

730
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,760
What do you think?

731
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,040
What do you think we should report?

732
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,840
Ten?

733
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,400
Let's report ten.

734
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,960
Ten.

735
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,960
*Lin Hao pouts*

736
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,120
You're very expressive today.

737
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,240
Let's make it eleven.

738
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,640
Okay.

739
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,240
Eleven.

740
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,280
Eleven.

741
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,240
Let's reveal.

742
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,680
Go ahead and reveal.

743
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:57,920
Reveal.

744
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,840
Reveal.

745
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,400
Currently it's negative six on the field.

746
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,360
He reported eleven, right?

747
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,960
Right.

748
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Which means...

749
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
He'd need to draw twenty...

750
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,400
for the challenge to fail.

751
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,360
Then just draw directly.

752
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,280
You draw.

753
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
Go ahead and draw.

754
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,920
Go ahead and feel

755
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,680
Sorry about that

756
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,320
Because this really

757
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,760
is quite different from the number you reported

758
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,160
Come on

759
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,080
Here's a small misdiagnosis as a reward

760
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,680
No problem

761
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,080
To be honest about these cards

762
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,040
I really didn't mean to

763
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,960
But I don't know why

764
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,320
Every round produces unknowns

765
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,760
It's already been three, no four rounds

766
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,160
Three rounds

767
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,960
Three rounds

768
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,640
Only they haven't drawn unknowns

769
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,080
Let's go

770
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,800
Zero

771
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,760
One

772
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,240
After reporting zero

773
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,880
One

774
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,160
What does that mean?

775
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,120
They're one, right?

776
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,000
Then two

777
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,720
You don't think we're negative ten, do you?

778
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,120
We couldn't be negative ten, could we?

779
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,760
I think we must be positive

780
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,320
Otherwise

781
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,120
If they were two, they wouldn't be so decisive

782
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,320
We're definitely positive

783
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,880
Five

784
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,880
Open

785
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,880
Challenge successful immediately

786
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,440
Come on

787
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,680
Let's go

788
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,840
This time, we're in Examination Room 3

789
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
I need to remind everyone

790
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,600
Currently, Clinic 3 and Clinic 1

791
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,560
both have two misdiagnoses

792
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,440
We should use their numerical disadvantage

793
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,080
At the very least

794
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,680
But if we report, will they expose us?

795
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,720
So what do you think we should report?

796
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,440
I think we should report minus two, minus one

797
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,280
This way

798
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,920
even if we report zero, they can't act

799
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,680
Then let's just report zero

800
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,960
Report zero

801
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,080
One

802
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,600
Not your turn

803
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,520
You're all jumping ahead now

804
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,520
I reported one

805
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,160
You reported one

806
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,720
We'll report two

807
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,880
Wait a minute

808
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,960
Reporting two won't make them expose us, right?

809
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,200
Let's report zero

810
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
They reported one

811
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,760
Meaning we're five

812
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,120
It could also be five

813
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,720
Open it

814
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,360
Open

815
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,440
Open

816
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,720
Please

817
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,080
The current score is minus three

818
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,040
This situation again

819
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,240
I really can't take it anymore

820
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,040
Field score: -8

821
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,520
Congratulations on your successful challenge

822
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,560
Even heroes are helpless when luck runs out, huh

823
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,800
We need to think about it

824
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,720
Then we'll go with zero

825
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,160
Zero

826
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,240
I knew we should call this

827
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,880
To be honest

828
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,000
Then let's go with one

829
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
One, we

830
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,560
One

831
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,080
One

832
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,280
What is this?

833
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,200
Four

834
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,400
Four

835
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,040
Then let's make it five

836
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,360
Six

837
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,400
Okay, six

838
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,080
They went with six

839
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,240
They chose six

840
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,680
Then we'll

841
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
Seven

842
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,160
Let's do seven

843
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,080
How about eight?

844
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,040
Should we?

845
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,680
But

846
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,920
Let's give it a try

847
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,440
But

848
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,040
You made two misdiagnoses

849
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,320
No problem

850
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,120
Let's try it

851
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,520
Shall we try?

852
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,000
Let's do it

853
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,520
Let's open one

854
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,240
Anyway, it's not your bet

855
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,400
It's our bet

856
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,800
Then it doesn't matter

857
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,200
Open

858
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,520
No, they're questioning

859
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,280
Unknown, you need to raise

860
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,000
What if you draw negative ten?

861
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,880
Come on

862
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,920
Zero

863
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,280
Challenge failed

864
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,600
Then let's quickly turn to

865
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,960
the content of our third round assessment

866
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,240
What should we look at this time?

867
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,440
Let's pick "Tianma"

868
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,680
Why choose "Tianma"?

869
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,000
Don't want to trouble everyone

870
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,000
Alright

871
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,920
Let's see what "Tianma" is

872
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,520
Medical Combat

873
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,880
Alright, now let's have the four clinics

874
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,560
each decide

875
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,200
which trainee physician

876
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,120
will compete first

877
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,320
Dragon Fist

878
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,320
What?

879
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,160
Dragon Fist

880
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,720
Dragon Fist is good

881
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,240
We can't lose in terms of momentum

882
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm Monkey Fist

883
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,240
Monkey Fist

884
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,400
Speak

885
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,000
Are our rules from wrestling

886
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,920
or from free combat

887
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,840
or from the octagon?

888
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,320
We follow DNT rules

889
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
DNT

890
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,160
Brain Movement Hall

891
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,600
Only head strikes allowed

892
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,920
Only head strikes

893
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,960
Use your brain

894
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,120
Are you ready, everyone?

895
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,760
Three

896
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,160
Two

897
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,280
One

898
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,800
Cue the music!

899
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
It's like...

900
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,320
Just like in "Battle Royale"

901
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,200
The first sixty seconds

902
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,360
Everyone gathers in the square

903
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,600
Right, show off a bit

904
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,960
Everyone, show your moves

905
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,280
You still have to dance

906
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,480
The hardest part is dancing

907
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,360
That's too much, you

908
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,440
Don't enter this white circle

909
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,760
Right, you must not enter that white circle

910
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,800
Got in

911
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,760
Foul

912
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,200
Defend, defend!

913
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,280
Defend against him!

914
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,480
Why are you defending against me?

915
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,000
You defend against him

916
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,560
I'll defend against Huang Kai

917
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,480
No, why are we fighting each other?

918
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,000
Timer starts

919
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,520
Thirty seconds

920
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,360
Get him

921
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,720
Dragon... Dragon Fist

922
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,960
Dragon Fist

923
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,440
Dragon Grab

924
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,800
"Dragon Seize"

925
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Ten seconds left

926
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,200
Too intense

927
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,520
He's locked

928
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
I'm locked

929
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,040
Stop

930
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,240
Time's up

931
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,880
Who has the pen?

932
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,680
Wei Xiaolong

933
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,960
Fate has me by the throat

934
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,560
Seems like it

935
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,560
Come on, ready?

936
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:01,920
Wei Xiaolong

937
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,680
Timer starts

938
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,440
This drawing is too hard

939
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,240
One

940
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,440
Then

941
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,680
Stars, waves

942
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,720
Okay, time's up.

943
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,280
Please go back.

944
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,320
So it's already over this quickly.

945
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,280
That was quite tough.

946
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,360
Didn't see anything else

947
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,920
I really didn't see it

948
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,600
It's quite difficult

949
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,160
Three, two, one

950
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,840
Music starts

951
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,280
Doesn't look like they want to dance at all

952
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,920
You all

953
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,040
Be careful

954
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
Snatched it

955
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,920
Resist

956
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,960
Feels very fierce

957
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,200
Don't break it

958
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,240
Very terrifying

959
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,400
Soccer team

960
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,160
Peking University soccer team

961
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,880
Soccer team

962
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,640
Five seconds left

963
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,480
Five

964
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,640
Four

965
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,600
Three

966
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,560
Two

967
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,000
One

968
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,560
Stop

969
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,560
Soccer player

970
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,400
Come on, timer starts

971
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,120
What's the difference between those two?

972
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,800
One has a frame.

973
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,480
Frame.

974
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,080
This one is so detailed.

975
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,040
I still can't see anything.

976
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,880
This is too difficult.

977
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,520
Don't fake it

978
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,200
Wei Xiaolong

979
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Wei Xiaolong truly leaps like a dragon

980
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,920
Dragon Soars

981
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,840
Dragon Fist

982
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Wei Xiaolong

983
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,440
Watch out

984
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,080
Basketball

985
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,000
"Dragon's Protection"

986
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,040
Oh my god

987
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,560
So difficult

988
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,360
Three

989
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,440
Two

990
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,160
One

991
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,840
Okay

992
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,880
Well done, Wei Xiaolong

993
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,440
Let's give Wei Xiaolong a round of applause

994
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:34,960
Alright?

995
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,040
Not easy

996
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,800
Truly not easy

997
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,840
Rugby-style play

998
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,880
Competitive sports

999
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,960
Who says mental sports aren't competitive?

1000
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,560
"Dragon's Guard"

1001
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:43,960
Come on

1002
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,040
Three

1003
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,760
Two

1004
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,400
One

1005
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,840
One

1006
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,600
Begin

1007
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,560
Got one

1008
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,200
This

1009
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,160
character

1010
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,160
Wei Xiaolong is too powerful.

1011
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,840
Alright

1012
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,840
Take another look

1013
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,680
You still can't see, right?

1014
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,040
Right

1015
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,720
Can't see

1016
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,160
I'll reward you with five seconds to look

1017
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,480
One

1018
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,560
Two

1019
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,600
Three

1020
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,480
Four

1021
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,120
Five

1022
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,400
Okay, everyone please return

1023
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,040
Come on, everyone

1024
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,040
Music, go

1025
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,760
Wei Xiaolong is so active

1026
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,920
Wei Xiaolong got excited

1027
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,080
Jumping dragon

1028
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,520
Jumping dragon

1029
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,240
I think this grouping is well done

1030
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,520
We

1031
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,680
They're all so strong

1032
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,360
Wei Xiaolong

1033
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,800
Watch your head

1034
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,560
Wei Xiaolong

1035
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,000
Wei Xiaolong

1036
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,440
Attack his Baihu point

1037
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,320
Strike his Baihu pressure point

1038
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,560
Feels good

1039
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
More pressure, master

1040
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,760
You can try tickling him

1041
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,320
Tried that

1042
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,360
He's not ticklish

1043
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,040
Feels great

1044
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,480
Okay, time's up

1045
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,240
Wei Xiaolong, I really feel like we're about to redeem ourselves

1046
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,760
In this battle

1047
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,560
Fighting hard

1048
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,520
If Wei Xiaolong went to war

1049
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,640
He'd definitely be a general

1050
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,160
Dragon Fist is number one under heaven

1051
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,800
Awesome

1052
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,960
Come on, our Wei Xiaolong

1053
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,520
Okay, no need to time it anymore.

1054
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,080
Congratulations, Wei Xiaolong.

1055
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
You've scored four points this round.

1056
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,000
Let's propose a peace initiative

1057
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,480
Any supporters?

1058
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,640
Supported

1059
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,960
Anyway, we'll just

1060
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,040
Whoever ends up holding it

1061
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,640
And cradling it

1062
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,160
We'll consider them the winner

1063
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,560
Okay

1064
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,880
Then they can proceed to answer

1065
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,360
Good

1066
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,080
Alright then

1067
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,600
Go for it

1068
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,400
Do your best

1069
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,440
Just stay alive

1070
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,480
Come back alive

1071
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,040
Return safely

1072
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,640
Wait no, this is me

1073
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,680
These are my real teammates

1074
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,920
Come on

1075
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,080
Three

1076
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,680
Two

1077
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,640
One

1078
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,840
Cue the music

1079
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,600
Start dancing

1080
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,000
Not bad

1081
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,400
Much better than those four

1082
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,280
from the previous round

1083
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,760
Everyone's got dance talent

1084
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,000
Last round we were just pretending to dance

1085
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,080
We just wanted to fight

1086
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,800
Foot

1087
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,040
Begin

1088
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,680
Where's the promised elegance?

1089
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,760
The promised peace

1090
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,360
No grabbing

1091
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,440
We

1092
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,600
Let's be a bit more civilized

1093
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,320
Right

1094
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,240
Tickling

1095
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,480
Use your body

1096
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,240
Use your legs to pry his legs apart

1097
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,680
Leg prying

1098
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,720
Two people prying legs

1099
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,160
Yes, use your body

1100
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,760
Hold on

1101
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,440
Lock it

1102
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,280
Core strength

1103
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,000
Engage your core

1104
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,440
Use your core

1105
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,640
Use your waist

1106
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,680
Five seconds left

1107
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,360
Five seconds

1108
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,960
Waist strength

1109
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,560
Just use your waist and it'll be fine

1110
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,240
Two

1111
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,000
One

1112
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,720
Done

1113
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,400
Time's up

1114
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,320
Okay

1115
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,040
You four are really...

1116
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,360
Someone even tickled me

1117
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,320
Wasn't this supposed to be peaceful?

1118
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,680
Whoever grabs it first, everyone stops

1119
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,920
Dong Zifan, let me say first

1120
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,120
Let's keep this peaceful

1121
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,480
Tickling him

1122
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,560
I noticed

1123
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,880
I noticed everyone broke the agreement

1124
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,240
in the very first second

1125
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,960
Right, right, right

1126
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,240
Come on, Yu Haoyang

1127
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,160
Ready?

1128
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,960
Three

1129
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,760
Two

1130
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,120
One

1131
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,760
This

1132
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,520
Is it that easy?

1133
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,640
It does seem pretty easy

1134
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,480
Seems quite easy

1135
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,320
Time's up

1136
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,200
Please go back

1137
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,840
Oh my god

1138
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:42,920
Right?

1139
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,800
This is a bit difficult, isn't it?

1140
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,280
Can't say

1141
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,000
No, no

1142
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,440
Brother Kai

1143
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,240
Let's go, go, go

1144
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,600
No

1145
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,120
Wait a sec

1146
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,560
That's not what I was about to say

1147
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,160
Keep it up

1148
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,840
What is this

1149
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,280
Thud thud thud

1150
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,160
Get down

1151
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,360
I saw two of them

1152
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,280
I need to draw it

1153
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,400
He saw two

1154
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:26,720
Poke him poke him

1155
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,840
Don't let him draw

1156
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,200
Poke him poke him

1157
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,080
Tickle him tickle him

1158
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,280
He doesn’t seem ticklish

1159
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,840
Lock the torso

1160
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,320
Torso locked

1161
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,520
Few seconds left

1162
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,680
Five seconds left

1163
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,560
Torso

1164
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,280
Torso locked

1165
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:36,720
Torso locked

1166
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,160
Three

1167
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,720
Two

1168
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,520
One

1169
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,080
Done

1170
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,800
Impressive

1171
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,280
Didn't expect that

1172
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,080
Yang Zongyu is really fast.

1173
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,760
After he snatched it,

1174
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,480
he went to a corner.

1175
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,280
No one noticed.

1176
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,160
So those three earlier,

1177
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,320
who were they actually fighting over?

1178
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,840
Fighting over nothing?

1179
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,200
Maybe we were fighting over Yu Haoyang.

1180
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,280
We were sure he had it.

1181
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,440
Come on.

1182
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,280
Timer starts now.

1183
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,080
Right.

1184
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,200
Let me ask

1185
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,400
the other three

1186
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,080
the friends wearing boxing gloves

1187
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,040
have you noticed

1188
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,840
there are two

1189
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,880
there are two

1190
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,960
but I can't get them

1191
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,400
then just grab them

1192
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,840
try to grab them

1193
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,360
right, do we have a chance now

1194
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,840
to avoid being punished

1195
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,720
the last two will be punished, right?

1196
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,240
Right

1197
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,160
What's your count now?

1198
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,080
We have thirty

1199
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,640
You have thirty mental points

1200
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,280
Doesn't matter

1201
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,880
Never mind them

1202
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,720
How many mental points do you have?

1203
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,000
Total score

1204
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,960
They have forty-five

1205
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,920
Then we're already in third place

1206
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,760
I can grab it first

1207
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,000
Then give it to one of you

1208
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,200
You should've given it to me earlier

1209
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,400
Did you find any?

1210
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,080
Give it to me now, there are two

1211
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,720
Okay

1212
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,920
Okay

1213
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,280
Come on

1214
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:42,800
Everyone

1215
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,400
Let's go

1216
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,560
Stop

1217
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,600
That's too much

1218
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,560
What are you doing?

1219
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,360
Minus ten points

1220
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,880
Our

1221
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,320
Dong Zifan

1222
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,440
made a deal

1223
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,480
They made a deal

1224
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,440
I have to grab

1225
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,480
Come on, Dong Zifan

1226
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,560
must grab

1227
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,840
Xinjiang man

1228
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,280
Chongqing man

1229
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,360
For the Horde

1230
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,040
For the Alliance

1231
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,040
Three

1232
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,200
Two

1233
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,880
One

1234
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,320
Okay

1235
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,040
Be careful

1236
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,960
Okay

1237
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,000
Thanks

1238
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,120
Good buddy

1239
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,760
Our Yang Zongyu is extremely kind

1240
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,160
Kind

1241
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,080
Extremely kind

1242
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,440
Helping others succeed

1243
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,640
Come on, answer

1244
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,400
This

1245
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,000
I'll grab it for you

1246
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,360
Did you find it?

1247
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:43,760
Found it

1248
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,160
Good

1249
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,440
Look, this is how the champion carries themselves.

1250
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,680
The leader isn't worried at all.

1251
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,840
Right, Ren Yinpeng is about to step up.

1252
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,600
Agility type.

1253
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,440
It's not over yet.

1254
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,280
Still time to snatch it.

1255
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,320
My pants!

1256
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,560
These pants, it seems...

1257
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:06,960
Hurry up!

1258
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,120
His pants tore.

1259
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,320
Here, take this.

1260
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,160
See? Isn't it...

1261
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,000
Torn, yes they're torn.

1262
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,360
They're torn.

1263
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,160
Cover up, time out!

1264
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,560
Okay.

1265
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,760
Then you'll answer this time.

1266
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,760
Are you ready?

1267
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,080
I'm ready.

1268
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,760
Go ahead.

1269
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,680
Please answer.

1270
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,920
It's really in here.

1271
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,680
Found it immediately.

1272
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,600
Let's congratulate Ren Yinpeng.

1273
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,800
For scoring a point

1274
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,880
for his team.

1275
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,760
After three rounds of assessments,

1276
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,840
everything is now concluded.

1277
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,080
What are our current mental scores

1278
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,120
looking like respectively?

1279
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,880
The acting hall leaders for this term

1280
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,000
who could they be?

1281
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,560
They are Consultation Room Four

1282
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,360
ranking in first place.

1283
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,160
We will now proceed to

1284
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,720
this term's most important segment.

1285
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,200
The acting hall leader inauguration ceremony.

1286
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,160
Bring out the gourds.

1287
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,920
Which color do you choose?

1288
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,280
I'll take the black one.

1289
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,200
You take the white one.

1290
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,880
Agreed.

1291
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,080
It seems these custom gourds

1292
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,160
will last a long time.

1293
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,720
Perfect.

1294
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,080
Both of you choose

1295
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,680
your most confident pose

1296
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,280
for our photo session.

1297
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,120
Today the consultation rooms

1298
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,640
receiving value-added services

1299
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,600
are Consultation Room Three

1300
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,320
and our Consultation Room Two.

1301
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,400
Adorable and charming

1302
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,600
Yes, absolutely radiant.

1303
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,640
Now let's immediately present

1304
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,320
our value-added services.

1305
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,200
Everyone please look at the TV screen.

1306
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,080
Is this what we're supposed to learn?

1307
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,560
You are

1308
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,080
Was he willing

1309
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,000
to accept mental punishment

1310
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,640
Because we are the Brainstorm Hall

1311
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,000
So our Brainstorm Hall version of 101

1312
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,920
We need to dance wearing boxing gloves

1313
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,400
Pick me pick me up

1314
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,520
Pick me pick me up

1315
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,800
That's the idea

1316
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,160
Ren Yinpeng, can you do it?

1317
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,840
I was taught by someone before

1318
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,360
Then teach these three

1319
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,680
We turn from this side to that side

1320
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,080
One

1321
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,040
First this hand

1322
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,960
Right hand

1323
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,440
One two three

1324
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:46,920
Up

1325
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,440
Right?

1326
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,880
Turn left

1327
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,800
It's that simple

1328
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,720
Wei Xiaolong is very coordinated

1329
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,560
But the soccer player

1330
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,480
Should have no problem either, right?

1331
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:02,560
Then

1332
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,440
Start with the left hand

1333
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,160
Left hand

1334
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,760
Turn left

1335
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,160
Foot

1336
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,360
One two

1337
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
One two

1338
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,280
Ready for the challenge?

1339
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,800
Let's go

1340
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,440
The four of us other doctors

1341
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,520
Also need to score

1342
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,520
If unsatisfied

1343
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,000
We'll make them dance again

1344
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,040
After all, you're the hall leaders

1345
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,680
You're the audience

1346
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,080
All very important

1347
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:22,560
Let's begin

1348
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,400
Weapons showcase

1349
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,760
Weapons showcase

1350
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:30,800
You

1351
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,360
Should we do a rehearsal

1352
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:37,840
Or go straight into it

1353
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,480
Okay, let's do an entrance

1354
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,880
For the entrance

1355
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,840
The hall leader will decide

1356
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,840
The hall leader decides

1357
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,320
No

1358
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:48,720
No need

1359
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,560
For the entrance

1360
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,080
Just bat your eyelashes

1361
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,200
Or we could all turn our backs

1362
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,680
Okay

1363
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
Let's turn our backs

1364
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,520
Then one by one

1365
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:57,920
Jump one by one

1366
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,080
Wink

1367
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,840
Then stick out your tongues

1368
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:01,920
When you turn around

1369
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,320
Be cute and charming

1370
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,200
Exactly like this

1371
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,000
Charming

1372
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:07,600
Okay

1373
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,520
Just like this

1374
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,320
That's cute

1375
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:09,720
Charming

1376
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,120
Radiant

1377
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,640
Charming

1378
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,760
Then shine together

1379
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,800
Then you'll dance

1380
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,120
Alright?

1381
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,880
Let's go

1382
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,600
Three

1383
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:15,960
Two

1384
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,200
One

1385
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:16,880
Music

1386
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,280
Go

1387
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,080
Cute

1388
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,160
Charming

1389
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,440
Radiant

1390
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,680
Charming

1391
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,360
Shining

1392
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,720
So handsome

1393
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,360
Ending pose

1394
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,880
Breathing

1395
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,520
Blinking

1396
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,720
Alright, alright

1397
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,120
Good, good

1398
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,280
Let me ask the hall master

1399
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,240
Satisfied?

1400
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,080
Not bad

1401
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,360
It's okay

1402
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,960
Pretty good already

1403
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,480
Okay everyone

1404
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,160
Another day of intense brain activity

1405
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,120
A day of burning brain cells

1406
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,320
Hope everyone gains wisdom daily

1407
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,360
At Brain Training Hall

1408
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,200
With fruitful results

1409
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,640
Now let's shout together

1410
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,680
Our slogan

1411
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,800
Start brainstorming!

1412
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,880
Unlock your brainpower!

1413
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,040
See you next time!

1414
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:39,560
Come on

1415
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,960
After-class games

1416
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,640
Don't panic

1417
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,880
No doubts in this game

1418
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,040
You have great advantage

1419
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,120
Hope it's that one

1420
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,320
That's the one

1421
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,320
One

1422
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,520
Told you theirs were smaller

1423
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,240
This isn't how you slaughter pigs

1424
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,920
Prescription Hunt

1425
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,120
Get ready everyone

1426
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,600
Three

1427
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,200
Two

1428
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,560
One

1429
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,080
First time feeling this

1430
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,640
A man running toward me

1431
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,760
We need to set up defenses along this line.

1432
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,720
What should we do?

1433
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,480
What to do?

1434
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,440
No no no

1435
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,160
Why can't we?

1436
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,280
We absolutely cannot place this here.

1437
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,720
If this comes over, they'll take it.

1438
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,840
We've been discovered.

1439
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,840
Our only option now is...

1440
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,800
to cut off one of their paths.

1441
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,600
Their final move...

1442
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,520
won't succeed.

1443
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,680
This move again.

1444
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,920
I knew they'd make this move.

1445
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,720
Huang Kai...

1446
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,120
just won't let me go.

1447
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,240
Cut off all three of his options.

1448
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,760
Brother Kai isn't leaving any room for mercy.
