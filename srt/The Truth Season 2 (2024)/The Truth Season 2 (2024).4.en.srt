1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,400
2022

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,120
In a secluded seaside building

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,120
"Let's Start Deduction" begins the story of Apartment 11 in Deduction City

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,520
After a year and a half

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm Bai Yu

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,160
Liu Yuning

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,040
Zhou Keyu

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm Dilraba

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,520
I'm not very good at using my brain

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,400
So I hope the show has more scary elements

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,920
I'm Zhang Linghe

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,120
I hope the veteran players

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,920
can look out for me

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,480
I'm really timid

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,720
I'm Wang Xun

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
Finally got the chance

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
to become a newcomer

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,880
Show us the ropes

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Six players form a developing deduction team

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,040
Embarking on an adventure-filled deduction journey

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,040
Helimo Yu, the Deduction King

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,320
Let's start deducing

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,240
What are you laughing at?

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,600
In the coming days

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
The deduction team will travel to parallel worlds

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Four dimensions of Deduction Town

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,600
Misty alleys with fluttering qipaos

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,440
Terrifying to hear about

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,440
You're lying

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,160
I'm perfectly sober

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,320
What if they're tricking you?

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,760
We'll judge for ourselves

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,120
Don't you want the truth?

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Turning point of the era, business boom

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
To work, love work

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,800
Can't live without work

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,560
What's your salary?

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,440
None of your business

39
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
Mine's five figures

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
I manage all company funds

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,320
This is your major mistake

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,840
The company will surely fire you

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
But as a junior employee

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,640
why would he target me?

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
Entertainment boom brings vitality

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,720
Dear students

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,640
I saw a monster in the laundry room

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,120
Sci-fi cyberpunk, memory interconnected

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,960
Several cases will occur in each timeline

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,240
Players work together to uncover the truth

51
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,080
The secret behind Tui Town

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,720
This is the organization's emblem

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,680
We can go to the warehouse

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
Hurry

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,680
"Let's Start Deduction" Season 2 Game Rules

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,840
Six players per episode

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
Divided into four suspects

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,120
And two detectives to investigate

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,840
The real culprit hides among the suspects

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
The culprit's mission

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Is to conceal their identity

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,320
Without being discovered by other players

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,920
Only the real culprit can lie

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
Notably

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,560
This season introduces new gameplay

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,240
The player who is the culprit

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,160
If they pass a certain test

68
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Can choose between the two detectives

69
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,600
To turn one into X

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
X's mission is

71
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,640
During subsequent investigations

72
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,480
To help the culprit escape

73
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,520
Game victory conditions

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,040
After the investigation

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Players vote for the culprit

76
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
If the culprit receives

77
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,040
Fewer votes than other suspects

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,800
Then culprit and X get golden keys

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,040
Otherwise players who voted correctly

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,440
Get golden keys

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,680
Are you ready?

82
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,960
Now

83
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
We'll follow the players

84
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,840
Traveling back to 1924

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,960
My name is Bali.

86
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm a fashion designer from Tui Town.

87
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,360
And the founder of the Shaoshuai 101 brand.

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,480
In these turbulent times,

89
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,120
Tuile Gate is the only haven in our town.

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Every night here is filled with singing, dancing, and splendid festivities.

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
And tonight,

92
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,440
I'll be leading Shaoshuai 101's

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
specially invited models

94
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,720
for the closing show of "Bali Fashion Week,"

95
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,600
showcasing my latest fashion designs.

96
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
Hello everyone,

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,920
Let's welcome the stars of the Bali Fashion Week

98
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,720
to introduce themselves.

99
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,760
Dear friends in attendance,

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,320
Hello everyone,

101
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm from Tuizhen,

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,880
a fashion designer,

103
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,680
a career-driven seamstress.

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
My name is Bali.

105
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,640
Let's give a round of applause for Bali!

106
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,680
The one and only

107
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,440
Bali.

108
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,920
The last apprentice

109
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,440
named Bai Youcai,

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,880
meaning "tailor's craft".

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,400
Master and apprentice work together in garment-making.

112
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,200
Your way of speaking is quite distinctive

113
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,920
It's this

114
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,960
Four-character phrases

115
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,480
You must have studied idioms

116
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,720
Just a little

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,840
Now, Young Marshal He

118
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,760
I'm He Shaoshuai

119
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
I'm one of Tuizhen's

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,160
most talked-about

121
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,440
figures

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,200
(One of them)

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,800
In Tuizhen

124
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes, out of ten people

125
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,040
nine discuss me during meals

126
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,440
Right? Born to trend

127
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
And born for negative trends too

128
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm Bally's exclusive model

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,760
Hope you'll support

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,400

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,000
We dominate Tuizhen's

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
trending charts

134
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,240
Hello everyone, I'm

Young Master Ning

142
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
Hello everyone, I am

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,920
Our Tuizhen's

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
Number one good brother

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,720
Young Master Ning

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
You are?

148
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,320
That's right

149
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,920
Little sister

150
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,920
Brother

151
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,280
Good

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,440
Welcome, Young Master Ning

it's my great honor to gather with you tonight

157
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,200
here in our Tuizhen town's

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,320
most vibrant and joyful place -

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
the Tuilemen Cabaret.

160
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,280
I am Master Le,

161
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,680
the owner of Tuilemen.

162
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Now besides the five guests we just introduced,

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
there's one more person -

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,960
Tuilemen's

165
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,720
only resident male singer,

Let's welcome Wang Chuanshuo!

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Thank you.

169
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,280
Furthermore,

170
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
our neighbors from next door

171
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
have also joined us today.

172
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,520
They are the intern physicians

173
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,920
from the Brainstorm Hall.

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
They are also loyal fans

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,960
of the Young Marshal 101 brand.

176
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,280
Today we'll not only expand our minds

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,680
but also present you with unique performances.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,840
As everyone knows,

179
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,240
the Bali Fashion Week

180
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,280
is about to conclude.

181
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,680
Young Marshal 101 has been so popular

182
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,520
it's topped the charts

183
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,880
on Tuizhen's Weibo hot searches for seven straight days.

184
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
The biggest contributor behind this success

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
is none other than Madam Bali.

186
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
In just one short week,

187
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
we've received

188
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,040
this many deposits -

189
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,280
among which

190
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,720
there are

191
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,800
as many as twenty

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,840
gold bars.

193
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
Twenty bars.

194
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
Now then

195
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Before the Bali Fashion Week concludes

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
I must first announce

197
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,520
a very important piece of news

198
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,400
Starting after 8 PM tonight

199
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,560
our town will be under lockdown

200
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,800
for forty-eight hours

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,880
Therefore, for the next forty-eight hours

202
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,000
none of you will be able to leave

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
our Sanjia Alley

204
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,000
Your food, clothing, and shelter

205
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,560
will all be taken care of by Lord Le

206
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,160
Alright?

207
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
Okay

208
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,520
Lord Le is truly Lord Le

209
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
There's something wrong with the lights

210
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,440
Really?

211
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,040
What's up?

212
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,040
What's wrong?

213
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,080
Wait a moment

214
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,240
Hold on

215
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,480
It's nothing

216
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
Could something appear suddenly?

217
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,000
No

218
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,680
Suddenly turning on the lights right in front of us

219
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,000
What is that?

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,880
Don't scare me.

221
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,280
What thing?

222
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,440
There's a "ghost."

223
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,120
Behind you.

224
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,640
Don't be like this

225
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,200
Who said there's a "ghost"?

226
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,240
Go away

227
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
You go away

228
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Help!

229
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,560
The long-haired witch

230
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,680
Go away

231
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,640
Where is she?

232
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,280
Where? What is it?

233
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,840
On the stage

234
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
She's amazing

235
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,880
She's so soft

236
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,840
You're amazing

237
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,040
She's so soft

238
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,000
The robot dance is really good

239
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,640
Where is everyone?

240
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,240
What's wrong?

241
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
Don't do this

242
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,320
Everyone

243
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,960
Is everyone unharmed from earlier?

244
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,240
Fortunately, yes.

245
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
But emotionally scarred.

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,360
That was the Long-Haired Demoness.

247
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,080
She's been terrorizing our Tui Town

248
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,200
for a long time now.

249
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,560
Look everyone,

250
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,600
What's wrong with him?

251
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,400
What happened to you?

252
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,120
The wound on my left arm

253
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,480
was caused by the Long-Haired Demoness.

254
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,640
Did she scratch you or...?

255
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,440
I just remember extreme pain.

256
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,360
Earlier I saw her claws -

257
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,440
they seemed extremely dangerous.

258
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,040
She must have trained in Nine Yin White Bone Claw.

259
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,640
Don't you all know

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
about the Long-Haired Demoness?

261
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,280
Are there any legends about her?

262
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,280
Our Tui Town Daily

263
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,680
has published some reports

264
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
you can read for more information.

265
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,080
"Long-Haired Demoness Night Attacks on Tui Town"

266
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,040
"Townspeople Living in Fear"

267
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,400
"From February 1923 to present day,"

268
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,640
"whenever night falls,"

269
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,560
"Tui Town becomes shrouded"

270
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,160
"in the terrifying shadow of the Long-Haired Demoness."

271
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,480
Her long hair strikes fear into hearts

272
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,080
Capable of sweeping away everything effortlessly

273
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,240
Reporters courageously interviewed those

274
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,480
who had encountered the Long-Haired Witch

275
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,960
unfortunately crossing paths with her

276
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,120
One resident from Sanjia Alley

277
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,680
tremblingly described

278
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,080
Though not facing the witch directly

279
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,840
was shocked to find kitchen delicacies

280
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,920
vanished overnight

281
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,120
Food thief!

282
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,800
Stealing food

283
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,640
The food thief

284
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,080
Many clothing stores in town

285
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,040
also fell victim

286
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,840
New outfits disappeared without a trace

287
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,640
This Long-Haired Witch

288
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,520
Her origins

289
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,760
and ghostly activities

290
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,120
leave townsfolk both curious and terrified

291
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,520
Panic spreads

292
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,360
All worry that the Long-Haired Witch

293
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,320
might next sweep away

294
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,120
human lives

295
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,240
Quite frightening

296
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Money

297
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,760
So it was all about money

298
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,880
They stole twenty gold bars

299
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,160
What should we do then?

300
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,120
Dilraba

301
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,960
I want to apologize to you

302
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,600
I didn't expect this to happen suddenly

303
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,760
Apologies are useless

304
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,920
This happened at your Tui Le Men

305
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,200
All my money is gone

306
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,480
About these gold bars

307
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,840
I will investigate thoroughly

308
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,680
Your losses

309
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,160
I will definitely give you an explanation

310
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
The heavy snow outside has been falling for three days

311
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,240
But it has stopped now

312
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,280
Distinguished guests staying in Sanjia Alley

313
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,840
You may now leave in an orderly manner

314
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
The six remaining guests

315
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,480
Please stay at our Tui Le Men for now

316
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,640
Tomorrow at 8 AM

317
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,960
We'll have breakfast together here

318
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,560
If you need anything

319
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,440
Feel free to call me anytime

320
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,280
I'll be in the boss's room upstairs

321
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,600
Goodnight, everyone

322
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,520
Alright

323
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,640
Got it

325
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,720
Young Marshal Ning is in this private room

326
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,920
Young Marshal He is over there

327
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
The money will be gone

328
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,520
No one would steal the wallet, right? Just wait a moment

329
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,040
All the chickens in the village fell ill

330
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,640
The entire village overslept

331
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,280
Exhausted

332
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,240
Morning

333
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,120
Morning

334
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
Young commanders

335
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,280
How was your rest?

336
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,960
Not bad

337
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,960
Are we the only ones here?

338
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,480
Waiting for Master Le for breakfast

339
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,760
Why isn't he here yet?

340
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,080
Master Le

341
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,640
He's usually punctual

342
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,760
Where does he live?

343
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,720
They said to find him on the second floor if needed

344
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,640
Let's go look for him

345
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,280
Old Bai, you're suspicious walking so fast

346
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
Why is walking fast suspicious?

347
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,600
He was the first one

348
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,160
Did you come out last night?

349
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,920
Whether I came out or not

350
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,640
What's it to you?

351
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,480
Boss's room

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,760
Master Le

353
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,160
Master Le

354
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,080
Time to get up

355
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,160
He's not up yet

356
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm starving

357
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,840
Master Le

358
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,920
The door's locked

359
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,680
It's locked

360
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,560
Look for his keys

361
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,480
Check if the keyhole has issues

362
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,400
Just kick it down

363
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,440
Brother Bai

364
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,400
Put your old skills to work quickly

365
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,560
Why me again?

366
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
We have a tradition from last season

367
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,320
That he's the door-kicker

368
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,920
Wait

369
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,640
I'll cover the rear

370
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,520
The windows are shut too

371
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
Let's just kick the door in

372
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,240
Let's go

373
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,160
What's wrong?

374
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,880
Is it Lord Le?

375
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,200
Master Le

376
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,080
Master Le's clothes

377
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,000
hanged

378
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,960
Look, he got tangled up in hair.

379
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,360
Was he possessed by the Long-haired Witch?

380
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,120
Not possessed.

381
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,160
He was probably killed by the Long-haired Witch.

382
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,720
Turn on the lights.

383
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,600
This is terrifying.

384
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,520
This hair...

385
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,760
How did this happen?

386
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,720
It is February 2nd, 1924.

387
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,560
8:10 AM.

388
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
The deceased in this case is Master Le.

389
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,480
Owner of the Tuilemen establishment.

390
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,040
Based on preliminary analysis,

391
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,320
Master Le's death

392
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
cannot rule out homicide.

393
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,960
The perpetrator

394
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,320
is likely among

395
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,280
Bali,

396
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,960
Wang Chuanshuo,

397
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
Bai Youcai,

398
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,800
and Young Marshal He.

399
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,760
In this game's scenario,

400
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,640
Young Marshal Ning

401
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,600
and Young Marshal Ke

402
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,120
are currently not suspects.

403
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,240
Thus you two will investigate.

404
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,120
Now please begin

405
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,840
by examining the scene.

406
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,800
Conduct initial evidence collection.

407
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,280
Let's get to work.

408
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
Come on.

409
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,800
Wait a moment.

410
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,520
You said

411
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,960
the door was locked when he died?

412
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,760
So it's a locked-room murder?

413
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,120
Right.

414
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,000
After killing him,

415
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,680
how did the killer leave?

416
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
That's the question.

417
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,240
Could they have used the window?

418
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
Any open windows perhaps?

419
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,800
This one's locked.

420
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,960
Let me check.

421
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,480
This side's locked too.

422
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,840
All windows are locked.

423
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,040
How did he get in and out?

424
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
Let's first check what's on the corpse.

425
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,480
Alright?

426
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,000
See how he died.

427
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,280
This is tied very tightly.

428
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,560
There are two pairs of scissors here.

429
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,480
Just snip it right off.

430
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,280
Come on.

431
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,360
Come

432
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,120
Wait a moment

433
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:25,800
Let's go

434
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,600
Okay

435
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
My boss

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,680
How did he die?

437
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,840
Gotta strip someone again

438
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,480
Strip someone every season

439
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,360
Nothing, nothing here

440
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,960
Anything in the pants pockets?

441
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,280
Let me check the jacket pockets

442
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,680
All pockets are empty

443
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,400
Nothing

444
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,640
Nothing in the shoes either

445
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,560
Take off the socks

446
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,520
Pants off too

447
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
In the underwear pocket

448
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,040
Let me take a quick look

449
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
Sorry about this, my apologies

450
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Nothing here

451
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,760
How come you've got nothing?

452
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,720
We're screwed

453
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,000
Only a ligature mark is quite visible

454
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
The ligature mark is deep

455
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
The hair from earlier must be the weapon

456
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,600
That hair earlier was likely the murder weapon

457
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,760
How do we hang it up?

458
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,320
Let's finish checking this area first

459
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,400
Check this entire area

460
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,720
Here's a newspaper

461
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,400
Tui Le Gate is now recruiting

462
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,920
Hand it over

463
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,080
The annual income ledger of Tui Le Men

464
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,640
Here it is

465
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
Ascension list

466
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,960
Bed

467
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Come on, come on

468
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,400
Just flip it over and be done with it

469
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,920
Here we go

470
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,040
Have you finished checking this cabinet?

471
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,560
There are footprints here, do you see them?

472
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,640
This...

473
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,920
This is cigarette ash, right?

474
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,000
We really can't miss any spot.

475
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,800
Finally found you

476
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,920
Quick, take a look at this

477
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,040
I just picked this up by the Helpless River

478
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,840
What is it?

479
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,160
You must talk them out of it

480
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,200
Don’t let them do something drastic

481
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,960
What’s the reason?

482
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,840
Helpless River

483
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,920
Goodbye to this world

484
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
All four of them are about to

485
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
commit suicide

486
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,040
The preliminary search of the crime scene is complete.

487
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,800
Let's go.

488
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,040
Officers, please escort the suspect

489
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,600
to the Interrogation Hall.

490
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,000
Prepare for questioning.

491
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
Let's go to Brainstorm Hall

492
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,480
This outfit of yours

493
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,960
is actually designed really cool

494
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,400
This looks beautiful

495
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,320
Good-looking

496
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,440
And there's a security cap too

497
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,000
Later you should make me a new performance costume

498
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,680
I think this outfit is too tacky

499
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,760
Brainstorm Hall

500
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,560
We're here

501
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,320
Brainstorm Hall

502
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,040
This season's questioning segment

503
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,840
will be conducted at Brainstorm Hall

504
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,920
Outwardly this is a pharmacy

505
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
Very high-end

506
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,840
But actually it's Tuizhen's case handling center

507
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,880
But actually it's Tuizhen's case handling center

508
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,280
While investigating the crime scene,

509
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,400
members of the Think Tank have also collected

510
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
some evidence related to

511
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,600
the four suspects in this case.

512
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,520
Players, please examine the evidence.

513
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,320
Examine evidence.

514
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,440
What is this?

515
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,280
Do we need to open this?

516
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,040
We usually open them.

517
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,400
Alright, we'll open it later.

518
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,160
Can I see this evidence?

519
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,280
It's all torn up.

520
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,760
Why is there blood on this?

521
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,960
This is a serious issue.

522
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
There are quite a few problems.

523
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,760
This time, it's my humble self

524
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,440
Young Master Ke and I

525
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
will serve as this episode's investigators

526
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
Today's deceased

527
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,640
was the boss of our Tuile Sect

528
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,320
called Master Le

529
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
First, let's all share

530
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,960
our connections with Master Le

531
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,000
I didn't have much connection with Master Le

532
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,800
But with that...

533
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm his cousin

534
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,040
Young Master Ke is my younger brother

535
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,000
Right

536
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
Young Master He is my cousin

537
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,840
Correct

538
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,720
Everyone knows I'm a young master

539
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,080
And I'm

540
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,240
Bali's boss's model

541
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,360
Who isn't? Me too

542
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,200
Yeah

543
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,560
What about Bai Youcai?

544
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,680
No other relationship

545
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,960
Between Master Le and me

546
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,200
he helped me once

547
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,640
Yes, that's all

548
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,560
My story's simple

549
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,120
I've been singing at his place

550
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,480
for these past two years

551
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
Two years to become a star

552
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,000
I worked hard

553
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,840
Two years of practice

554
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,840
Not bad

555
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,600
Next, let me first share with everyone

556
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,160
the evidence collected from the crime scene

557
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,360
Today's victim, Master Le

558
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,560
The crime scene

559
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,840
was his bedroom

560
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,400
We all know the time of death

561
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
Yesterday, our

562
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,120
event ended at 9 PM

563
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,520
So that means

564
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,320
between 9 PM and 8 AM

565
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,640
Right

566
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,280
After Investigator Ke and I searched

567
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,120
we found he was strangled

568
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,240
with hair

569
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,200
and hanged from the ceiling beam

570
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,360
and hanged from the ceiling beam

571
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,960
That beam is very high

572
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,200
Even the three of us couldn't reach it

573
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,040
So at the scene,

574
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,880
the table by the window

575
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,440
could be moved

576
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,000
There are scratch marks on the floor

577
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,360
meaning he pulled it over

578
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,280
this

579
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,480
pulled it here

580
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,560
used the table as a step

581
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,000
threw the hair over the beam

582
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,360
placed the body on the table

583
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,040
We also found on the beam

584
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,160
signs of dragging

585
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,800
There are two

586
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,160
deep friction marks here

587
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,880
The hair was knotted

588
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,200
wrapped around the neck

589
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
then flung upward

590
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,040
pulled

591
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,320
After hanging, he moved the table away

592
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,880
leaving the body suspended

593
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,240
So our initial suspicion

594
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,680
is that one of you four

595
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
mimicked the Long-Haired Witch

596
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,640
to kill Master Le

597
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,680
We also found

598
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
by his wardrobe door

599
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,400
burnt-out knockout incense

600
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,040
He was likely

601
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,720
knocked out first

602
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,800
before being strangled

603
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,000
And what's the most important point?

604
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,120
When we entered the room,

605
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,040
we had to break the door down.

606
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,960
All windows and doors

607
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,640
were locked from the inside.

608
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,960
This means it was

609
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,640
a locked-room murder case.

610
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,040
We also found a suspicious cabinet.

611
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,840
There are footprints here, see?

612
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,640
In this spot,

613
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,440
we discovered half a footprint.

614
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,400
Specifically, the heel print is here.

615
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,280
It had moved.

616
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,760
Someone stood at the doorway,

617
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,040
and their heel print

618
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,320
was left beneath the cabinet here.

619
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
So we've confirmed

620
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
this room has a secret passage.

621
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,440
The killer used this passage

622
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,520
to enter the room,

623
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
committed the murder using those methods,

624
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,280
and after killing the victim,

625
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,840
escaped through the passage.

626
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,440
But we still don't know

627
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
how to open this secret passage.

628
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,400
Next, our young master Ke

629
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,960
will present some physical evidence to everyone

630
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,760
The first piece of evidence

631
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,440
is a copy of the "Tui Town Daily"

632
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,920
Tui Le Gate has opened auditions for singing stars

633
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,520
As long as you're at least 18 years old

634
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,280
and have no family ties (orphaned girls)

635
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,720
and can pass a physical examination

636
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,400
you'll have the opportunity

637
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,200
to perform on Tui Le Gate's stage

638
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,920
Their recruitment conditions

639
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,040
at this place

640
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,240
are rather peculiar

641
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,720
A woman?

642
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Just a woman.

643
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,080
So this is suspicious.

644
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,560
Because through this,

645
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,600
we can actually infer

646
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,120
that this Le Ye

647
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,160
has some hidden secrets.

648
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,920
Second, we found

649
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Tui Le Men's account books.

650
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Tui Le Men opened in 1910

651
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,400
and operated at a loss for twelve months

652
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,160
until January 1911,

653
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,600
when it suddenly became profitable.

654
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,320
He said,

655
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,920
"I knew that VIP guest

656
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,280
wasn't ordinary."

657
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,160
The VIP guest refers to

658
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,440
a mysterious person.

659
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,080
It was after this VIP guest's

660
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,960
appearance that

661
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,520
Tui Le Men became profitable.

662
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,960
Business boomed

663
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,880
and continues to this day.

664
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,800
Third,

665
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,320
we found Tui Le Men's rising star list.

666
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,040
This evidence is quite interesting.

667
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,720
It lists people who became famous here.

668
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,600
Right.

669
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,280
It records

670
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,920
all of

671
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,400
Tui Le Men's songstresses.

672
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,240
It's formatted as a table:

673
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,200
First row is date,

674
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,560
second row is "Le Ye's picks,"

675
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,160
third row is "Mystery's selections."

676
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,080
After Le Ye recommends

677
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,240
these songstresses,

678
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,160
there's another round

679
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,720
of screening

680
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,840
like a selection process

681
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,520
called "Mystery's selections."

682
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,000
This "Mystery"

683
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,800
might be that VIP guest.

684
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,120
Le Ye definitely works for him.

685
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,080
This business

686
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,120
has some dark secrets.

687
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,320
Then on this list,

688
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,160
there's one point I don't quite understand.

689
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,200
In the row recommended by Master Le,

690
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,560
names get crossed out.

691
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,200
Basically every month,

692
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
there are names being crossed out.

693
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,920
Then below it appears

694
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,080
a new name.

695
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,920
My personal deduction is

696
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
they're replacing people.

697
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
And then,

698
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
on the Ascension List,

699
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
we saw Ba Li's name.

700
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,040
Then regarding Xiao Ba,

701
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,760
during this round of Mysterious Selection,

702
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,600
Xiao Ba was initially checked,

703
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,760
but then crossed out.

704
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,880
What month was this? The timeframe is

705
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,440
Xiao Ba was in February 1923.

706
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,840
So we need to ask Xiao Ba

707
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,440
about her connection with Master Le and this Mysterious Selection

708
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,240
what exactly happened

709
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,000
in February 1923.

710
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,920
I briefly worked at Tui Le Men.

711
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,680
Doing what?

712
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
I was a seamstress.

713
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,080
Just basic sewing and mending.

714
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,920
If you were just a seamstress at Tui Le Men,

715
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,880
why would you be on this list

716
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,560
and marked with a half-cross?

717
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,880
I truly don't know.

718
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,080
Because I was never a songstress.

719
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,320
I only ever worked as a seamstress.

720
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,520
So you only worked as a seamstress?

721
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,200
Yes.

722
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,760
It's okay, you're a good person.

723
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,440
She might indeed be a

724
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
special existence

725
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,440
So

726
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,440
The fourth piece of evidence

727
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,640
is our work badges

728
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,680
Because this week is

729
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,720
Bali Fashion Week

730
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,400
And this week

731
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,560
you need this work badge

732
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,040
to enter and exit Tui Le Gate

733
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,920
In each of your rooms

734
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,400
there should be

735
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,480
work badges

736
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,040
Yes there are

737
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,520
Yes

738
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Then in the boss's room

739
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,440
we found his work ID

740
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,200
But his work ID

741
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,040
is missing one day

742
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,960
specifically January 31st

743
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
30th

744
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,960
31st is missing

745
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,240
There's a possibility that the 31st

746
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,160
was taken by someone

747
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,000
or something

748
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,240
I suspect the murderer

749
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,920
took the January 31st ID

750
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,240
so they could enter early

751
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,880
to prepare the crime scene

752
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,640
and make preparations

753
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,160
Because he died

754
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,480
on the night of February 1st

755
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,320
so one day earlier, right?

756
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,040
And the fifth point is

757
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,880
the most important evidence is

758
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,680
you four suspects present here

759
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,920
You

760
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,160
You all

761
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,880
Have you been happy lately?

762
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,680
We found four suicide notes

763
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,560
Each written by one of you four

764
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
But at different times

765
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,400
How did they reach you?

766
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,840
They were found by someone from Dongnao Hall

767
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,440
I just found this by the Wukenai River

768
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,680
while taking a walk

769
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,360
What?

770
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,520
"Youcai's final words"

771
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,440
Youcai

772
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
wanted to kill himself?

773
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,520
"Bali's final words"

774
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,720
Everyone wrote about their darkest hour

775
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,840
and wanted to commit suicide

776
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,920
Why did you want to die?

777
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,200
Can you tell us?

778
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,280
Darkest hour

779
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,440
I'd rather not talk about it now

780
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,360
Because I feel that period

781
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,240
wasn't very good for me

782
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I was in great pain during that time

783
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,960
I couldn't go on anymore

784
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,000
I felt that

785
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
life wasn't worth living

786
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,280
So I helplessly jumped into Wukenai River

787
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,720
Right?

788
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,400
I was framed by a villain

789
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
I couldn't defend myself

790
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,160
I had no choice

791
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,800
So I jumped into Wukenai River

792
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,760
And who was this villain?

793
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,520
What happened?

794
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,960
I'm completely confused right now

795
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,240
What about Bai Youcai?

796
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,160
Let me

797
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,760
first make a guess

798
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,000
I predict

799
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
he lusted after my sister's beauty

800
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,320
Then he wanted to pursue her

801
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,520
But in the end, he failed

802
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,160
At this point, the young man didn't want to live anymore

803
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,800
Oh my god

804
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,240
Does this make any sense?

805
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
I'm speechless

806
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,320
A brother's heart can understand

807
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,280
So now you...

808
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,800
Still have suicidal thoughts?

809
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,880
Of course not

810
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,960
Now I'm full of sunshine

811
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,040
Yes, full of sunshine

812
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,640
Because he had a crush on my sister

813
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,200
That's right

814
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,840
She gave you hope

815
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,240
Right?

816
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,360
Yes, exactly

817
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,360
You admit it, right?

818
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,120
Yes, I do

819
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,200
I admit it

820
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,920
Then that's settled

821
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,080
I really...

822
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,960
But one thing we can learn is...

823
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
The sister and brother had a good relationship

824
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,440
Of course, naturally

825
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:37,840
Very good

826
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,280
You didn't even know your sister committed suicide

827
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,280
He wasn't there at the time

828
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,600
I am Ning Shaoshuai

829
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,280
I am Ning Shaoshuai

830
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,920
I wasn't there at the time, I went to work

831
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
Working as a bodyguard

832
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,520
As a bodyguard

833
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,880
Then later he saw how good I was at fighting

834
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,560
So he adopted me as his stepson

835
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,920
That's why I'm now called Ning Shaoshuai

836
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,720
Was she your biological sister?

837
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,680
Biological sister

838
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,560
Don't we look alike?

839
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,880
Similar

840
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,720
To be honest, they really do look alike

841
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,320
Right? They have similarly big eyes, don't they?

842
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,480
Impressive

843
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,600
Let me ask something unrelated

844
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,880
Did you really jump into the river?

845
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,680
We did

846
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,360
All of us jumped

847
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,040
Yes, everyone jumped

848
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,560
You went in

849
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,520
Mhm

850
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,360
And you're still alive

851
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,040
Pretty amazing, right?

852
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,280
Next, let's hear from our Bali

853
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,520
begin sharing the evidence

854
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,920
Xiao Ba is still doing the puzzle.

855
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,840
I'm ready

856
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,720
Begin

857
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,920
It's this pile of torn letters

858
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,360
It was found in the Legendary King private room

859
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,680
discovered in the dressing table drawer

860
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,080
What's written here says:

861
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,640
At age ten, you had dreams

862
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,160
Everyone thought you were cute

863
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,240
At twenty, it was still inspiring

864
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,280
At thirty, still chasing dreams

865
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,800
banging your head bloody

866
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
How embarrassing

867
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,080
Turn it over and there's another

868
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,480
self-portrait

869
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,040
Next to the self-portrait there's

870
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,440
an up arrow and down arrow

871
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,040
with a 7 written

872
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,240
and a 3 on the lower body

873
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,520
I think this must be

874
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,080
showing body proportions

875
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,800
These proportions...

876
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,120
Drawn out of insecurity?

877
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,960
I didn't draw it

878
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,080
Someone else drew it

879
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,040
While I was singing there

880
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,400
they just threw it there

881
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,240
to insult me

882
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:54,840
At that time...

883
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,400
To be honest

884
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,200
I was really hurt

885
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,160
Since childhood I've always

886
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,440
loved singing and dancing

887
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,760
Then one day by chance

888
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,440
I came to Tui Town

889
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
and discovered at Tui Music Club

890
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,520
a singer called Pink Phoenix

891
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Inspired by her

892
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,960
I felt that I

893
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,280
should fight for my dreams

894
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,440
give it my all

895
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,080
So I came to Tui Town

896
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,040
performing on the streets

897
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,360
My vocal training methods

898
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,640
people found strange

899
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,600
At first it attracted

900
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,080
many people to come

901
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,840
They all came to watch

902
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,600
But when I actually started singing

903
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
they all ran away

904
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,120
Then suddenly one day

905
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,320
there came

906
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,840
a noble person

907
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,640
who was about

908
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,440
as tall as you three combined

909
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,600
nearly two meters tall

910
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
After they arrived,

911
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,720
they started scolding me,

912
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
saying my singing was off-key,

913
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,480
lower than our doorstep.

914
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,640
They said my singing

915
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,520
was worse than leftovers

916
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,440
from a week ago.

917
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
At that time, I was really... I...

918
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,840
You didn't hit him?

919
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,200
I couldn't beat him.

920
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,080
A 1.9-meter-tall guy - I stood no chance.

921
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,120
So I tried to explain to him,

922
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,200
I asked what's wrong.

923
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,120
I said I'm pursuing my dreams.

924
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,200
What's wrong with that?

925
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,240
Then right then,

926
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,560
he hit me with this line:

927
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,760
"At thirty years old,

928
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,480
if you're still talking about dreams,

929
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,440
and getting yourself battered

930
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,000
chasing those dreams,

931
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,280
you're just pathetic."

932
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,920
I was really

933
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,760
He made me feel utterly ashamed

934
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:00,800
I couldn't take it anymore

935
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,840
So I walked to

936
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,720
the Wukenai River

937
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,520
As I walked

938
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,080
I suddenly plunged into

939
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,960
Do you remember who that person was?

940
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,320
The 1.9-meter-tall suspect, right?

941
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,240
Of course I remember, let me tell you

942
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,240
One of those three

943
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,720
I'd recognize them even if they turned to ashes

944
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,600
Young Marshal He

945
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,640
How could you be like this?

946
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,440
You despicable villain

947
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,240
I can't believe you're this kind of person

948
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,640
To think you'd stoop to such levels

949
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,080
Don't be so quick to blame me

950
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,760
Everyone, don't forget

951
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,000
As I just mentioned

952
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,800
The reason I went to jump into the Wukenai River

953
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,320
was precisely because of Wang Esq.

954
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,480
He's the main culprit

955
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,080
There's a twist

956
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,560
There's one more thing

957
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,080
Found on his sofa

958
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,680
was a record

959
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,440
The performer was Wang Esq.

960
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,400
The cover had a message:

961
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
"Don't care about others' opinions"

962
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,240
"Those who don't even dare to try"

963
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,440
"are the real disgrace"

964
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,560
What's the name of this song?

965
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,640
The light beam turns dark overnight

966
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,280
Read it backwards

967
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Read from right to left

968
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,320
A beam of light in the dark night

969
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,160
Must have lived too earnestly

970
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,760
It's nothing

971
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,920
A beam of light in the dark night

972
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,520
This was your darkest hour

973
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,640
A beam of light in the dark night

974
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,160
And then this

975
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,080
Should we talk about who she is?

976
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,480
Right when I jumped into the river

977
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,960
As I was sinking down

978
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,560
I suddenly felt

979
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,640
A force supporting me

980
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,120
It was the female singer who inspired me

981
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,840
Pink Phoenix

982
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,840
After saving me

983
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,760
She took me in and taught me to sing

984
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,920
We started performing together

985
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,880
And so just like that

986
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,040
I joined the Tui Le Sect

987
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,560
But Master Le

988
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,680
You know he was particularly harsh

989
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,960
He wouldn't pay me

990
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,600
He said Tui Le Sect only recruited women

991
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,880
So Pink Phoenix

992
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,640
She said it was okay

993
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,720
She said she would take

994
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,040
a portion from her own pay for him

995
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,720
So you two were a duo, right?

996
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,600
A musical duo

997
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,720
We were Phoenix Legend

998
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,840
You were Legend

999
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,320
Yes

1000
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,120
She was Phoenix

1001
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,520
Yes

1002
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,240
Actually this song "A Beam of Light in the Dark Night"

1003
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,120
Was something I wanted to write

1004
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,200
I wanted to dedicate it to her

1005
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,520
This song is truly good

1006
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,680
Really great song

1007
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,600
They say it's very popular now

1008
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,280
A beam of light in the dark night

1009
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,000
Illuminating my ash-hearted past

1010
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,960
You taught me to brave forward

1011
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,600
Lent me your gentle shoulder

1012
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,480
Those despairs that once crushed me

1013
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,680
Will ultimately give me strength to soar

1014
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,800
A beam of light in the dark night

1015
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,720
Seems like it's about done

1016
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,680
About done

1017
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,640
You just need to pay attention to that

1018
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,360
You just need to focus on that

1019
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,360
Just pay attention to that

1020
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,200
rhythm

1021
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,520
Just steady it a bit more

1022
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,880
Yes, teacher

1023
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,160
I'll definitely respect the original work

1024
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,200
Mind the rhythm

1025
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,120
Okay

1026
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,160
Still showing good respect for the original singer

1027
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,360
Source text

1028
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,920
Bai Youcai, it's your turn.

1029
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Mine is from Young Marshal He.

1030
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,040
On Young Marshal He's private room table,

1031
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,240
there's a October issue of Tui Town's biggest scoop.

1032
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,800
Tui Town's undisputed "Battle KING".

1033
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,120
Battle KING.

1034
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,720
Battle KING.

1035
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,320
Young Marshal He.

1036
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,080
Tui Town's famously known Battle KING.

1037
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,920
Daily obsessed with street battles,

1038
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,840
challenging all comers.

1039
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,040
Our reporters witnessed three times

1040
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
Young Marshal He's competitive matches

1041
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,640
firsthand.

1042
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,000
Challenge One

1043
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,760
Finish eating longan with mandarin oranges while smiling

1044
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,200
No one has beaten him

1045
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,280
Challenge Two

1046
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,080
After spinning five times

1047
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,000
Who can flick and hit the bottle cap

1048
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,480
No one has beaten him

1049
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,640
Just spin five times

1050
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,560
Then flick that bottle cap with your finger

1051
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,160
This is really hard to hit

1052
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,200
How do you flick it?

1053
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,440
Come on

1054
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,880
Show us how this game works

1055
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,360
I can't, you'll have to ask him

1056
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,800
Alright, watch

1057
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,800
First someone needs to hold the bottle cap

1058
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,440
Then what?

1059
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,280
Look, like this

1060
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,240
You're too high, you need to go lower

1061
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,320
Bend a little

1062
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,560
Yes

1063
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,320
And don't move it away later

1064
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,240
Also aim with one eye

1065
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,320
Four

1066
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,600
Five

1067
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,600
Don't pull your hand back

1068
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,120
Okay, just aim with this one eye

1069
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,360
You can hit it

1070
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,840
How was that?

1071
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,560
Very impressive

1072
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,880
Young Marshal He is really something

1073
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,040
Come on, quick

1074
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,960
Let me do it, watch me

1075
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,040
No

1076
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,120
I can't flick it like this either

1077
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,880
I can't see anything without my glasses

1078
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,640
It's fine

1079
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,480
We can go slower, no need to rush

1080
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,600
One

1081
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,120
Two

1082
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,680
Don't

1083
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,440
I'm so dizzy

1084
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,600
Three

1085
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,040
Four

1086
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,600
Five

1087
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,000
Okay okay okay

1088
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,320
Bro

1089
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,440
Stand straight

1090
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,400
Stand straight

1091
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,840
Oh my

1092
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,200
You okay?

1093
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,680
Quick

1094
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,560
Put it right in front of me

1095
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,320
Let me flick it

1096
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,240
Okay

1097
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,720
Success

1098
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,640
Come on, give me a high-five

1099
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,080
Oh my god

1100
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,520
Four

1101
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:07,840
Five

1102
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,960
This one's faster.

1103
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,200
What's your deal?

1104
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,560
She's a dancer.

1105
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,600
She used to spin a lot.

1106
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,440
She's a dancer.

1107
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,000
That's all she does every day.

1108
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,080
That explains it.

1109
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,120
This Commander He...

1110
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,160
What's your story?

1111
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
How did you...

1112
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,520
How did you come in first?

1113
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,960
Look how they crushed you.

1114
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,680
Let's continue our talk.

1115
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,760
The third challenge...

1116
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,480
was to see who could hide in Tui Town...

1117
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,680
for four months...

1118
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,760
without being found.

1119
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,720
He lost this challenge.

1120
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,480
He only disappeared for twenty days...

1121
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
before being discovered...

1122
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,400
passed out on the street.

1123
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,360
His occipital bone...

1124
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,760
was severely struck...

1125
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,280
causing amnesia.

1126
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,280
So after being hit...

1127
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,200
you got amnesia, right?

1128
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,240
Right.

1129
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,080
Then when I woke up...

1130
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,160
my parents were by my side.

1131
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,040
And after that...

1132
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,080
my mind wasn't right anymore.

1133
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,320
I would occasionally go...

1134
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,480
to Dongnao Hall on the street for treatment...

1135
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,040
but it was never cured.

1136
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,160
I've always wanted to find out who...

1137
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,920
hit me from behind.

1138
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,680
I think that person...

1139
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,960
must have had a grudge against me.

1140
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,240
He's offended too many people.

1141
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,480
Definitely.

1142
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,120
This is me

1143
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,960
during

1144
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,000
an experience before my amnesia

1145
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,880
You remember before the amnesia?

1146
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,080
Later my parents helped me remember

1147
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,880
What if they're lying to you?

1148
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,160
Is it possible he's deceiving you?

1149
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,960
I'm absolutely certain about this

1150
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,360
Because my little brother can vouch for me

1151
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,440
If I knock him out tonight

1152
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,840
And tell him I'm his brother the next day

1153
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,000
He'd believe it

1154
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,560
Couldn't this brother be fake?

1155
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,240
Can you verify for him?

1156
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,560
He looks completely confused

1157
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,960
You remember I'm your brother, right?

1158
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,000
I know you're my brother

1159
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,720
cousin

1160
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,360
Yes, cousin

1161
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,680
We don't share the same parents

1162
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,920
No, you know my parents

1163
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,480
What I mean is

1164
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,960
I know

1165
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,720
them?

1166
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,960
So you can't confirm either

1167
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
whether his later parents

1168
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,200
are actually his parents

1169
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,040
How do you prove

1170
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,960
your parents are your parents?

1171
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,440
Why are you all so hostile toward me?

1172
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,920
Nothing can be done then

1173
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
Fine

1174
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,360
Then I'll continue with another clue

1175
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,320
The second book

1176
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,520
Tui Town's B-King

1177
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,160
Upgraded to Tui Town's

1178
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,240
Number One Mad Lord

1179
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,400
Mad Lord

1180
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,760
Recently Tui Town's top B-King

1181
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,800
Young Marshal He has shown consecutive abnormal behaviors

1182
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,680
His mental state is concerning

1183
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,880
Wang Legend told our reporters

1184
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,440
After his act of bravery

1185
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,280
he suffered from Young Marshal He's

1186
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,760
fierce face-to-face threats

1187
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,120
Young Marshal He choked him with one hand

1188
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,080
and roared loudly

1189
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,400
The detailed conversation follows:

1190
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,280
Show us right now

1191
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,360
Why did you treat me like that?

1192
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,440
Stop pretending.

1193
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,760
I'm standing straight now.

1194
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

1195
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,480
Seeing is believing.

1196
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,000
Are you having an episode?

1197
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,920
I'm perfectly lucid.

1198
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,520
I just want an answer.

1199
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,240
Bitter truth is still truth.

1200
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,360
Why would you do this to me?

1201
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,000
What if you really did kill someone?

1202
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,640
The logic is that he

1203
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,840
claims to have killed someone

1204
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,280
At that time I went to our

1205
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,200
Brain Hall in Tui Town

1206
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,960
to see the hall leader for brain treatment

1207
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,720
I waited for a long time

1208
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,800
but never got to see the hall leader

1209
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,040
so I left

1210
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,520
Right after I returned

1211
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,080
I was arrested by the patrol officers

1212
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,080
and detained for five days

1213
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,960
They told me

1214
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,720
that the hall leader of Brain Hall

1215
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,800
was murdered in the clinic

1216
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,640
Then they explained why they arrested me

1217
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,680
A man named Wang Chuanshuo

1218
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,840
Here's what happened

1219
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,440
That afternoon I went to get medicine

1220
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,400
I saw

1221
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,720
Young Marshal He

1222
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,400
enter the old hall leader's consultation room

1223
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,640
After getting my medicine

1224
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,960
I thought I'd greet the old hall leader

1225
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,480
But when I

1226
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,240
entered the consultation room

1227
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
found the old hall leader already dead

1228
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,600
Can't you see it's obviously fake?

1229
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,440
Right?

1230
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,600
Although I'm genuinely afraid of him

1231
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,800
But in this matter

1232
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,280
I believe

1233
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,200
Human lives are at stake

1234
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,920
Are you kidding me?

1235
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,800
Why would you still be afraid of me?

1236
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,560
Of course I'm afraid of you

1237
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,000
Now I have neither fame nor status

1238
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,040
It's true you have no fame or status

1239
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,360
But you're 1.9 meters tall

1240
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,280
The issue is 70-30

1241
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,560
70-80

1242
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,320
No, I said 70-30 split, bro

1243
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,840
Sorry

1244
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,160
I was saying why was I reduced to

1245
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,920
1.73 meters

1246
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,240
No, bro

1247
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,640
That's not

1248
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,200
Didn't you just say

1249
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,240
You didn't see the hall leader

1250
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,920
I truly didn't see him

1251
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,880
I saw him go in

1252
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,400
Then where did the old hall leader die

1253
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,800
Right inside the consultation room

1254
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,840
Inside the consultation room

1255
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,920
I told you I saw at that time

1256
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,200
Only he went in

1257
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,920
I waited for him in the room but I

1258
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,120
Never saw the old hall leader from start to finish

1259
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,760
He's lying

1260
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,960
Because when I entered I saw

1261
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,120
The old hall leader dead there

1262
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,800
I really didn't see the hall leader

1263
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,560
No one went in

1264
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,080
This is all your

1265
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,200
One-sided story

1266
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,800
You can say it's my one-sided story

1267
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,240
I just provided the police

1268
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,280
With what I witnessed

1269
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,440
Just provided what I witnessed

1270
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,760
Your statements don't match up right now.

1271
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,920
There must be something missing

1272
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,320
in the chain of information.

1273
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:14,640
Several possibilities:

1274
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,240
Three possibilities:

1275
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,880
First, one of them is lying.

1276
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,920
Second possibility - he's sick.

1277
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,960
He went in but doesn't remember.

1278
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,120
He went crazy, right?

1279
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,520
Isn't he mentally unwell?

1280
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,520
Third possibility is

1281
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,040
there's another person -

1282
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,760
he's actually two people.

1283
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,880
This is just my random thought.

1284
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,520
Yes, exactly.

1285
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,080
Like twins or something.

1286
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,600
I think so too, yes.

1287
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,520
So you were framed by him,

1288
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,400
accused of murder,

1289
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,200
which made you jump into the river.

1290
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,000
Is that the sequence?

1291
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,840
Because of him,

1292
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,200
I was condemned

1293
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,400
by everyone.

1294
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:39,840
Right.

1295
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,240
Even dogs cursed him.

1296
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,840
Every person on the street,

1297
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,960
every single dog,

1298
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,400
said you were the killer.

1299
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,280
How did...

1300
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,040
How did they say it?

1301
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,440
I want to hear how dogs talk.

1302
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:52,960
The murderer

1303
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:53,920
Yes

1304
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
And even

1305
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,680
I was even kicked out of my home by my parents

1306
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,480
Okay

1307
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,200
Yes

1308
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,720
Then why didn't your suicide succeed?

1309
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,840
It's related to this

1310
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,640
"A Light in the Darkness," right?

1311
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,840
This song became so popular

1312
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,160
She said don't let the innocent harm themselves

1313
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,800
You never need to prove your innocence

1314
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,400
As long as you live, there's hope

1315
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,600
Who is this "she"?

1316
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,280
When I jumped into the river in despair

1317
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,680
She pulled me out of the water

1318
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,360
Just as I was near death

1319
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,040
She appeared like a beam of light

1320
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,560
And became my hope to live

1321
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,360
She was the light in your darkness

1322
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:45,960
Right?

1323
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,640
Yes

1324
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,000
In the end, it was that person who saved me

1325
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,880
And took me in

1326
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,960
So I've been working for her ever since

1327
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,760
Yes

1328
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,120
It was your sister, Xiao Ba

1329
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,960
You saved him

1330
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,680
So now I have a brother-in-law, right?

1331
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,240
No

1332
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,880
Yes, you saved him (Young Marshal He)

1333
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,960
She (Xiao Ba) saved me

1334
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,840
Gave me hope to live

1335
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,440
And she took care of me afterward

1336
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,520
Because I was disowned by my parents

1337
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,600
I'm no longer the young marshal

1338
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,880
Was it you who saved him?

1339
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,840
No

1340
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,960
I never saved him

1341
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,000
It was by the riverbank

1342
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,200
I saw him lying there

1343
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,800
I saw him lying there

1344
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,480
So I brought him to

1345
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,840
my tailor shop

1346
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,560
When I was in the water

1347
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,120
there was a hand

1348
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,080
that pulled me out

1349
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,080
After being pulled out

1350
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,000
I was left on the bank

1351
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,120
Now the truth is clear

1352
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,960
Actually it wasn't my sister who saved you

1353
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,720
You just happened to find him

1354
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,600
by the river

1355
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,200
You took him in

1356
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,440
Right, he was asleep by the river

1357
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,920
So you thought she saved you

1358
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,160
Right?

1359
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,520
Yes

1360
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,240
You claim no connection with Master Le

1361
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,040
But here we have

1362
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,000
a bloody bracelet

1363
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
and also Master Le's

1364
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,640
drawing with an X mark

1365
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,960
What does this mean?

1366
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,240
You silenced a witness

1367
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,160
To be honest,

1368
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,240
Three days ago in the lobby,

1369
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,560
I saw Bali looking very panicked.

1370
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,200
I became very worried about her.

1371
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,400
So I followed her

1372
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,600
to her private room.

1373
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,280
After she left,

1374
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,520
I discovered

1375
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,720
a bloodstained handkerchief

1376
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,360
wrapping a bloodied bracelet.

1377
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,040
I wanted to know why it was bloodstained -

1378
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,160
was Bali injured

1379
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,800
or something else.

1380
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,760
I asked around about the bracelet

1381
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,880
to find out the truth.

1382
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,080
What I learned was

1383
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,800
Master Le said the bracelet's owner

1384
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,600
was his enemy.

1385
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,800
Master Le wanted to eliminate them.

1386
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,480
So,

1387
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,160
since Bali had the bracelet,

1388
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,440
could the person Master Le wants to kill

1389
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,360
possibly be Bali?

1390
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,840
Could Bali be in danger?

1391
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,720
You wanted to hide this

1392
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,880
to protect -

1393
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,920
to protect Bali.

1394
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,160
So actually from that moment,

1395
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,120
I developed

1396
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,360
murderous intent

1397
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,960
but didn't act on it.

1398
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,480
How can you prove you didn't act?

1399
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,680
Here's our evidence against Commander He

1400
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,560
All my evidence points to Bai Youcai

1401
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,960
The first piece of evidence is

1402
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,840
numerous pawn tickets

1403
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,800
found in Bai Youcai's private room behind the coat rack

1404
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,680
inside a suitcase

1405
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
Pawned items include Granny Wang's melons

1406
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,640
Qiangqiang's fish

1407
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,840
Brother Cheng's gold tooth

1408
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,760
Dou E's cooking pot

1409
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,880
Granny Rong's needles

1410
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,280
Granny Rong

1411
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,800
Where did all these come from?

1412
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,280
These were all given to me by these people

1413
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,240
So let me explain

1414
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,920
I was born into a

1415
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,160
family with modest means

1416
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,960
When I was young, my mother

1417
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,880
consulted a scholar

1418
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,120
consulted a scholar

1419
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,360
who gave me the name Bai Youcai

1420
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,480
Your family name is a bit troublesome

1421
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,240
Doesn’t matter

1422
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,320
Growing up, I went through these things

1423
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,760
The people around me

1424
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,560
The people around me

1425
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,880
all said I must be exceptional

1426
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,440
a prodigy or something

1427
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,120
And then

1428
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,080
I got admitted to the prestigious academy in Tuishi

1429
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,840
But since my family wasn’t well-off

1430
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,640
the folks in my hometown

1431
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,360
supported me with some resources

1432
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
which I then exchanged

1433
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,960
for money

1434
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,120
to pay for my studies

1435
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,720
There’s also proof

1436
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,320
a piece of cloth

1437
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,760
with words written on it

1438
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,880
"Dock"

1439
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Why do I have this towel?

1440
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,520
Did you work there?

1441
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,480
Yes, that's right.

1442
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
When I stepped out

1443
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,520
into this vast world,

1444
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,520
I realized that

1445
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,240
I simply couldn't learn anymore.

1446
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,160
No matter how hard I tried,

1447
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,640
I couldn't manage

1448
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,080
to be as good

1449
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,240
as I was before.

1450
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,120
I could only carry sacks

1451
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,000
to earn money.

1452
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,240
He was working at that dock

1453
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,520
I happened to run into him

1454
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,600
I could hardly believe it

1455
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,240
Then I immediately told him

1456
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,960
I said you can't do this

1457
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,920
You worked so hard to get into university

1458
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,400
And everyone had

1459
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,720
Placed such high expectations on him

1460
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,200
So I tried to motivate him

1461
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:54,960
But as I kept talking

1462
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,560
I noticed that he

1463
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,360
Seemed to be

1464
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,560
Deeply affected by my words

1465
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,520
You're lying

1466
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,680
That's not what happened

1467
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,920
He said Bai Youcai

1468
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,480
He said Bai Youcai

1469
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,880
You're unworthy of your name

1470
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,120
A disappointment to your parents

1471
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,840
And to everyone back home

1472
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,960
After we gave our savings

1473
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,240
To crowdfund your tuition

1474
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,200
I admit that at the time

1475
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,360
I got carried away

1476
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,000
Because he completely

1477
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,840
Rejected you

1478
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,520
After your harsh criticism

1479
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,080
I decided to jump in the river

1480
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,760
Really

1481
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,160
I'm truly sorry

1482
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,440
I was just trying to

1483
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,360
You know, give you a push

1484
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,320
But that doesn't matter now

1485
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,240
I don't blame you

1486
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:32,880
Fine then

1487
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,680
I do blame you

1488
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,800
The next piece of evidence

1489
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,240
is this record.

1490
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,760
These words are what she said to me

1491
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,760
after saving me.

1492
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,520
Who is this "she"?

1493
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,080
After I was rescued,

1494
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,640
I turned around and saw

1495
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,520
a drenched young woman

1496
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,400
walking away.

1497
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,120
Then I secretly followed her

1498
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,480
and discovered she was

1499
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,520
Ba Ye.

1500
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,160
Ba Ye.

1501
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,960
Ba Li.

1502
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,240
Ba Li.

1503
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,160
Yes.

1504
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,640
It was Ba Li.

1505
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,840
Ba Li saved me.

1506
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,600
No, I never saved him.

1507
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,120
Another self-deluded young man

1508
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:26,920
Never could have imagined

1509
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,440
Turns out I was the deluded one

1510
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,160
This is where it gets interesting

1511
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,160
And the most crucial one

1512
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,720
The fourth piece of evidence

1513
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,760
is a bloodstained missing person notice

1514
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,200
The person was dressed strangely

1515
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,720
wearing a sunflower-shaped

1516
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,040
accessory as shown here

1517
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,840
This brooch is also

1518
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,600
right here

1519
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,600
It's a bloodstained brooch

1520
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,280
This woman is extremely dangerous

1521
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,160
She's a sworn enemy of our Tuile Sect

1522
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,080
If you see her

1523
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,320
contact me immediately

1524
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,240
with generous rewards

1525
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,160
Master Le

1526
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,840
The notice also stated

1527
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,440
We must never let Master Le discover the brooch

1528
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,320
actually belongs to her

1529
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,080
So this brooch

1530
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,080
was indeed the one she wore

1531
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,600
And on

1532
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,640
the 30th

1533
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,120
Tuile Sect's security asked me

1534
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,160
if I'd seen

1535
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,640
someone like this

1536
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,640
I said no

1537
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,000
He said she's our sect's enemy

1538
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,400
and I should report immediately

1539
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,680
I agreed

1540
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,240
Then

1541
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,080
when I entered Bali's room

1542
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,760
I saw a handkerchief

1543
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,160
with bloodstains

1544
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,440
When I opened it

1545
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,240
I found the sunflower brooch

1546
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,160
I thought

1547
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,440
Bali was Tuile Sect's enemy

1548
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,760
Because in my heart

1549
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,440
she was my lifesaver

1550
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,920
She was also

1551
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,560
a light in my darkness

1552
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,600
Yes, I had to protect her

1553
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,640
So I took

1554
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,360
this item away

1555
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:54,880
I see

1556
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,960
To protect her, right?

1557
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,200
Yes

1558
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,200
I want to eliminate him (Master Le)

1559
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,160
Next up, we're the Legendary Brothers

1560
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,560
Right

1561
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,040
Come on

1562
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,120
I have a closing notice here

1563
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,880
Tailor Shop Closure Notice

1564
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,680
Dear Customers,

1565
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,920
We regret to announce

1566
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,760
that our tailor shop

1567
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,760
which operated for just one year

1568
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,400
has decided to close

1569
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,760
effective immediately.

1570
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,920
Bali's Stall Clearance Sale

1571
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,960
Long tops with short bottoms

1572
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,200
Custom-made outfits

1573
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,120
See? Made just for you

1574
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,000
This was made for me?

1575
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,880
Exactly!

1576
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,360
Here's another

1577
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,680
Bali Tailor Shop Closure Notice

1578
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,320
Dear Customers,

1579
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,720
Bali Tailor Shop

1580
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,880
which operated for just one month

1581
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,520
has decided to close due to force majeure

1582
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,960
effective immediately.

1583
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,200
Can you explain what's going on?

1584
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,400
From the very beginning,

1585
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,000
I've always been extremely unlucky

1586
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,720
Everything I do

1587
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,440
somehow turns out bad

1588
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,040
without fail.

1589
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,240
My first shop

1590
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,960
was recommended by my brother

1591
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,120
didn't last long

1592
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,640
before going bankrupt.

1593
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,560
Seeing how depressed I was

1594
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,560
during that period,

1595
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,720
he opened another shop for me.

1596
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,960
Then the shop next door caught fire

1597
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,480
and mine burned down too,

1598
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,800
so I had to close again.

1599
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,600
Then I went to the entrance of the Phoenix Nightclub

1600
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,160
because there was more foot traffic there

1601
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,720
So I set up my stall there

1602
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,920
And then I met you

1603
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,560
You thought my designs were great

1604
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,400
I thought your songs were wonderful

1605
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,280
Then the two of us

1606
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,280
After complimenting each other

1607
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,560
I said I could make you a custom outfit

1608
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,280
You agreed

1609
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,760
We exchanged payment and goods on the spot

1610
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,400
Then I went back and worked hard for a week

1611
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,640
Specially crafting

1612
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,120
an outfit for you

1613
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,000
But then you disappeared

1614
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,240
Another failure

1615
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,720
So these three experiences

1616
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,080
summarize the unfortunate first half

1617
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,280
of my life

1618
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,680
Next is

1619
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,480
On the shelf in the Bali private room

1620
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,760
a notebook was found

1621
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,680
There were obvious bloodstains on the notebook

1622
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,640
The front pages were filled with her design sketches

1623
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,000
Very beautiful

1624
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,240
Look, so beautiful and stylish

1625
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,400
All of them are stylish

1626
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,880
At the end there's a passage

1627
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,880
Probably her business plan

1628
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,840
Create a striking brand name

1629
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,000
Then organize a fashion week

1630
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,200
Hire beautiful models

1631
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,640
This was February 1923

1632
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,040
Written at Tuilao Hui

1633
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,120
How could you be at Tuilao Hui?

1634
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,200
During that time

1635
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,400
I was backstage at Tuile Men

1636
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,480
Mending clothes for singers

1637
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,920
Doing alterations for them

1638
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,160
But I wanted to go to

1639
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,840
a bigger stage

1640
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,600
Tuilao Hui was

1641
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,280
a bigger stage than Tuile Men

1642
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,080
So I told Master Le

1643
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,320
I asked if I could go to Tuilao Hui

1644
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,880
to work as a tailor

1645
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,840
Then on February 5, 1923

1646
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,040
Master Le took me to

1647
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,680
the premium room on Tuile Men's second floor

1648
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,720
He told me to wait there

1649
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,400
for the owner of Tuilao Hui

1650
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,520
I waited for several hours

1651
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,000
Eventually I fell asleep

1652
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,960
When I woke up

1653
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,200
that room

1654
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,840
was no longer the one

1655
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,000
I fell asleep in

1656
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,960
It had become an extremely luxurious room

1657
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,800
I had arrived at Tuilao Hui

1658
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,960
Then after a while, someone arrived

1659
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,600
He was wearing a mask

1660
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,880
He didn’t tell me his name

1661
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,800
or his identity

1662
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,960
I just assumed he must be

1663
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,880
the owner of Tui Lao Hui

1664
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,360
He brought me some

1665
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,040
exceptionally beautiful

1666
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,960
clothes I’d never seen before

1667
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,880
For the first three days, I even took notes

1668
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,200
I listened to what he told me

1669
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,000
about how to grow and strengthen my brand

1670
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,080
But by the fourth day

1671
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,640
I woke up in Dong Nao Tang

1672
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,400
Then on the third day,

1673
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,120
when you stayed at Tui Lao Hui,

1674
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,400
were you conscious?

1675
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,160
I should have been conscious,

1676
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,320
because I was still taking notes.

1677
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,640
I listened to what that person told me,

1678
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,960
and I communicated with them.

1679
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,000
Then on the fourth day,

1680
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,480
I woke up at Dong Nao Tang.

1681
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,600
I didn't know what had happened.

1682
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,080
Then I saw

1683
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,640
Yue standing nearby.

1684
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,120
He told me

1685
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,440
that Tui Lao Hui

1686
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,040
had been robbed,

1687
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,760
and I'd been stabbed.

1688
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,320
You were stabbed?

1689
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:53,880
Yes.

1690
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,920
Can you confirm that blood

1691
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,400
on the notebook is yours?

1692
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,720
Then you wanted to jump into the river, right?

1693
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,000
I just felt like

1694
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
everything I do

1695
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
never turns out well.

1696
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,720
And I always

1697
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,200
bring trouble to those around me.

1698
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,680
I just bring

1699
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,160
bad luck to others.

1700
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,040
Can't see any dreams

1701
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,880
so I thought there wasn't much

1702
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,560
reason to keep living.

1703
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,640
On the day I tried to jump,

1704
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,320
walking by that helpless river,

1705
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:30,840
I was walking,

1706
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,600
thinking about

1707
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,760
how I should

1708
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,000
say goodbye to this world.

1709
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,120
Wanting to leave this world

1710
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,680
is easy to imagine,

1711
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,320
but when the moment comes,

1712
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,720
you still think about many things.

1713
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,960
So as I walked there,

1714
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,560
misfortune struck again -

1715
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,520
I stepped on a banana peel,

1716
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,680
and slipped.

1717
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,160
So unlucky.

1718
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,640
Just my luck.

1719
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,600
Who saved you?

1720
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,480
Yes, the most crucial thing is who saved you?

1721
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,240
Because when you sink to the bottom,

1722
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,680
you'll have a period of unconsciousness.

1723
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,680
You can only vaguely

1724
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,760
sense some things.

1725
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,160
I saw this bracelet

1726
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,280
and this brooch.

1727
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,280
Then I was rescued

1728
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:13,880
by a girl.

1729
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,520
So this sunflower brooch

1730
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,520
and sunflower bracelet

1731
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,440
belong to that girl.

1732
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,680
Yes.

1733
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,800
She's our real savior.

1734
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,680
When that woman saved you,

1735
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,960
did she say anything to you?

1736
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,440
This girl told me:

1737
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,240
"Bad things

1738
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,280
always bring some good lessons.

1739
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:33,960
Don't always

1740
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,320
hold onto those bad feelings

1741
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,480
while expecting

1742
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,640
the good things that will eventually come.

1743
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,120
As long as you're alive, there will be opportunities."

1744
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,800
Is it possible that this woman is

1745
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,320
Fenghuang

1746
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,120
It's possible

1747
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,960
Xiao Ba has a point

1748
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,480
Does everyone remember

1749
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,760
on that ledger

1750
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,160
what the half-cross she marked means

1751
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,640
Xiao Ba is a special one.

1752
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,560
Brother Legend, what do you think

1753
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,440
who is the most suspicious right now?

1754
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,320
At present,

1755
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,640
you still think of me

1756
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,760
as your sworn enemy.

1757
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,280
A single insult breeds lifelong hatred

1758
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,960
Even the rumored motive for murder

1759
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,760
remains unclear

1760
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,720
His relationship with Master Le

1761
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,920
is still not fully understood

1762
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,200
There's also a key figure—Pink Phoenix

1763
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,760
That one's absolutely crucial

1764
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,400
That's the most crucial story.

1765
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,040
Right, who do you think it is?

1766
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:44,880
What about Xiao Ba?

1767
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,400
Legend.

1768
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:47,840
Yes.

1769
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,800
Wang Esq.'s legend.

1770
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,280
Why?

1771
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,720
A woman's intuition.

1772
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,520
The rest of us seem relatively like good people.

1773
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,480
You know what?

1774
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,400
So now we've confirmed

1775
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,760
their motives for murder.

1776
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,680
Their motives for murder

1777
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,360
still don't exist.

1778
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,640
Next we'll enter the X confirmation phase

1779
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,760
In this season's show

1780
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,200
The player who is the murderer

1781
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,240
will face X's challenge

1782
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,360
If the actual murderer player

1783
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,080
succeeds in the challenge

1784
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,200
they can choose between the two detectives

1785
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
to corrupt one of them

1786
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,640
Only you will know

1787
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,760
whether you've been corrupted or not

1788
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,960
We'll definitely know

1789
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,160
who the bad one is between us

1790
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,680
If he's corrupted and I'm not

1791
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,200
No

1792
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,120
It's possible X's challenge wasn't completed

1793
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,480
We don't even know who the murderer is, who should we help?

1794
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,640
Brother Ning

1795
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,000
Was Brother Ning hacked?

1796
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,480
The move you've made

1797
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,040
What's up?

1798
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,640
What's up, young man?

1799
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,800
You seem so happy.

1800
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,960
Don't look at me like that.

1801
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,960
I'm really fine.

1802
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,640
Don't tell us whether you're fine or not.

1803
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,200
We'll judge that ourselves.

1804
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,040
I'm fine.

1805
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,840
I'm really okay.

1806
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,800
Currently, regarding Wang Chuanshuo...

1807
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,720
and Bali's motive for murder...

1808
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,840
we haven't found them yet.

1809
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,080
So next we need to...

1810
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,280
search both of their dressing rooms.

1811
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,360
Conduct a search.

1812
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,200
Next we'll...

1813
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,480
start with Wang Chuanshuo.

1814
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,440
Okay.

1815
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,360
Take us to your room.

1816
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,320
Come on in, welcome.

1817
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:26,520
Let's go.

1818
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,440
The singer's room.

1819
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,480
Why is this door so small?

1820
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:30,480
No.

1821
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,880
This is my dressing room.

1822
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,600
I usually get ready here.

1823
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,720
After all, I am...

1824
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,520
the only male star in our Tui Le Men.

1825
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,640
Is this the Pink Phoenix?

1826
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,160
Yes, the Pink Phoenix.

1827
01:13:59,400 --> 01:13:59,840
Here.

1828
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,440
[Source text]

1829
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,040
[Source text]

1830
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,840
There doesn't seem to be anything in the clothes.

1831
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,320
Nothing in the clothes.

1832
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,120
Nothing here

1833
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,360
That's all there is

1834
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,600
No way

1835
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,360
26 27 28

1836
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,160
30

1837
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,000
29

1838
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,640
31

1839
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,920
1 This is Qi's

1840
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,840
Everyone, look at this

1841
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,360
Your partner

1842
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,240
On the surface, was sent by Le Ye

1843
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,480
to join Tui Lao Hui

1844
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,040
But in reality, Le Ye

1845
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,040
sent him on a path of no return

1846
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,000
You must be careful with Master Le

1847
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,280
He's the mastermind behind it all

1848
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,680
February 7, 1923

1849
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,480
A kind-hearted person

1850
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,000
Do you know who this kind person was?

1851
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,400
I truly don't know

1852
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,920
It happened suddenly on February 7th

1853
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,120
Right after I returned from my performance

1854
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,320
That's when I discovered this

1855
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,800
Pink Phoenix left

1856
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,200
on January 30, 1923

1857
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,200
suddenly without saying goodbye

1858
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,640
Then I went to find Brother Le

1859
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,360
Brother Le told me

1860
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,040
he had met someone

1861
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,640
called the Mysterious Recommender

1862
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,200
and directly recommended her to

1863
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,720
the Recommender's Guild

1864
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,880
Then Brother Le told me

1865
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
that this was Pink Phoenix's

1866
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,800
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

1867
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,120
[Source text]

1868
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,240
You absolutely must not go looking for her

1869
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,520
After all these years in the Recommender's Gate

1870
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,400
don't you know what

1871
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,720
the Recommender's Guild is like?

1872
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,960
I only know it's where

1873
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,960
actors ascend to

1874
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,480
But since I've never been there

1875
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,480
and... right

1876
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,400
you don't know what kind of place it is either, right?

1877
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:00,920
I don't know

1878
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,400
I truly don't know

1879
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,520
What is this thing?

1880
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,080
Phoenix

1881
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,840
Pink Phoenix

1882
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,000
Where did this come from?

1883
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,560
Speaking of this...

1884
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,160
It pains my heart.

1885
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,600
This was something I gave to Pink Phoenix.

1886
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,200
You gave it to her?

1887
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,720
I gave it to Pink Phoenix.

1888
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,200
But when this was discovered...

1889
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,040
It was actually...

1890
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,280
On the evening of January 30th,

1891
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,920
when I went to see Master Le,

1892
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,960
I saw a servant sweeping there,

1893
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,160
and this was on the ground.

1894
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,880
This blood-stained hair ornament of Pink Phoenix.

1895
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,040
When I held this ornament,

1896
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,440
I was completely stunned.

1897
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,840
Because Pink Phoenix...

1898
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,320
would never take this off.

1899
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,760
And how could it appear in...

1900
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,480
Master Le's room?

1901
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,960
What's more, there was...

1902
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,560
so much blood on it.

1903
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:15,520
I immediately...

1904
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,360
took that letter...

1905
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,480
that kind stranger wrote to me,

1906
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,720
and connected the dots.

1907
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,680
I thought to myself...

1908
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,840
Why didn't I...

1909
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,280
take that letter seriously?

1910
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,800
Your partner...

1911
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,520
was sent by Master Le on a...

1912
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,840
path of no return.

1913
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,080
Did you ask Master Le about it?

1914
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,040
After I went to see Master Le,

1915
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,960
he just dismissed me...

1916
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,880
with a few casual words.

1917
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,160
So you want to kill him

1918
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,280
When I saw this,

1919
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,520
I realized I needed to

1920
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,400
remain calm.

1921
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,680
I couldn't let

1922
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,480
Le Ye notice any

1923
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,240
clues.

1924
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,600
So I suppressed all my anger,

1925
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,960
thinking about how to deal with him.

1926
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,320
So you killed him?

1927
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,640
No

1928
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,920
I didn't make it

1929
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,160
We've got the murder motive now, right?

1930
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,280
He thought Boss Le killed Fenghuang.

1931
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:29,960
Right.

1932
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,840
Alright.

1933
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,200
Then let's head to Xiao Ba's room next.

1934
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:37,680
Okay, let's go.

1935
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,360
Xiao Ba.

1936
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,880
Xiao Ba's room.

1937
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,960
Xiao Ba has lots of clothes here.

1938
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,600
Xiao Ba has name brands here.

1939
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,600
How many of these brands are there?

1940
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,880
January 26th

1941
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,640
January 27th

1942
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,680
January 28th

1943
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,760
29th, 30th, 31st

1944
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,800
The 1st is complete.

1945
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,640
Put the complete ones over there.

1946
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,560
For Young Marshal He

1947
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,880
For Young Marshal He

1948
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:41,640
Open it yourself

1949
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,480
Someone gave this to you

1950
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,600
It's for you

1951
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,720
It's for Commander He

1952
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,400
Heartbroken?

1953
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,760
Why would I be heartbroken?

1954
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,360
She's not my savior

1955
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,240
You change your heart too fast, you man

1956
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,640
Stopped loving her so quickly?

1957
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,800
I only love those who save me

1958
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,840
Stop pretending to be calm

1959
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,080
Bai Youcai

1960
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,200
Don't pretend to be calm

1961
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,400
Melon seeds can't hide

1962
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,120
The pain you're feeling inside now

1963
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,560
Get into character, cry a bucket first

1964
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,800
Sad

1965
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,400
Give me a melon seed

1966
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,560
Now's not the time

1967
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,680
We're just spectators

1968
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,480
Want some melon seeds?

1969
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,320
This is a bit violent

1970
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,200
You're too violent

1971
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,920
Don't appreciate

1972
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,120
The valuable gift

1973
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,800
What nonsense

1974
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,640
Brain Exercise Hall

1975
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,800
Good brains specialize in treating

1976
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,800
brain injuries from trauma

1977
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:33,920
Headache

1978
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,240
She knows you got hit

1979
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,920
I was the one who hit you with that stick.

1980
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,640
Here's what happened.

1981
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,800
I was going through a particularly unlucky period back then.

1982
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,400
I felt like someone...

1983
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,640
was following me from behind.

1984
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,200
And acting very suspiciously.

1985
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,720
Then you hit me with a stick.

1986
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,480
I thought this person had bad intentions.

1987
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,040
So I approached you from behind...

1988
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,280
and struck you with a stick.

1989
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,240
Were you actually following her at that time?

1990
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,480
I was in the KING competition...

1991
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,080
which was about...

1992
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,800
who could go four months...

1993
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,880
without being detected.

1994
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,920
While I admit I used to be a troublemaker...

1995
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,960
I wouldn't go so far as to...

1996
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,920
stalk people, right?

1997
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,040
Stalk people, right?

1998
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,360
Hard to say.

1999
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,200
These things...

2000
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,280
are hard to judge.

2001
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,920
Hitting him then was completely justified.

2002
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,600
He deserved it.

2003
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,600
He had it coming.

2004
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:42,840
And then later,

2005
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,760
I saw you lying by the riverbank.

2006
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,200
Didn't you recognize me?

2007
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,600
Yes, I did recognize you.

2008
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,840
Then I called out to you,

2009
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,720
I said "Wake up,"

2010
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,320
"What's wrong with you?"

2011
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:51,880
"What are you doing here?"

2012
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,920
But then you didn't remember me.

2013
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,280
Later you told me

2014
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,000
you were homeless,

2015
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,280
that's why you were sleeping there.

2016
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,880
So I thought I should take you in,

2017
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,440
since it was me who hit you and made you dumb.

2018
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,800
Then I even went to Dongnao Hall

2019
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,680
to buy medicine for you.

2020
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,240
So as a gift,

2021
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,400
it was my apology.

2022
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,120
Why didn't I give it to you?

2023
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,600
I hadn't given it yet when all this happened.

2024
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,080
I thought after this show,

2025
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,240
I would confess to him,

2026
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,200
tell him

2027
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,040
that it was me who hit you with that stick.

2028
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,480
Alright.

2029
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,320
Come on, what else is there?

2030
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,400
Let's look again, is there more?

2031
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,680
What else could there be?

2032
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,840
This is a comic

2033
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,800
A girl with two little boys beside her

2034
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:46,720
That little girl was me

2035
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,000
This drawing shows

2036
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,960
when I was little

2037
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,920
visiting Tuilemen for fun

2038
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:53,880
Going up to the second floor

2039
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:55,920
and there,

2040
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,960
I met a

2041
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,960
boy about my age

2042
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,160
He spoke by

2043
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,400
uttering words in four-character phrases

2044
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,200
This kid—

2045
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,040
he spoke

2046
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,640
in rigid four-word chunks

2047
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,520
"How sad..."

2048
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,520
"Don’t be like this..."

2049
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,240
"Too terrifying..."

2050
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,480
"Bai..."

2051
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,080
"Bai..."

2052
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,600
Your way of speaking is quite distinctive

2053
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,760
Always in four-character phrases

2054
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,160
Bai

2055
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,040
He always speaks in four-character phrases

2056
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:29,960
Everything in four-character phrases

2057
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,840
So he was one of them

2058
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,800
One of the boys who played with you

2059
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,560
Then who was the other one?

2060
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,280
He liked to sit with crossed legs

2061
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,200
So we gave him a nickname

2062
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,040
Called "Cross-legged Boy"

2063
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:37,960
Me

2064
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,800
Me

2065
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,320
Yes

2066
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,520
Really

2067
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,520
You're Cross-legged Boy

2068
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,240
Yes

2069
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,760
The three of you knew each other since childhood

2070
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,040
But I don't remember this at all

2071
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,480
Back then

2072
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,760
While playing, we ended up

2073
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,800
Next to the upper house

2074
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,680
He (Cross-legged Boy) at the time

2075
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:55,840
Taught us

2076
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,040
A new game

2077
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,040
Called "Radish Squat"

2078
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,680
Later we wanted to leave but couldn't open the door

2079
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,640
We got really scared

2080
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,480
Then cried in despair

2081
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,520
And fell asleep

2082
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,720
While we were sleeping

2083
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,320
We heard a very soft

2084
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,000
Gentle female voice

2085
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,640
It was the same voice

2086
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,520
I heard when I accidentally fell into the river

2087
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,400
That I heard

2088
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,760
Miss Sunflower's voice

2089
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,240
Did you write this line yourself?

2090
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,280
As long as you're alive, there's a chance.

2091
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,240
I was the one who remembered her words.

2092
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,200
It was when I was in the river (that I heard it).

2093
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:27,600
These were the words of Miss Sunflower.

2094
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,480
These were the words of Miss Sunflower.

2095
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,720
Each of you said...

2096
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,760
When you were pulled up...

2097
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,240
The person who saved you...

2098
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,880
They all said something encouraging, didn't they?

2099
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:38,440
Right.

2100
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,840
The one who said, "As long as you're alive, there's a chance"...

2101
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,840
Those were Miss Sunflower's words.

2102
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,040
So the one who saved the three of you...

2103
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,200
Was Miss Sunflower.

2104
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,640
Then this

2105
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,640
What is this?

2106
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,560
What's going on?

2107
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,240
Two handkerchiefs?

2108
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,280
Why is there blood on them?

2109
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,840
These handkerchiefs were...

2110
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,240
On January 30th,

2111
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,840
when I went to Master Le's room.

2112
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:17,120
I found a brooch and bracelet there,

2113
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,880
so I used my two handkerchiefs

2114
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,080
to wrap them up

2115
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,680
and put them in this box.

2116
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,640
But when I returned,

2117
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,400
the evidence inside - the bracelet and brooch -

2118
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,360
were already gone.

2119
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,640
The one I was looking for -

2120
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,920
the sunflower one, right? (evidence)

2121
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,560
Yes.

2122
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,640
So you think

2123
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:35,760
Master Le killed her?

2124
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,080
Yes.

2125
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,360
Because Master Le's

2126
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,600
possessions in his room

2127
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,320
made me suspect

2128
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,800
if it's possible that

2129
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,000
Master Le killed that girl.

2130
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,800
I believe

2131
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,000
that girl saved me once,

2132
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,120
I've always considered her my savior.

2133
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,080
So you wanted to kill Master Le too?

2134
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:55,720
Yes.

2135
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,280
I believe you

2136
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:02,840
I believe you

2137
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,120
I believe you

2138
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,040
First, she's my sister

2139
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:06,520
That's the first point

2140
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,760
This is me maintaining my character

2141
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,280
That's the first point

2142
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,440
Second, what she's saying

2143
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,720
makes perfect sense

2144
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,680
You bastard

2145
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,360
What are you doing here?

2146
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,080
Trying to confuse everyone

2147
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,840
She's my sister, I have to believe her

2148
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,640
But in this round

2149
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,000
You're the most suspicious one

2150
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,680
Let me tell you

2151
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,720
I really

2152
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,480
Don't think she's the killer at all

2153
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,240
You're definitely lying

2154
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,600
You're talking nonsense there

2155
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,360
Calm down, calm down

2156
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,600
Alright, now I've got it figured out

2157
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,680
Anyone here?

2158
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,840
Is anyone there?

2159
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,080
Looking for Master Le

2160
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,920
Master Le

2161
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,680
What do you need him for?

2162
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,920
Looking to sell him some fish

2163
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:45,760
Master Le

2164
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,400
I'll tell you - Master Le is dead

2165
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:47,840
What?

2166
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,760
Master Le is dead

2167
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,440
Yikes

2168
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:51,720
Yikes

2169
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,040
You look somewhat familiar

2170
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,520
I

2171
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,680
You might recognize me

2172
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,200
I perform here often

2173
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,480
I perform here every day

2174
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,160
You jumped into the river

2175
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:18,640
How do you know?

2176
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,560
Two years ago

2177
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,480
Yes, yes, yes

2178
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,520
February 1st

2179
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:22,480
You jumped into the river

2180
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,400
Yes, yes, yes

2181
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,880
You were the one on November 6th last year

2182
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,600
who jumped into the river

2183
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,160
Yes

2184
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:27,720
And you

2185
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,440
Oh, so beautiful

2186
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,040
You

2187
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,280
and

2188
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,360
this young man

2189
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,080
You both

2190
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,040
jumped on March 2nd last year

2191
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,120
Who saved us?

2192
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:42,640
You.

2193
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,720
Could it really be you? Our savior?

2194
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,080
Savior

2195
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,000
I only love those who save me

2196
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,440
I only love those who save me

2197
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,520
You three

2198
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,320
climbed up on your own

2199
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,000
Then you saw us jump into the river

2200
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,200
You didn't save us

2201
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,640
I was terrified

2202
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:16,760
I didn't know what you were doing

2203
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,560
You jumped in and climbed out by yourselves

2204
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,920
You jumped in and climbed out by yourselves

2205
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,320
What a coincidence that you

2206
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,280
witnessed the whole thing

2207
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,040
I was fishing by the river

2208
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:26,880
I fish there every day

2209
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,280
Fishing

2210
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,240
Are you certain those three

2211
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:28,960
climbed out by themselves

2212
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,600
I'm certain

2213
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,960
I saw it, I'm certain

2214
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,920
Didn't you see anyone else?

2215
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:33,960
When we jumped into the river

2216
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,120
I didn't see anyone else

2217
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,080
He was saved by a young girl

2218
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,400
I was saved by the pink phoenix.

2219
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,240
Photo.

2220
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,960
Let me see the photo.

2221
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,200
Do you recognize this?

2222
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,120
This is the girl who saved you.

2223
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:49,760
Yes.

2224
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,720
Right.

2225
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,840
Then why did you say someone saved you?

2226
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,160
I heard a voice.

2227
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,720
In our memory, we were saved by someone.

2228
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:08,880
What about the fish?

2229
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,080
Who's buying?

2230
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,800
How much for it?

2231
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,400
You act like you have money.

2232
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,360
Show me one dollar.

2233
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:15,400
Let me see.

2234
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,800
So you're buying?

2235
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,640
How much will you pay?

2236
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,720
No, I was just asking.

2237
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,400
I'll check elsewhere.

2238
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,520
Anyone else want fish?

2239
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:23,120
Alright.

2240
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,960
She objectively saw you three.

2241
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:25,520
Climbing up.

2242
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,240
That's a confirmed lead then.

2243
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,560
Why would you have

2244
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,520
memories of being saved by others?

2245
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,040
And the words were so clear too.

2246
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,440
This is a bit bizarre.

2247
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:36,960
Should we go to

2248
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,520
check out our childhood playhouse?

2249
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,200
Let's go.

2250
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:40,880
We must go.

2251
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,040
Where's the playhouse?

2252
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,360
Let's go.

2253
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,120
Let's go up and look.

2254
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,120
Let's reminisce about childhood.

2255
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,480
Where is the premium suite?

2256
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,080
This one.

2257
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,240
This should be...

2258
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,360
the room next to the premium suite.

2259
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:54,800
Right.

2260
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,480
Correct.

2261
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,400
Exclusive for premium suite guests.

2262
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,000
This is the premium suite, right?

2263
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,240
Premium suite.

2264
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,680
We still need to figure out how to open it.

2265
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:08,640
It should be here

2266
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,720
The key should be here

2267
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,680
We should look inside here

2268
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,160
Right

2269
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,120
This is a new environment

2270
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,880
The premium suite—this is nice

2271
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,640
It has a lamp, very luxurious

2272
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,200
Really great

2273
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,840
We still need to turn this on

2274
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,720
High-power

2275
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,000
High-power electrical appliance

2276
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,160
Are we pushing something mysterious?

2277
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:40,280
Yeah, pushing something mysterious

2278
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,440
This one should probably be turned on

2279
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,320
Friends, look at this.

2280
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,720
There are two keys here.

2281
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,680
Time to use our brains again.

2282
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,080
This piano must be...

2283
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:02,960
Let's examine it.

2284
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,800
This must be...

2285
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:04,800
Press together.

2286
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,480
Can you distinguish these two notes?

2287
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,640
I've never understood music since childhood.

2288
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,840
Zhou Keke.

2289
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,640
This...

2290
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,120
Isn't this...

2291
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,320
Do re mi fa so.

2292
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,160
Isn't this 'so'?

2293
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,000
Isn't this 'do re mi fa'?

2294
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,840
So fa.

2295
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,040
So fa becomes...

2296
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:26,880
What's the number equivalent?

2297
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,880
5 4.

2298
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,000
So fa.

2299
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,120
Sofa.

2300
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,600
Sofa.

2301
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,040
Sofa.

2302
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,640
That's not impossible.

2303
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,200
Sofa.

2304
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,120
Really.

2305
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,440
Homophone.

2306
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,000
Could be.

2307
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:41,680
Sofa.

2308
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,520
Hint: two sofas.

2309
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,280
This music guy...

2310
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,880
Already figured out the English from the homophone.

2311
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,440
We're like a moving company.

2312
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,400
Quick, quick, sofa!

2313
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,480
Let's try moving the sofa.

2314
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,280
Come on.

2315
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:54,800
Pull it out.

2316
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,520
Nothing here.

2317
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,040
Is there anything in this cushion?

2318
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,240
Nothing at all.

2319
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,400
Check this zipper.

2320
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,040
Yes, unzip it.

2321
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,560
Nothing inside.

2322
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,760
Nothing here either

2323
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,960
Pull it up and see

2324
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:13,800
Take it out, right?

2325
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,960
Take it out

2326
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,080
Just pull it

2327
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,760
There's a key here

2328
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,280
Really?

2329
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,560
It really is

2330
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,400
Thought it would be more sophisticated

2331
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,400
Like a coded one

2332
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,440
There's a reason for the sofa

2333
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,560
Impressive, bro

2334
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,400
It says "warehouse" underneath

2335
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,160
Next door

2336
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:31,760
The warehouse is next door

2337
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,840
Someone's coming

2338
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,560
What are you doing in my room

2339
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,560
Sneaking around like this?

2340
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,640
This is my room.

2341
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,840
You are...

2342
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:55,600
Do you know...

2343
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,720
The legendary singer Wang?

2344
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,520
My fan?

2345
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,440
Hello.

2346
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,600
Young Master Ke, right?

2347
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,080
You know me?

2348
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,320
Young Master Ning.

2349
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,400
That would be me.

2350
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,200
Hello.

2351
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:14,800
You are...

2352
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,960
The best tailor in Tui Town.

2353
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,080
The genius tailor, Bai Youcai.

2354
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,320
His reputation is rising

2355
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,160
Pleased to meet you

2356
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,000
You look familiar

2357
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,960
If you don't know her

2358
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,120
You've wasted your time in Tui Town

2359
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,600
What are you trying to do?

2360
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,160
What do you want?

2361
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,000
What's your intention?

2362
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,760
You look familiar

2363
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,920
Are you

2364
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:00,200
Ba Duanjin or Ba Li

2365
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,440
Ba Duanjin

2366
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:05,960
Who is Ba Duanjin

2367
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:07,320
Sorry

2368
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,120
My mistake

2369
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,760
Ba Duanjin

2370
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,120
Jiawei

2371
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,440
Jiawei

2372
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:18,880
Who

2373
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,560
Jiawei

2374
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,680
Jiawei is

2375
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,920
He Jiawei

2376
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,400
Jiawei He

2377
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,000
Are you Jiawei or Young Marshal He?

2378
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,120
Who is your father?

2379
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,040
Do you know me?

2380
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,200
I don't remember

2381
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:44,840
I don't care what your reasons are

2382
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,440
None of you should have come in

2383
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:47,720
Did you get the key?

2384
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:48,360
Get out

2385
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,440
Go

2386
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,040
Jiawei, get out

2387
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:51,440
Jiawei

2388
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,800
Come with me

2389
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,000
The mysterious room I recommend

2390
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,120
No one is allowed to enter

2391
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,080
Recommended mystery

2392
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,200
You are the recommended mystery

2393
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,120
That VIP guest

2394
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,040
Is no ordinary person

2395
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,080
Ever since that VIP guest

2396
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:07,880
appeared

2397
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,200
Tui Le Men started making profits

2398
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,200
And business boomed

2399
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,400
The ascension list

2400
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,280
Records all the singing girls of Tui Le Men

2401
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,720
It's like a screening process

2402
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,960
The strict selection of recommended mysteries

2403
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,720
Recruitment of singing stars

2404
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,720
Must be 18 years old

2405
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,840
With no family ties

2406
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,520
Female only

2407
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,080
This recommended mystery

2408
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,640
Has some unknown secrets

2409
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,520
Are you Ba Duanjin or Ba Li?

2410
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,480
Are you really Jiawei or Commander He?
