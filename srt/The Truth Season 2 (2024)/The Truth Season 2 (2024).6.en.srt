1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,840
My name is Bali.

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,560
Tonight,

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,400
I will lead the Young Marshal 101 brand

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,800

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,040
to present the closing show of "Bali Fashion Week."

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,920
showcasing my clothing designs.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,040
It's my great honor

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,720
to gather with everyone at our

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,520
Tuilemen Cabaret.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,680
As you all know,

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,440
"Bali Fashion Week"

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,600
is about to conclude.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,000
Now,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,520
we will present tonight's

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,760
grand finale show.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,280
Accompanied by our legendary singer Wang,

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,240
we will

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,600
showcase Bali's designs

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
in a special presentation.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,600
Let's begin.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,040
Amazing

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,440
Legendary Brother

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,720
Wang Esq. Legend

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,160
Wang Esq. Legend

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
What's his score?

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,800
It's a B

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,520
Here he comes

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,720
How much did he get?

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
What's with that expression?

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,200
Handsome

31
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,200
Class F

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,560
Get down

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Class A, then.

34
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
Ma Shuai, everyone

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,040
Thank you for your hard work, my legendary brother

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Please take your seats first

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,320
Ms. Ba Li

38
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,880
Seeing everyone wearing

39
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,600
the Young Marshal 101 outfits you designed

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
putting on a performance

41
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,400
How do you feel about this?

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm very pleased

43
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
And I'm very happy

44
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,680
Was there anyone's performance

45
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,760
that left a particularly deep impression on you?

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
My brother's

47
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
well-deserved

48
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
I just noticed

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
our Ms. Bali

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,040
at every

51
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,160
guest appearance

52
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,280
would hold up a sign

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,000
with letters like ABCF

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,480
What does this mean?

55
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,240
These are Class A, B, C, and F

56
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,600
No, actually it's...

57
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,840
This is how I would describe

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
everyone

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,600
Let everyone guess

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
Okay

61
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:54,960
Go ahead

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
Wait a moment

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,880
Let me pick a difficult one

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
We can't make it too easy

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
F

66
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm very sensitive about this

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,120
Because five years ago I was F

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
Yes, five years ago I was F

69
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,520
Really?

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
Excuse my poor performance, everyone

71
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,040
Nothing special

72
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
Let's guess what F

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,240
stands for

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,280
What does Fdpp mean?

75
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,760
Fdpp

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,360
Dashing and elegant

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,120
Good

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,240
Now let's guess Bksy

79
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,520
I know this one

80
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,000
This is mine

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,760
What?

82
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,640
Unbelievable

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,240
Incredible

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,240
Impressive

85
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,320
What about A?

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
Aybc

87
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,160
Hey, not bad

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,640
Oh, not bad

89
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,640
Not bad

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Really not bad

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Every single word

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Is a good word

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
It seems Ms. Bali's preparations

94
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
Were quite thorough

95
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,680
Now please enjoy

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,960
The carefully prepared

97
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,040
appreciation performance by the brand

98
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,760
Handsome, everyone
