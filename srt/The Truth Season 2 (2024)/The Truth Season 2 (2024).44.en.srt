1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome everyone to

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,000
the event sponsored by

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
all you bulldozers

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,640
"Let's Push It! X"

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,240
I'm Cui Shaoyang, assistant director of Brainstorm Hall

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,760
Who would have thought even in 2048

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,360
in the cyber-era town of Pushville

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,120
violent crimes still occur frequently

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,160
Yet the perpetrator Xiao He

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,640
and suspect Xiao Bai managed to escape

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,960
In this thrilling case

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,520
how did Xiao He pass the X test

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,880
and how did they clear their suspicions

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,640
to successfully obtain the golden key?

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,040
Now let's all together

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,720
"Let's Push It! X"

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,400
This is your X challenge for today

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,760
Find five differences

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,720
Yes, with a three-minute time limit

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,160
Isn't this basically free?

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,720
Please find in the following two images

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,040
five differences

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,400
Let me take a quick look first

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,000
Is it really this hard?

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
It's actually quite difficult

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,400
Very hard—how is this supposed to be easy?

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,720
I'm the worst at these kinds of tasks

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,720
Where should I circle? The top or the bottom?

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,400
Either is fine.

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,920
It's ruined

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,160
I've found four

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,400
I take back what I just said

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,520
Isn't this basically free?

34
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,720
The banner has an extra layer.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
This also has an extra layer.

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,160
This has more, this side has more, and this side too.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,320
And there's an extra empty space here.

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,240
Isn't that right?

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,600
Could this be just one?

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,240
Yes, the banner counts as one.

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,120
This is really frustrating.

42
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,800
Found it

43
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,640
First is this slash on the blackboard

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
This horizontal line is different

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
Then there's this on the newspaper

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,760
Treble clef

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,600
Rest symbol

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,360
Different

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,960
Next is this horizontal banner

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,880
There are five on top

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,200
And four below

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,440
Then there's this horizontal bar in the hallway

53
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,560
Also, these two posters swapped places

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Five in total

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,720
Congratulations, you passed the test

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,040
Thank you, Master

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,600
Why can't I find a single one?

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,240
Found it!

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,760
Just one more to go

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Found it

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
Five places

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,640
Five locations, right?

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,160
That's correct.

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,040
It's harder than I thought.

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,640
There, done.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
This...

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,480
This one... one.

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,360
Two, three, four, five.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,920
This counts as one, right?

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,160
Sorry about that.

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,320
This counts as one.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,120
Found it

73
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,880
Okay, that's enough

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
This corner spot

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
This one's bigger

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,200
This one's smaller

77
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,560
You guys must have put a lot of effort into photoshopping this image.

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
Where else could this be photoshopped?

79
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,800
Five

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
Xiao Bai, I choose you as X

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,280
Because your magical attacks are incredibly powerful

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,880
Would anyone really choose Xiao Bai?

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,520
Of course they would

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,200
Let me tell you, this round I'll be...

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,280
Didn't you see I installed an antenna today?

86
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
For receiving signals today.

87
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,560
Why does Brother Bai seem a bit unnatural?

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't mind him.

89
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,920
It's definitely him.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
Stop the chatter.

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,560
He's holding it together, look.

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,160
He's holding it together.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
Come on, hurry up!

94
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,880
Hurry up already.

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,680
Playing this game, huh?

96
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,520
Alright, alright, alright.

97
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,000
How come you're so energetic as soon as you came out?

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Are you X?

99
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,080
No.

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,240
I trust him.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
He seems genuine.

102
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
I am.

103
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,960
The killer didn't need to choose him at all

104
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,160
If you pick him as X

105
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,320
Then you'd have two X's

106
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Right

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
What does that mean?

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,600
This killer must be afraid of him

109
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,000
Who would be afraid of him?

110
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm afraid of him

111
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
You're afraid?

112
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,080
Wait, according to what you're saying,

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,040
I'm already X, right?

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,200
You are.

115
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,240
Yeah, you definitely are.

116
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,160
Why am I definitely X?

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
Because I say you are.

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,880
If I say I'm X now,

119
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,320
does that really make me X?

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,120
Yeah.

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,920
Remember this:

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,760
This is karma coming full circle.

123
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
This is how you manipulate others normally,

124
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,520
so now you get to experience it too.

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
Fine, I am. Fine.

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
Now you know how I feel.

127
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,280
We only have three episodes left.

128
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

129
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,600
I have nothing to say.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,160
Let's just see how he plays this.

131
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,760
Alright then.

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,800
Okay, okay, okay.

133
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,200
The contact information you provided is correct.

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
He's been deceiving me all along.

135
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,040
I lied to him, saying I was Xiao Ke's classmate.

136
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,920
I asked why you didn't choose Brother Bai.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
It's our usual trick again

138
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,240
Choosing Brother Bai was the right decision

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,440
Let's try it this way

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
January 1st, 2036

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,360
It's in English

142
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
Stay away from me

143
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
What?

144
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
[unintelligible]

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
Stop pretending

146
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,080
X, solve it quickly

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm X and I don't know how to solve it either

148
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Aren't you supposed to be smart?

149
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,040
Who are you targeting today?

150
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,880
Let me listen

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
I still have no clue

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
Rare to be this clueless

153
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
I'm targeting X

154
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,760
You're X

155
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,960
Yes, I am

156
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,000
You two

157
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,160
The two of us couldn't possibly be

158
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,760
Never in this lifetime

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,920
Trust me

160
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,640
Let me tell you

161
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,160
Don't you think those two are suspicious?

162
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
We're suspicious?

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,040
Yeah, we're totally suspicious

164
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,680
So what?

165
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,840
Don't you think they're messing with you?

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,720
I do think so, but I'm not saying yet

167
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,520
Cut it out

168
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm keeping it to myself for now

169
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,840
You're definitely my prime suspect

170
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
I couldn't be the killer

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,360
Okay

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,400
Why couldn't it be you?

173
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,160
You're just being deliberately mysterious

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
Actually, I just remembered something

175
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
What Xiao Ba mentioned

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,880
June 20th is the anniversary

177
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,480
Right

178
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,560
Who would commit murder

179
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
on such an important anniversary?

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,000
The anniversary

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Exactly

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
If you want to make a

183
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,240
murder weapon with a strong sense of ceremony

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,760
then it must be revenge killing

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,560
So you mean

186
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
you suspect Dilraba, is that it?

187
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,120
No, I'm just analyzing the motives

188
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,080
I didn't say who I suspect

189
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
No, let's analyze our motives

190
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,360
You want to

191
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,960
I wanted to perform that person's surgery

192
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,640
Right, you deal with humans

193
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,520
So leaving would mean

194
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,480
Yes, you're escaping

195
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,680
I want to escape

196
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,280
She is

197
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,600
I killed that Xiao Ai

198
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
which means betraying my mission

199
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,400
So I think it's Xiao Ai

200
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,120
who tampered with me

201
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Meaning yours is revenge killing

202
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
She wants revenge

203
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,760
Actually, He Yun has two motives

204
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
Then it must be him

205
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
So how did you

206
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,520
rule out Dilraba?

207
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,040
Her motive is the weakest among you three

208
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,600
Is this motive weak?

209
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,320
No, I think avenging the master

210
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,200
would be a more fitting motive

211
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,280
Yes, and the master died on June 20th

212
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Right

213
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
No, if he's been to this place

214
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,080
He might not have been to this place

215
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,440
He might have just gone to the prison

216
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,400
Without opening that secret box

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,160
If you think this way

218
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
I'd think you're being too partial to Dilraba

219
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,080
You being her X is too obvious

220
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,120
We're talking about motives

221
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,280
Is there a problem with that?

222
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,720
No problem

223
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,000
No problem at all

224
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:25,960
Let me tell you

225
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,880
It's very possible neither of us is X today

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
Why do you say that?

227
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
I don't think so

228
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,880
I don't think so either

229
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,840
If there is an X, it must be him

230
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,080
Or maybe there's no X at all

231
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,360
Why does there need to be an X?

232
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,480
Because I know I'm not X

233
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,800
Well I know I'm not either

234
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
Then let's just wait and see

235
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I don't quite believe you

236
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,200
You don't have to believe me

237
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
I'm not forcing you to believe me

238
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,920
Let's see which of them turns out to be X

239
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
This is getting interesting

240
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
Fascinating

241
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,040
Let's go

242
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,160
Time to vote

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
I had no choice in this matter

244
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,520
There's no way around it, I'm the killer

245
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm sorry

246
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
I didn't mean to

247
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,840
Okay, I voted for Xiao Ba.

248
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,520
But this vote

249
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,480
is just for show.

250
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
It's not my real intention.

251
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,840
I hope Xiao Ba can understand.

252
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
Today's prime suspect is Xiao Ba.

253
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,400
Her motive was revenge.

254
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,720
Today I wanted to choose...

255
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
our Xiao Ba as the final suspect.

256
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,840
Xiao Ba...

257
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
Xiao Ba...

258
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
I vote...

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,920
for the suspect being...

260
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,040
Xiao He.

261
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,280
This case...

262
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,680
failed to identify the real culprit.

263
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm really impressed...

264
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,840
by you.

265
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,600
It wasn't me.

266
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,800
The real culprit was...

267
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Xiao He.

268
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Wow, you acted so well!

269
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,120
I really want to thank...

270
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,480
everyone.

271
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,240
Xiao He, please go to your X.

272
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,640
I...

273
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,920
Stop looking down.

274
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Look up already.

275
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
You're really something.

276
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
It wasn't me.

277
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,600
Alright.

278
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,520
Xiao Bai, oh my god...

279
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,720
Let me tell you...

280
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,800
The only time I panicked today...

281
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,680
was when...

282
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,680
after you came out from choosing X...

283
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,920
and told me you were the culprit.

284
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,200
I asked why...

285
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
You said if you weren't X...

286
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,120
and the other person was X...

287
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,640
who would fear them most...

288
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,480
what does that mean?

289
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,600
The culprit must be afraid of them.

290
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,480
That statement was quite impactful.

291
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,640
My heart skipped a beat at that moment.

292
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,360
Yes, I panicked a little.

293
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,440
Let me tell you...

294
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
but Xiao Ke...

295
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,600
never believed until the end that he was X.

296
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Fooled by this old fox, weren't you?

297
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
I just trusted him too much.

298
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,920
This case appears to be an accident

299
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,520
but in reality, it was Xiao He

300
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,880
who meticulously planned a murder

301
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,080
So how did Xiao He

302
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,960
actually commit this crime?

303
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,360
What is the true story behind this?

304
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,120
I killed Tui AI

305
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm Xiao He

306
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Eight days ago, June 12, 2048 at 7:20 PM

307
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,080
While Tui AI hadn't arrived yet

308
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,360
I sneaked into his research lab

309
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,280
I saw a

310
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,840
detailed parameter sheet for four robot models

311
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,560
It showed our torsos contain Y-element

312
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,880
and the length of our left arms

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,400
Also on his computer

314
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,760
I saw he purchased inorganic cleaner

315
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,920
and organic cleaner

316
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
plus his work to-do list

317
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,680
but the list was incomplete

318
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,800
Using my accidental discovery

319
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,080
that pressing my navel for 5 seconds

320
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,440
can read any to-do list

321
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,760
I viewed the complete version

322
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,520
He'd already finished new robots:

323
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,840
Xiao Bai and Xiao Ke

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,240
that wouldn't produce waste

325
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,720
June 15

326
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,840
Tui AI installed a new gate

327
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,000
in the stairway passage

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
between the exhibition hall and his lab

329
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,520
I could no longer enter his lab freely

330
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,280
To kill him now

331
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,400
I'd need careful planning

332
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,120
I remembered the info sticker

333
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,320
on his cleaning robot

334
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
Every night at 8 PM

335
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,680
the cleaning robot

336
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,280
cleans his research lab

337
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,040
His new robots use Y-element

338
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,440
Y-element fragments are flammable/explosive

339
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,000
When combined with the blue

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,360
organic cleaner used by normal robots

341
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,840
they easily explode

342
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,560
That's why his lab robots

343
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,840
only use red inorganic cleaner

344
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,520
But our exhibition area uses

345
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,320
the organic cleaner

346
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,000
Also, from observing Tui AI

347
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,520
I learned he's colorblind

348
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,160
Though he daily checks

349
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,520
the cleaner in his robot

350
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,360
he can't distinguish

351
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,960
between blue and red

352
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,440
I can use the mopping and sweeping robot

353
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,480
to mix with flammable and explosive fragments to cause an explosion

354
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,640
and kill AI Tui

355
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,600
But since both cleaning agents in the exhibition hall were out of stock

356
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I didn't know when his newly purchased

357
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,120
cleaning agent would arrive

358
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,240
I found the shopping mall's phone number

359
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
and called to learn that

360
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,400
it would arrive during the day on June 20th

361
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
So I decided

362
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,360
to kill AI Tui that same day

363
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,720
However, because AI Tui's research lab entrance

364
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,040
had installed a gate security system

365
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,520
and the distance from the gate to the robot was 3.4 meters

366
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,080
I needed to use the robot's left arm

367
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,040
which could be detached

368
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,760
and reassembled

369
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,880
I had to remove the left arms from four of our robots

370
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,000
and connect them together

371
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,880
to reach the robot at his lab entrance

372
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,160
and complete my murder method

373
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,880
I recalled hearing AI Tui mention before

374
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,080
that our hibernation pod programs

375
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,680
were all modified in the database

376
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,480
I could also access the database to modify programs

377
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,280
to help me remove their arms

378
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,000
The door in the corner of the exhibition hall

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,360
was the database door

380
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,800
There was a combination lock on the door

381
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,760
I worked on it for a while

382
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,280
and finally cracked the code

383
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,040
Yesterday, June 19, 2048 at 7:15 PM

384
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,720
I used my free activity time

385
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,120
to secretly access the database

386
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,800
and modified the hibernation pod's program

387
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,880
to make myself wake up half an hour earlier tomorrow night

388
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,520
meaning ending hibernation at 6:30 PM

389
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,800
Then I changed everyone else's pod opening time

390
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,560
to 6:30 PM as well

391
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,440
This morning at 8 AM

392
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,320
when it was time for us to hibernate

393
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,280
I entered the hibernation pod

394
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,120
along with the other robots

395
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,400
At 6:30 PM I woke up

396
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
First I used my finger's No.1 component

397
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,280
to remove Xiao Ning's left arm

398
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Then used his finger's No.2 component

399
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,160
to remove Xiao Ba's left arm

400
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,360
Then using the components

401
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,240
I connected several arms together

402
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,280
to make a long pole that could pass through the gate

403
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,720
and reach the mopping robot

404
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,800
Then using this arm

405
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,280
I passed it through the gate to push

406
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,920
the mopping robot out from the AI room entrance

407
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,120
I swapped its cleaning container

408
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,200
with the exhibition hall's cleaning container

409
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Then put the robot back in place

410
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,440
Now the robot contained

411
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,800
organic cleaning solution

412
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,440
Then I cut off a piece

413
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,840
of the Y-element from my torso

414
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,960
and threw it through the gate into the research room

415
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,160
So when the organic cleaner

416
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,240
encountered

417
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
the flammable and explosive Y-element fragments from my torso

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,320
it would cause an explosion

419
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,760
Finally I reattached

420
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,720
the robots' left arms

421
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,680
and threw the four robots' detailed parameters

422
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,200
into a hidden corner

423
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
I couldn't keep these on me

424
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,520
After completing everything

425
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,160
I returned to my hibernation pod

426
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,920
At 7 PM

427
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,320
I pretended to wake up like everyone else

428
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,920
Welcome everyone to this episode of

429
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,720
