1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,080
Welcome everyone

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,320
to "Push It! X" sponsored

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,640
by our generous bulldozers

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,640
"Push It! X"

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,720
I'm Cui Shaoyang, assistant director

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,640
of Brainstorm Hall aspiring to be director

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,520
Each week I'll be here

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,000
bringing you mind-blowing X challenges

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,280
exclusive X perspectives

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
and highly anticipated case reenactments

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,640
Rumor has it

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
our Push Town recently had an unsolved case

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,120
where Boss Le of neighboring Pushle Gate

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,360
was strangled to death

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,160
and hung from the ceiling beam

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,200
But fortunately

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,960
through our diligent efforts

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
at Helimo Investigation

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,640
we successfully caught mastermind Wang Chuanshuo

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,040
and X, Ning Shaoshuai

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,040
My vote for the killer is Wang Chuanshuo

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,880
Wang Chuanshuo

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,840
Wang Chuanshuo

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,640
The real killer is

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,200
Wang Chuanshuo

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,720
In this bizarre and twisted case

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,960
how did Wang Chuanshuo pass

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,320
X's test

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,440
And how did these two

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,200
manage to deceive everyone

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,800
right under our noses?

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Now let's all together

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
"Push It! X"

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,680
This is a tricky problem, right?

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,760
Move one matchstick

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,560
to form the largest possible number

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
Move one matchstick to make the equation correct

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Move three matchsticks

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
to flip the fish's head around

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
Move one matchstick

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,240
Remove one matchstick

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,600
to turn it into a "1"

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Move two matchsticks to form a character

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,200
Move two matchsticks to form a character

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
An animal, right?

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,920
Move two matchsticks to form a TV

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,200
Turn it into a TV

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,560
How do we do this?

49
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Why do you say that

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,040
It's just

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,840
Within this reasoning

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
There are these little games

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
Just a light warm-up, right

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,360
Alright

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,160
It's valid

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,720
I changed it to a question mark

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
Question mark equals

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,240
So 81 minus 91 equals question mark

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
It's valid

60
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,120
This doesn't work

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,760
This still doesn't work

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,960
16 minus 18

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,440
16 minus 18 equals 26

64
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,520
Turn this board over

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,600
16 equals 18 minus 2

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,680
So take this

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,760
Bring this over

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
The dream of 900 million girls

69
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,320
900 million

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,320
Bug

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
Not bad, right?

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,160
Done

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,720
Just turn it into TV and we're done

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Is this really necessary?

75
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,240
Right?

76
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,120
Challenge completed

77
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,120
Alright

78
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Good thing I played with matches a lot as a kid

79
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,800
Or I would've fallen for your trick

80
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
Because you're the killer

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,560
So please write down on the board

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,440
The name of the detective you want to corrupt

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,360
Perfect

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,840
Here

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,400
As soon as I entered the elevator today

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,680
Young Master Ning started bluffing me

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
Saying "Brother Xun, you're the killer, right?"

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,600
I said "Yes"

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,560
So I'm going to make him my accomplice

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,680
My accomplice is

91
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
If I look first, then it definitely can't be me.

92
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,200
I was going to check his back for micro-expressions.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,200
This move of yours

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,560
I don't get it

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,800
He said to me, "Brother,"

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
I replied, "Brother,"

97
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,880
"Tell me what to do."

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,720
"My suspicion is quite high,"

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
"So you should firmly pin it on me,"

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,200
"This way,"

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,160
"It will confuse them about"

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,320
"whether you or Ke Shaoshuai is the corrupted one,"

103
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,880
"this situation"

104
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,760
"making it unclear for them to judge."

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
"He told me to pin it on him."

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,520
"I can pin it on him,"

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,760
"But if I push too hard,"

108
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
"they'll follow suit."

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,880
"That's acceptable."

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
"Alright, okay."

111
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
"Play it by ear."

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,080
"I must pin it on him,"

113
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,360
"because his suspicion is too great,"

114
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,880
"and"

115
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,080
"right now he and my sister are the most suspicious."

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
"I must protect my sister."

117
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,640
"Pin it on him."

118
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,160
Next,

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,120
we'll start with that Wang legend.

120
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,760
Alright then.

121
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,800
Take us to your place.

122
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,160
Come on, come on.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,720
Welcome, come in.

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,240
This is my dressing room.

125
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,840
27 28 29 30 31

126
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
27 28 29 30 31

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
1

128
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,920
This is Qi's

129
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,560
What is this thing?

130
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,480
What do you mean?

131
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Phoenix.

132
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,200
Pink Phoenix, right?

133
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Where did this come from?

134
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,000
This was something I gave to Pink Phoenix.

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,040
Why is it in Master Le's room?

136
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,200
The key point is, there's such a strong trace of this...

137
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,160
This bloodstain.

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,680
So you wanted to kill him?

139
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,320
That's his motive for murder.

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,640
Okay

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Then let's go to Bali's room next

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,880
Alright, let's go

143
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
This is a comic

144
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,280
What is this?

145
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,360
What's this?

146
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,760
Two handkerchiefs?

147
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,880
Why is there blood on this?

148
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,880
This handkerchief was from January 30th

149
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,640
when I went to Le Ye's room.

150
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,840
I found that brooch and bracelet.

151
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,720
Then I took my two handkerchiefs

152
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,800
and wrapped them up.

153
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,480
This is the one I was looking for—

154
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,600
the Sunflower Bracelet, right?

155
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,400
So you also wanted to kill Le Ye?

156
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,280
I believe you, I believe you

157
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,760
Yeah right, I believe you

158
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,680
I believe you

159
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,040
First of all, she's my sister

160
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,600
That's the first point

161
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,760
I have to maintain my character

162
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,280
That's the first point

163
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,240
Second, what she said makes sense

164
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,960
What the hell are you doing here?

165
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,680
You're trying to mislead everyone

166
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
She's my sister

167
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,160
I have to believe her

168
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,280
But right now...

169
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,000
You're the most suspicious in this round

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,760
Let me tell you

171
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,240
You're definitely...

172
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,680
You're just spouting nonsense

173
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,880
Let me go first

174
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
On the 31st

175
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
I was there the whole time

176
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,960
I went to the dressing room to organize clothes

177
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,720
From morning until 7 PM

178
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,120
Then around 10 PM

179
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,440
I went back home to Bajia Alley to sleep

180
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Later

181
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,280
We might

182
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Tamper with the alibi

183
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,480
You went home at 10?

184
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
Yes, I went home at 10

185
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,680
I was there at 10:45 PM

186
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,040
I knocked on your door but got no response

187
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,680
I also went there at 10:40 PM.

188
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
She lived in a single dormitory at Bajia Alley.

189
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,240
I also knocked, but no one answered.

190
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,680
So either both of you are lying, or you're lying.

191
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,280
Something's off.

192
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,440
Simply no one was (home).

193
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,320
Actually, I have a question.

194
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,520
You were at the Phoenix Nightclub.

195
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,120
And after passing out, you woke up the next day—

196
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,480
suddenly in that lavish room.

197
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,680
That part is pretty strange too.

198
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,280
I feel like a lot of things are being left unsaid.

199
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,800
I keep feeling many details are being withheld.

200
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,160
Including his personal grudge against Boss Le.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,560
Everyone, think carefully—who’s the killer?

202
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,120
Then cast your final vote.

203
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
Got it.

204
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,560
Who?

205
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,280
This is way too hard, man.

206
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Sacrificing family for righteousness

207
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,480
Such is the cruelty of life

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
Sorry about this, little sister

209
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,920
And my apologies to you too

210
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,280
To all my good friends in the deduction team

211
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,840
My sincerest apologies

212
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,680
I'm voting for Bali

213
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,280
My vote goes to Bali

214
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,600
Three to three

215
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,880
It's a tie

216
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,400
The real culprit is

217
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,520
Wang Esq.

218
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,600
My X is him

219
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,800
Obviously

220
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
Mine

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,560
Wait, who else voted for me?

222
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,680
I voted for you

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,680
Who else? There are two more votes

224
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,920
They must have teamed up to vote for you

225
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
We both voted for you

226
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,720
He voted for you

227
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,480
Three votes

228
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,240
You should be more careful

229
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,840
You got tricked

230
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,280
Right, how could you vote for her?

231
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,240
Just because I knocked him out?

232
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
The only thing we got right was

233
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,600
He would vote for her

234
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Exactly

235
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
I was torn between them

236
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,160
In the end I chose Bali

237
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
What made you decide?

238
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
It was about her work situation

239
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,600
I never figured it out

240
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,000
Her work situation

241
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
All that back and forth

242
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,240
Passing out in new places

243
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,400
Why are you stuck on this?

244
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,720
Why shouldn't I be?

245
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,480
It's definitely worth considering

246
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,520
What does that have to do with Leye's death?

247
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,240
It's relevant

248
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Between her and Leye

249
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,240
Her relationship with Leye

250
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
No, her relationship with Leye doesn't matter

251
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,200
She had motive

252
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,040
That's the first point

253
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,960
Right

254
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,880
Second, the murder method

255
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,680
We all know it

256
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,840
We know all the details

257
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,520
It's just whether she did it or not

258
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,600
Whether she was unconscious or asleep

259
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,240
has nothing to do with it

260
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,920
Right

261
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't you think?

262
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
Who did you vote for, Dilraba?

263
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,240
Why did you vote for him at that time?

264
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,240
Because his motive to kill

265
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,720
appeared earlier than ours.

266
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
Because in 1923,

267
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,080
on February 7th,

268
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,840
he received a letter from a stranger

269
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,760
saying his partner

270
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,920
would be sent to another place.

271
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,640
Yes.

272
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,520
While we all learned

273
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,440
That's right.

274
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,240
on January 30, 1924

275
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,040
that Leye intended to harm

276
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,080
They thought about harming me,

277
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,840
and I thought about harming the Sunflower Girl.

278
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,040
Our motives were all spontaneous.

279
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
Another point is

280
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
he understood that Push Leye Gate

281
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,600
better than the three of us.

282
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Yes.

283
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,520
When we discussed this motive

284
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,480
in the room,

285
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
he kept arguing,

286
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,120
saying how could you all be the same.

287
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,480
Young Marshal Ning is too adorable.

288
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,960
After I corrupted him,

289
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,720
he really became a different person.

290
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
I thought he didn't sleep well.

291
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,760
You know, today his energy was insufficient.

292
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,680
Not analyzing.

293
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,880
Not because there's nothing to say.

294
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,920
How is there nothing to say?

295
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,720
Then I said you should suspect me

296
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,960
But he didn't suspect me at all

297
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,600
You should suspect

298
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
No, but what did he choose?

299
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
He chose to protect her

300
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
If I suspect him, it would be too obvious

301
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm afraid of making him look guilty

302
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,760
You know?

303
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
He already looks guilty

304
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,480
Because many people already suspect you

305
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
If one more person suspects you

306
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,680
You'll definitely be chosen

307
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,480
I can only say

308
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,920
You all have equal suspicion

309
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,520
Can't just suspect him alone

310
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,600
Suspecting him makes him look guilty

311
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
You all voted for him

312
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
And another point is

313
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,360
He knows more than the three of us

314
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,160
About that Tui Le Gate

315
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,560
Yes

316
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
He worked there for over a year

317
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Yes, yes, yes

318
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
So actually it's hard for me to hide

319
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,120
Because the more I say later

320
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,480
The more mistakes I'll make

321
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,360
The more fake it seems

322
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,120
Right, the more fake it seems

323
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
So I'll find a way

324
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
To influence your judgment

325
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,800
You actually did this

326
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,240
Look, someone else voted for me

327
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Thank you, Commander He

328
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,320
Although you weren't very kind to me before

329
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,480
but at the critical moment

330
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,320
you helped me out

331
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
No, I lost too

332
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,120
But having a tie vote makes me feel a bit better

333
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,880
Right, at least

334
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,000
That's acceptable

335
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
I really thought he only got two votes

336
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
Just the two of us

337
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
An even split

338
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
What a pity

339
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
Both of you failed to escape

340
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,680
But the process was still quite thrilling

341
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,800
Now that everyone knows

342
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
how our killer and X

343
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,600
worked together

344
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm sure everyone is curious

345
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,960
about how our legendary killer

346
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,000
committed the crime

347
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,160
So what is the truth behind the story?

348
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,240
Everyone, take a look

349
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,320
I am Wang Chuanshuo

350
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,640
With Pink Phoenix's encouragement

351
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,040
I came to the Tui Le Men

352
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
to pursue my dreams

353
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,360
Pink Phoenix and I formed the Phoenix Legends duo

354
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,560
Those were my happiest days

355
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,920
A year ago, Pink Phoenix left without a word

356
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,440
to pursue greater opportunities at Tui Lao Hui

357
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,400
An anonymous benefactor left me a letter saying

358
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,600
that Pink Phoenix was sent by Tui Le Men's boss, Master Le

359
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,000
on a path of no return

360
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,840
At first, I didn't take it seriously

361
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,360
I thought it was just a prank

362
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,560
Until January 30th this year

363
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,560
Master Le

364
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,160
Master Le

365
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,360
While cleaning Master Le's room, I found in the trash

366
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,520
a blood-stained Pink Phoenix hair accessory

367
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,480
Combined with the previous anonymous letter

368
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,280
I became certain Master Le truly harmed Pink Phoenix

369
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,720
I will kill Master Le

370
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,360
to avenge Pink Phoenix

371
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,760
To escape perfectly

372
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,640
I decided to use the legend of the Long-Haired Witch of Tui Town

373
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,080
to craft a flawless murder plan

374
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,720
First,

375
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,040
I plan to use a secret passage I accidentally discovered before,

376
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,400
that leads from the Dongnao Hall

377
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,120
abandoned old Sect Leader's office

378
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
to the wardrobe in Master Le's room,

379
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,440
which hides a secret vault.

380
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,240
Normally, I could come and go through this passage,

381
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,120
but Tuizhen has been buried under heavy snow for three days and nights.

382
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,560
I don’t know when the snow will stop,

383
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,160
so to avoid leaving footprints

384
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,080
in the snow-covered courtyard of Dongnao Hall afterward,

385
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,720
I took advantage of the darkness to scout the hall in advance.

386
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,640
I noticed the wooden planks of Dong Nao Tang's staircase

387
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,920
are separate from the steel frame structure beneath.

388
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,200
I can move the staircase planks level by level

389
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
and use the steel frame to move between floors.

390
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,840
This way, even after the snow stops,

391
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,320
I can still use Dong Nao Tang

392
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
and Master Le's secret stash

393
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,800
to create the perfect locked-room murder.

394
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,200
Then to frame the Long-haired Witch,

395
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,680
I'll need enough wigs

396
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,720
to fabricate the eerie crime scene.

397
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,280
On the evening of January 31st,

398
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,840
after the Bally Fashion Week ended,

399
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,960
I took advantage when the barber shop owner

400
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,080
across from Tui Le Gate briefly left,

401
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,280
and stole some hair.

402
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,400
Just the night before last,

403
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,480
at 8:30 PM on January 31st,

404
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,880
I went to the restroom,

405
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,680
and when I returned,

406
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,520
someone had stolen

407
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
all my hair.

408
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,800
Later, carrying the lyrics to "I Love Young Marshal 101",

409
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,160
I hurried to Bally's house in Bajia Alley.

410
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
From a distance, I saw

411
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,920
Marshal He knocking at Bally's door,

412
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
but no one answered.

413
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,800
When I returned from Bajia Alley to my room,

414
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
I found my work badge for that day was missing.

415
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,120
I searched everywhere but couldn't find it.

416
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,640
Fortunately, the badge

417
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,160
didn't have our names on it.

418
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,680
February 1st - Bally Fashion Week concludes.

419
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,920
Unexpectedly during the thank-you performance,

420
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,080
the Long-haired Witch actually appeared.

421
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,280
Could something be about to happen?

422
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,720
The Long-haired Witch...

423
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,600
Tonight would be the perfect time to act.

424
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,840
When the snow stops and it's quiet at night,

425
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,120
I'll follow the original plan,

426
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,040
bring the prepared wig props

427
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
and a pair of gloves,

428
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
and go to Dong Nao Tang.

429
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,040
I'll dismantle the staircase level by level,

430
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,760
enter from the courtyard upstairs,

431
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,120
then

432
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,160
enter Master Le's bedroom through the old hall master's office.

433
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,480
Passing through the old hall master's office,

434
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,120
I casually took a mask

435
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,080
and a packet of knockout drugs from the office.

436
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,000
I hid in Master Le's wardrobe

437
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,960
Put on a mask

438
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,760
Pushed the wardrobe door open slightly

439
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,200
Lit the knockout incense

440
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,360
After the incense burned for a while

441
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,840
Master Le fell completely unconscious

442
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,120
In such a seemingly inaccessible room

443
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,240
The murder that occurred

444
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,120
Appeared more like the work of a female ghost or supernatural event

445
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,560
After that, I took out the rope braided from long hair

446
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,280
and tied a tight knot at one end

447
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,240
then looped it around Master Le's neck

448
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,440
Then put on the gloves I specially prepared

449
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,520
Stand on the table

450
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,680
Holding one end of the long hair rope

451
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,560
I threw the other end over the roof beam

452
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Then using the long hair and the beam

453
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,320
I pulled hard on the hair

454
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,160
Hanging Master Le up

455
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,480
Suspending him mid-air below the beam

456
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,680
Finally, I wrapped the remaining long hair

457
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,840
around his body

458
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,120
Making the whole scene appear

459
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,880
more like a female ghost's supernatural killing

460
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,560
After completing this

461
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
I restored the table

462
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
and incidentally took Master Le's

463
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,040
January 31st fashion week work pass from his bedside

464
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
Then I left through the secret passage

465
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,960
returning the same way to the abandoned office

466
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I discarded the used anesthetic, mask

467
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,000
and recently used gloves

468
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,760
in a corner of this abandoned office

469
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,360
Then using the same method I came in

470
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,080
I left Dongnao Hall

471
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,040
At 8:00 on February 2nd

472
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,560
I came to the Tuile Gate lobby with others

473
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,680
waiting for Master Le to come downstairs

474
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,440
to have breakfast together

475
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,360
What time is it?

476
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
It's already 8:02

477
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,760
Now it's 8:03

478
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,680
Why hasn't he come yet?

479
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,000
Master Le

480
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
He's usually quite punctual

481
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,200
But I knew

482
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,040
he would never come again

483
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,520
Thank you all viewers

484
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,640
for watching this week's "Let's Deduce! X"

485
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,920
To know what happens next

486
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,160
please listen to Shaoyang's explanation next time
