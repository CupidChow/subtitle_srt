1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,960
This game is called "Squatting Radish."

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,920
Then I'll call myself Bai Yu.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,320
So your name is Bai Yu, huh?

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,640
My name is Bai Yu.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,520
Then what's my name?

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,480
You call me...

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm Dilraba, got it!

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,200
After Bai Yu squats, Liu Yuning squats.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Liu Yuning squats.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
After Liu Yuning squats, Liu Yuning squats again.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,160
After Wang Xun squats, Zhou Keyu squats.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,000
It's stuck.

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,080
Zhou Keyu isn't me.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,880
It's not him.

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,240
Zhou Keyu isn't me.

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,720
You...

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,440
Do you all want to observe?

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's have someone try it.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,720
Can someone lift him up?

20
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,880
I can't lift him.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,160
We'll know if we try.

22
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,920
He's not easy to lift.

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,040
Then you're out.

24
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Can't handle these things at all.

25
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,600
No, didn't she say in the last case...

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,640
Used great strength to...

27
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,600
hit him with a club to knock him out?

28
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,000
A very heavy object.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,720
Like a 200-pound pickaxe.

30
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,160
Come on.

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,240
All you little killers, veteran killers...

32
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,280
Veteran killers...

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
And Killer X...

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,000
None of you are good people.

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,480
Let me tell you...

36
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,120
Do I look...

37
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,600
really like a killer?

38
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,320
Why won't you believe me?

39
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,720
Everyone's suspicious.

40
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,600
You're just giving up now.

41
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,440
At this point...

42
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,760
Stop with the lovesick persona.

43
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,600
Alright?

44
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,200
Take these crazy guys...

45
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
and push these elements to the extreme.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,960
You'll be...

47
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,920
the ultimate character in this show.

48
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,240
Tui Town General Store

49
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Push push push

50
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,360
Hello everyone

51
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,120
Welcome back to

52
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
generously sponsored by the bulldozers

53
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440
Tui Town General Store

54
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm your favorite editor, Tui Bao

55
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Fresh content is out

56
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
Come take a look quickly

57
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,000
This week

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
The first major event in Tui Town

59
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,800
was Marshal He gathering his close buddies

60
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,040
to undergo the unique

61
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,200
memory restoration therapy from Dongnao Hall

62
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,320
Whether this therapy works is uncertain

63
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
but it was genuinely hilarious

64
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,200
The six of us played a game together

65
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,520
The game was called

66
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,200
"Radish Squat"

67
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,640
Where each of us

68
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,880
would pick a new name

69
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
then we'd chant "[name] squat, [name] squat"

70
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,640
After one squats, the next person squats

71
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Okay

72
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
First, let's have everyone

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,320
choose a name for themselves

74
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,560
Alright, let's pick nicknames first

75
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
Choose your own

76
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,640
Right

77
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,880
I'll go first

78
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
I'll be "Bold Art Master"

79
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,320
"Bold Art Master" - isn't that too long?

80
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Is it?

81
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
Because I saw one here that

82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,080
Maybe we should pick regular names

83
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,360
I'll be

84
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,720
Should we make them cuter?

85
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
More fun ones?

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,240
Cuter ones

87
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,240
Then I'll be Bai Yu.

88
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
You're Bai Yu? That works.

89
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm Bai Yu.

90
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,720
Okay.

91
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm Bai Yu.

92
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,080
Right.

93
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,080
This actually works.

94
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,360
This approach is fine too.

95
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,440
Then what's your name?

96
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
You're Wang Xun.

97
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,080
Good.

98
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,160
Agreed.

99
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,640
Then I'll be Hehe.

100
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
Hehe.

101
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,000
Then I'll be Keke.

102
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,680
Wait a minute.

103
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,200
Hehe, Keke.

104
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,280
No, let's use real names.

105
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,560
This way we'll react naturally.

106
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,720
Full names, okay?

107
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,640
Are you Zhang Linghe?

108
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,520
No, you...

109
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,320
I'm Zhang Linghe.

110
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
Zhang Linghe.

111
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,440
Yes, I'm Zhang Linghe.

112
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,200
Zhou Keyu.

113
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,360
Then what's my name?

114
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,920
You call me...

115
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,880
I'm Dilraba, got it.

116
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,760
Alright.

117
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,840
Wait, this is too difficult.

118
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,320
Too confusing.

119
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,920
Hold on.

120
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,720
Let's go from left to right.

121
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
State your names in order.

122
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
From the left.

123
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,920

124
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,680
Zhang Linghe.

125
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,880
Bai Yu.

126
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,480
Dilraba.

127
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,600
Wang Xun.

128
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,760
Zhou Keyu.

129
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,480
Done.

130
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,720
Let's start the game now.

131
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,200
Okay.

132
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,920
Alright, let's go.

133
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,800

You can't name yourself

147
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,240
No, you can only name others

148
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,480
You have to pass it on

149
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,600
I don't know

150
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Liu Yuning is out

151
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,480
Liu Yuning, you're out

152
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,200
Alright

153
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,760

Zhou Keyu isn't me

174
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Not him

175
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
Zhou Keyu isn't me

176
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,400
You

177
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,800
Now we only have four left

178
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,920
We're still playing

179
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,080
Not helping him recover memories

180
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,880
We're still playing

181
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm watching you all play

182
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,240
Watching us might recover some, right?

183
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,000

Reba squat

201
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,800
No

202
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,040
Sorry, okay

203
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,520
Sorry

204
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,400
Okay, I admit

205
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,200
I admit

206
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,360
Okay, another one is eliminated

207
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,880
Bai Yu squats, Bai Yu squats

208
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,200

Zhang Linghe squats, Zhang Linghe squats

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,560

Bai Yu squats, Bai Yu squats

216

Zhang Linghe squats, Zhang Linghe squats

222
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,480
After Zhang Linghe squats, Reba

223
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,400
Reba is gone

224
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,280
Goodbye

225
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,680
No more Reba

226
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,400
That's it, right?

227
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,880
We lost

228
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
You two won

229
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,880
I'd like to ask Commander Zhang

230
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
Have you recalled

231
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,800
your childhood memories?

232
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
You should remember by now

233
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,280
I've got nothing

234
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,160
Any thoughts?

235
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,840
No

236
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,320
No effect

237
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
This doctor

238
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
Your treatment method

239
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,560
I think it's a bit silly

240
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,000
Now reporting the second major event of this week in Tuizhen

241
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,240
Co-authored by the renowned detective Heli Moyu

242
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,960
in collaboration with

243
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160
"The Can You Deduce It? Strategy Guide"

244
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,120
is now officially released

245
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,200
Opening the guide

246
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,480
reveals the first shocking skill:

247
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,040
"In-depth corpse examination"

248
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,600
Starting with something this intense right away?

249
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,640
And you're still lying around here?

250
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
Did you unload it?

251
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,200
Yes, we unloaded it.

252
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,200
Would you like to take a look?

253
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,560
Pushing mystery.

254
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,720
His pockets were emptied.

255
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,600
We were going through his pockets

256
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,320
Looking for something

257
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
This is so soft

258
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
Feels real, huh?

259
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,840
Silicone

260
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,240
It's silicone

261
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,760
But it's heavy, extremely heavy

262
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,520
Yes, it has an internal skeleton

263
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
Alright, let's try this

264
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,520
Who can lift him up?

265
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Go ahead, give it a try

266
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,280
I can't lift it

267
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,240
No, lifting from the ground is difficult

268
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,480
Is it really this heavy?

269
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,680
Very heavy

270
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,040
Try it and you'll see

271
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,880
Can't lift it

272
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
This isn't something you can normally lift

273
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,640
Right

274
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,440
Alright then

275
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,600
Let's leave it for now

276
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,720
So you're ruled out

277
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
Simply can't handle this

278
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:53,960
No

279
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,200
Didn't she say in the last case

280
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
That it took tremendous strength

281
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,360
To knock him out with a club?

282
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,600
A very heavy object

283
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Something like

284
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
A 200-pound pickaxe

285
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,880
Or a 200-pound weight to knock him out

286
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,480
Hence the memory loss, makes sense

287
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,120
Yes, super strong

288
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,840
Why is its hand moving?

289
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,640
The hand is moving

290
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,000
This

291
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,720
It even has a manicure habit

292
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,440
Manicure

293
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,880
Really

294
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,520
Wait a minute

295
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
There's a heart here

296
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
This is from that repairman

297
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
The repairman gave it to Sister Ba

298
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
He gives these to every girl

299
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,080
he meets, doesn't he?

300
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,600
Why are there so many

301
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
bugs here?

302
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,320
Miss, be careful

303
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,560
Here, for the lady

304
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,960
And these moves

305
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,040
Just put it in your hand and hide it

306
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Just put it in your hand and conceal it

307
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,240
Indeed

308
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,160
Very impressive

309
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,880
Put it inside

310
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
I already saw you holding it

311
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
Let's go

312
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Okay

313
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,640
Young Master Ning's flower

314
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,400
Truly touched Tuibao's heart

315
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,880
But the killer won't listen to sweet talk

316
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,960
We'll have to bluff

317
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,800
Actually, I can't eat either

318
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,120
Brother, why can't you eat?

319
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,400
Why can't you eat?

320
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,320
No, my stomach is too full

321
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
I don't know why

322
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,760
I just went

323
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,600
I thought we had exposed you

324
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,280
You've exposed me

325
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,080
That's not the case

326
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,440
I've noticed

327
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,080
You really like working outside the scene

328
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,680
Really

329
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,280
Aren't you the detective, bro?

330
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,440
I am the detective

331
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
What are you doing?

332
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm here observing you all

333
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,240
You

334
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,600
What's up?

335
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,360
Are you tired?

336
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,680
Let me peel a banana for you

337
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,000
I just ate one

338
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,440
Alright

339
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
You're acting a bit unusual this time

340
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,040
I'm a bit tired

341
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,800
Who isn't tired?

342
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,680
Sorry

343
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,040
I shouldn't have said that

344
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,920
Who isn't tired?

345
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,640
Alright, alright

346
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,000
Little killer

347
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,320
Playing these tricks, huh?

348
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,000
But detectives

349
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
Do you have any secrets to catching the killer?

350
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,760
Keen eyes

351
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,520
You're Master Xiu

352
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,080
I am Master Xiu

353
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Then why are you carrying

354
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,760
Master Dai's bag?

355
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,040
My brother

356
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
It's like this

357
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,240
You brushed it off so carelessly

358
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,120
Master Xiu, you're so strange

359
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
Let me see what's in your bag

360
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
Let me see

361
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Let me check what's in your bag

362
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,680
No, Brother Shan

363
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,920
What does this little red heart mean?

364
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,880
Why did you snatch someone's bag?

365
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
I just wanted to take a look.

366
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,160
Hey, Brother Shan

367
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,000
Can you give me back that chest bag

368
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,960
of mine?

369
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
What's a chest bag?

370
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,120
My brother's bag

371
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,880
We call brother's bag "chest bag"

372
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,400
You mean murderer's bag?

373
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,000
Murder bag

374
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,560
Brother's bag

375
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,400
Come on, I want it back

376
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,680
Oh dear

377
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,000
Head-on clashes are unavoidable

378
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,640
But we still need to maintain a relaxed vibe

379
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,800
Let's begin

380
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
When we first started recording

381
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,400
It was season one

382
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
None of us knew each other well in the first episode

383
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,120
But after just one episode

384
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,640
We bonded like comrades who've been through life and death

385
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,280
You know what?

386
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,200
Because we experienced "death" together

387
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,560
Like dealing with "dead" people and such

388
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,120
That built strong mutual trust

389
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
That kind of trust was

390
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,000
Professional trust at work

391
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
Trust in work settings

392
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,840
But not so much in personal life

393
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,760
No trust during cases

394
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,280
No trust in cases

395
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,080
You understand that logic, right?

396
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,320
It was actually quite fun

397
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,960
During recording

398
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,800
We got familiar with each other quickly

399
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,880
Then we talked more and more

400
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,680
Our discussions became more free-flowing

401
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,160
The more relaxed we were

402
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,680
That was the best approach

403
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,160
Right, just say whatever comes to mind

404
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,080
Later we were really just winging it

405
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,800
At first we still analyzed the logic

406
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Scripted lines

407
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
You can just improvise

408
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,760
Say whatever you think of

409
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Don't worry about sounding ridiculous

410
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,080
Don't stress about lying or not

411
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Right

412
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,680
Even if you say something wrong

413
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,880
If it seems too outrageous later

414
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
They'll just edit it out

415
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,200
But don't deliberately try to

416
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,560
Don't make your lies too convincing

417
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,280
You know?

418
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,760
If it's too real, you might actually fool us

419
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,800
Just keep it playful

420
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,560
Yes, just play around casually

421
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,880
The atmosphere is crucial

422
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,480
Right

423
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
Having that comfortable familiarity is

424
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,120
Very important

425
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,400
In the blink of an eye

426
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,880
The final major event of the week

427
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,560
I really wish I could grow a brain at the Brain Gym

428
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,080
I also want two chances to kill

429
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,040
You'll get them

430
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
Killing one is still killing

431
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,640
Killing two is also killing

432
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,240
Go for it, you can do it

433
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,160
Come on, open sesame

434
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,040
You said you'd be taken away next time

435
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,960
Who will open this door

436
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,360
Who still practices this Qi training

437
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,360
Come on

438
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,520
Little assassins, old assassins

439
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,400
Old assassins

440
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,160
And Assassin X

441
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,320
That's right, I am Assassin X

442
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,040
None of you are good people

443
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,960
Let me tell you

444
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Look at you all

445
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,360
Not sure if you're using your brains

446
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,760
Tui Bao thinks your imaginations

447
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,960
have been blown wide open

448
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,520
Brother Xun, did you kill again?

449
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Was it you?

450
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,200
You killed two in a row

451
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,680
No

452
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,760
Double kill

453
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Did he know you killed Master Le?

454
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,360
So you killed him too?

455
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,960
Possibly

456
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,880
*sinister laugh*

457
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Don't be like this

458
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,960
You showed weakness earlier

459
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,640
You look very sinister now

460
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,840
You showed weakness earlier

461
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,880
You're doing that again

462
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,600
Let me have a proper game

463
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,480
Was it you?

464
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
It was me

465
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,400
The most suspicious is Ba Li

466
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,120
Was it you?

467
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,920
No

468
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,120
Again with this

469
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,400
You're voting for me again?

470
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
How could you? Why?

471
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,800
Do I look

472
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,480
really like a killer to you?

473
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Don't vote for her this time

474
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Vote for me

475
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,520
That's so fake

476
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,760
You've got nothing left to vote for

477
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,960
You're going to jail regardless

478
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,200
Right, killing one is still killing

479
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Killing two is still killing

480
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,200
You're beyond redemption now

481
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,120
Right, let me serve your sentence

482
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Serve my sentence for me

483
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,480
Yes

484
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,680
Confirmed

485
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,440
For us

486
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,120
For you

487
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
You three tell me who it is first

488
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,480
I'll do it for you

489
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
I understand.

490
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,160
This Jiawei is most likely...

491
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,880
an assistant to the Mysterious Pusher.

492
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,360
Then why would the Mysterious Pusher want to kill...

493
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,920
The Mysterious Pusher does need an assistant.

494
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,680
He's always worn a mask.

495
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,760
But he's also pressured by the Mysterious Pusher...

496
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,200
Yet he still wants to help people.

497
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,040
Including many things inside...

498
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,480
were leaked by him.

499
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,800
I think it's possible.

500
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,080
I believe...

501
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
Jiawei might be...

502
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,840
someone close to the Mysterious Pusher.

503
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,400
Why won't you believe me?

504
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,560
From the very beginning...

505
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,520
I've wanted to protect Bali.

506
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,280
At this point...

507
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,680
Stop playing the devoted lover role.

508
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,480
Alright?

509
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,280
But I am a devoted lover.

510
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,000
Very suspicious...

511
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,040
Jiawei is very suspicious.

512
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
Highly suspicious.

513
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,400
She's no longer your savior.

514
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,040
Right.

515
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,600
She didn't save you.

516
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,200
You climbed up yourself.

517
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,680
But after spending so much time with her...

518
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,600
I just...

519
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,400
understand.

520
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,000
Truly and genuinely.

521
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,880
That's also possible.

522
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,720
Why don't you ever believe me?

523
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,760
We believe you, we do.

524
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,880
Bali, look at them.

525
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,840
You shouldn't have finished that chicken soup.

526
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
You should have passed it to me.

527
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,480
Tui Town Tea Party

528
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,520
Delicious yet affordable

529
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
This is the exclusive

530
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
case review partner for bulldozers

531
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,200
Dedicated to bringing you

532
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,320
fun and appetizing review "pickles"

533
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,160
What are you waiting for?

534
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,120
Dig in!

535
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,920
The three of you

536
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,000
are visiting

537
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,040
our show for the first time

538
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,840
So after experiencing

539
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,080
such a story

540
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,600
what do you think

541
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
about the upcoming characters,

542
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,120
the story itself,

543
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,240
or the segment setups?

544
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,080
What are your expectations?

545
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,440
Hope for more math problems like this

546
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,320
Oh no, please don’t

547
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,320
Actually, it's my first time here

548
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,200
and I'm already quite impressed

549
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,000
For the first time, being fully immersed

550
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
in such a large-scale

551
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,640
murder mystery show

552
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,800
feels completely different

553
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,480
Plus with so many clues

554
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,920
to sort through

555
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,840
and every character is so vivid

556
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,760
so three-dimensional

557
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm really looking forward

558
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,400
to seeing what kind of script comes next

559
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,040
I also hope my character won't be

560
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,280
a brainless romantic again

561
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,240
I hope I can...

562
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,360
You're not a brainless romantic

563
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,880
No

564
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,080
This time you got the ultimate character archetype

565
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,560
Really?

566
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,480
First - crazy protagonist

567
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,440
Crazy protagonist

568
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,720
Second - more kingly than a king

569
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,440
Third - has amnesia again

570
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,960
Right

571
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,680
Fourth - hopelessly romantic

572
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,720
He's a superstar

573
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes, fifth - also a superstar

574
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,600
Sixth - also a rich heir

575
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,480
The ultimate - truly the ultimate

576
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,840
Wait

577
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,760
When you mix all these together

578
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,240
it just doesn't feel right, you know?

579
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:57,960
No

580
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,080
You're definitely the ultimate character in this show

581
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,520
Really, truly

582
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,320
Alright

583
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,920
Then I just hope

584
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,720
next time I can perform well

585
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,240
and take these crazy protagonist

586
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,360
elements to their extreme

587
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,760
This time was quite interesting

588
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,080
I feel like I got to experience it first-hand

589
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,200
This murderer

590
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,760
All eyes were on you

591
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,480
Talking too much felt like it would give me away

592
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,360
But not speaking also felt wrong

593
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,360
That was really hard to balance

594
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,240
Really

595
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
I believe he felt the same today

596
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
When I checked his pulse

597
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,280
He really was at that moment

598
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,960
The moment I felt his pulse

599
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,840
You really did feel my pulse

600
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,800
Of course I did

601
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,720
Was it fast?

602
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,680
Yes, it was fast at that time

603
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,600
So solving cases from a medical perspective

604
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,560
has also begun now

605
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,360
That's why we recorded two episodes

606
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Learned a lot from everyone

607
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,160
Looking forward to future episodes too

608
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
Let's try deduction again

609
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,400
It might become more complete then

610
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
But I think deduction is actually quite difficult

611
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,640
Especially with this X factor added

612
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,760
It's really tough

613
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,400
For experts at this level

614
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm no expert

615
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,280
I'm just... I'm a little killer

616
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
Right, you're the little killer

617
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
Little killer

618
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,000
No

619
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,120
I just feel there's this

620
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,040
About this victory

621
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,200
A feeling I can't control

622
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,600
It's hard

623
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,960
It's genuinely very difficult

624
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
If the killers make even one

625
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
small mistake in details

626
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,560
They can easily be caught

627
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,240
Right

628
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,720
Bali

629
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
What are your expectations

630
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,240
Or about this

631
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,440
whole recording experience

632
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,880
Haven't really thought about that

633
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Just looking forward to it

634
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,840
Because I don't know

635
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,880
how else they'll play it

636
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,160
And also because I

637
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,000
don't record shows in real life

638
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,600
Never played script murder games either

639
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,280
If it's too hard, I'll just look stupid

640
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,440
I can handle

641
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,640
things like haunted houses

642
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,720
Can create some effects

643
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,760
But I'm not good at thinking

644
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,920
You're not good at thinking?

645
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,120
Too modest

646
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,240
I really can't think well

647
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
Maybe just got lucky

648
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,320
I might just be lucky today

649
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,760
Really not

650
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,880
Her look was so sharp

651
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,200
Really

652
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
When I saw that look I knew I was done

653
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,280
Really, just your

654
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
If you can't remember

655
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,880
He'd be grinning all day today

656
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,760
The scariest part was

657
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
When she saw me, she

658
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
I felt she already had me locked

659
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,840
You know

660
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,400
That was the scariest

661
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,360
Because actually in our surface evidence

662
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
nothing pointed to you

663
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
Mainly I almost forgot

664
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
about the things we searched in modern times

665
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,880
Right, nobody thought of that

666
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,720
Why would she

667
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,200
This point I still can't

668
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I really think

669
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,560
This Xiao Ba is amazing

670
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,520
Truly impressive

671
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,920
So I think Xiao Ba excels in these areas

672
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,160
Not just with intuition

673
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,200
Her deductive skills are truly remarkable

674
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,320
No, I've never tried this before

675
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,680
I think you have a talent for detective work

676
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,160
If you don't continue this job, you should become a detective

677
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,680
If you hadn't pointed that out today

678
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,480
The one sitting here now would be

679
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,280
Him watching all of us

680
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
You guys

681
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,560
That won't happen

682
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,200
So,

683
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,200
Do you think you can guess correctly next time?

684
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,200
Not necessarily.

685
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,480
The production team will definitely make it harder.

686
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,200
Let me tell you,

687
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,880
These two episodes are already

688
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,320
the peak difficulty of our show.

689
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,720
You say that every day.

690
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,520
So this counts as easy, right?

691
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,320
Relatively easy.

692
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,040
Compared to Season 1's first case,

693
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,080
it's not simple.

694
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,440
Well... relatively speaking.

695
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,680
Should we be this immodest?

696
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,040
No,

697
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,680
mainly because we didn't deduce it very well

698
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,520
in Season 1.

699
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,360
Right, we weren't that skilled to begin with.

700
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,920
Alright,

701
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,040
now we've reached

702
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,320
the golden key awarding segment.

703
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,640
Please have Young Master Ke present the golden key.

704
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,720
Adding insult to injury.

705
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
I have a feeling

706
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,880
I won't get the (Golden Key) in the third round

707
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,520
No way

708
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,480
If I were the killer

709
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
I would definitely choose you

710
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,440
Let's team up

711
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,920
We'll coordinate like crazy

712
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,840
Alright

713
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,960
Starting off by cursing at each other

714
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,160
It's you

715
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,440
Thank you, thank you, Young Master Ke

716
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
Thank you, cousin

717
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,000
Thank you

718
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,840
Come on

719
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,600
I really don’t want to give this to you

720
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,440
I really, really don’t want to

721
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,200
Comfortable

722
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,520
Two rounds now, feels good

723
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,000
In the end

724
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
Can be exchanged for items, right?

725
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
Points exchange?

726
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,720
It represents an honor

727
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
Recognition for your deduction skills

728
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,800
That won't do

729
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,920
We need to add more gameplay

730
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,800
Back in your first season

731
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,160
Who got the most keys?

732
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,480
You got the most keys

733
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,880
Me and Guo Qilin

734
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
Yes, you and Guo Baoyou

735
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,440
Now then

736
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,480
We will now activate each player's

737
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,560
next Tuizhen Resident Card

738
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
Starting now

739
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,120
We begin right now

740
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,280
In the next recording session

741
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,840
Your Tuizhen Resident Cards

742
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,040
What backgrounds will they have?

743
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,120
We'll all travel together to

744
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,800
Tuizhen in 1988

745
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,680
The year 1988

746
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,960
1988

747
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,120
After the reform and opening-up

748
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
1988

749
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,440
A decade of reform and opening-up

750
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,320
Ten years already

751
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,760
So everyone's identity

752
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,240
What exactly will it be?

753
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,920
Liu Yuning

754
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,680
Your undercover identity is

755
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
Captain Ning

756
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,280
Captain Ning

757
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,160
A pirate?

758
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,760
Captain, you went into business, right?

759
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,400
Bai Yu, your identity is

760
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,560
Bai Mai

761
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,040
Bai Mai, the buyer

762
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,760
Bai Mai

763
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,800
You're a shopping agent

764
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,680
A reseller

765
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,880
Possibly

766
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,640
Okay, good

767
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,960
The third veteran player, Zhou Keyu

768
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,680
Your identity in Tui Town is

769
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Ke Grid

770
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,840
Ke Grid, aligning the granularity

771
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,240
Dilraba

772
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,040

Sister Ba

774
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Sister Ba

775
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,720
This name rolls off the tongue nicely

776
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,760
Sister Ba

777
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,040
Zhang Linghe, your identity in Tui Town is

778
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,520
He Kefu

779
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,600
The one who answers calls, what about me?

780
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,040
Teacher Wang Xun

781
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,080
Your identity is

782
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,360
Wang Juanwang

783
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
Wang Juanwang

784
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
Both a singing star and the king of competition

785
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,560
Okay

786
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,920
Let's all look forward to

787
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,440
the next story

788
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,280
Alright

789
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,040
Helimo Yu, the Reasoning King

790
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,360
Let the deduction begin

791
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,040
I'm not satisfied.

792
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm very satisfied too.

793
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,160
Very satisfied.

794
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,360
I'm not very satisfied.

795
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,320
I'm not satisfied either, not happy.

796
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,880
Not happy.

797
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,400
Next time you'll definitely be the killer.

798
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,880
Let me tell you.

799
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,480
I know.

800
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,320
You'll definitely be the killer next round.

801
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,560
Just wait for us to vote you out.

802
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,440
Okay, no problem.

803
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,880
Really.

804
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,480
Sure.

805
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,840
We'll definitely investigate you.

806
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,880
We'll investigate you thoroughly.

807
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,200
If I'm not mistaken.

808
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,400
I'll still be X next round.

809
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
Still X.

810
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,160
No way.

811
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,640
You probably won't be the detective anymore.

812
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,200
He should be the suspect next game.

813
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
Because I'm the killer.

814
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,480
I'll make him the X.

815
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,080
I'll protect you.

816
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,880
I'll protect you next round.

817
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,600
Let's agree.

818
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,000
Whoever is the killer will drag him into it.

819
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,560
No problem.

820
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,160
I'll definitely drag him into it anyway.

821
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,880
Okay.

822
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Alright

823
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,080
This week's Tui Town General Affairs

824
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,120
ends here

825
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,640
Next week we'll follow the retro trend

826
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,240
and visit Tui Town in 1988

827
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,200
What juicy news will Tui Bao bring?

828
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
Same time, same place next week

829
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,640
More surprises await you
