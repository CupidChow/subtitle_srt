"Start Reasoning" Trial Version Game Rules

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,480
Six players per episode

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
Divided into four suspects and two investigators

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,240
to solve the case

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,360
The real culprit is hidden among the suspects

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,160
The culprit's task is to conceal their identity

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,000
without being discovered by others

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,760
Only the real culprit is allowed to lie

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,880
Notably

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,960
A new gameplay element is introduced

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
The player who is the culprit

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
if they pass a certain test

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,520
can choose one investigator

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,840
from the two

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,560
to turn into an X

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
X's task is to assist

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,200
the culprit during the investigation

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,680
and help them escape detection

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,320
Victory conditions:

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,920
After investigation, players vote for the culprit

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,880
If the culprit gets fewer votes than others

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,160
the culprit and X win

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
Otherwise, correct voters win

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,200
Welcome to

25

"Start Reasoning" Trial Version

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
I'm Reason Bao

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,200
Before the official recording

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
of "Start Reasoning" Season 2

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,520
we invited Laura, Wang Nengneng

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,920
Hou Zhuocheng, Yang Ruqing

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,760
Huang Kai, Hu Minghao

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,960
six guests to Reason Town

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
for a trial experience

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,160
Now let me, Reason Bao

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,920
watch together with everyone

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,440
and comment on the new residents' performances

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,320
Yesterday, June 3, 2004

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,760
marked the first day

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,680
of the three-day anniversary

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,400
at Reason Town Art Academy

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,680
Want to hear some rap?

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,840
Great but affordable

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,760
Exit left and scan to pay

44
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,160
Several students were rehearsing

45
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,560
"Reason Swan Lake" in the auditorium

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,440
when the screen suddenly showed

47
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,080
Zhi Daole's distress video

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
Everyone discovered

49
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,040
Zhi Daole dead in the prop cabinet

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,160
During the subsequent investigation by Tui Tan,

51
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
an empty piano room

52
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,600
revealed the second victim, TYP.

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,520
As the investigation deepened,

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,920
they discovered hidden behind the laundry room

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,920
the Tui Ke Empire.

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,760
This led to the speculation that both victims

57
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,240
might have been the forum moderator and 555 conspiring together.

58
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,440
However, regrettably,

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,360
the group failed to capture the true culprit,

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,760
allowing them to escape.

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,080
Bet you didn't see that coming.

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,880
Meanwhile, Tui Zhen Art Academy's anniversary celebration continues,

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,640
with the cast of the musical "Tui Goose Lake"

64
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,440
preparing for their performance in the small auditorium.

65
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,040
Someone died

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
Just as "Swan Lake" was about to begin

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
Everyone was drawn by Xiao Xiao's voice

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
to the backyard

69
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,320
Someone died

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,320
Xiao Xiao told everyone

71
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
Rui Sibai died in

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,120
the courtyard of the dormitory

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,400
Rui Sibai

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,920
At 11:20 in the morning,

75
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,840
I received an anonymous message.

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,040
It told me to come to the second-floor atrium.

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
As soon as I reached the second floor,

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,000
I looked through the glass window

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,480
and saw Sisi lying on the ground.

80
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,120
Then from the second-floor window,

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
I noticed the first-floor door was covered in tape.

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,520
I went downstairs,

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,640
but found the door wouldn't open

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
because of the tape.

85
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,840
So I went to the convenience store

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
and got a utility knife.

87
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,520
I used it to cut through the tape along the door seam.

88
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
When I got inside,

89
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
she was already dead.

90
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,120
I swear I had nothing to do with this.

91
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,760
Here's the thing -

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm the only one here

93
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,040
who's taken forensic courses.

94
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,240
I'll go get the autopsy kit.

95
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,440
Okay.

96
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,120
Wait for me.

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,640
Alright.

98
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,360
Hurry up.

99
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,600
Secure the crime scene.

100
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,360
Got it.

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,960
"Start Reasoning" Experience Version - Case 2

102
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,800
The Midnight Curse of Reasoning Arts

103
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,160
Officially begins

104
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,200
The date is June 4, 2004

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
The victim in this case is Sisi

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,360
She was a performing arts major

107
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
A sophomore at Tui Town Art College

108
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,040
After preliminary investigation

109
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,040
Sisi's death may have been homicide

110
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,080
The murderer

111
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,960
is likely among

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,600
Ah Kai

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,640
Luo Luo

114
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,080
Neng Neng

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,800
and Ming Hao

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,480
Ru Qing and Zhuo Cheng are temporarily cleared

117
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,360
So they'll serve as investigators

118
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,520
Both investigators

119
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Please remain at the scene for evidence collection

120
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,080
We can't look?

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,040
Suddenly everyone seems suspicious

122
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
Have a nice time

123
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,280
Head first

124
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,240
There's something in her pocket

125
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
I should die

126
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
It's printed

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,320
The scaffolding is 6 meters high.

128
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,280
She might have fallen from above.

129
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
But we can't rule out the possibility that she was pushed.

130
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,640
It says here that

131
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,840
This sign means you can't open it

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,200
The camera operator is inside

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,480
Then on her phone

134
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,920
Let me see if there's any other information

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
Right, let's check the phone again

136
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,320
It's here

137
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,080
The killer is

138
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,760
10:10 AM

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm Wei from the convenience store

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,240
My colleague checked the dormitory entrance

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,600
The surveillance at the store entrance

142
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,240
Suddenly Wei appeared

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
Providing a clue to the two investigators

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,480
So the investigators came to check the store

145
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
It should be this one

146
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,520
There's one here

147
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,560
There's one on this computer

148
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,000
A chat dialog with the store manager

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,760
The two investigators at the crime scene

150
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,160
After collecting evidence

151
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,880
Brought four suspects to the interrogation room

152
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,520
For questioning

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,840
This appears to be a pharmacy

154
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,640
But actually it's the town's investigation center

155
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's all share

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
our connections with the deceased, Sisi.

157
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,640
Sisi and I were classmates and roommates.

158
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,360
I was Sisi's senior at school.

159
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Sisi was my junior.

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
We rehearsed a play together.

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Sisi and I were classmates.

162
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,200
I admired her directing talent.

163
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
I thought we could have been great

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
creative partners.

165
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
She created many musicals,

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,480
and I performed in some of them.

167
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,920
But it was purely artistic collaboration.

168
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,800
She was my classmate.

169
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,480
Her expertise in musical theater

170
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
was quite remarkable.

171
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,800
I really wanted to collaborate with her.

172
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,360
Sister Ruisi Bai was my

173
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
very good director friend.

174
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,600
She often helped us rehearse plays.

175
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,920
I was also one of the actors

176
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,360
in her drama troupe.

177
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,480
Alright, now that we've all described

178
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,960
our relationships with Ruisi Bai,

179
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,200
let's share

180
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
the crime scene investigation report

181
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
and the evidence we've collected.

182
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,600
First, about today's incident:

183
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,960
The victim was Ruisi Bai.

184
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,360
The incident occurred on June 4th

185
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
at 11:40 in the morning.

186
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,440
The location was the dormitory courtyard.

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,400
The evidence we found at the scene:

188
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,440
First, the autopsy report

189
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,960
provided by classmate Xiao Xiao.

190
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,920
Yes, everyone can look at the autopsy report.

191
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,840
The victim had ligature marks on her ankles,

192
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,320
severe head trauma,

193
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
intracranial bleeding,

194
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
and multiple internal organ injuries.

195
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,240
Cause of death was an 8-meter fall.

196
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,000
Estimated time of death was

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,680
on June 4th

198
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,840
between 10:00 and 11:00 AM.

199
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
Then I'd like to ask everyone

200
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,920
Between 10 to 11 this morning

201
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,680
what were you all doing?

202
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,960
The detective immediately

203
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,160
questioned everyone

204
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,040
about their whereabouts

205
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
between 10 and 11 am

206
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,640
trying to find anything unusual

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
Unexpectedly, all four suspects

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,400
after 10:30 am

209
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,640
were paired up together

210
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,280
At around 10:30 am

211
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,040
I went to find my sister Luo Luo

212
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,960
planning to teach her some singing

213
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,800
since we were all rehearsing

214
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
for "Swan Goose Lake"

215
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
From 10:30 to 11 am

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,400
A Kai and Luo Luo were in the school courtyard

217
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,160
Their conversation turned into an argument

218
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,720
and Luo Luo ended up crying

219
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,400
While Ming Hao and Neng Neng

220
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,480
from 10:30 to 11:15 am

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,880
were together in the dance studio

222
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,600
practicing the fight scene between the Demon King and Prince

223
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,280
Before 10:30 am

224
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,080
Luo Luo was reading in the courtyard

225
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,960
A Kai was practicing vocals in the recording studio

226
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,560
Ming Hao was watching a movie by the Wu Ke Nai River

227
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,280
Neng Neng was organizing props in the storage room

228
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,800
So currently,

229
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM,

230
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,080
there are basically mutual alibis

231
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,160
that can be verified.

232
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,480
But between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM,

233
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,360
currently,

234
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,040
yes, there are no alibis.

235
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,520
Since between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM,

236
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,200
the four suspects were paired together,

237
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,080
the preliminary suspicion is

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
that the crime was more likely

239
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,760
committed before 10:30 AM.

240
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
By checking Sisi's phone, we found

241
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,520
an unknown number

242
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
sent a message to Sisi

243
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
at 10:10 AM.

244
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
At 10:10 AM,

245
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,080
an unknown phone number

246
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,200
sent Sisi a message saying:

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
"Come to the laundry room.

248
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,800
I'll tell you the truth about Xiao Ai's suicide."

249
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,800
The unknown number lured Sisi

250
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
under the pretense of revealing

251
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,960
the truth about Xiao Ai's death.

252
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,640
Then, in the convenience store's computer,

253
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,360
we found some chat logs.

254
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,600
The store clerk mentioned in the logs

255
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,680
that Sisi entered the dormitory at 10:15 AM.

256
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,360
This proves Sisi was still alive at 10:15.

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,440
She likely went to the laundry room

258
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
after receiving the message.

259
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
The laundry room was where the killer

260
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,920
arranged to meet Sisi.

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
Now we can actually

262
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,040
narrow down Sisi's time of death

263
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,320
to between 10:15 AM and 10:30 AM.

264
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,080
Then the investigator turned his attention

265
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
to the fatal fall height.

266
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,640
Let's continue examining

267
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,960
this autopsy report.

268
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,840
The medical examiner concluded it was an 8-meter fatal fall.

269
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,560
The autopsy report indicates an 8-meter fall height.

270
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,120
However, at the scene in the courtyard,

271
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,960
the highest construction scaffold was only 6 meters.

272
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,880
The highest scaffold measured just 6 meters.

273
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,000
So there's a height discrepancy.

274
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,360
Moreover, since yesterday when student Ai Changge

275
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,320
fell into the courtyard,

276
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,680
the school has sealed off

277
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,600
all windows above the second floor.

278
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,320
Eliminating the possibility of falling

279
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
from upper floor windows.

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,960
This leaves a temporary mystery:

281
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,760
how could she fall 8 meters

282
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,360
in a courtyard without that height?

283
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,480
The investigator also found

284
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,760
ligature marks on the feet

285
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,520
and a printed note

286
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,280
reading "I deserve to die."

287
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,840
Next, Zhuocheng shared

288
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,880
the biggest mystery of the case.

289
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,600
According to Xiao Xiao's testimony,

290
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,480
at 11:20 am,

291
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,560
he received an anonymous message

292
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
telling him to go to the second floor.

293
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,320
At 11:20 am,

294
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,080
I got an anonymous text

295
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,880
telling me to come to the second-floor courtyard.

296
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,960
Then from the second-floor window,

297
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,640
he saw a girl lying in the courtyard.

298
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,520
And the courtyard door

299
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
was sealed with tape from inside.

300
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,040
He rushed down,

301
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,280
found the door wouldn't open,

302
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,040
went to get a utility knife,

303
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,760
cut the tape along the door seam,

304
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,120
and entered the courtyard

305
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,880
to discover Rui Sisi's body.

306
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,120
The courtyard had only one entrance,

307
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,760
and as you saw,

308
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,080
it was sealed from inside.

309
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,560
What's puzzling is:

310
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,520
if the killer wanted to fake

311
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,760
a falling accident,

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
why seal the door with tape?

313
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,520
Could it be that he actually wanted to create

314
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,720
the atmosphere of a locked-room scenario?

315
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Perhaps he believed that Sisi

316
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,640
truly committed suicide

317
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,480
rather than being murdered.

318
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,080
Right, he wanted to fabricate

319
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,400
that she pasted it herself before jumping.

320
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes, because she wrote "I deserve to die"

321
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
but this note might have been forged by the killer.

322
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
So this is a locked-room murder case.

323
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,560
What about upstairs?

324
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,280
Could someone come down from above?

325
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,600
Theoretically, no.

326
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,160
Because logistics has already

327
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,640
sealed all windows above the second floor.

328
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,800
But were there any damages to second-floor windows?

329
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,120
No.

330
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,040
Meaning they couldn't be opened, right?

331
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,520
Correct.

332
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,080
Moreover, the convenience store surveillance shows

333
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,360
that between 10:00 and 11:30,

334
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,680
only Sisi and Xiao Xiao appeared.

335
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,080
So how did the murderer disappear from

336
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,760
this courtyard locked room

337
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,960
and move through the dormitory to commit the crime

338
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,040
without being caught on the store's cameras?

339
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,720
Therefore, everyone speculates

340
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,440
there must be

341
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,080
another path that bypasses the dormitory entrance

342
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,480
leading to the courtyard.

343
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
The investigative sharing session comes to an end.

344
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,080
Then A-Kai shared

345
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
the evidence he had found,

346
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,080
which brought Neng Neng's hidden secret

347
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,800
and concealed murderous intent to light.

348
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,680
Neng Neng treasured a sketchbook

349
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
containing drawings of her younger self

350
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
and a girl with nine pockmarks

351
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,800
named Canary.

352
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,320
It documented their happy memories

353
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,080
together abroad.

354
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,400
There was a drawing of a boy and a girl

355
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,240
having a meal together.

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,200
What does this writing say?

357
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,320
Canary.

358
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,960
Canary (meaning "goldfinch").

359
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,960
It's you.

360
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,880
You actually know such an obscure word.

361
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
Pushing the Eiffel Tower,

362
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
seven-star Michelin restaurants...

363
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,720
You seem quite proud of yourself.

364
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,920
No, I'm not.

365
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,680
So this is a drawing of you and me?

366
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Isn't that right, Neng Neng?

367
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Just when everyone thought

368
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,240
this Canary

369
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,280
was Luo Luo from childhood,

370
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,560
a suicide letter revealed the truth.

371
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,320
Terrence

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,280
so it was you all along?

373
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,840
This...

374
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,800
I want to say goodbye to you.

375
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,080
Please don't think it's sudden.

376
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,680
Let me tell you a story.

377
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Until you transferred to our class,

378
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,640
even after all these years,

379
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
I recognized you at first sight.

380
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,120
I just never expected

381
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
you'd become one of those

382
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,040
who ignore me in the crowd.

383
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,200
But still, thank you

384
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,840
for giving me those pure, beautiful memories.

385
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,680
I'm leaving now.

386
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,400
I hope your future is smooth sailing,

387
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,280
filled with happiness and joy.

388
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
A Canary who will sing no more.

389
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,520
Ai Singing who fell from the building...

390
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,480
Yes,

391
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,120
Luo Luo.

392
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,960
He's grieving for her.

393
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,480
Explain yourself clearly.

394
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,480
Does everyone remember yesterday?

395
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,560
After 10 o'clock at night,

396
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,520
I found a letter

397
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,760
slipped through the dormitory door.

398
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,120
It's the letter you're holding now.

399
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,880
Actually, since last September

400
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,840
after joining Tuiyi

401
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,160
I suddenly saw Luoluo

402
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
who had nine pimples

403
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,240
and was also called Canary

404
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,920
I was certain she was the one I met

405
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,160
by the Tuina riverside ten years ago

406
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080
Substitute Literature

407
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,720
You treated my sister as a substitute

408
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,560
Exactly

409
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,720
But I still feel remorse towards her

410
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
At the same time, I feel

411
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,760
longing for the real Canary

412
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,000
Because she ultimately fell down the air shaft

413
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
was taken to the hospital

414
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,040
but couldn't be saved

415
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,800
My heart is filled with anguish

416
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,640
It turns out Nengneng and Luoluo's love

417
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,400
originated from a misunderstanding

418
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,480
while the real Canary, Ai Singing

419
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,840
Ai Singing jumped to her death

420
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,760
She already fell to her death

421
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,560
When Nengneng was grief-stricken

422
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,800
she received an anonymous private message

423
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,920
on Tweet Empire

424
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,240
The message described how

425
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,080
the school bully Rui Sibai

426
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,800
Rui Sibai

427
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,960
bullied Ai Singing

428
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,000
Rui Sibai rigged the votes

429
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
causing Ai Singing

430
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
to become last place

431
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
in the Talent Star voting

432
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,440
Afterwards, Ai Singing was ostracized

433
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,680
treated as invisible

434
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,760
It's speculated that when Talent Star

435
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,200
held another competition yesterday

436
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,160
Ai Singing feared she would

437
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,400
still be last place

438
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,960
Unable to endure

439
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,000
the pain of covert bullying

440
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,440
she chose suicide

441
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,680
It was around 11 PM that night

442
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
I was grieving alone by the riverside

443
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
At midnight

444
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,520
I received this private message

445
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,200
I'd always been cold to her before

446
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,640
Why were you so cold to her?

447
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,480
Because classmates would tell me

448
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,040
to stay away from Ai Singing

449
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,920
But I never imagined Ai Singing was actually

450
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
my former Canary

451
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,200
I believe my coldness

452
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,600
indirectly caused her death

453
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,000
So you hate Rui Sibo deeply

454
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,280
Yes, I truly hate Rui Sibo

455
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
Can you tell me when the message was sent?

456
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,720
It was at midnight

457
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,240
Midnight

458
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,720
Correct

459
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,320
Although Rui Sibo bullied Ai Singing

460
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,560
but according to the phone we found at the scene

461
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,520
the text said "Come to the laundry room"

462
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,080
"I'll tell you the truth about Ai Singing's suicide"

463
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,520
So it definitely wasn't Rui Sibo

464
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,680
who pushed Ai Singing, right?

465
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,360
Actually, Rui Sibo was also

466
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
searching for the truth

467
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,800
investigating Ai Singing's suicide

468
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,800
Then why would Rui Sibo investigate

469
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,000
the suicide of someone she bullied?

470
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,480
This logic seems very strange to me

471
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,320
So it's possible that Ai Singing

472
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,680
and Rui Sibo

473
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,400
had some other connection

474
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,800
It shouldn't just be a simple bully-victim relationship

475
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,200
Right

476
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
And is it possible that

477
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,480
the text message from that unknown phone

478
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,240
and the one saying "I know the truth" to Huinengneng

479
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,680
were sent by the same person?

480
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
The next piece of evidence is

481
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,160
a large piece of tree bark

482
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,880
with a pig's nose imprint on it.

483
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,120
Actually, after midnight,

484
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,000
after receiving that private message,

485
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,600
I went to the common areas of the dormitory

486
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,520
to walk around

487
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,360
and clear my mind.

488
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,520
Then I suddenly realized I'd left my phone behind,

489
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,200
so I returned to the Wukenai River.

490
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,080
Just as I found it,

491
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,240
I heard a loud bang -

492
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
two trees suddenly fell down.

493
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
That's when I saw a pig-headed monster

494
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,120
ramming into trees.

495
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
The pig-headed monster was knocking down trees.

496
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,560
After the monster finished,

497
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,240
I collected some evidence under the trees

498
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,640
and obtained this

499
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
piece of bark with the pig's nose imprint.

500
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
Then ahead there was a dinosaur monster.

501
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,920
Now there's a pig-headed monster too

502
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,280
I'm utterly astonished

503
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,800
The pig-headed monster crashed into a tree

504
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,360
So terrifying

505
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,280
What's even scarier is

506
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,480
the pig-headed monster appeared right after

507
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,920
Luo Luo found Ming Hao's

508
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,400
T-shirt covered in leaves and mud

509
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,960
pants

510
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,880
prop handcuffs

511
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,840
During questioning, Ming Hao described

512
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,800
how he turned into a pig-headed monster at midnight

513
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,760
"I was sleeping last night

514
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
when suddenly I felt like I was hit

515
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
Then I opened my eyes

516
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,320
and saw not the dorm room

517
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,360
but a riverside

518
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,880
There were two fallen trees

519
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,440
I was really confused

520
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
and wondered why I was there

521
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
I tried to wipe my face

522
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
to see what was going on

523
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,280
Then I felt a pig snout

524
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,800
You also felt a pig snout?

525
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,080
You touched your face and felt a pig snout?

526
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,280
Yes, I touched my head

527
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,240
and felt it was huge

528
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,440
Then my ears moved upward

529
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
When I reached the dorm

530
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I saw my reflection in the door

531
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,800
and realized my head had turned into a pig's

532
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,840
He is the pig-headed monster

533
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,800
I didn't want to be seen by others either

534
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,960
But I was also afraid to say

535
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
Because I was initially in the dorm

536
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,040
Then later went to the riverside

537
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,480
Could it have been sleepwalking?

538
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
Then I was afraid I'd fall asleep and sleepwalk around again

539
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
So I went to the prop storage

540
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,000
And took one of those

541
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,480
Handcuffs

542
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,400
After taking them

543
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
I went straight back to the dorm

544
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,520
Then handcuffed myself to the bed and fell asleep

545
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,840
Do you roughly know when

546
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,680
You returned to the dorm?

547
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,680
I don't know that

548
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,600
I only know it was

549
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,280
After 12 at night

550
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,840
Because at that time I

551
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,040
Wasn't in the mood to check my phone

552
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,480
Or confirm the time or anything

553
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
Then under Minghao's bed

554
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,680
There was a blood-stained shirt

555
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,080
Why was that?

556
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Before I turned into the pig-headed monster,

557
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,880
I was writing lyrics for my own rap song.

558
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,720
Suddenly, I heard in the hallway

559
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,800
hurried footsteps

560
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,360
and some moaning sounds,

561
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,960
like someone was in pain.

562
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,320
Then I got curious,

563
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,400
so I cracked open the dorm door

564
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,080
to peek outside.

565
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,360
I saw someone completely wrapped in bandages,

566
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,720
still bleeding.

567
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Dead or alive?

568
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,680
Alive.

569
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,920
Because he was carrying something

570
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,160
while walking toward the stairwell.

571
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,600
He kept looking around,

572
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,920
so I quickly and quietly closed the door.

573
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,880
I was afraid he might see me.

574
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,200
After making sure he was gone,

575
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,680
I dared to go out and look.

576
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,320
He was indeed no longer in the hallway,

577
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,840
but at the stairwell,

578
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,360
I saw this

579
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,120
bloodstained shirt.

580
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,840
Minghao first found

581
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,640
the blood-soaked bandaged man's

582
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,040
dropped bloody shirt.

583
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,320
Then he woke up from a nightmare,

584
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,760
only to find he had turned into a pig-headed monster.

585
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,800
These bizarre incidents

586
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,440
seem connected to

587
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,880
an online post.

588
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,800
Luoluo found on Minghao's computer

589
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,920
a campus forum discussion post.

590
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,280
The post discussed

591
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,240
a musical directed by Ruisibai

592
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,800
"Pig Head."

593
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
"Pig Head" tells the story of a child star

594
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,120
who loses himself

595
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,560
after achieving early fame.

596
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,960
It stars this year's last-place

597
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,040
Push Art Star, Hu Jie.

598
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,560
"Pig Head" is a pun on "pig-headed,"

599
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,320
and this name

600
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,160
was what Minghao used to mock Hu Jie.

601
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,800
It seems you have

602
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,320
some unpleasant history

603
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,920
with the male lead of "Pig Head."

604
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,680
May I ask what happened?

605
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
I wouldn't say I hate him.

606
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
Just find him a bit annoying.

607
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,080
It was around March last year.

608
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,840
He transferred to our program at Tuiyi.

609
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,640
But back then,

610
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
I was too busy dating Luoluo

611
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
to pay much attention to him.

612
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,960
However, when I slept,

613
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,040
I kept hearing someone snoring.

614
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,880
The snoring would go up and down,

615
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
and was intermittent.

616
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,320
This snoring

617
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,800
really affected my sleep.

618
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,480
To the point that during several performances,

619
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,680
I was yawning while rapping on stage.

620
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,120
So I decided

621
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,920
I had to find out who was snoring.

622
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,200
I pressed my ear against every dorm door,

623
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,280
listening one by one.

624
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,840
Finally traced it to A-Kai and Hu Jie's room.

625
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,600
where it was coming from.

626
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,320
I knocked on their door,

627
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,120
and when it opened,

628
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,800
Hu Jie wasn't there,

629
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,520
only A-Kai was.

630
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
So I asked A-Kai,

631
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
"Is Hu Jie the one who snores every night?"

632
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,800
And A-Kai said it was Hu Jie.

633
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,000
So I concluded that Hu Jie

634
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,960
was the snorer,

635
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
the culprit.

636
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
Yes, that's my grudge against Hu Jie.

637
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,800
Because Hu Jie's snoring

638
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,920
affected Minghao's performance.

639
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,720
So to get back at Hu Jie,

640
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,080
Minghao nicknamed him "Piggy."

641
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,400
Hu Jie embarrassed me during performances,

642
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,800
so I wanted him

643
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,280
to taste some embarrassment too.

644
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,720
People speculate

645
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
there might be a connection between "Piggy" and Minghao turning into a pig-headed monster.

646
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,760
(Repeats speculation from previous line)

647
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,720
Coincidentally,

648
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,640
A-Kai also experienced

649
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,080
something bizarre last night.

650
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,960
The sheets, pillowcases, and even his pants...

651
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,520
Okay, let's spread out the bedsheet and take a look.

652
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,280
Really, is there something...

653
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,120
There's a watermark.

654
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,040
Bedwetting.

655
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,680
The whole thing is damp with bloodstains.

656
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,560
Last night when I was almost asleep,

657
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,320
I vaguely felt

658
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,240
intense pain all over my body.

659
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,320
When I opened my eyes,

660
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,200
I found many wounds appearing on my body.

661
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,720
They just appeared out of nowhere.

662
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,440
On my chest, belly, and limbs,

663
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
they were all splitting open.

664
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,480
And bleeding.

665
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,840
Instinctively, I immediately

666
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,960
took out my first aid kit from under my bed.

667
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,880
and bandaged myself up.

668
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,720
I often got injured doing extra work before,

669
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,000
so I'm quite good at bandaging.

670
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,320
After bandaging, I changed

671
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,880
out of these clothes

672
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,360
and took them to the laundry room.

673
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,320
So the person Lin Hao saw must have been me.

674
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,160
Then I saw someone covered in bandages

675
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,960
still bleeding.

676
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,880
While running there, it really hurt again,

677
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,040
and I kept bleeding.

678
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,080
So scary, I'm not watching anymore.

679
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,240
Everyone can take a look.

680
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,760
It's a blurred shadow.

681
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,880
Stealing some food from the convenience store.

682
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,440
Yes, it particularly likes to eat dragon beard candy.

683
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,720
Look, it took out all the dragon beard candy.

684
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
It took everything out.

685
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,600
Yesterday (June 3rd), wasn't it...

686
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,640
After 10:30 PM...

687
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,960
we all went our separate ways?

688
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,320
Then I went to the front yard...

689
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,920
to practice the aria from "Pushing Goose Lake."

690
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,240
I checked the time...

691
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,680
and it was almost midnight.

692
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,040
At that point, I was about to return to the dorm.

693
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,200
Then when I got back to the dorm...

694
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Just as I stepped into the dorm building...

695
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
I heard from over there...

696
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,280
rustling...

697
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,040
scraping and crunching sounds.

698
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,840
I thought it was either a thief...

699
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,760
or a monster.

700
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,960
Because we saw some monsters yesterday too.

701
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
Then, terrified, I quickly...

702
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
took a step back.

703
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,480
I hid in the corner...

704
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,680
and secretly took a photo with my phone.

705
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,040
Then I saw it was a dark figure...

706
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,680
with dragon beard candy all over the floor.

707
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,840
It was frantically eating...

708
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,760
as if it was starving.

709
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,120
After seeing it, did you do anything?

710
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Did you tell anyone else?

711
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,760
Did you tell Hu Jie?

712
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,560
The strange thing is, Hu Jie wasn't in the dorm.

713
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,240
I didn't see him either.

714
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,640
Then, Nengneng found another post on the campus forum

715
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,800
a top trending thread

716
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,680
that turned Hu Jie from a beloved child star

717
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,080
into someone everyone despised

718
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,920
The post's content

719
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,800
was an insider's full exposé on Hu Jie

720
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,720
covering everything

721
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
including but not limited to plastic surgery

722
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,680
loud snoring

723
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,040
privately insulting fans

724
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,960
dating 18 girlfriends simultaneously

725
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,280
being late due to arrogance

726
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,880
fighting, gambling, and more

727
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,760
People suspected A-Kai's intense interest in this post

728
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
meant he was involved in one of the leaks

729
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,680
But it was soon discovered

730
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,360
that all the information in the post

731
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,520
was leaked by A-Kai himself

732
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,360
and all of it was fabricated

733
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,960
You've got the gossip

734
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,560
Accounts of random people A, B, C, D

735
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,840
It's not that he has all of these

736
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,920
Fake accounts

737
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,480
Then there's plastic surgery mentioned behind

738
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,320
Badmouthing fans behind their backs

739
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,720
Dating eighteen girlfriends simultaneously

740
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,800
Seems we don't even need to fabricate evidence

741
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,200
Now people will believe whatever is said

742
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,360
You little hater

743
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,680
What exactly is between you and Hu Jie

744
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,920
Such deep-seated hatred?

745
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,240
On the tallest thread in the forum

746
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,640
Spreading rumors about him

747
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,960
I just asked him if even one

748
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,520
Was posted by him

749
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,560
Turns out all of them were posted by him

750
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
LOL

751
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,000
Come on, haters

752
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,240
So cyberbullying was your doing

753
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Now, explain this

754
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,680
June 10, 2003

755
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,560
In our town Tui Zhen

756
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,720
The latest issue of "Tui Zhen Gossip"

757
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,000
I saw an article that infuriated me

758
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,360
Claiming child stars are better than grassroots actors

759
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,520
The epic "Ambush in Plain Sight"

760
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,840
Might be replacing the male lead

761
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,440
When I had already agreed with the director

762
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
That I would be the male lead

763
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,480
But they claimed with certainty I'd be replaced

764
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,840
And have Hu Jie take the role

765
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,720
This made me furious

766
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
Why does everyone adore him

767
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,680
While the media just uses me

768
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,840
As a tool to promote him

769
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,760
I thought since everyone believes

770
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
He's so brilliant

771
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,400
I would destroy him

772
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,200
Ruin his public image completely

773
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,360
So on June 12

774
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,800
I registered a Guagua Le account

775
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,400
Posted my first article

776
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,240
Created many derivative works

777
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,920
Derivative content

778
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,440
Produced lots of derivative works

779
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,400
Fabricating damaging rumors

780
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,440
But I felt

781
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,840
This wasn't convincing enough

782
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,600
So I created multiple accounts

783
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,960
Random bystanders A, B, C, D

784
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,840
And I even fabricated some

785
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,120
"Concrete evidence"

786
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,800
For example, the rumor about him getting plastic surgery

787
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,360
So I photoshopped his pictures to look ugly

788
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,560
And the one about insulting fans

789
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,880
Actually, I personally heard

790
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
I heard Hu Jie

791
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,800
helping someone with an audition

792
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,120
But I edited out

793
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,760
the context

794
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,160
and only kept this part

795
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,520
where he seemed to be insulting fans

796
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,080
Then I posted the edited audio online

797
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,000
The snoring rumor was also made up by me

798
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,200
Actually, that snoring sound was me

799
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,360
Later when there were

800
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
so many "proofs" against him

801
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,680
many people already disliked him

802
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,320
and joined in bashing him online

803
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,520
As it progressed

804
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,880
more and more rumors emerged

805
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,040
When the hype grew bigger

806
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,880
people would believe anything I made up

807
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,920
A'Kai, out of jealousy

808
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,760
spread baseless rumors to slander Hu Jie

809
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,280
Then strange phenomena appeared with him covered in blood

810
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,120
Similar things happened to

811
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,040
Luo Luo

812
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,360
Luo Luo never liked dragon beard candy since childhood

813
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,560
But last midnight

814
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,640
while completely unconscious

815
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,480
was found at a store devouring dragon beard candy

816
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,040
First question

817
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,880
It's quite tasty.

818
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,440
Just crispy, crunchy.

819
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,560
Just like when it was captured in his photo.

820
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,960
That exact moment.

821
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,800
The one in the photo.

822
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,920
The shadow captured in the photo was you.

823
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,840
Yes.

824
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,680
Probably, though I'm not sure.

825
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,160
Because in my memory,

826
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,720
I don't like dragon beard candy.

827
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
Then why were you there

828
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,520
at that time?

829
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,360
It's because that day

830
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,800
I felt very strange.

831
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,440
My head was dizzy and swollen,

832
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,800
then suddenly I entered the convenience store.

833
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,880
I started eating dragon beard candy.

834
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,200
You were conscious.

835
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,360
I wasn't conscious.

836
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,840
Additionally, Minghao also found

837
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
the chat records between Luoluo and Ai Singing.

838
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,080
They documented how

839
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
Luoluo emotionally manipulated Ai Singing

840
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,760
to serve her own purposes.

841
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,240
Then when Ai Singing became

842
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,200
the last place in "Star of Pushing Arts",

843
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,560
she completely ignored her.

844
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,400
This added heavy weight

845
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,640
to Ai Singing's suicidal thoughts.

846
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,320
It's suffocating me.

847
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,800
I'm leaving.

848
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,000
Goodbye.

849
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm not that bad of a person.

850
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,320
I've always just liked

851
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,520
singing with Sister Ai

852
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,240
We lived together

853
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,200
She always took good care of me

854
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,480
I felt she was like a real sister to me

855
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,720
Then why last year

856
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,920
did you cut ties with her?

857
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,040
Does everyone know about

858
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,760
the unwritten rule at school?

859
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,480
That the last place in the Talent Star competition

860
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,200
can't be spoken to

861
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,360
I think Luo Luo's relationship with Ai

862
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,160
wasn't so much good

863
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,640
as it was that she

864
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,960
treated her like a maid

865
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,080
That's true actually

866
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,920
You saw through her true nature

867
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,600
Also, from Luo Luo's

868
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,320
dorm check with the supervisor last night

869
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,560
no one was in their rooms at that time

870
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,320
But Ru Qing claimed she went to bed early

871
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,960
Why wasn't she found

872
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,360
during the room check?

873
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,760
In my memory

874
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,600
because of today's performance

875
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,520
I actually went to bed at 11 for beauty sleep

876
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,640
But Luo Luo just said

877
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,400
I wasn't actually in the dorm

878
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,280
This is what's strange to me

879
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,200
I don't know if it's because

880
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,720
I also lost consciousness

881
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,800
To summarize one point,

882
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,000
A-Kai, Luo Luo and I

883
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,040
have all actually engaged in bullying behaviors.

884
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,200
One was spreading rumors,

885
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,480
one was giving people nicknames,

886
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,520
and one was that cold indifference.

887
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,640
That's why we're all experiencing these

888
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,200
supernatural phenomena.

889
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,160
Just with different targets.

890
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
So perhaps these phenomena we're experiencing

891
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,800
are punishments for our bullying.

892
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,280
There might be some kind of

893
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,360
mechanism in this school

894
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
that punishes

895
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,720
those who bully others with retribution.

896
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,760
I understand now.

897
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,600
You just asked why she changed the script.

898
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,400
This morning at 7am,

899
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,360
Rui Sibai woke me up

900
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,480
and asked me

901
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,640
if we could change the white swan to a black swan.

902
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
She said it would make the script more dramatic.

903
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,400
So I agreed.

904
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,280
Last night, Ai Changge died.

905
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,240
She was bullied by Rui Sibai, right?

906
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,920
Right.

907
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,480
So the white swan became a black swan.

908
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
She changed the script.

909
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,160
So it was Ai Changge's

910
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
spirit possessing Rui Sibai.

911
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,080
Perhaps Rui Sibai learned that Ai Changge jumped

912
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,080
because of the bullying she led.

913
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,960
So she faked it to make it seem

914
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,320
that Rui Sibai knew about this

915
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,440
and felt she deserved to die.

916
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,680
She jumped herself.

917
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,000
But in reality, wasn't it

918
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
someone taking revenge for Ai Changge

919
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
and staging this

920
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,240
locked-room murder case?

921
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,960
That should be it. It makes sense.

922
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,400
Next, we will enter the X confirmation phase

923
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,680
In this episode

924
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,040
The player acting as the murderer

925
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,040
will face the trial of X

926
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,280
If the true murderer succeeds in the trial

927
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,400
they can choose between the two detectives

928
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,440
to corrupt one of them

929
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,160
At first glance it's clearly

930
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,880
Don't point at me

931
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
It's definitely you pointing at me

932
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
A family torn apart situation

933
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,920
It might not necessarily be this one

934
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,680
You seem different today compared to yesterday

935
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,760
quite noticeably so

936
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,280
Is it Ruqing who can't hide her smile

937
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,840
or Zhuocheng pretending to be calm?

938
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,880
Or perhaps there's no X in this case at all?

939
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll keep you in suspense for now

940
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,720
Let's continue watching.

941
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,680
Then let's go search for evidence in the dormitory.

942
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,600
Check the scene.

943
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,240
How about going to my dorm room first?

944
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,160
Because Sisi and I are roommates.

945
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,200
This way.

946
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,160
102

947
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,040
Following Xu Duocheng's suggestion,

948
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,080
everyone decided to start with Xu Duocheng

949
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,880
and the deceased Sisi's dorm room, 102.

950
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,560
There's a computer and a notebook here.

951
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,200
Let's take a look.

952
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,400
This is Ruisi Bai's account

953
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,840
Yes, log in

954
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,280
She sent messages to three people

955
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,560
Let's see A'Kai's first

956
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,760
Don't vote for Ai Singing in this year's Rising Star Awards

957
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,600
Or you won't be in my musicals anymore

958
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,040
Dear sister, for this year's Rising Star Awards

959
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,760
don't vote for Ai Singing

960
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,200
Otherwise, as long as it's my musical

961
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,440
you can forget about being in it

962
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,920
Ruisi Bai also rallied everyone

963
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,160
not to vote for Hu Jie

964
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,080
or they wouldn't be in the musical

965
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,760
It's Ruisi Bai

966
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
who's been bullying everyone

967
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,800
Give me one of your personal items, it's urgent

968
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,320
A'Kai asked what for

969
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,040
Ruisi Bai said

970
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,600
I want to create a custom play for you

971
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,920
using your personal items for scenes

972
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,480
A'Kai said that sounds interesting

973
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,800
Is a 10cm height-increasing insole personal enough?

974
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,520
10cm height increase

975
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,240
Then at 11 PM, Ruisi Bai

976
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,040
asked Luoluo to also give her a personal item

977
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Ruisi Bai said,

978
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,320
"You'll be the heroine in all my scripts"

979
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,280
"The female lead has changed"

980
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,440
"Sis finally recognized my talent"

981
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,320
"My personal item is this book"

982
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,520
"How to Conquer Handsome Young Men"

983
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,240
She actually owns this book, okay?

984
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,880
Minghao gave a 2B pencil

985
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,920
Zhonghua brand, made in China

986
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,120
Essential item recommendation for every creator

987
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,200
Let's see if there are any personal items

988
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,480
I need to find that 2B pencil

989
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
You want to draw eyebrows, right?

990
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,400
Yes

991
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,680
Photo

992
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,920
What's with this photo, Ruqing?

993
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,840
Little Star Orphanage

994
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,240
You were adopted

995
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,960
Is this your photo?

996
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,520
Me with my grandpa

997
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,320
But I haven’t actually told anyone about this

998
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,880
Except for my good roommate

999
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,920
Alright, let’s head to Room 101 now

1000
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,960
Luo Luo and Ai’s singing dorm

1001
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,280
These are all Xiao Ai's singing awards.

1002
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,040
What

1003
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,640
Everyone, look at this

1004
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,960
If you see this text

1005
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,760
It means you're gradually mutating into

1006
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,160
the monster from campus legends

1007
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,920
The way to curse someone is

1008
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,680
to take their personal belongings

1009
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,240
to the hidden shrine in the night study room

1010
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,480
So the three of you

1011
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,840
Akai, Luoluo, and Minghao

1012
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,000
Last night everyone turned into monsters

1013
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,360
It turns out it was because of Ruisi Bai

1014
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,840
took your personal belongings to cast curses

1015
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,520
Everyone was in Luo Luo's dorm room

1016
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,640
where they found some mysterious writing

1017
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,600
It mentioned her personal belongings

1018
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,440
being placed on the shrine in the night study room

1019
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,640
and being cursed

1020
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,000
Luo Luo admitted that she

1021
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,360
went to check the night study room

1022
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,840
and found her personal book

1023
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,960
It was indeed placed on the shrine

1024
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,800
And a curse was stuck on its back

1025
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,680
Turning into a monster behind the white screen

1026
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,160
Losing control of one's body

1027
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,000
First, let's check our dorm

1028
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,560
Then everyone searched

1029
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,720
Minghao and Akai's dorm

1030
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,440
and found that both of them, like Luoluo

1031
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,200
had experienced exactly the same thing

1032
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,320
Year 2004

1033
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,600
Pig head on human body, appetite increased dramatically

1034
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Using "oink" to replace all responses

1035
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,040
Minghao was cursed

1036
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,280
Height-increasing insoles

1037
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,400
Ten centimeters tall

1038
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,480
With words written on them

1039
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,280
Bleeding all over, suffering unbearable pain

1040
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,520
Forever repeating

1041
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,080
This is your curse

1042
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,600
Yes

1043
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,520
I just happened to see that note

1044
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,560
Then I went to the night study room

1045
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,520
Found a shrine

1046
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,200
My shoe lifts are indeed inside

1047
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,840
I feel something beneath me

1048
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,080
Medicine

1049
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
For snoring

1050
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,320
It's you

1051
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,120
Yes, I mentioned earlier

1052
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,840
You snore

1053
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,440
I snore

1054
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,000
This seems like regular candy now

1055
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,840
This

1056
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,920
What is this?

1057
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,000
If you're reading this

1058
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
It means you're gradually becoming

1059
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,160
a monster from the campus horror legend

1060
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,680
So all cursed individuals will have

1061
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,520
this text

1062
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,360
It seems they all end up in the night study room

1063
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,880
found

1064
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,400
We need to go to the night study room

1065
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,640
Then let's check out the night study room

1066
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,560
Let's go

1067
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,880
You go first

1068
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,480
I'll bring up the rear

1069
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,920
Actually, I'll be last

1070
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,520
You stay in the middle

1071
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,240
They all saw the mysterious text first

1072
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
then went to the night study room

1073
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,960
before discovering they were cursed

1074
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,360
There's a password

1075
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,960
Password

1076
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,960
It's 6 characters

1077
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,560
Letters

1078
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,080
I think it's related to colors too

1079
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,920
23351 is green-blue

1080
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,440
pink

1081
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,640
Could it be green?

1082
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,320
Yes, green

1083
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,920
Then the second letter of green

1084
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,280
Right

1085
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,080
And blue is blue

1086
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,560
Smart

1087
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,120
run now

1088
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,520
Run now

1089
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,720
Come on

1090
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,320
I also have night blindness

1091
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,920
I want to go home

1092
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,000
Why should I play this?

1093
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,360
There's a candle here

1094
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
There's a match

1095
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,480
Everyone

1096
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,800
There's a piece of paper here, okay?

1097
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,000
Okay, let's continue.

1098
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Everyone find a seat.

1099
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,360
Then you sit on my left.

1100
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,960
Where's the safest place to sit?

1101
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,920
This way I can't hold on.

1102
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,160
Can there be a guy next to me?

1103
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,160
Pull it.

1104
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,720
Those two are open.

1105
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,800
Don't scare me

1106
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,160
This is safe

1107
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,640
Read it

1108
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,040
Sitting in the night study room

1109
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,440
After placing the candle on the marked circle on the table

1110
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,040
The lights will go out

1111
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,120
Light the candles in order and recite

1112
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,040
Tui Yi Strange Tales

1113
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,920
The door to the abandoned space will open

1114
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,600
Recite

1115
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,920
The four words "Tui Yi Strange Tales"

1116
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,880
I hope we don't actually summon something

1117
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,280
Happy birthday

1118
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,000
Happy birthday to you

1119
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,880
Happy birthday to you, Zhuocheng

1120
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,360
Making wishes on white candles is unlucky

1121
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,920
There's no specified order

1122
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,480
You scared me to death

1123
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,720
Good luck comes, wishing you good luck

1124
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,480
Good luck comes, wishing you good luck

1125
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,760
Help me click it

1126
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,240
Not that one

1127
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,040
To avoid being startled by sudden noises

1128
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,920
Don't burn yourself

1129
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,720
Good luck comes

1130
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,200
Good luck comes to us

1131
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Ready

1132
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,680
Say it together

1133
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,040
Three two one

1134
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
Pushing Arts Strange Tales

1135
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,320
It's open

1136
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,640
It's already open

1137
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,440
Let's go over there

1138
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,600
It's really very dark here

1139
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,360
So scary

1140
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,800
Happy New Year

1141
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,880
Wishing everyone a Happy New Year

1142
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,600
We sing, we dance

1143
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,000
Wishing everyone a Happy New Year

1144
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,440
Happy Birthday, Zhuocheng

1145
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,040
Wait a moment

1146
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,080
We've reached a door

1147
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,640
There's a light

1148
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,040
What is it?

1149
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,440
Revolving Door Instructions

1150
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,000
Due to long-term disrepair

1151
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,960
Each time the door revolves

1152
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,360
the angle may vary

1153
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,120
Let's go

1154
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,040
Going now

1155
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,560
Minghao

1156
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,760
So brave, Minghao

1157
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,640
How old are you?

1158
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,400
Bye bye

1159
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,640
Hope to see you again

1160
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,040
If you're scared, just scream

1161
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,440
How's the world over there?

1162
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,720
Keep making sounds, Minghao

1163
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,360
Minghao, are you still there?

1164
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,520
Minghao

1165
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,480
There's a skeleton here

1166
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,120
There's a skeleton here

1167
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,000
Skeleton

1168
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,920
Without it, he's just talking nonsense

1169
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,200
Nonsense

1170
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,480
Knit hat

1171
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,560
I'll go up first

1172
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,640
Good luck

1173
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,360
Goodbye

1174
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,160
Who is it?

1175
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,040
We're the same

1176
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,880
We're spinning differently

1177
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,240
Right

1178
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,760
No, I'm so scared

1179
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
I can't do this

1180
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm really about to cry

1181
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,760
Please don't scare me, I'm begging you

1182
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,480
Let's leave it at that

1183
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,440
Let's stay here

1184
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Don't scare us

1185
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,720
There's a room here

1186
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,960
What's this?

1187
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,960
Go

1188
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,440
Wait, I haven't gotten down yet

1189
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,320
Is there a slope here?

1190
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,080
There's a step

1191
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,720
Wait, there's a step here

1192
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,480
Slow down

1193
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,800
Got down

1194
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,160
Is it over?

1195
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,000
It's over.

1196
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,120
Let's go, there's a door upstairs anyway.

1197
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,800
Go, get out.

1198
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,320
You go push this door, I don't dare

1199
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,400
Wait a moment

1200
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,640
This needs unlocking

1201
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,520
Hold on

1202
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,560
Ruisibai's secret space

1203
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,440
Every time we leave the secret space

1204
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,400
We must remind ourselves to hide the keys in

1205
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,440
The abandoned toilet and abandoned bathroom

1206
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,480
This secret space

1207
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,000
So are they in the abandoned bathroom?

1208
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,560
Can we communicate?

1209
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,040
Can you hear us?

1210
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:15,920
We can hear you

1211
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,480
On our side

1212
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,920
Let me read it for you

1213
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,640
We need two keys here

1214
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,880
One is in the toilet

1215
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,160
One is in the abandoned bathroom

1216
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,640
Bathroom

1217
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,000
"Yan" room

1218
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,280
Who's in the toilet?

1219
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,640
Who's in the bathroom?

1220
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,360
Key

1221
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,040
Keys

1222
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,760
I really don't dare to go

1223
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,360
We're both cowards

1224
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,360
We're the coward team

1225
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,920
Not joking at all

1226
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,760
We can't move right now

1227
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,040
My legs are weak

1228
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,440
Please, seriously

1229
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,400
Please

1230
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,760
Although I said in 2024

1231
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,320
I would be braver

1232
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,120
But not brave in this situation

1233
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,760
Luoluo Nengneng, what's on your side?

1234
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,600
We don't dare to go out

1235
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,160
Let's go to their place.

1236
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,480
Thank you, Zhuocheng.

1237
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,800
We're coming to look now.

1238
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,240
Okay.

1239
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,400
Thanks for your hard work.

1240
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,360
Slow down.

1241
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,880
It's fine.

1242
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,600
We really look like...

1243
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,800
You know what?

1244
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,000
The life-cherishing old folks group.

1245
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,640
Right.

1246
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,760
All masculinity is gone today.

1247
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,200
Does that make you a little sad?

1248
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,640
But there's no choice.

1249
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,960
I know you're afraid of this.

1250
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,480
You've done well to get this far.

1251
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,560
There's a hat on the bloody gauze.

1252
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,200
There's a rope on the ground.

1253
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,960
Here's a rope and shoes.

1254
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,360
Rope and shoes.

1255
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,000
Tools for the crime.

1256
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,160
But can this thing really move a person?

1257
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,600
Let's leave everything here for now.

1258
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,280
It can't handle a person.

1259
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,800
But it might be able to close a door.

1260
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,240
Like tape, for example.

1261
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,760
Now you stick it like this.

1262
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,040
Right, I've thought about this before.

1263
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,920
But think about it.

1264
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,400
If it was loosely stuck at first.

1265
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,920
Then when bent.

1266
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,360
The tape would snap into place.

1267
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,120
But I feel that way.

1268
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,400
The tape would be too loose.

1269
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,400
It might come off with a bump.

1270
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,440
But he said he had to use a knife to cut it open.

1271
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,760
Let's examine this thing.

1272
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,040
Could this bandage have any clues?

1273
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,760
Should we tear off the bandage?

1274
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,240
We can try.

1275
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,960
Is there anything inside?

1276
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,080
A key.

1277
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,800
There really is.

1278
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,720
Take this hat out.

1279
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,400
This wouldn't represent that pig head, would it?

1280
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,320
We should just leave now.

1281
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,600
This might be the secret passage

1282
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,040
Right

1283
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,280
There are two locks

1284
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,320
Do we only have one key?

1285
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,320
Damn

1286
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,960
Do we have to wait for them?

1287
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,320
We need to wait for the bathroom key

1288
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,560
Wait a minute

1289
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,640
Maybe I should stay here

1290
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,600
crouching down

1291
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,800
No need

1292
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,880
You'll just scare yourself more by crouching

1293
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,000
I don't dare look

1294
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,960
There's something up there

1295
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,360
It already scared us once

1296
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,640
We were sent here as VIP guests

1297
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,400
No more scares please

1298
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,320
We have special privileges

1299
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,960
Right, we're here to help

1300
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,240
We've already been scared once

1301
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,920
Don't run, I'm coming

1302
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,480
Don't run

1303
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,600
Then what?

1304
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,480
Let's go, move forward

1305
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,840
Be careful

1306
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,800
This door is open

1307
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,040
I've reached the toilet

1308
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,680
And you didn't even touch any poop

1309
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,320
Hello

1310
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,120
Why is it so high up?

1311
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,160
Use that

1312
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,880
Use the key to open the other lock

1313
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,640
Let's go

1314
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,400
In Ruisi Bai's secret space

1315
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,680
Everyone discovered

1316
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,800
a loft higher than the second floor of the dormitory

1317
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,680
This height better matches an eight-meter fatal fall

1318
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,120
This place could create

1319
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,680
the conditions for someone to fall to their death

1320
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,440
It's that rope

1321
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,120
Really

1322
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,600
There's a pulley here

1323
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,640
Outside this loft window

1324
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,720
there's a suspended pulley device

1325
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,120
Everyone speculates Ruisi Bai

1326
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,160
was tied up here

1327
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,600
Hence the rope marks on the feet

1328
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,960
There's a sign below

1329
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,560
Back door of the small auditorium

1330
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,880
Looking down from the loft window

1331
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,120
there's a back door to the small auditorium

1332
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,640
a secret passage no one knew about before

1333
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,200
Let's see what we can find

1334
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,760
There's something here

1335
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,880
This painting was done by me.

1336
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,520
It depicts something from deep within my heart.

1337
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,920
The incident that affected me the most.

1338
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,240
About Sisi - she was my roommate.

1339
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,920
And also my close friend.

1340
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,000
Actually, I would never

1341
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,240
tell anyone else that

1342
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,040
I was adopted by my grandfather from an orphanage.

1343
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,160
Right?

1344
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,680
I only told her.

1345
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,360
Because I trusted her completely.

1346
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,320
But I never expected

1347
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,840
that she would tell others.

1348
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,320
I overheard her

1349
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,560
telling others:

1350
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,320
"Do you know?

1351
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,640
Ruqing is an orphan."

1352
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,000
I absolutely never imagined

1353
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,760
this would happen.

1354
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,200
And because I was an orphan,

1355
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,720
people started bullying me

1356
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,080
for no reason.

1357
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,600
They would say things like:

1358
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,560
"You liar,"

1359
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
"No one wants to play with you,"

1360
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,240
"You'll never have friends,"

1361
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,280
"Poor little thing," and such.

1362
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,800
This is the scene of me being bullied.

1363
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,200
And you can see Sisi here,

1364
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,960
just walking by casually.

1365
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,600
I feel all the mudslinging

1366
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,000
and the pain I suffered

1367
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,400
actually originated from her.

1368
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,720
She poured it all over me.

1369
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,440
That's Sisi.

1370
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:30,720
Yes.

1371
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,080
But I don't know

1372
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,040
why it's here.

1373
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,560
Where was it originally kept?

1374
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,560
It must have been in my dorm.

1375
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,720
Definitely under my bed.

1376
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,000
But now it's appeared here.

1377
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,800
Maybe because Sisi found out

1378
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,960
about this matter.

1379
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,120
There's a combination lock here.

1380
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,720
It's an alphabetical combination lock.

1381
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,840
Here

1382
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,080
there's a note

1383
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,480
After thinking all night in my secret space

1384
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,400
I decided to tell the truth tomorrow

1385
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,240
June 3, 2004

1386
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,280
She planned to reveal the truth the next day

1387
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,960
But she died the following day

1388
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,480
What was the truth?

1389
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,920
The truth might be

1390
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,040
We all think Ruisi is

1391
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,360
bullying others

1392
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,120
But could it be

1393
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,200
that Ruisi partnered with someone

1394
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,840
to bully others

1395
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,280
then wanted to quit?

1396
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,720
Perhaps

1397
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,040
her partner refused?

1398
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,600
Or maybe Ruisi

1399
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,560
was being bullied

1400
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,000
and forced to do this?

1401
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,720
But this locked box

1402
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,480
remains unsolved

1403
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,200
Though it might contain money

1404
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,680
If it's 'e'

1405
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,560
But these

1406
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,360
four

1407
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,000
So we'll take it

1408
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,840
to meet Luoluo and Nengneng

1409
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,000
Alright, let's take it

1410
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,400
Hello

1411
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,880
We're heading to the small auditorium

1412
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,880
Everyone rushes to the secret attic's

1413
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,560
previously discovered auditorium

1414
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,080
toward the back entrance

1415
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,920
Indeed, a hidden door

1416
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,360
is concealed in the wall

1417
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,520
This one

1418
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,560
Look, this is the one we just saw.

1419
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,960
That hanging rope

1420
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,360
What's below it?

1421
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,240
There's a map underneath

1422
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,480
Here's also a mask

1423
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,800
A knockout incense

1424
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,080
Called "Instant Sleep"

1425
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,520
Causes immediate unconsciousness when inhaled

1426
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,080
Victims won't wake up for a full day and night

1427
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,520
This is a bloodstained

1428
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,680
plastic sheet

1429
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,040
This should be the sealing tape for doors

1430
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,280
Because this way

1431
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,320
when she fell, the blood wouldn't

1432
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,320
splatter on the ground

1433
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,040
They could just dispose of this plastic sheet

1434
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,680
And then they could

1435
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,320
So she actually died here

1436
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:16,880
Right

1437
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,880
They moved the crime scene

1438
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,360
Here's a remote control

1439
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,520
It says it can tighten the pulley

1440
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,440
or loosen the pulley

1441
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,320
If someone was tied to it

1442
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,360
They could actually use this to

1443
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,280
hoist them up

1444
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,760
This is a hidden door

1445
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:34,840
Look at the back

1446
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,520
There's writing on the back

1447
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
I heard you cursing Ruisi Bai

1448
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,640
I can provide you with a murder plan

1449
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,320
If interested, please reply

1450
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,400
Say OKOK

1451
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,120
For our safety

1452
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,040
Don't meet in person

1453
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,640
Pass notes through the door

1454
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,560
OKOK you can do this

1455
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,120
Art Building Atrium

1456
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,440
It's an abandoned space in the art building

1457
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,880
No one would ever go there

1458
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,680
So this space could be used to commit the crime

1459
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,800
He pointed us in the right direction

1460
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,760
Meaning Sisi definitely died here

1461
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Because there's bloodstains here

1462
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,400
Right

1463
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,920
And the strangulation marks were likely from a rope

1464
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,680
Hanging her by the legs

1465
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,200
Yes

1466
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,480
Then controlling the lift upwards

1467
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,200
This area is eight meters high

1468
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,200
Yes, this spot right here

1469
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,520
It's labeled as the atrium here

1470
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,000
We're in the atrium now, right?

1471
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,720
Correct

1472
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,400
The atrium connects to the laundry room

1473
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,960
That one

1474
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,080
That's the emergency exit

1475
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,160
The laundry room's emergency exit

1476
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,680
So we can go through here

1477
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,080
to reach the laundry room

1478
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,600
We've made it through

1479
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,160
Then to here,

1480
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,920
She was dragged over like this,

1481
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,880
Currently, everyone has unanimously agreed

1482
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,880
that Sisi was killed by falling

1483
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,280
at the back door of the small auditorium,

1484
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,760
and then the body was transported through the laundry room's secret passage

1485
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,760
to the dormitory building's courtyard.

1486
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,280
Could there be a possibility

1487
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,440
that this is misleading us

1488
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,640
into thinking it's a locked room

1489
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,640
when actually the killer placed her there

1490
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,320
and then left?

1491
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,880
Then the question becomes

1492
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,600
how to seal it

1493
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,360
so everyone would think

1494
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,280
the killer couldn't seal it from outside

1495
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,720
Right, because sealing requires outside access

1496
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,360
Exactly

1497
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,600
Everyone gathered all the evidence

1498
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,280
and returned to the small auditorium

1499
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,960
They've figured out the corpse transport route avoiding the store's cameras

1500
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,600
They already have the answer

1501
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,480
But how did the killer

1502
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,360
escape from what appeared to be

1503
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,480
a taped-up sealed courtyard?

1504
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,520
Wait, there's something about this tape

1505
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,560
that hasn't been mentioned yet

1506
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,400
Can withstand hundreds of kilograms of pulling force

1507
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,440
Easily cut by sharp objects

1508
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,000
Meaning human strength cannot tear the strong adhesive tape

1509
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,520
Can only be cut using sharp tools

1510
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,920
But the sharp tool will retain adhesive residue

1511
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,360
So this must be

1512
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,880
The tape used to seal the door

1513
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,240
He said if it was cut open with a sharp tool

1514
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,840
The tool would retain adhesive residue

1515
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,960
What about that knife?

1516
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,080
Check that utility knife

1517
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,320
For any residue

1518
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,520
None on the knife

1519
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:34,920
Absolutely none

1520
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,680
There's really nothing on the knife

1521
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,560
So it was a fake seal then?

1522
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,080
Then why couldn't Xiao Xiao

1523
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,080
Open that door?

1524
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,320
Xiao Xiao couldn't push it open

1525
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
Could it be because

1526
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,520
Someone was holding it from inside

1527
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,240
Then when he went to get the knife

1528
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,200
That person escaped

1529
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,640
How did they escape?

1530
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,040
Because he told Xiao Xiao when to come

1531
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,760
He knew Xiao Xiao would definitely

1532
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,200
At 11:20

1533
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,080
I received an anonymous message

1534
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,880
Telling me to come to the second-floor atrium

1535
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Right.

1536
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,880
The killer first worked in the courtyard.

1537
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,640
Taped the door and its frame together.

1538
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,200
Then cut the tape.

1539
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,840
Texted Xiao Xiao to come to the second floor to see the body.

1540
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,720
At this moment, the killer hid outside the courtyard door.

1541
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,960
There's one point.

1542
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,000
On the second floor.

1543
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,600
He could see the entire courtyard.

1544
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,680
Are there hiding spots in the courtyard?

1545
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,040
He must have known clearly.

1546
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,760
That he would go to the second floor to look.

1547
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,760
At this exact moment.

1548
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,920
He might have.

1549
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,680
Not been in that space.

1550
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,840
Then as he went downstairs.

1551
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,640
He first ran to brace that door.

1552
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,920
When Xiao Xiao ran from second to first floor.

1553
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,000
The killer hid inside the courtyard door again.

1554
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,880
Bracing the door.

1555
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,960
Xiao Xiao tried pushing the door unsuccessfully.

1556
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,240
When going to the store to get a utility knife.

1557
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,880
The killer seized the chance to leave.

1558
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,800
Xiao Xiao returned with the knife.

1559
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,640
Instinctively sliced along the door gap.

1560
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,280
Then entered the courtyard and discovered.

1561
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,720
Rui Sipai was dead.

1562
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,560
At this point, everyone deduced

1563
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,200
the killer's escape method

1564
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,840
He made it appear like a locked room

1565
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,320
Didn't Xiao Xiao use a knife to cut?

1566
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,040
But the knife

1567
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,720
had no tape residue

1568
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,360
meaning it wasn't forcibly sealed

1569
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,560
If it had actually been

1570
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,480
cut open

1571
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,640
the craft knife would show marks

1572
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,120
Right

1573
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,680
So the killer used that

1574
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,480
After exiting through that door

1575
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,360
went through the laundry room

1576
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,560
and then escaped

1577
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,560
Because the killer knew

1578
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,560
this escape route

1579
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,560
Then everyone tried

1580
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,200
to find more clues

1581
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,480
from each person's story

1582
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,120
Ruqing first cast suspicion

1583
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,960
on Nengneng

1584
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,760
Let me propose a new theory

1585
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,320
If Ruisi Bai's death

1586
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,920
was revenge against bullies

1587
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,480
and Luo Luo, A Kai and Minghao's

1588
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,360
treatment

1589
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,240
were all anti-bullying revenge

1590
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,120
then whoever performed the ritual in the study room

1591
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,240
wanting revenge

1592
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,120
couldn't be the bullies themselves

1593
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,480
or Ruisi Bai

1594
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,960
Is it possible

1595
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,960
that from the beginning Nengneng had

1596
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,040
drugged Ruisi Bai

1597
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,160
then used Ruisi Bai's account

1598
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,440
to obtain your information?

1599
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,640
The current trigger

1600
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,400
was Ai Changge's death

1601
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,120
which led to Ruisi Bai's death

1602
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,920
Now who would be so affected

1603
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,280
by Ai Changge's death?

1604
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,560
One would be someone

1605
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,880
who once loved her deeply

1606
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,160
Ai Changge who fell from the building

1607
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:29,640
Right

1608
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
After falling through the lightwell and being hospitalized

1609
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,600
she died from her injuries

1610
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,200
I was deeply pained

1611
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,280
I actually hated Ruisi Bai

1612
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,760
One is

1613
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,720
a younger sister she was once very close to

1614
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,960
So both of you had motives

1615
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,760
But I can tell you

1616
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,920
that actually

1617
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,360
I also really want to admit my mistakes

1618
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,520
Because Xiao Ai singing

1619
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,000
was my very good roommate

1620
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,840
but in reality, I had been

1621
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,800
subtly bullying her all along

1622
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,280
Because she treated me so well

1623
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,480
She always treated me like

1624
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,640
her own younger sister

1625
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,520
So every time I would

1626
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,960
without any restraint

1627
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,800
make demands of her

1628
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,400
to do many things for me

1629
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,200
And now I realize

1630
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,480
I actually feel quite regretful

1631
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,240
But I haven't reached

1632
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,720
the point of desperately wanting

1633
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,760
to take revenge for her

1634
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,040
I do feel that

1635
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,160
it's unbelievable she actually died like this

1636
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,360
So before dorm inspection

1637
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,200
you became the one eating dragon beard candy

1638
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:37,880
Right

1639
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,760
So you developed murderous intent towards Ruisi Bai

1640
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,720
before 1 AM

1641
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,560
because you did dorm inspection after drinking tea

1642
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,720
The inspection was at 1 AM

1643
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,080
You were already sober then

1644
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,560
Because you had

1645
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,760
murderous intent towards Ruisi Bai

1646
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,840
Regardless of whether the intent was strong or weak

1647
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,480
you at least had murderous motives towards her

1648
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,920
So you can't be ruled out yet

1649
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,680
Because we're looking for

1650
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,520
someone who developed murderous intent

1651
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,640
towards Ruisi Bai between 1-2 AM

1652
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,600
Actually I have a new thought

1653
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,280
About Luo Luo

1654
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,160
See how she dates boyfriends

1655
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,640
who are just substitutes

1656
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,240
for her brother

1657
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,120
And yesterday her brother died

1658
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,560
yet she didn't kill anyone

1659
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,440
So it's even less likely

1660
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,520
that she would kill because of

1661
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,560
Ai Singing's sister jumping to her death

1662
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,000
Right?

1663
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,560
I think

1664
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,600
If we follow the timeline

1665
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,880
Only one person could have

1666
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,200
both the opportunity and motive

1667
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,920
I did have a motive to kill

1668
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,680
That's true

1669
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,880
But I didn't have the means

1670
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,840
It's quite obvious

1671
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,920
Like tools or props

1672
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,000
I didn't have any of those

1673
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,360
No time to prepare at all

1674
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,360
You just wanted

1675
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,200
those three to receive

1676
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,360
the punishment they deserve as bullies

1677
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,920
to face appropriate consequences

1678
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,960
Because Minghao called someone a pig-head

1679
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,320
So he saw a pig-head

1680
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,680
What about Akai?

1681
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,000
And what about Luoluo?

1682
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,800
It's the same cycle repeating

1683
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,440
You're making my murder motive

1684
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,600
seem too broad

1685
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,640
If I really

1686
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,320
wanted to kill someone

1687
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,440
I'd only target Ruisi

1688
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,640
But towards the other three

1689
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,160
I had no such intentions

1690
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,720
You just wanted simple revenge

1691
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,440
Both of you could be the one.

1692
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,800
I can prove my motive for killing.

1693
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,800
Arose after 2:10 AM.

1694
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,440
Because when I opened my eyes,

1695
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,560
those two trees were already fallen.

1696
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,640
So it must have been

1697
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,960
at least after 2 AM.

1698
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,560
And about the motive,

1699
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,640
we could all be lying.

1700
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,480
It's possible to lie.

1701
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,000
The killer

1702
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,680
But

1703
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,480
that tree outside,

1704
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,320
why does it have a

1705
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,040
pig symbol on it?

1706
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,520
That could only have been drawn by Nengneng

1707
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,400
to trick Minghao

1708
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,320
into thinking it was real.

1709
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,840
Now I feel

1710
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,440
because initially,

1711
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,880
he had the clearest motive.

1712
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,320
But if it's still him now,

1713
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,240
that seems too obvious.

1714
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,600
And you're somewhat targeting him.

1715
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,240
Now I think you might be X.

1716
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,320
You're X, you know that?

1717
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,680
You've been targeting me all along.

1718
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,920
I also think you

1719
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,920
I'm definitely not X.

1720
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,360
It should be Ruqing.

1721
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,520
Actually, there's another question.

1722
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,640
Why did you know that Ruisibai

1723
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,520
was constantly bullying you,

1724
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,120
yet you still chose to be her roommate?

1725
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,760
The school assigned us.

1726
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,080
No, the important thing is

1727
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,560
Ruisibai was also promoting me,

1728
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,720
and she even

1729
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,080
made me the Art Promotion Star.

1730
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,560
Right.

1731
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,960
So why would I kill her?

1732
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,200
It's exactly like this.

1733
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,560
Here's what we've discovered now:

1734
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,960
Your painting appeared in

1735
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,280
Ruisibai's secret space.

1736
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,960
So what?

1737
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,440
It means you've been there.

1738
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,040
So what?

1739
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,000
It means you're an accomplice.

1740
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,600
Even if we assume that,

1741
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,600
who would I be helping as an accomplice?

1742
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,920
Why would I help someone kill?

1743
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,760
I think you've been targeting me.

1744
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,680
I agree, it's too obvious.

1745
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,280
You're obviously [censored]

1746
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:09,920
Way too obvious.

1747
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,000
Don't believe him.

1748
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,880
No, this is solid [evidence]

1749
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,000
It's testified, confirmed.

1750
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,600
Exactly.

1751
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,200
You've been protecting him all along.

1752
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:30,920
Let's vote

1753
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,160
I think today's murderer is Nengneng.

1754
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,840
He disguised himself as Rui Sisi

1755
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,320
to make all the novice bullies

1756
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,680
was punished

1757
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,600
In the end, the ultimate bully, Sisi,

1758
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,720
met her demise

1759
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,200
I voted for Lin Hao

1760
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,760
because I believe, based on the current situation,

1761
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,600
More people will vote for Nengneng.

1762
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,960
Then I think the culprit is likely between

1763
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,680
Minghao and Nengneng.

1764
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,640
If the real culprit is Minghao,

1765
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,920
but everyone votes for Nengneng instead,

1766
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,520
we'll lose.

1767
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,240
So I'll cast my vote for Minghao.

1768
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,320
My vote today is for Nengneng.

1769
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,600
And I chose Nengneng because of Ruisi.

1770
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,760
He was bullied at school.

1771
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,160
A former crush.

1772
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:24,920
He grew resentful.

1773
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,440
He felt he couldn't let the bullying continue.

1774
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,000
to go on any longer.

1775
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,320
And he took a series of actions.

1776
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,200
Those former bullies.

1777
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,200
also received appropriate punishment.

1778
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,200
I voted for Nengneng as the culprit.

1779
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,760
I voted for Minghao.

1780
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,080
X is Zhuocheng.

1781
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,880
I hope I win.

1782
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,560
I'm not the killer myself.

1783
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,120
So the real culprit is...

1784
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,360
It was actually very difficult.

1785
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,720
But in the end I wrote...

1786
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,720
Next we will announce.

1787
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,880
the voting results of all players.

1788
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,520
After everyone's voting,

1789
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,960
our voting results are:

1790
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,560
three players received votes.

1791
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,360
The one with 0 votes is

1792
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,600
A-Kai.

1793
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,480
Among the other three players,

1794
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,480
who received more votes?

1795
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,160
Now I announce:

1796
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,960
One player received 3 votes.

1797
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,880
He is

1798
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,680
Minghao.

1799
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,080
What?

1800
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,920
I voted for Minghao.

1801
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,440
I voted for Minghao too.

1802
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,320
The real culprit is Minghao.

1803
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,200
It was really a tough decision,

1804
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,080
but I ultimately chose Luoluo.

1805
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,720
So did everyone successfully identify the culprit?

1806
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,320
Everyone identifies the culprit

1807
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,560
Failed

1808
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,200
The real culprit in this case is

1809
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,040
Luo Luo

1810
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,200
It's me

1811
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:27,920
Sorry about that

1812
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,040
Too strong

1813
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,160
I guessed right

1814
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,760
Please have the real culprit approach the case X

1815
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,400
Is that you?

1816
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,160
Zhuocheng

1817
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,000
It's not me

1818
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,200
What?

1819
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,320
Who would be so affected by Ai Singing's death

1820
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,680
to such a great extent?

1821
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,960
One is someone who

1822
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,280
used to love her deeply,

1823
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,080
the other is

1824
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,320
a younger sister who was once very close to him.

1825
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,800
I haven't reached

1826
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,360
the point of desperately wanting

1827
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,160
to take revenge for her.

1828
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,560
Regardless of whether the intent to kill was strong or weak,

1829
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,040
you at least had murderous intentions toward her.

1830
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,320
Even when Luo Luo's brother died yesterday,

1831
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,640
she didn't resort to killing.

1832
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,000
So it's even more impossible that she would kill because of

1833
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
an Ai Singing sister she had been using,

1834
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,840
who jumped to her death, right?

1835
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,480
Both of you could be suspects.

1836
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,480
Then it must have been drawn by Neng Neng

1837
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,920
to deceive Ming Hao.

1838
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,400
I feel like you've been targeting me.

1839
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,480
I agree, it's too obvious.

1840
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,920
You've been protecting him all along.

1841
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,680
And you seem to be targeting him a bit.

1842
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,720
Now I think you're somewhat like X.

1843
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,080
You're clearly X.

1844
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,560
Yes, darling.

1845
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,200
But I don't understand

1846
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,440
why you keep targeting me

1847
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,200
Yeah, it's really strange

1848
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,840
He genuinely believes it's you

1849
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,480
Back then I thought "thank you"

1850
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,240
Zhuocheng helped me by relentlessly targeting you

1851
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,840
which brings us to today

1852
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,440
Actually, we still have many

1853
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,560
unsolved mysteries

1854
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,360
Like on the first day

1855
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,000
we heard Luoluo talk about

1856
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,080
the campus urban legends

1857
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,400
To this day we still don't know

1858
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,240
whether those legends were real or not

1859
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,120
The Seven Mysteries of Tuiyi

1860
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,480
And that day when Nengneng and I went to the piano room

1861
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,960
There was clearly no one there

1862
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,520
so why was it playing by itself?

1863
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,320
Then in that day's chat records

1864
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,680
Xiaoxi and Xiaonan said

1865
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,440
we've forgotten someone

1866
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,040
Who did they forget?

1867
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,640
Today's case is about

1868
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,200
who gave Luoluo the murder plan

1869
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,880
Then there's the locked box

1870
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,680
inside Ruisi Temple

1871
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,760
that still hasn't been opened

1872
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,480
And now all three of you

1873
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,040
have been cursed

1874
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,840
Is it possible to break it?

1875
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,880
As for my own unsolved mystery

1876
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,160
Luoluo said she checked the dorms

1877
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,960
so why wasn't I there?

1878
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,360
So actually right now

1879
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,320
there are still many eerie things

1880
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,240
that we haven't figured out

1881
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,200
Students

1882
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,880
It's now 8 PM on June 4th

1883
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,520
Those who signed up for

1884
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,840
the Tuiyi Mysterious Art Exhibition

1885
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,760
please come to the library at midnight for the event

1886
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,600
Kyle Owen

1887
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,440
Great

1888
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,440
Go for it, brothers

1889
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,120
Where is Ruqing?

1890
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,400
Something's wrong

1891
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,440
Where does this lead to?

1892
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,200
Warning

1893
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,560
Detected 6 people in the elevator

1894
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,480
There are only 5 of us now

1895
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,560
What does that mean?

1896
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,360
Someone has to get off

1897
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:55,880
Not allowed to leave

1898
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,240
Who is holding me now?

1899
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,520
Who is holding my hand now?

1900
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,040
Brother

1901
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,440
I'm Luoluo

1902
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,440
Where are you, Luoluo?

1903
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,400
Nengneng

1904
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,800
Brothers, why am I here again?

1905
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,040
Sister Ai Singing

1906
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,440
Didn't she already die?

1907
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,080
I don't need to break up peacefully with Luoluo anymore

1908
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,480
She's both Ai Singing and Luoluo anyway

1909
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,480
You're happy, aren't you?

1910
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,720
Room F was empty at that time

1911
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,360
Where did you go?

1912
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,960
Who pressed the B button?

1913
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,200
The B button was pressed by A

1914
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,400
Who pressed the F button?

1915
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:37,840
E

1916
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,040
Tell me which button I should press

1917
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,280
No, you don't need to press anything

1918
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:40,840
Right

1919
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,960
I didn't need to press anything in the first place

1920
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,600
If we first exclude the invisible person

1921
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,640
No, why exclude the invisible person?

1922
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,120
You're wrong, I won't believe it
