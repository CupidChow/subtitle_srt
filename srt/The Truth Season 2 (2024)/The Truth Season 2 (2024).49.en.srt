1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,360
Welcome everyone to

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,640
the show generously sponsored by all our bulldozers

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,360
"Let's Push It! X"

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,760
I'm Cui Shaoyang, assistant director of the Brainstorm Hall

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,000
After living in Push Town for so long

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,520
it wasn't until a few days ago

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,160
after the pusher fell to his death

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,760
that we discovered the true nature of the Push AI Doll House

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,600
is actually a cyber psychiatric hospital

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,840
Push Cyber

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,960
Psychiatric Hospital

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,120
This case is quite special

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,800
The killer Heli passed X's test

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,760
but initially

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,040
he didn't know his true identity as the killer

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,120
When exactly did he

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,080
make contact with X Ning Slow Walk

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,040
And how did they collaborate

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,240
to successfully escape?

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,120
Now let's all

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,240
"Let's Push It! X"

22
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,400
Here's today's X test

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,120
From these three silhouettes

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
guess the anime characters

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,080
Get two right to pass

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,040
From these three silhouettes

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,760
guess the anime characters

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,880
Get two right to pass

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,600
This one

30
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,880
Finally an easy one, come on

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,240
What's the one in the middle?

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,120
The one on the right is Crayon Shin-chan.

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,040
The one on the left is Conan.

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,360
Just guess two correctly.

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,800
Right, want to try guessing the middle one?

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,400
No.

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,480
If you can guess this one,

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,160
type the answer on the screen.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
If you can't guess it,

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,920
congratulations, you're on my level.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
So easy.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,040
Chibi Maruko-chan.

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,720
Crayon Shin-chan.

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,640
Kogoro Mouri.

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,480
Maruko, Shin-chan.

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Maruko, Shin-chan, Kogoro.

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,760
This is Conan, right?

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Shin-chan.

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,600
This must be Pleasant Goat.

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,480
Isn't the middle one Conan?

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,920
Is this even a guess? Oh my.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,640
Is the first one Grey Wolf?

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,520
Grey Wolf, Conan

54
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
This one

55
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Is it from "One Piece"?

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,760
I don't know

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,400
Have you watched "Sailor Moon"?

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,560
Yes, I have

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,600
Who's the most handsome one in it?

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,760
Tuxedo Mask

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,760
Who could guess that?

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,080
He is Tuxedo Mask

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,880
This

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
Just this one

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,720
What was this one called again?

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,720
First one: Crayon Shin-chan

67
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,280
Second one: That village chief Slow Sheep

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,600
Third one: Conan

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,640
Alright

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,040
Okay, congratulations on passing the level

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
X

72
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,160
Take care on your way

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,320
This is as far as I can help you

74
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,920
From now on, I'll have to play the villain

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,560
Okay

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,240
So stupid, really

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
So you're X

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,520
That's right, he is.

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,760
He's causing trouble again.

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,720
You're stirring things up again.

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,520
So you're X, huh?

82
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm not

83
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
This

84
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,640
Why hasn't this killer sent me any messages?

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,160
Definitely mentally ill

86
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
No communication

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
There's another possibility

88
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
This killer themselves

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,600
Doesn't know they're the killer

90
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,760
They've lost their memory

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,320
They don't know they've killed someone

92
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
That's possible

93
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,360
Then there's no other way

94
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,280
I'll just have to improvise on the spot then

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,800
Alright then

96
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,240
After entering this room

97
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720
Has anyone remembered anything?

98
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,120
Have you remembered anything?

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
I've never been here before

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Still lying

101
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
I really don't remember

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,480
You enjoy the feeling of killing, don't you?

103
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,960
No, I don't particularly like that feeling

104
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,720
Then what does he do

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,480
To make you obey forever?

106
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,200
Which personality are you right now?

107
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm in work mode now

108
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,480
Okay, so are you Baba or Baby now?

109
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,400
Baby

110
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
I don't believe you

111
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,880
No, then what about him?

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
What is he?

113
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,800
He's a very mysterious person

114
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Don't worry about him

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,320
This doesn't match my symptoms

116
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
It doesn't match your symptoms?

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,280
I just told him

118
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,920
No need to protect me, just investigate normally

119
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,280
Because I really don’t have anything

120
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,960
that could be exposed as a flaw

121
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,120
Just don’t tell him about my purple mark

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
The fewer who know, the better

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,120
I think there's another logic to this.

124
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
What logic?

125
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,360
For example, he was given a sealed box at ten o'clock.

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,960
Then it took him forty minutes to wake up.

127
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,200
I know how to calculate it.

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
We should go by each person's...

129
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,360
elevator boarding time.

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,680
Calculate whose time was the longest.

131
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,880
No, you can't calculate it that way.

132
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,520
Do you know why?

133
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
I came in.

134
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,760
For example, I was the first to enter.

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,680
I was ten minutes later than his last entry.

136
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,840
So when he was knocked out...

137
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,600
I was also knocked out again.

138
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,120
What do you mean "also knocked out again"?

139
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,680
He means when he was lying here...

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,840
While unconscious, he inhaled that substance again.

141
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,560
Got drugged again.

142
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,200
Right.

143
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,360
So that means the timer reset.

144
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,840
Your unconscious time, right?

145
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,080
Of course, this way all four of us would be equal.

146
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
So you're saying...

147
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,000
There were four people piled up in this room at that time?

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,720
Exactly.

149
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
I think this logic makes sense.

150
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Yes, it's reasonable.

151
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,360
Because you were indeed here.

152
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,880
Right.

153
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
If you calculate it your way...

154
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,960
Then I would definitely be the culprit.

155
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,760
I'd have the longest time because...

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,680
That makes sense.

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
So the four of you are

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,720
all qualified to handle cases based on the evidence

159
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,400
No, we can't single out one person

160
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
Right, exactly, we can't eliminate anyone

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
First of all, the four of us

162
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
are we all robots?

163
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,600
No

164
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,000
No

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Only he is a robot

166
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,280
No, it's not about robots

167
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,200
It's about brain-computer interfaces

168
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:57,640
Yes

169
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,560
Alright then

170
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,720
Then keep listening

171
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,160
Look, there's a maintenance record here

172
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
And then?

173
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
He's been continuously updated these years

174
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,840
So is it possible that

175
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,400
his physical condition is more updated than ours?

176
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,840
No, that's impossible

177
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,080
This only tells you one logic

178
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,920
which corresponds to his diagnosis letter

179
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,480
Why are you protecting him again?

180
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm talking about fairness

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,880
He could have implanted his brain

182
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,520
into that person earlier

183
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,360
Updated in advance

184
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,760
Starting from 2018

185
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
when this research existed

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
it could be updated to

187
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,880
"dead" people

188
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
That's exactly how it is now

189
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,360
That's why he could enter you four

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,480
and control all four of you

191
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,160
Don't keep emphasizing 2018

192
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,680
It will mislead you, I'm telling you

193
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,920
Because he wasn't used until 2030

194
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,320
Meaning he was

195
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,120
created in 2030

196
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,080
I think the only breakthrough point is with him

197
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
Let's see whose X he is

198
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,240
Is he your X?

199
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,480
He hasn't argued with you even once

200
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm really not lying today, believe me

201
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,760
No, wait a minute

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
What I mean is this person's awakening

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,920
was an accident, right?

204
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,600
Dilraba's father didn't have the ability

205
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
to predict he would wake up

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,600
But this still doesn't change one thing

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,680
that whoever has a stronger constitution

208
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,520
would wake up first, right?

209
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,200
So we can still analyze

210
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
who has the better physique

211
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,160
Yes, that makes sense

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,840
Whoever's healthier

213
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
Between the two of us, it's obvious

214
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,560
To be honest, I think your health

215
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,840
isn't particularly good

216
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
Because you self-harm

217
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,520
That's not as direct

218
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,280
His method was more direct - he took drugs

219
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
Actually both are direct

220
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,120
Right

221
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,760
Both methods are very direct

222
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
Why don't you have this trait?

223
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,680
He's a workaholic

224
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,920
You have self-harming tendencies

225
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,800
What you really mean is

226
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,840
He's tough, I'm tough

227
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,880
Not that we're both in perfect health

228
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,480
No, there's another logic here.

229
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
What he meant wasn't

230
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,800
just "good health", right?

231
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,280
He was referring to special constitution.

232
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,240
This special constitution

233
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,200
might not relate to good health.

234
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
For example, I have strong drug resistance

235
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,360
or no alcohol allergy - things like that.

236
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,240
That's what you call special constitution.

237
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,960
Meaning me, right?

238
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,960
Special preferences, special constitution.

239
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,880
Starting with Keqin, who do you suspect?

240
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
I suspect Bai.

241
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,640
You suspect Bai. What about you?

242
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,120
If I had to choose, I'd pick him.

243
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
Why?

244
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Because neither of you seem likely.

245
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,720
I’m judging by his reaction.

246
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
He hasn’t argued with him at all today.

247
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,720
Fair enough, that’s an unusual angle.

248
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
I suddenly feel like voting for him.

249
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
Why?

250
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,160
Look at him—why?

251
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,600
Do you still want to vote for him?

252
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Why?

253
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Who are you voting for?

254
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,800
I’m voting for myself.

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,000
You’re voting for yourself?

256
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
If she votes for herself,

257
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,760
the odds between the killer and the innocent

258
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,920
would still be fifty-fifty.

259
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
Because the killer loses in a tie.

260
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,800
So if she votes for herself,

261
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,880
it’s two against two.

262
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,200
Let's vote

263
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,520
The true culprit I chose is White Noise.

264
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,080
Because I was just trying to mislead them.

265
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,680
I kept steering them toward...

266
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,840
...who had better physical condition...

267
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,160
...and could wake up faster.

268
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,200
But actually, this point...

269
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,480
...can't identify the real culprit.

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,400
So if it's between White Noise and Baby...

271
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,880
I'll still choose White Noise.

272
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,560
So today's vote...

273
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,120
...goes to White Noise.

274
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,480
Uh, sorry about this...

275
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
I'm the X in this episode.

276
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,840
So buddy, I have to eliminate you.

277
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,960
Next time we'll solve cases together.

278
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,320
Can't help you this time.

279
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,400
Bye-bye.

280
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,680
Everyone, I voted for White Noise.

281
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,400
White Noise.

282
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
The real culprit is...

283
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,960
Baby.

284
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,920
Failed to identify the culprit this episode.

285
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
What?

286
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,200
Speechless... absolutely speechless.

287
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,240
Was there an X in this case?

288
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,880
Just me alone?

289
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,480
This case had an X.

290
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
X, please step forward.

291
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,760
Oh sister...

292
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,240
Alright, it's fine.

293
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
At this point...

294
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Brother, you've failed me again.

295
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,320
It really wasn't me, I give up.

296
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,880
No, I said don't let it affect our relationship.

297
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,720
I...

298
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,440
...am the killer.

299
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Speechless

300
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
See? I told you it wasn't me

301
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
Thank you everyone

302
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,320
Here's the thing

303
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,520
This case is truly difficult

304
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,120
Very difficult

305
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,920
It's genuinely hard

306
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,880
Come on, Ke, come here

307
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,160
Tell me, how is his health good?

308
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,080
Go ahead, you say it

309
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
I said it - I said he self-harms daily

310
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,200
Yet he protected him

311
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,320
If he self-harms, how's he still alive today?

312
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,040
It's not that he's tough

313
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
But that his constitution is just good

314
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,320
That was actually my reasoning

315
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,640
And another point is

316
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
About that livestream project of mine

317
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
Right, he can do many things

318
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,920
Fine fine, good health then

319
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,800
It's over, really

320
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
The final episode collapsed

321
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's leave it at that

322
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,960
The perpetrator in this case was Heli

323
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,920
But the true culprit

324
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,800
Was Baba who invaded Heli's consciousness

325
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,400
What method exactly did Baba use

326
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,560
To kill the promoter?

327
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,880
What was his modus operandi?

328
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,760
I am Baba

329
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,240
Founder of Tui Cyber Technology

330
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,760
I died in a car accident

331
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,600
But it doesn’t matter

332
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,160
Because I only lost my physical body

333
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,520
My consciousness lives on

334
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,000
I developed brain-computer interface technology

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
Others thought I created this technology

336
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,200
To improve people’s lives

337
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,720
But in reality

338
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,120
I wanted to control everyone more easily

339
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,240
To fulfill my ambitions

340
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,680
I discovered the director of Tui Cyber Psychiatric Hospital

341
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,520
Was secretly investigating me

342
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,920
He uncovered my secret

343
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,600
And planned to expose it to Tui Tan

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,160
I had to find a way to kill him

345
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,280
But he stayed hidden for a long time

346
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,600
In his office at Tui Cyber Psychiatric Hospital

347
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,400
Through my daughter Babi,

348
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
I noticed

349
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,200
there were four patients

350
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,640
including my daughter Babi,

351
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,840
Heli,

352
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,880
Kexuejia,

353
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
and Bai Zaoyin,

354
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,960
who had planned a mutual killing scheme.

355
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,800
On June 27th,

356
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,760
they would prepare four murder weapons.

357
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,160
Coincidentally, they had all undergone my brain-machine surgery

358
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,280
without encryption chips installed.

359
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,480
I could log in anytime

360
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,920
through the brain-machine backdoor.

361
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,040
and use their prepared weapons to kill Tuishou.

362
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,160
Those I controlled wouldn't remember the killings.

363
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,200
On June 27th,

364
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,240
I began my plan.

365
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,440
At 21:49,

366
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,240
I logged into Heli's system.

367
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,280
After all, I had used his body to kill Xiang Jingjing.

368
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,640
This time,

369
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,320
I planned to use his body to kill Tuishou too.

370
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,480
At 21:50,

371
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,720
I went to Tuishou's fifth-floor office.

372
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,520
I picked up the hammer Heli had prepared.

373
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,160
I intended to kill him directly,

374
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,560
then exit Heli's body and leave.

375
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Even if Heli got trapped in the office,

376
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
it wouldn't matter.

377
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,800
I had plenty of other puppets to control.

378
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,080
Hiding the hammer, I approached Tuishou.

379
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,880
I struck him once with the hammer,

380
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
and he collapsed.

381
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Then Heli suddenly fainted,

382
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,760
forcing me offline.

383
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,640
At 21:52,

384
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,560
I logged into Bai Zaoyin,

385
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,000
entered Tuishou's office with a pillow.

386
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,200
Tuishou lay severely injured from my earlier attack.

387
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,560
I approached and smothered him briefly with the pillow,

388
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,480
when suddenly Bai Zaoyin fainted too,

389
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,560
forcing me offline again.

390
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,520
At 21:55,

391
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,000
I logged into Kexuejia,

392
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,960
and entered Tuishou's office with a poison syringe.

393
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,480
After approaching the Pusher,

394
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,480
I quickly took out a syringe to inject him with poison,

395
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,040
but before I could,

396
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,280
I passed out again.

397
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,840
I was forcibly logged out once more.

398
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,880
21:58

399
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,480
As a last resort,

400
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,320
I logged into my daughter Barbie's account,

401
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,520
grabbed the medical kit she had prepared,

402
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
and hit him with the medical kit.

403
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,080
Before I could finish him off,

404
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,160
while severely injured, he told me

405
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,040
he had installed encryption chips

406
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,960
in all the people I performed brain-machine surgery on.

407
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,400
I can no longer access them.

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,440
Only these four I just used remain unmodified.

409
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
Then Barbie also lost consciousness.

410
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
I was forcibly logged out yet again.

411
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,440
Now all four remaining accessible people are unconscious.

412
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,600
I still haven't managed to kill the Pusher.

413
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,320
The only four people I can control now

414
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,040
are all in the Pusher's office.

415
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,080
If the Pusher dies,

416
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,640
with those four locked in his office,

417
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,960
they'll surely be arrested as suspects.

418
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
This way,

419
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,560
I would have no

420
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
freely movable puppets left

421
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,560
to continue controlling.

422
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,680
It would be as if I've truly died from this world.

423
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,680
I absolutely cannot allow this to happen.

424
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,240
I must change my plan.

425
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,120
Find a way to kill the Pusher

426
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,200
and make it look like an unquestionable suicide.

427
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,040
Only then can I protect these four vessels.

428
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,200
I can still use these bodies later

429
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
to create more controllable puppets.

430
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,200
For now, I can only wait

431
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,640
for one of these four to wake up.

432
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,280
Then I can proceed with my next steps.

433
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,520
22:40

434
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,520
I discovered Heli has actually woken up.

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
This is perfect for my plans.

436
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,960
Heli indeed has a special constitution

437
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
No wonder during his livestreams

438
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,040
he could rap nonstop for three days and nights

439
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,520
and even dive to the bottom of the Wukenai River

440
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,600
I can keep using Heli's body to kill the pusher

441
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,560
But to prevent Heli from getting caught

442
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,600
I've come up with a plan

443
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
to protect him and the remaining three bodies

444
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,480
Since the poison takes forty minutes to take effect

445
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,320
I can use the makeshift

446
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
research operating table on the sixth floor

447
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,840
to create a delayed mechanism

448
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,200
and make everyone think the pusher jumped to his death from the fifth floor

449
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,280
By that time

450
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,360
I'll have already moved the other three bodies

451
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,640
to the second-floor ward

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,160
This way

453
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
all four will have alibis

454
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
And after the pusher dies

455
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,120
his office doors and windows will automatically lock

456
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,120
No one could kill him in his office and escape

457
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
So everyone would be completely cleared of suspicion

458
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,320
22:42

459
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,840
I picked up the unused poison syringe from Kexuejia

460
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,640
After the previous attacks

461
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,320
the Pusher had already passed out

462
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,640
I injected the poison into his body

463
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,560
He would die in forty minutes

464
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,040
Then

465
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,000
I typed a suicide note on the Pusher's computer

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,040
and left it there

467
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,440
Next, I moved the three unconscious bodies

468
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,760
to a regular ward on the second floor

469
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,880
22:50

470
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,160
I destroyed the computer containing evidence against me

471
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,960
Then along with other weapons

472
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,400
took them to the hidden sixth floor

473
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,760
Using the simple operating table on the sixth floor

474
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,960
I created a delayed-action device

475
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,760
22:53

476
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
I opened the window

477
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,880
Because the Pusher's life

478
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,600
was connected to the building's power system

479
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,120
When he truly dies at 23:22

480
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,600
after his actual death

481
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,120
the whole building will lose power

482
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,800
The electromagnet connected to the operating table

483
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,840
will lose its magnetism

484
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,680
Once the operating table loosens

485
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,040
the body will slide out the window

486
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,640
Everyone will think

487
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,160
that's when the Pusher actually died

488
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
Moreover

489
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,080
half an hour after opening

490
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,520
at exactly 23:23

491
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,720
the window will automatically close

492
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,960
right after the Pusher's body hits the ground

493
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
with just enough time

494
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,360
After completing all this

495
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,120
I made Heli return to the second floor

496
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,120
and lie back in bed

497
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,080
After 23:00

498
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,160
Babi

499
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,240
Kexuejia

500
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,280
and White Noise seemed to wake up one after another

501
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,560
But having just been drugged

502
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,800
they all seemed mentally unclear

503
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,480
Stumbling toward the elevator

504
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,840
they went downstairs

505
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,480
I kept Heli with the group as much as possible

506
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,480
Calculating when they'd fully regain consciousness

507
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,160
I left Heli's body

508
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,440
Thank you, dear audience, for watching this episode of

509
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
"Let's Deduce! X"

510
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,360
To find out what happens next

511
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,600
stay tuned for Shaoyang's breakdown in the next installment
