1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:05,960
A doctor drinking cooled boiled water

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
The physician who drank cooled boiled water

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,440
Formed a team to establish a clinic

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,960
You've had three cups of "magma" in a row

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,560
Tone down your veins a little

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
Crying, Brother Huang Kai

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,280
You're all acting

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,200
It's truly cooled boiled water

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,920
Another familiar assessment for everyone

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,080
There are two self-proclaimed "Chess Kings"

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,920
The divine dragon "1" move keeps appearing

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,600
Four words for everyone

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,960
Returning to the martial world

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,040
If you play this, won't you be ready to win?

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,920
Then you'll block, right?

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,200
Should we block or not?

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,560
Arrived one step too late

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,280
Can't block anymore

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,880
Come on, the "god" of show effects

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,000
He's specifically blocking us, right?

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,920
Just happened to have time to check over there

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,440
Weaving a cocoon around oneself

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,560
Locked "tight"

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,720
What else can we move?

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,160
Annoying me to "death"

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,320
You're surrounded

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,320
Not necessarily

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,880
Paper can't wrap up fire

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,840
Quick, this is the spot! Go now!

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
Hold your breath, focus your energy, and strike with your palm!

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,280
With a loud *bang*—

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,080
*Bang!*

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,160
Shattering the inner and outer secret doors into pieces.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,320
Come on

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,440
Alright, everyone

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,560
Welcome to

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,120
"Let's Start Thinking"

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
This is Tuizhen Town's

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,720
centuries-old renowned pharmacy

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,680
Thinking Hall

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,080
I'm the assistant director of Thinking Hall

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,240
Cui Shaoyang

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,160
This year marks

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
the 164th anniversary

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,880
of Thinking Hall's establishment

46
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,600
has also implemented the acting hall master system

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,680
for the sixty-fourth year

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,760
We look forward to more

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,400
exceptionally talented apprentice physicians

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
taking up the role of acting hall master

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,640
to shine and contribute to the Dongnao Hall

52
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,440
Now

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,280
let's review the assessment rules

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
This week's two value-added services

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
They are

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,560
The ultimate summer cooler

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,720
Ice bucket foot soak for chilling relief

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
And refreshing

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Effortless wet towel cannon

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,200
I hope all physicians can during the assessment

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,920
maintain clear minds

62
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720
with coherent thinking

63
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,600
to win honors for our clinic

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,040
The triage rules for this session

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's just plain boiled water

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,760
Really just plain water

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Excellent

68
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,640
Not bad

69
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,360
Try to relax your veins a bit

70
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,120
His swallowing seems slightly strained

71
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,440
He's crying, Brother Huang Kai

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
Furrowed brows

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
The acting is a bit poor

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,920
Somewhat exaggerated

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360
Feels like acting

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Then let's deduce, brothers

77
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,680
Which two cups are plain water

78
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,920
Seems none of you drank plain water

79
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
I think there's no plain water

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,960
Unless you're all acting

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,080
Everyone's got some acting skills

82
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,480
Those who didn't drink plain water

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,760
Take one step back

84
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,440
Come on

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,080
Three

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,440
Two

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,480
One

88
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,400
Please step back

89
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,800
Let's congratulate Ren Yinpeng and Hu Minghao

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
For forming today's first consultation team

91
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
Bottoms up, truly bottoms up

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,240
This is very much plain water

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Very plain water

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,280
Right, I think so too

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,080
Drank and laughed

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
Like it

97
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Brows furrowed

98
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,320
His eyes are getting teary again

99
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
Feels like something's off

100
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Quick, act it out

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,520
Acting

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,240
So sour

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,400
Who drank water this round

104
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,760
Let's all step back

105
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,240
Three

106
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,520
Two

107
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,920
One

108
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,600
Okay

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,280
Congratulations to Hou Zhuocheng and Huang Kai

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,840
For forming today's second consultation team

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,240
He laughed

112
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
He's enjoying it

113
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,920
Enjoying

114
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,320
You've had three "Magma" drinks in a row

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
This is a bit too much

116
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,960
It's really a bit too much

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
This feeling is really not

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
Let's first invite two

119
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,120
brothers who have become clinic staff

120
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,920
to analyze it

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,920
Xiaolong must be saltwater, right?

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,040
Xiaolong keeps swallowing saliva here.

123
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,240
Just drink it.

124
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,920
Indeed.

125
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,560
I guess Yu Haoyang is also saline water

126
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
I saw that drop dripping from the corner of his mouth

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,680
It looked a bit murky

128
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,040
So, who exactly drank the saline water

129
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,080
Is it our Haoyang?

130
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,200
What about Xiaolong?

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,360
Those who didn’t drink saline water, take a step back

132
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,400
Please step back

133
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
Congratulations

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,040
Reunited by fate

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,160
The two of you have continued

136
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
A bond from 64 years ago

137
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,880
In the third phase, 1988

138
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,040
You’re still paired together

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,440
This is the third time you’ve been assigned to the same clinic

140
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,560
Do you have anything to say?

141
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,280
Fate

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,800
Good

143
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,440
Good

144
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,360
I want to say

145
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,280
Our first win might’ve been luck

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
The second win was skill

147
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,360
The third win is dominance

148
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,640
Do the two in examination room one have anything to say?

149
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,840
New combination

150
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,200
New mental enhancement service

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,360
You speak

152
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,160
Don't

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,840
Still a bit

154
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,680
Still just a little bit

155
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
New combination

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,680
New starting point

157
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
Same destination

158
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,760
Same fate

159
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
Okay, collapse

160
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
Say something

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,440
Well

162
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,920
Go for it

163
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,320
Keep it up

164
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,920
Okay

165
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,600
Okay, wish you success then

166
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,640
Our new team

167
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,160
What do Zifan and Xiaolong say?

168
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,200
I think it's a brand new beginning

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,040
Boring

170
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,960
Didn't you say you wanted one or three?

171
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,160
Sixty-four years ago,

172
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
One day I was fourth place,

173
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,440
another day I was second place.

174
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,920
Today let's see

175
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,280
if it's third place or first place.

176
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,200
No problem, this time you're third, I'm first.

177
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
We'll meet at the top.

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,160
Not necessarily.

179
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,880
It might be us first and you third.

180
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,960
It hasn't even started yet and here we go.

181
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
Starting to feel like we're becoming rivals.

182
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,880
What do you think?

183
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,640
What's your opinion?

184
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
I thought your previous collaboration

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,880
wasn't that unpleasant?

186
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,720
Okay.

187
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
Huang Kai and Zhuocheng,

188
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,280
this is also a new pairing this time.

189
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,440
Do you two have anything to say?

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,560
With Huang Kai by my side,

191
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,840
I suddenly feel confident.

192
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,560
Brother Zifan,

193
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,680
that's not what I meant.

194
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,320
As expected, the collaboration wasn't very smooth.

195
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
That's not what I meant.

196
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,960
This...

197
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,400
The more I say, the more mistakes I make. Forget it.

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,840
No, let the results speak for themselves.

199
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,480
Alright.

200
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,480
Huang Kai, anything you'd like to say?

201
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm really looking forward to it.

202
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,280
Yes.

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,680
Because suddenly seeing them

204
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,640
still as a team,

205
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,080
I feel we have confidence.

206
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
They won't be first place.

207
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,960
Right.

208
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,640
I think this time we're like

209
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,600
"The six major sects besieging Bright Peak."

210
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,360
Good.

211
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,880
That's something.

212
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's go, brothers!

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,560
Okay.

214
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,200
Alright.

215
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,760
Now let us

216
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,400
Now let us

217
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,720
officially begin the assessment.

218
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,680
(I choose) Dandelion.

219
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,640
Doctor hey hey goji.

220
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,800
Goji berries

221
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,840
Another familiar assessment for everyone

222
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,640
There are two who claim to be "Chess Kings"

223
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,040
I'd like to interview first

224
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,080
Ren Yinpeng and Huang Kai

225
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,800
Come on, you two speak up

226
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,680
I think

227
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,480
I was able to achieve that state last time

228
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Because with Brother Huang Kai

229
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,840
We reminded each other

230
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
And then summarized together

231
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
That's how we played that chess game together

232
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,840
You're hinting at me

233
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,760
No

234
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,600
What I mean is

235
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
This thing is

236
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,720
Minghao would be better

237
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
You're hinting at me

238
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,600
That's not what I meant

239
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,200
It's just

240
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,120
Both are good

241
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,320
So what's your opinion about this chess game?

242
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,480
Zhuocheng is better

243
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,080
Good

244
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,480
Good

245
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,200
Remember in our last assessment

246
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,080
There were frequent appearances of the "Dragon 1" move

247
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll give you four words

248
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
Return to the martial world

249
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,000
The first consultation room

250
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,480
Consultation Room Three matches with Consultation Room Two

251
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,840
Come on, rock-paper-scissors

252
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
To decide who goes first, come on

253
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,960
Rock-paper-scissors

254
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Exam Room Two goes first

255
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,560
1

256
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,880
3

257
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,440
Both sides are evenly matched now

258
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,360
3

259
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,280
Just like this or...

260
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,440
No, we can't do this

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you play here, aren't you ready to win?

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,640
Right.

263
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,800
Then you'll block us, right?

264
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes, we'll block.

265
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,120
Attack.

266
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,240
Here we attack while defending.

267
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,040
Yes, activate both paths.

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Draw.

269
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Draw one.

270
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,760
Okay.

271
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,760
This move is so neat.

272
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,280
Should we fill this up again?

273
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,680
Then Kai's Whisper... no, that won't work.

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,040
Cheng's Rebellion, I insist on playing here.

275
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,240
Two.

276
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,840
I think we should take the initiative.

277
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,320
Protect ourselves.

278
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,960
Right.

279
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,840
Draw a 3 to block

280
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,200
Should we block?

281
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,920
Bet

282
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,960
The Gambler's Wager

283
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,800
Dare to bet they don't have it

284
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,120
Bet

285
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,560
3

286
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,160
Definitely not

287
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,600
No, this is 11.

288
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,800
11.

289
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
No regrets in the move.

290
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,160
I just

291
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,440
No, I thought we had won

292
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I saw Brother Huang Kai didn't react

293
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,520
What were you thinking at that moment?

294
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,600
It was too late, I should have whispered

295
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,760
Horizontally, it no longer works

296
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,800
The horizontal sum is already over 10

297
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,480
He listened

298
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
He has to go there

299
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,680
I think 1 is useless

300
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,040
But we can block him

301
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,480
We're a step too late

302
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
Luckily we blocked it

303
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,400
Then let's do this

304
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,880
Okay

305
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,200
Or maybe we can go here

306
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,280
That works

307
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,440
But it's not that easy to win

308
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,360
They will definitely block

309
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,240
So we have to go there

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,760
Ready to win

311
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,160
Can't block it

312
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,200
This placement works too

313
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,920
We can at least make a pair of 2

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,960
Come on, let's bet

315
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,000
Here comes the tense moment

316
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Bet they can't flip a 2

317
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Come on, let's go

318
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,520
This decided the outcome

319
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,280
Well done

320
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,600
Congratulations to Clinic 3 for gaining 20% mental energy

321
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,200
Clinic 4 goes first

322
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,720
Everyone's got good luck

323
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
I think this spot is better

324
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,560
Wouldn’t expanding sideways here work?

325
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,360
You mean here?

326
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,120
Okay

327
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,520
Block his side

328
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,480
Blocking this side makes no sense

329
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,680
Another three

330
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,400
Right, I think we should place it here.

331
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,880
Because the two 3s can merge together.

332
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,000
And it can also connect with this 2.

333
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,520
Right.

334
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,040
That makes sense.

335
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,240
If we place it here,

336
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,520
it would actually be a bit weaker.

337
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,080
Right.

338
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,240
Okay.

339
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,480
3.

340
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,520
Let's go directly above.

341
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,240
Okay.

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,960
My thinking is this.

343
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,920
Even if I place it here,

344
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,800
a 3 appears here.

345
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,600
But on both sides,

346
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,400
next turn,

347
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,000
I can directly place this.

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
Sure, no problem.

349
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,760
3.

350
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
We've reached 7 pieces.

351
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,840
1

352
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,560
Okay

353
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,440
3

354
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,080
Pretty good

355
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,120
Block here

356
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,040
Can't go over it

357
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,040
He only listens to the three of diamonds.

358
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,040
I think we should go this way.

359
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,720
If we go this way, I can listen to both ends.

360
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,000
And I'm also listening to this card.

361
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,680
Okay.

362
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,600
Let's bet.

363
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,560
Yu Haoyang

364
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,960
Keep your personal bias in check

365
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,080
Understood

366
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Your personal bias is showing a bit too much now

367
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,360
Here we go

368
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,320
Now we're getting somewhere

369
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,120
Then let's congratulate Clinic One

370
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,200
for winning this round of assessment

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,160
Okay

372
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,040
Alright

373
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,920
Let me be the first to draw the medicine card

374
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,840
Rou

375
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,280
What?

376
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,960
Rougui

377
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,760
Rougui

378
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Pearl

379
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,320
I choose

380
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,560
How about the pearl closer to me?

381
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:35,960
Fine

382
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,040
Herb Competition Battle

383
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,280
First,

384
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,520
Each clinic will send one representative

385
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,000
to play rock-paper-scissors.

386
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,320
You go.

387
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Rock-paper-scissors, right?

388
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,040
Or maybe you should do it.

389
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,640
I'll go.

390
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,440
You do it.

391
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,280
Come on, rock-paper-scissors!

392
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
Nice!

393
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,200
Okay.

395
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,280
That works too.

396
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,520
Clinic Four goes first.

397
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,400
Clinic One second.

398
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,440
Clinic Two third.

399
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,040
Clinic Three fourth.

400
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,280
Now draw position cards.

401
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,640
Why am I feeling

402
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,760
so nervous about this?

403
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,720
You draw, I have terrible luck.

404
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,840
Okay.

405
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,520
Each person draws one card.

406
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,920
Very good

407
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,840
Good cards

408
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,960
Okay

409
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,040
Exam Room Four goes first this round

410
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,480
We declare

411
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,880
We claim to be pharmacists

412
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,000
We'll take two cards from Exam Room Two

413
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,920
Take two herb packs

414
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,120
Herb packs, right

415
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,680
From us

416
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,800
Right

417
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,120
Wait

418
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Hold on

419
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,960
We can stop this

420
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,320
We have the Administrative Director

421
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,280
We must stop it

422
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,320
First

423
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,680
Does anyone challenge their pharmacist claim?

424
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,720
No one

425
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay

426
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,000
Is anyone questioning whether they are the administrative section chief?

427
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,320
No one

428
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,200
questions

429
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,600
doubts

430
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,000
challenges

431
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,080
They question whether you're the administrative section chief

432
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,240
Please present your credentials as administrative section chief

433
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,000
Doubt

434
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,880
There is an administrative section chief.

435
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,280
Discard a card

436
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,040
My smile suddenly faded

437
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,760
And this time the alchemist

438
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,080
their skills are ineffective

439
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,880
Understood?

440
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,520
Alright

441
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
How many rounds will this game last?

442
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
The game ends when someone gets eliminated first.

443
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,720
Just one round.

444
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,240
Let's begin the clinic round.

445
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,640
We need one medicine package.

446
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,320
Here.

447
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,960
Please take it.

448
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,880
Peace.

449
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,760
This means they have nothing.

450
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,040
This means we're nothing either.

451
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,000
We want...

452
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,680
three medicine packages.

453
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
Clinic Director's ability.

454
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,840
Claiming to be the Clinic Director.

455
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,520
Attempting to obtain three medicine packages from the storage.

456
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,480
Does anyone wish to challenge this?

457
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,400
Five, four

458
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
No, I mean

459
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,880
Three

460
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,080
Do it

461
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,400
We question

462
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,880
Question

463
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,360
Do you even have an outpatient department director?

464
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,120
Please show

465
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,320
Goodbye

466
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,360
Goodbye

467
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,440
Goodbye

468
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,360
What? It's over just like that?

469
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,800
The game is over?

470
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,040
They actually...

471
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,800
No, why is this happening?

472
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
You have obtained three medicinal herb packs

473
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,360
Not bad

474
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,000
Come

475
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,680
Examination Room 3

476
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,920
Please begin your turn

477
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,080
We'd like to take from Examination Room 2

478
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,240
two medicine ingredient packs

479
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
They claim to be pharmacists

480
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,960
and want to take two medicine ingredient packs from Room 2

481
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,800
Does anyone object?

482
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
(whispering)

483
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,360
Then take them

484
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,960
Received

485
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,520
Two medicine packs sent

486
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,440
Examination Room 1 begins

487
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,400
Take one more

488
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,040
No problem

489
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,800
Examination Room 2

490
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,440
We are

491
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,480
We are the chief surgeons

492
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,520
We'll make them

493
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,160
lose one position card

494
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,320
Any objections?

495
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,440
No objections

496
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,800
Then you must lose one position card

497
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
We challenged the wrong person

498
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,720
Now it's Examination Room 3's turn

499
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,440
We'll take two medicine packs from Examination Room 1

500
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,360
Five

501
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,560
Four

502
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,000
But there are already two there

503
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,760
There are already two here

504
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,520
Two

505
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,280
One

506
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,760
Challenge

507
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,160
Please reveal your identity

508
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,360
Challenge failed

509
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,240
Surrender one position card

510
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,520
Here

511
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,040
This one

512
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,280
Done

513
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,440
Come on, it's your turn at Clinic One.

514
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,800
We want to obtain a medicinal herb pack.

515
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,680
No problem.

516
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,600
Clinic Two.

517
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,280
We'll take three.

518
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,000
Any objections?

519
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,640
Five, four, three, two, one.

520
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Okay.

521
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,760
Let's swap cards.

522
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,920
Let's take them on.

523
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,760
We...

524
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,400
We either succeed or die trying.

525
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,360
Alright, successful card swap.

526
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,640
Do we have no choice but to go through with it?

527
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,000
We have no choice but to proceed.

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
What else can we do otherwise?

529
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,000
Come on, let's go to Operating Room 1.

530
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,600
We are the lead surgeons.

531
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,160
Don't "kill" us

532
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
"Kill" them

533
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,800
Right

534
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,280
Okay

535
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,600
So we can only challenge now?

536
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
We'll "die" if we don't challenge

537
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,000
We have the head nurse

538
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,960
You can also stop it

539
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,160
Then we have to challenge

540
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Challenge

541
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,520
We either succeed or perish

542
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,000
They're challenging if you're the head nurse

543
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,080
Okay, goodbye.

544
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,920
Goodbye.

545
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,920
Only we're left now.

546
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,520
Come on.

547
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,320
We'll submit three herb pouches.

548
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,880
Make them lose one position card.

549
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,240
They claim to be the lead surgeons.

550
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you wish to challenge that?

551
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,920
Challenge.

552
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,040
It's gone.

553
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,000
Alright, let's congratulate Clinic Two.

554
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,120
for securing first place in this assessment.

555
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,320
They've successfully accumulated 25% brainpower.

556
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,280
Brothers from Clinic Four,

557
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,200
regarding this outcome,

558
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,120
do you have anything to say?

559
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,080
We only scratched the surface of this game.

560
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,720
Next time, we'll strive harder.

561
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,920
Yes, we've fully realized

562
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,400
the true essence of this game.

563
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,960
Next time,

564
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,640
perhaps we'll make a triumphant return.

565
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,480
Alright.

566
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,040
Looking forward to it.

567
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,080
Do you believe it?

568
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,400
We believe.

569
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Then applaud for us.

570
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,400
Okay, thank you.

571
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
He's manipulating you.

572
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,400
I'll still be responsible for the physicians

573
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,560
I'll continue overseeing the doctors

574
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,000
drawing the examination topics

575
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,240
Alright, I'll choose this one then

576
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,160
Golden Drink Flower

577
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,040
Golden Drink Flower

578
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,120
Miraculous Healing Hands

579
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,160
It seems like

580
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,000
the building blocks one

581
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,600
That's right

582
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,880
Answer questions then build blocks

583
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:20,920
This time I

584
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,200
will absolutely not touch those building blocks

585
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,760
What's important is

586
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,040
building with blocks

587
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,960
Right

588
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,600
Indeed

589
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,280
Correct

590
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,280
Now let's present our first question

591
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,760
Year

592
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,640
Which of these films can't be seen in theaters?

593
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,120
"God of Gamblers" is very old

594
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,680
I remember "God of Gamblers" being very old

595
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,960
Three long and one short

596
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,840
Choose the shortest one

597
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,760
Please answer the question.

598
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,320
A C B

599
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,360
Come on, no more changes.

600
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,920
B

601
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,800
Good.

602
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,480
Now let's congratulate...

603
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,160
Clinic One who chose the shortest option among three long and one short.

604
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,640
The correct answer is C.

605
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,440
Now let's congratulate Clinic One.

606
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,360
for accumulating 15 seconds of construction time in advance.

607
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,800
Presenting the second question immediately.

608
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,360
Year.

609
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
Which of the following pop songs cannot be heard?

610
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,640
Please answer.

611
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,840
A C B C

612
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,040
We have two clinics choosing C.

613
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,520
They are Clinic One and Clinic Three.

614
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:33,720
Come.

615
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,480
Clinic Three, explain your reasoning first.

616
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm most familiar with this song.

617
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,920
How does it go?

618
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,320
She always...

619
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,840
only leaves her phone number.

620
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,600
This song...

621
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,040
never lets me walk her home.

622
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,520
So I feel...

623
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
it should be closer to my generation.

624
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,920
We thought similarly to them.

625
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,800
It just feels a bit vaporwave...

626
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,880
a song with that kind of vibe.

627
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Congratulations to Clinic One and Clinic Three.

628
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,480
Correct answer.

629
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Successfully accumulated another 15 seconds.

630
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,760
Year

631
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,120
received China's first

632
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,600
resident ID card was

633
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,800
what profession?

634
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,160
I know

635
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,120
Painter

636
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,160
Merchant

637
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,280
Singer

638
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,560
Teacher

639
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,400
Either C or D

640
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,080
D

641
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,480
D C C B

642
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,160
Clinic 2

643
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,120
Why?

644
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,440
Three long

645
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,360
Right

646
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,160
Other classmates

647
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,200
anyone confident about

648
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,360
this question?

649
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,640
In my memory

650
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,120
it was one of our country's

651
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,800
female sopranos

652
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,360
who received the first ID card

653
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,120
I think it might be

654
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,040
Congratulations Clinic 3, Clinic 2

655
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Awesome

656
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,000
Alright

657
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,280
Which of these celebrities

658
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,000
wasn't born in 1988?

659
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,000
I know

660
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Zhu Yilong

661
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,760
Older

662
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,080
Tan Jianci probably

663
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,800
He's not even thirty

664
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,320
Clinic 4 and Clinic 1

665
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
both chose A

666
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,120
Why?

667
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,840
Not referring to other teachers

668
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
Meaning they don't look young

669
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,000
But

670
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But Teacher Tan looks

671
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,480
exceptionally young indeed

672
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,320
Same

673
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,000
Seconded

674
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,440
Congratulations to Clinic 1 and Clinic 4

675
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,200
The answer is A

676
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,160
Okay

677
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,360
Teacher Tan is indeed very young

678
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,880
Alright, get ready for the next question

679
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,840
Year

680
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,640
Which of the following dramas cannot be seen on TV

681
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,600
is which one below

682
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,800
Consultation Room 2

683
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
Could you explain why?

684
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,280
"Misty Rain" and "The Deer and the Cauldron"

685
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,880
These were both relatively early works

686
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,600
As for the Four Great Classical Novels

687
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,520
"Journey to the West" was from 1986

688
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,120
And "Dream of the Red Chamber" was probably

689
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,440
either 1987 or 1988

690
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,960
So we chose "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"

691
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,280
What about Consultation Room 4?

692
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,160
If a director films two simultaneously

693
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,680
He needs a proper creative cycle

694
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,440
I remember "Dream of the Red Chamber" was

695
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
probably the 1987 version

696
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,520
I think "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"

697
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,680
came slightly later

698
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,640
That seems quite reasonable

699
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,680
Congratulations to Consultation Rooms 2 and 4

700
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,000
for successfully accumulating 15 seconds of build time

701
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,680
Which of these poetic lines

702
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,200
originated from the 1980s?

703
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,560
B A D B

704
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,400
Congratulations

705
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
Congratulations to Clinic 3

706
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,120
Successfully accumulated another

707
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,600
seconds of setup time

708
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,360
This polymer thing...

709
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,560
Are you also knowledgeable about poetry?

710
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,520
Somewhat

711
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,280
Alright, now for the final question

712
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,960
Brothers

713
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,040
This is the last question

714
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,080
Which of the following events occurred in 1988?

715
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,240
already happened

716
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,920
Definitely doesn't seem like it

717
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,640
Have you ever seen Boss Bao take the subway?

718
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,520
No

719
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,480
Lotteries should have existed long ago

720
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,280
China Sports Lottery

721
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,000
China Welfare Lottery

722
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,400
Because they're both state-run lotteries

723
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Right

724
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,800
I think it's B and D

725
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,360
Should choose C

726
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,000
D C D B

727
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Then congratulations to Clinic 4 for the correct answer

728
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,880
Are you ready, everyone?

729
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,720
Ready.

730
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,360
Three, two, one.

731
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,000
Start building.

732
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,720
Ignore what falls.

733
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,000
Consultation Room 2, please stop construction

734
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
Okay, stopping

735
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,200
Five, four, three, two, one

736
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,600
Stop construction, everyone

737
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,680
Stand down, we're done

738
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,760
They might not have more than us

739
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,280
Clinic Four gets 61 points

740
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,160
Clinic Three, 51 points

741
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,400
Clinic Two, 33 points

742
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,960
Clinic One

743
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,200
Top layer has eleven

744
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,520
This layer has two less

745
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,480
Good, this layer has two fewer again

746
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,720
Good, two less again

747
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,920
We can still get third place

748
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,320
We actually got third place

749
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,320
Clinic One, 11 points

750
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,600
Congratulations to them

751
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,240
Impressive, impressive

752
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,600
Thank you

753
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,080
My mistake

754
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,960
I'm the "curse" of miraculous healing

755
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,360
But they did build it quite beautifully

756
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,640
Right

757
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,720
Beauty takes time

758
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,400
This is a real shoddy construction

759
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,080
Pretty on the outside

760
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,360
but inside it's all...

761
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,560
I'm about to draw

762
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,720
the final assessment for this session

763
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm so nervous

764
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,720
I'll choose

765
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,120
the curtain

766
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,200
medical ring set

767
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,600
Come on, everyone

768
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,240
Let's draw

769
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,920
the two clinics for the first round

770
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,480
Okay, Examination Room One

771
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,800
Second examination room

772
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,480
Alright

773
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,640
Come on, guys

774
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,880
Gather around

775
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,240
Put Consultation Room One first

776
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,960
Place five circles

777
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,320
Come on, let it go

778
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I feel like the world is spinning

779
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,880
I'm already starting to feel dizzy

780
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,160
This game is a bit too difficult

781
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,240
I'm kind of

782
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,360
Maybe we should just play casually without overthinking

783
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,000
Can't calculate it all

784
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,320
Your possible moves

785
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,920
Each move takes forever to calculate

786
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,360
The sky's vast for birds to fly

787
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,480
Let's go this way

788
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
Alright

789
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,680
Jump over it

790
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,600
Is this okay?

791
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,880
Yes.

792
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,400
The one above, come here.

793
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,280
Okay

794
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,680
No arrest

795
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,680
Let's go

796
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,680
I think we should go that way

797
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm so afraid of making a mistake

798
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,480
This game is truly difficult

799
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,240
Huang Kai

800
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,840
Seems doable

801
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,720
Either arrest him alone

802
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,800
Just (stay) here in Lvteng

803
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,720
Useless

804
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,240
Then this is set in stone for us

805
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,400
He can still come back to mess with us

806
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Let me think about this

807
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,080
I roughly know

808
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,640
Wait a moment, let me think

809
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,120
Diametrically opposed

810
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,160
Want to try?

811
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,080
Like this

812
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,840
Then flip this over to here

813
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,160
Let's push it up there

814
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,480
Push it upward

815
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,960
Okay, I think it works

816
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,480
Is that what you want?

817
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,600
Okay, that works too.

818
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,280
Just choose one of the two.

819
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,880
Here or here.

820
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:36,360
Place it like this.

821
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,880
You can only have one.

822
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,920
We

823
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,880
This side is locked

824
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
Can't move this side

825
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,520
Play this one

826
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,760
Go up and take two of his pieces

827
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,000
What else can we move?

828
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,240
Nothing left to move.

829
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,640
Feels like we have to give up.

830
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,680
Let's move this one.

831
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,120
I'll take these five.

832
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,040
Should we still move this ring?

833
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,440
We need to move it one more step.

834
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,640
Then you need to take one more.

835
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,600
Put that ring away.

836
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,040
That one seems a bit cumbersome.

837
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,840
Then move the green one here.

838
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,200
Right, they blocked that

839
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,200
Luckily we saw it

840
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,520
Not this one

841
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,320
Move it here

842
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,720
Right?

843
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,880
Then change these two as well

844
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,760
There's one more here

845
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,560
Okay

846
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,520
You're surrounded

847
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,200
Not necessarily

848
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,800
He took another step and jumped back

849
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,800
Wait, let me think of a way

850
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,360
We have to do it this way

851
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,960
Then he won't be able to move

852
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:48,960
Actually, it's possible

853
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,040
Why can't we?

854
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,640
Is it lagging like this?

855
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,640
But we got another one.

856
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,440
Fun

857
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,680
Can both clinics comment on this assessment

858
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,760
Share some thoughts

859
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,480
Too difficult

860
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,440
This is too complicated

861
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,920
Requires sufficient energy

862
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,360
Attention and meticulousness

863
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,680
It really requires what should I say

864
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
That kind of all-seeing awareness

865
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,720
Because I didn't expect

866
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,680
You could jump directly from here to there

867
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,520
Missed that

868
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,920
That was still an excellent match

869
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,240
Now, Clinic Four and Clinic Two

870
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,760
Please come up

871
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,840
Clinic Four goes first

872
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,920
Here comes the "God" of show effects

873
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,880
First take the side

874
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,920
Yes, first take the corner

875
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,600
This feels so right

876
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,280
He's specifically blocking us, right?

877
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,040
Corner first then

878
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,320
Okay, no regrets once placed

879
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,040
Place it here

880
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,760
Then put the red ring here

881
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,400
This one

882
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,640
Sure

883
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,800
Good move

884
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,320
This can also handle it

885
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,360
Put this here

886
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,720
Okay, go ahead

887
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,600
Ring Restraint

888
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,560
Lock Down

889
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,040
But he needs three rings

890
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,360
to lock our two rings

891
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,400
We don’t want to be locked

892
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,520
Might as well take the time to check it out

893
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,680
Kai is messing with their minds

894
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,760
Right now, everyone seems like useless pawns

895
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,280
Why not take control of these two as well

896
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,880
Find a chance to break through

897
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,480
Then charge out

898
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,320
I don’t think we need to charge out

899
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,520
Because he can’t possibly take all three rings

900
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,720
Lock my two rings

901
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,600
Then these two rings of yours

902
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,640
would be useless, right?

903
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,280
Look

904
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,160
What about your plan?

905
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,000
You two should join in

906
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,920
Put the rings here

907
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,440
There'll be five rings soon

908
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,200
Then we can take them all at once

909
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,480
No

910
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,680
We have another way to win

911
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,400
Another way to win

912
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,480
There's another way to win

913
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,200
Yes, there's another way to win

914
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,160
What is it?

915
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,320
The main focus now is adjusting the positions

916
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,080
Because there aren't enough cards yet

917
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,960
Right, adjust the positions first

918
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,600
I think we need to block its three rings

919
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,240
Correct

920
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,360
But if you place it there

921
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,920
Move the next one to this position

922
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,440
Then we can't move this one for now

923
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,840
Then place it here

924
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,560
Shift green to the left

925
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,880
Move it down to this point

926
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,560
It has five chances

927
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,840
But these five chances

928
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,360
Can easily be flipped away

929
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,200
Leave this circle here

930
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,360
Then it can't be flipped no matter what

931
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,920
Okay, then place it there

932
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,080
We'll place two rings ahead of them

933
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,560
That should do it

934
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:07,920
Right

935
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,480
Then he won't be able to jump over

936
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,320
They're withdrawing one by one

937
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,240
Withdrawing one by one

938
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,480
Then we can eliminate them first

939
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,480
Otherwise these two rings of ours

940
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,880
Right

941
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,760
Dead

942
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,600
Here

943
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,080
Then eliminate this one

944
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,160
Oh no

945
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,000
How interesting

946
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Hoist with his own petard

947
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,920
I'll claim this spot first.

948
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,880
Truth will always come to light.

949
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,720
Wait, I'll place it here.

950
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,720
Move this ring over here.

951
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,200
Okay.

952
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,640
Let's make that ring move away.

953
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,800
This should work here.

954
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,520
Go ahead, place it here.

955
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,640
Actually, we could go for area control.

956
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,960
This is another way to win.

957
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,600
This is an alternative winning strategy.

958
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,440
Because we'll run out of cards soon.

959
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,880
It's based on quantity.

960
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,240
They currently have more in quantity.

961
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,320
If we flip this one,

962
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,040
the green one can immediately capture it.

963
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,160
Let's do this one.

964
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,440
I think the priority right now is

965
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,520
He wants to take this side

966
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,800
I'll just move this piece here

967
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,280
and occupy this spot

968
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,760
then his corner formation (won't work)

969
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,880
I think you should pretend to focus on the side

970
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,520
while actually connecting lines

971
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,040
I can hear everything

972
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,080
You're being way too loud

973
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,040
Conspiring out loud

974
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,840
So Huang Kai's method actually works

975
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,800
We really need to say it this way

976
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,720
Whispering, right?

977
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,680
I think this is exactly how we should do it

978
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,520
Move this one here

979
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,520
Take this position

980
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,120
Right

981
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,640
And once he moves this

982
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,960
we can just go there

983
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,560
If this row gets blocked

984
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,080
This feels much better

985
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,200
Put one here

986
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,920
Move it over here

987
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,040
It's just four

988
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,320
This is acceptable

989
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,520
We already have five here.

990
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,360
We must eat one right now.

991
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,000
But you know...

992
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,600
After this goes here...

993
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
Where does this go?

994
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,120
This goes this way.

995
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,240
You must eat one

996
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,400
That was really hard to take just now.

997
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,520
Holding on

998
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,520
Now they've got us in these two rings

999
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,720
Stuck here

1000
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,160
But we can move this first

1001
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,640
Now there are only nine left in the public deck

1002
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,560
Okay

1003
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,720
Kai moves the piece

1004
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,320
He wants to gather five

1005
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,800
Place one and move up

1006
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,480
This one of his can't be removed no matter what

1007
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,760
Place

1008
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,720
It's over

1009
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,880
He already has five

1010
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,560
Once I'm here, he can't get past

1011
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,880
At least two of his escape routes are blocked.

1012
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,920
Yes.

1013
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,800
We've already lost all of these.

1014
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,080
We're out of options, right?

1015
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,360
There might be a way.

1016
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,720
Both of these are our pieces.

1017
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,920
So he can't connect five.

1018
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,680
If we move this over...

1019
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,080
Flip this one and he'll have five.

1020
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,600
Then shouldn't I just block it?

1021
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,960
Genius.

1022
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,480
You're a real genius.

1023
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,880
Then go ahead and block it!

1024
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,680
Fine, then let's place it there.

1025
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,080
Then hurry up and block it!

1026
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,440
You've got something waiting for us, don't you?

1027
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,160
Just waiting for you to make your move.

1028
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,640
Let me move over here.

1029
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,200
Only two pieces left now.

1030
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,720
Both sides have one move remaining.

1031
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,520
Actually, you can make your move now.

1032
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,280
No matter where you move, you'll lose.

1033
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,360
No matter where we move, we'll lose.

1034
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,160
Just these last two moves.

1035
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,520
As long as they don't succeed, we win.

1036
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,680
Place it here, move it there.

1037
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,560
Then I'll have one more.

1038
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,200
Okay.

1039
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,920
Alright, no regrets after placing the piece.

1040
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,040
I see it.

1041
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,160
It's your turn now.

1042
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,520
And this one is public

1043
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,160
Right

1044
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,480
Forming five

1045
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,720
You must remove one ring now

1046
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,960
Go ahead and take it

1047
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,000
Okay

1048
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,360
Now it's our turn, right?

1049
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,840
Then let's take our own path

1050
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,120
We'll be one step ahead of them

1051
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,680
What should we do? What should we do?

1052
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,640
Actually, we've already...

1053
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,200
It feels like we've lost, right?

1054
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:54,640
Yeah.

1055
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,600
It feels like a loss.

1056
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:58,920
Okay.

1057
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,120
Then let's congratulate Clinic Two...

1058
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,480
for securing...

1059
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,440
the final 20% of the brainpower score.

1060
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,920
Congratulations to you.

1061
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,880
Come on.

1062
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,480
Here, thank you all for your hard work.

1063
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,200
I believe everyone

1064
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,960
is eagerly awaiting

1065
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,160
the announcement of the final results.

1066
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,240
We will now announce

1067
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,240
the rankings from the four rounds of assessments.

1068
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,760
For the first time,

1069
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,200
since the premiere of "Start Using Your Brain,"

1070
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,160
we have consulting rooms tied for first place.

1071
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,880
Congratulations.

1072
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,080
After sixty-four years of evolution,

1073
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,280
the acting sect leader position (reward)

1074
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,720
has been materialized as a golden gourd

1075
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,440
into an acting sect leader appointment certificate.

1076
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,240
Student Ren Yinpeng,

1077
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,960
becomes acting sect leader for the first time.

1078
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,960
Next, student Hu Minghao,

1079
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,760
becomes acting sect leader for the first time.

1080
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,280
Congratulations to Huang Kai from Consulting Room 2,

1081
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,440
on his first appointment as acting sect leader.

1082
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,920
Congratulations to Hou Zhuocheng from Consulting Room 2,

1083
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,440
on his first appointment as acting sect leader.

1084
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,920
After more than sixty years

1085
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,080
of intellectual enhancement services,

1086
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,520
this is their first time becoming acting sect leaders.

1087
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,560
The service has paid off.

1088
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,560
This proves our enhancement services are effective.

1089
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,760
This is...

1090
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,200
seems good for propping up instant noodles.

1091
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,680
I think this is...

1092
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,960
good enough to get once.

1093
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,040
Because if you never get it,

1094
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,520
what would you tell everyone?

1095
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,360
No offense meant,

1096
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,640
but currently we're the only two

1097
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,160
who haven't received it yet.

1098
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,240
I've realized having some ambition

1099
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,160
is still important.

1100
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,160
Because over sixty years ago,

1101
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,520
when I first came to the Brain Hall,

1102
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,360
I said

1103
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,680
I wanted to erase

1104
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,520
that clear-eyed foolishness of a college student

1105
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,640
from my gaze.

1106
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,720
Now after sixty-plus years,

1107
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,720
I've finally graduated -

1108
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,200
after delaying graduation for fifty years.

1109
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,880
I'm extremely happy.

1110
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,720
Let's move outside

1111
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,880
Now our Zifan and Zongyu

1112
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,120
are ready to take on

1113
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,840
the ice bucket foot soak challenge

1114
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,400
Do you two have anything to say now?

1115
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,320
I'd like to nominate someone

1116
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,920
to pour this ice water for me

1117
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,080
That person is my former teammate

1118
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:43,920
Hou Zhuocheng

1119
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,280
I have nothing to say

1120
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,560
I'm just taking the straight-face challenge

1121
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,160
to last thirty seconds

1122
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,640
What?

1123
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,840
Last thirty seconds

1124
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,600
Three, two, one, begin!

1125
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,240
Okay, start the timer.

1126
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,320
Eight hundred soldiers rush northward

1127
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,320
Eating grapes without spitting the skins

1128
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,640
Not eating grapes but spitting the skins

1129
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,120
Artillery fears hitting the soldiers

1130
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,720
Soldiers fear the artillery's guns

1131
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,160
Not a single moment apart

1132
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,560
Three, two, one

1133
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,640
Challenge succeeded

1134
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,560
Awesome

1135
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,000
Alright, let me briefly

1136
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,200
explain to everyone

1137
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,920
the rules of the wet towel cannon game.

1138
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,920
As the name suggests,

1139
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,120
one person receives the cannon,

1140
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,680
and one person fires it.

1141
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,520
First, you two need to choose

1142
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,560
who will help you shoot the cannon.

1143
00:57:59,280 --> 00:57:59,560
Okay.

1144
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,560
Yang Zongyu then.

1145
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,840
Before receiving the premium service,

1146
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,040
does Xiaolong have anything to say?

1147
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,200
Prepare your "last will and testament."

1148
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,800
Alright.

1149
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,520
The "will" as in "last will."

1150
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,320
Got it.

1151
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,200
Didn't see it

1152
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,520
Can we do it again?

1153
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,640
Now then, next up

1154
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,200
is our classmate Haoyang

1155
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,600
Any words before the premium service?

1156
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,000
I think we should let the storm

1157
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,280
rage even fiercer

1158
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,200
Whirlwind Charge Tornado

1159
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,200
Bring it on

1160
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,600
Whirlwind Charge Tornado

1161
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,120
Then let's congratulate Haoyang

1162
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,640
And our Xiaolong

1163
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,960
Value-added service completed

1164
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,840
It's nothing.

1165
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,960
So today,

1166
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,760
the intense and exciting brainstorming session

1167
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,760
is coming to an end.

1168
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,640
All the doctors have worked very hard.

1169
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,080
Today was also

1170
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,840
a day of having great minds together.

1171
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,120
So today,

1172
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,200
our 1988 "Let's Start Brainstorming"

1173
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,800
must bid everyone farewell.

1174
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,480
"Let's Start Brainstorming"

1175
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,040
Goodbye.

1176
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:11,440
Goodbye.

1177
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,320
Choose your favorite food

1178
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,680
to determine your teammates.

1179
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,440
Waiting for my Houttuynia cordata brothers.

1180
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,560
Am I about to be kicked out?

1181
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,640
Excuse me.

1182
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,560
Sorry.

1183
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:27,680
13.

1184
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,320
13.

1185
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,000
11.

1186
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,640
17.

1187
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
Being this cautious?

1188
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,680
Why are the numbers so big?

1189
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,280
They're messing with us, right?

1190
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:33,880
They're messing with us, right?

1191
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,640
23.

1192
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,040
25.

1193
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,680
This game is turning into a bluffing contest.

1194
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,240
What number was called?

1195
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,000
Open.

1196
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,920
Challenge.

1197
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,960
"The Dragon's Move" coming up.

1198
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,680
Feel the dragon.

1199
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,040
Actually, we can just make any move.

1200
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,880
"Kill" him.

1201
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,000
You don't seem to have any other choice.

1202
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,760
They're going to

1203
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,800
set up a slingshot.

1204
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,000
We must come up with

1205
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,520
a way to counter the slingshot tactic.

1206
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,840
They've made some excellent moves.

1207
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,360
Those teapots of theirs now

1208
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,520
have nowhere to go.

1209
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,600
Feels like we can't hold them back anymore.

1210
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,640
Feels like we can't hold them back anymore.

1211
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,280
Calm down, calm down.

1212
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,360
Can't come back.

1213
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,680
Oh my, what am I doing?
