1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,480
No matter your reasons,

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,080
you shouldn't have come in here.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,440
This is my private chamber.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,560
No one is allowed inside.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Private chamber.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,080
You're in my private space.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840
Tell me immediately, where's the Pink Phoenix?

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,760
Everyone get out!

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,920
Out!

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,840
Let's go, we should leave first.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,760
Retreat.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,440
Sorry for disturbing you.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,280
My apologies.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,000
A-Tui.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
Jiawei

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,880
What's going on, Jiawei? Baduanjin

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,040
What's wrong with you?

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,600
Baduanjin

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Baduanjin

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,720
Jiawei

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,120
Jia

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,360
I don't know

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,040
You really don't know?

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
I really don't know

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,320
It's open

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,440
This warehouse

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,240
There's quite a lot of stuff inside the warehouse

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Warehouse

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,160
This warehouse

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,040
First, there were two key points earlier

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
She and he

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,000
Has a new identity

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,680
Could be twins or something similar

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,800
Yes, twins or something like that

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,120
Twins

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,960
Did you know I'm a twin, Brother Spider?

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
She's definitely not a twin

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
She's my biological sister

39
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,320
I can prove her existence

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,600
It's hard to say for sure

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,640
Mr. X

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
Be careful with Mr. X

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,160
No

44
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,920
Don’t listen to his nonsense

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,160
He’s trying to confuse us now

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,560
Let’s deal with the things in this room first

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,920
So when you were little, you were here

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,960
Played here

49
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,360
Yes, we did

50
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,240
That’s right, exactly here

51
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,400
Here

52
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
This is what you drew as kids, right?

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,720
Yes

54
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,920
Did someone trigger some kind of mechanism?

55
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,000
There's a door here.

56
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,160
It's sealed shut.

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,760
Yes

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,760
That is, you used to play here as kids.

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
Have you heard this phrase?

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
Right.

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
I remember this sound very clearly.

62
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,720
I'd recognize it even if it turned to ashes.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,960
Take a quick look.

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,320
Quick, have a look.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
White passage.

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Then we'll have to open the door.

67
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,120
Let's get this open.

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
The key unlocks it.

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,160
Is there anything here?

70
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,080
Nothing here.

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
Here's a newspaper

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,720
Tui Town Daily

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,680
Recently, our Brain Hall

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Professor Tuixindong, a renowned psychologist

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,200
revealed a surprising experiment

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,680
The subjects were a group of children aged

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,920
between five and ten years old

78
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,880
Children were placed in a sealed room

79
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,480
to experience extreme stress situations

80
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
While repeatedly showing them

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
a forest poster

82
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
to imprint the forest image

83
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,360
deeply into their subconscious

84
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,040
When these children grew up

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,520
whenever facing desperate situations

86
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,840
they would unconsciously experience

87
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
hallucinations of being in a forest

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,320
Professor Tuixindong is concerned about

89
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,160
the mental health of Tui Town residents

90
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,680
If you experience mental confusion

91
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,720
memory disorders, auditory or visual hallucinations

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,680
please call

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
Brain Hall's phone number

94
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,360
01326916

95
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
We can call her later

96
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,880
Note: Tui Town's first telephones have been installed

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
and are now operational

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,400
located at various places in Tui Town

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,760
including government offices and Brain Hall reception

100
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
Tui Le Men boss's office

101
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,880
If you wish to call Brain Hall

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,080
you may visit these locations

103
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,760
We should go to the boss's office to call her

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Make the call

105
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,720
Let's go

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,360
Things are getting more complicated, I feel

107
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
Oh, Brother Le

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,680
Come on, make the call

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,160
Go ahead

110
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,400
0

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,000
1

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,800
3

113
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
2

114
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,760
It's connected

115
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello, good day

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Hello?

117
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,840
I'm the Heartbeat Doctor

118
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,760
May I ask who you are?

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm Wang Chuanshuo

120
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
Wang Chuanshuo?

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
You're not my scheduled appointment today

122
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,640
My scheduled appointment is Wang Ge

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,840
Then I am Wang Ge

124
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,840
Wang Ge is a little kid

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,280
Wang Ge is a child

126
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Goodbye

127
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,400
She even had you pick it up, impressive

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,960
Come on, pick it up, you do it

129
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,760
Little kid

130
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,880
Ba Li, only you can do this

131
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,480
Hello, good day

132
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm Doctor Tui Xindong

133
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,360
May I ask who you are?

134
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Hello, doctor

135
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,440
I am Wang Ge

136
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,600
Wang Ge, you finally called.

137
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Just now there were several

138
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,000
people calling, I don't know who they were

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,080
It was so annoying

140
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
I...

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,360
I often hear a voice

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
What kind of voice?

143
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,440
Well...

144
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
There's this

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
older sister who says

146
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,640
that I should live well

147
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,800
Where is this sister?

148
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,280
Who told you these things?

149
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,880
I don't know

150
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,920
I really don't know

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,520
In that room

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
We were locked in a

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,640
very abandoned room

154
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
And then...

155
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,400
we played squatting game

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
played the squatting game

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,960
and heard a sister's voice

158
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,720
Really?

159
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Yes

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,600
Then someone rescued us

161
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,480
Then you should be careful

162
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,240
I once conducted an experiment

163
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,760
across the ocean

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
If when you were little

165
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,520
during times of great fear and despair

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,000
you heard a voice

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
or saw an image

168
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,320
then when you grow up and face

169
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
similar extreme despair

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
that voice will reappear

171
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,480
and make you hallucinate

172
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,200
Never underestimate the strength of the human spirit

173
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Often it's only yourself

174
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,880
who can pull yourself out of the mire

175
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,120
I understand

176
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,520
Then

177
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,480
Then

178
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,440
Ask her if there's anything else

179
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
she wants to tell us

180
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,400
Little Wang Ge

181
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,560
It seems there are also

182
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
adults talking beside you

183
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,720
If they have any questions

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,120
they can ask me all at once

185
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,160
No

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,400
Sis, there isn't

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Yes

188
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,240
We do

189
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,120
Do you know any doctors

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,160
Do you know any doctors

191
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
in Tui Town who can perform this experiment

192
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,520
Is this your dad?

193
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Yes

194
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
Hello, Mr. Wang

195
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,120
Hello

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,760
Actually, this experiment isn't that important

197
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,800
What matters is

198
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,760
If you encounter

199
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,720
a situation similar to this experiment

200
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
then this theory

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
can support it

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,200
But you must never underestimate

203
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,640
the strength within you

204
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Goodbye

205
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,400
So,

206
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,640
she merely proposed a theory

207
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,440
an experiment

208
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,000
that when people are young,

209
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
certain experiences

210
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,400
influence them

211
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,160
Then when they grow up

212
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,200
and face desperate situations again,

213
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,280
they save themselves

214
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,120
Exactly

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,440
But where did that hallucination of a brooch come from?

216
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,120
This brooch feels too real to me.

217
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,960
There's evidence of that.

218
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
The flowers and everything are still there.

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
Is it possible that when we were kids, it was real?

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,440
That this person really saved us?

221
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,320
Right.

222
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,600
Now there are two possibilities.

223
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,480
The first possibility is that

224
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,800
those three never actually saw this person.

225
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,560
They were just trapped in that room

226
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,640
and heard sounds coming

227
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,560
from inside the room.

228
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,480
That's what you mean?

229
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,280
The other possibility is that all three of them

230
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,240
genuinely saw this person.

231
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,560
That such a person really existed

232
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,280
and saved them.

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,320
So this is something

234
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,240
we haven't figured out yet.

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,960
I think so.

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
There's another hidden room in that house.

237
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,640
That secret chamber cannot be opened

238
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
I think we should first

239
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,680
return to the core of Master Le's death case

240
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,000
Brother Le

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
This room also has a secret passage

242
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,560
Where?

243
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Here

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
It's inside the cabinet.

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
There's half a footprint here.

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,520
The killer definitely came in through here.

247
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,320
Right now, we're thinking—

248
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,280
how to activate this mechanism.

249
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's see what's in this room

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,560
that can open this door.

251
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,120
It has this sunflower thing

252
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,160
What is this thing

253
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,440
I think this

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,960
This should represent something

255
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Can we put one on top of this?

256
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,080
Place one

257
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,160
Pointer

258
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
If we find this

259
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,480
and arrange them

260
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,680
we might uncover some kind of password

261
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,240
Is this it?

262
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,600
Hour and minute hands

263
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
I always thought this microphone

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,120
had some life to it

265
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Isn't this a watch?

266
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,960
It also has this on it

267
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,640
time periods

268
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,920
It has these zodiac time markers

269
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,560
Clever

270
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,680
After it lights up

271
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,240
Master Le

272
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
Master Le's birthday

273
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,400
Does anyone know his birthday?

274
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,960
No idea

275
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,920
We found account books in the room

276
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,560
Ascension list

277
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,000
That plaque dated January 31st

278
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
The gate to a new world

279
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,000
was pushed open that year

280
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,640
was pushed open that year

281
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,120
The gate to a new world was pushed open that year

282
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,800
I understand now

283
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,920
This place opened in 1910

284
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
operated at a loss for a year

285
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,160
Then in 1911

286
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,120
after encountering special guests

287
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,040
it began turning a profit

288
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,040
The Tui Le Gate opened

289
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,920
in 1910

290
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,720
It sustained losses for 12 consecutive months

291
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
until January 1911

292
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,800
when Tui Le Gate became profitable

293
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,080
So that was 1911

294
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
1911, you say?

295
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,160
Yes, 19:11

296
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,560
7:11 PM

297
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,960
7:11 PM

298
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,200
Yeah

299
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,120
It's open

300
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,960
Wait a moment

301
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,080
So much money

302
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,440
All gold and treasures

303
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,240
Isn't this the money from that day?

304
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
This belongs to Tui Shenmi

305
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,960
Right?

306
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,920
Brother Le has hidden a lot of things here

307
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,080
Contract

308
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Contract

309
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,960
Brother Le sends to Tui Shenmi every month

310
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,360
recommended singers to develop in Tui Laohui

311
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
Tui Shenmi promised

312
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,560
to provide Brother Le with four small gold bars monthly

313
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,800
He recommends girls to him

314
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,280
Yes

315
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Then

316
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,400
gets money every month

317
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,560
Yes, he gives him money every month

318
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,680
The Mystic Selector can choose according to their preference

319
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,960
and change Master Le's recommended candidates

320
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,760
This is the notebook you found

321
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,640
Cross her out

322
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,880
Then they keep changing people

323
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,560
Article 4 states Master Le guarantees

324
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,440
that recommended singers meet all transfer conditions

325
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,080
required by the Mystic Selection

326
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,520
First requirement: orphan girls

327
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,840
To put it bluntly

328
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,240
those who don't know their parents

329
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
so no one would come looking

330
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,720
If they disappear, no one searches

331
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
Right, absolutely no one would look

332
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,640
Orphan girls who

333
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,760
pass physical examinations

334
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,320
Once they pass the physical exam

335
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,200
and are

336
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
orphans without any relatives

337
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,680
Isn't this suspicious?

338
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,440
What kind of physical examination?

339
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,160
So he's targeting these girls

340
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,400
but not necessarily for that purpose, right?

341
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,640
They claim they're going to Tuilao Hui

342
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,480
but actually end up in

343
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,520
the neighboring room

344
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,600
for experiments

345
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,160
This mysterious push is definitely up to something

346
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,080
Fenghuang is very likely

347
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,960
taken away by him

348
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,040
Possibly

349
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,160
This...

350
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,800
Like this

351
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,560
Let's guess what's behind this

352
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,320
I think it's

353
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,880
a passageway

354
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,120
Tui Lao Hui

355
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,600
Really?

356
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,440
Could be

357
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,840
Let me take a look

358
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,760
It's a room

359
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,200
This room is beautiful

360
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,440
And there's a desk

361
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,480
A desk lamp

362
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,040
Various famous calligraphy and paintings on the walls

363
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
All kinds of famous artworks

364
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,560
Does it slide open sideways or what?

365
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
Can't get in, it's stuck

366
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,280
Quick, blast it

367
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,600
This part is meant for you to blast

368
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,040
This really needs blasting

369
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,880
This absolutely requires blasting

370
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,560
This part needs to be kicked open

371
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,520
Quick, blast it

372
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,360
What are you doing?

373
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,960
You clean it up

374
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,000
You're the one blasting

375
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
You go clean up

376
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,000
How do I blast it?

377
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
Get up

378
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,680
Everyone, teachers

379
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,200
Come on, let Bai Cannon go through

380
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,400
Bai Cannon, open it for me

381
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,160
Bai Cannon, go!

382
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,440
Break it open for me

383
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Come on

384
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,560
Too violent

385
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,680
Is it this difficult?

386
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,760
I told you it was about demolition

387
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,560
We really need to kick it open

388
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,480
Go

389
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Oh my god

390
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,040
Be careful

391
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,600
Such a (place)

392
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,920
Be careful

393
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,040
This is the old hall master's office

394
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Mind Hall

395
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,920
Mind Hall

396
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,760
Mask

397
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,520
There's more here

398
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,160
What's this?

399
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,760
Laughing embrace

400
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,920
Dizzy embrace

401
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,040
Dizzy embrace

402
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,800
Laughing embrace

403
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,920
This is dizzy incense

404
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,520
Dizzy incense - something that makes people

405
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,840
experience a dizzy embrace

406
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,440
Causes immediate unconsciousness when inhaled

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,720
Is this what was lit at the entrance?

408
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,120
This

409
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,280
Could be dizzy incense

410
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,120
Dizzy incense

411
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,320
If using on others

412
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,800
Please wear a mask

413
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,240
Must wear a mask

414
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,160
The killer must have worn this mask

415
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Right

416
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,680
Because he lit that (dizzy incense)

417
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,720
Come on, let's have a laughing embrace

418
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,400
Let's go

419
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,360
What is this thing?

420
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,440
Fits perfectly, you look just like

421
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,400
He matches quite well too

422
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
Also a good match

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,480
You

424
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,800
He's not bad either

425
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
They're all about the same

426
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,000
What are you trying to do?

427
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,720
There are matches here too

428
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
And gloves

429
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
These are signs of use

430
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,040
Traces of use

431
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,720
The killer must have been in this room

432
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,520
Took this to drug someone

433
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,160
Then entered through this secret passage

434
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
The boss's room

435
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,760
So Master Le only knows about his vault

436
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
Right

437
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,200
He doesn't know someone here wants

438
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,560
to steal his gold

439
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Yes

440
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,240
Go out and take a look

441
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
And it's been snowing for three days

442
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,680
There's been heavy snowfall for three straight days outside

443
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,640
It has stopped now

444
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,360
Everyone

445
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,760
Distinguished guests residing in Sanjia Alley

446
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,480
You may now leave in an orderly manner

447
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Are you saying there are no footprints?

448
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
If there are no footprints

449
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,920
How did he (the killer) get out

450
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,280
Who

451
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,920
Where did you all come from?

452
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Why did you go upstairs?

453
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,960
The office on the second floor

454
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,720
was our former Sect Leader's office

455
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
Ever since the old Sect Leader passed away

456
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,800
this office has remained vacant

457
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,440
There's nothing up there

458
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,080
Come down quickly

459
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,640
Alright, you go down first

460
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Be careful

461
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,560
Watch your step coming down

462
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,880
Careful

463
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Our sect's courtyard

464
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,880
hasn't been cleared of snow for a long time

465
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,480
Look

466
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,680
It's so clean there aren't even footprints

467
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,680
Do as you please

468
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,800
I'll go inside to work now

469
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
If the killer left this way after murdering someone

470
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,480
how did they come down?

471
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,400
This thing

472
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,880
left no footprints at all

473
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,920
From here

474
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,520
Look, the only way up

475
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,040
might be climbing this pillar

476
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,400
That's just too

477
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,200
difficult, isn't it?

478
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
For the killer,

479
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,080
I don't see what's so hard about it.

480
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,480
Climbing over from here

481
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,800
is really high.

482
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,960
There must be some logic to it.

483
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,600
Why couldn't the killer use qinggong (lightness skill)?

484
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,160
If you could use qinggong, why take secret passages?

485
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,080
Just use bone-shrinking skill

486
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,320
to slip through door gaps.

487
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,840
Or use wire work.

488
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,240
Actually, I think

489
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,800
you know,

490
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,720
when committing the crime,

491
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
did he tie people up with hair?

492
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,680
Whether using hair

493
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,320
or rope,

494
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,400
he must have used something.

495
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,560
Following this logic,

496
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,000
should we check up there -

497
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,120
the railings and such?

498
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:00,960
Look,

499
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,320
are there any scratch marks

500
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,680
up here?

501
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,120
Nothing.

502
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,360
Then he didn't come down from there.

503
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,600
Because a person's weight

504
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,520
would at least leave

505
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,360
some scratches or marks.

506
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
This is

507
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
This is

508
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,960
This thing can actually be pulled out

509
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,640
Right

510
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,480
This works

511
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
This works

512
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
So all of them can be pulled out?

513
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,520
All of them can

514
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,240
Then it's possible

515
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,080
He used this to get down

516
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,240
Could be

517
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,600
Think about it—if he

518
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,040
pulled this out

519
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,120
took one layer at a time

520
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,800
Exactly

521
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,320
Then we've basically cracked this

522
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,360
footprint-less (crime) method

523
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,680
Right?

524
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,240
Yes

525
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,400
So now we know

526
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
the killer's movement path

527
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,040
Correct

528
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,920
Anyway, this person must have some strong connection

529
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
with Dongnao Hall, right?

530
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,480
You've been to Dongnao Hall

531
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,360
None of your business whether I have or not

532
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,960
No,

533
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,240
I mean before

534
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,800
previously

535
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,840
I've been there

536
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,440
Been there

537
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,960
Why did you go to Dongnao Hall?

538
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,600
For treatment?

539
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Why should I tell you my reasons?

540
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,560
Show me evidence first, then I'll talk

541
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,360
We've reconstructed the killer's route

542
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,600
Must have exited here

543
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,680
Then doubled back

544
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,160
So we should probably check

545
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,640
what's on this street

546
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:06,920
Don't you think?

547
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,560
Yes, worth investigating

548
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,280
We've returned to Tuile Gate

549
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,600
Okay

550
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,440
We're back at

551
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,600
our dear Tuile Gate

552
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,160
Now then

553
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,920
we know

554
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,600
the killer's route already

555
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,960
Right

556
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,920
You all

557
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,760
are from Tuile Gate, right?

558
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,280
We're from Tuile Gate

559
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,880
Yes

560
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,400
Let me introduce myself

561
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,080
As for me

562
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm Technician Xiu

563
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,960
I just received

564
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,000
a notice from Tuizhen Power Company

565
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,680
saying your Tuile Gate

566
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,440
currently has

567
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,040
high-power equipment running

568
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,160
High-power appliances

569
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,320
Is Tuile being mysterious?

570
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,880
You see

571
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,680
this could affect

572
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,280
overloading our entire power grid

573
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,480
So

574
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,040
quickly

575
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,720
turn off these high-power appliances

576
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,360
These are Tuile Gate's electricity guidelines

577
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,200
I have other business, bye

578
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,680
Okay, thanks

579
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,280
When using high-power appliances

580
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,480
that affect regional power supply

581
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,840
you must turn them off promptly

582
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,240
If unable to turn off appliances

583
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,680
use the following method to cut power

584
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,000
to the room's circuit breaker

585
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,400
Simultaneously press

586
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
the six buttons located near

587
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,160
the singer's portrait on Tuile Gate's 2nd floor hallway

588
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,080
until the lights

589
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,400
return to full brightness

590
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,920
Calabash Brothers, move out

591
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,720
Alright

592
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,840
Everyone take your positions

593
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,440
Let's go

594
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
Go

595
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,720
By the singer's portrait

596
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,520
This one?

597
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,040
It's so high up.

598
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,360
I can't reach it.

599
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,920
Such a high button.

600
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
How can we press it?

601
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,120
You tall ones go.

602
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,880
Let me try.

603
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,520
I can't reach it either

604
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,240
Never mind

605
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,200
This is ridiculous

606
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Can't reach it

607
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,120
Even the three of you can't reach it

608
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Out of reach

609
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,080
Too high

610
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,560
Let's find a shorter one

611
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,360
Look for a shorter one

612
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,560
This one

613
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,960
Zhu Yaozi

614
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,200
This one's tall too

615
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,920
There's one here

616
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,480
This one, this one

617
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,120
You can reach this one

618
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,200
There's another one here

619
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,120
Here

620
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,840
This one's good

621
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,040
This one, we can...

622
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,800
One of these, one of those

623
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,760
Then I'll press this one

624
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,760
You take that one

625
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,600
Then I'll take this one

626
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,000
I'll take this one

627
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,520
Get a stool

628
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,520
I don't need it

629
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,960
I don't need it

630
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,400
No need to make it hard for yourself

631
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,720
Bai Tailor

632
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,640
Get the stool

633
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,800
He's already moving the table

634
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,720
He's being sneaky

635
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,880
Let me know when you're ready.

636
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
Report in from all positions.

637
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Pink Phoenix.

638
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,280
Orchid Crystal.

639
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,360
Feng Zi.

640
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,480
Zhu Yaozi.

641
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,520
Zhu Yaozi. That's really her name.

642
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,080
Xia Banla.

643
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,280
Mei Yunlian.

644
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,720
Three.

645
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,640
Two.

646
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,520
One.

647
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,360
Hold it down for several seconds.

648
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,680
What are you doing?

649
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
And then?

650
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,240
Keep holding it down?

651
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
There's someone behind me.

652
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,480
I feel someone next to me.

653
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,640
Get away.

654
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,040
I know you're here.

655
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,240
Don't

656
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,000
Go away

657
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
What's wrong?

658
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,720
Help!

659
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,880
Quick, catch him!

660
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,760
Hurry, hurry!

661
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,040
Grab him!

662
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,760
Everyone, it's me.

663
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,080
I'm Brother Chen.

664
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,640
You scared us to death!

665
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm not the long-haired witch

666
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,680
mentioned in the Tui Town Daily.

667
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,200
Why are you pretending?

668
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,080
Well, I heard that

669
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,040
Dilraba was going to hold

670
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,600
a Dilraba Fashion Week here.

671
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
So I wanted to ruin it for her.

672
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,480
No way! I was just thinking

673
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,800
it's a good chance to make some money.

674
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,080
This is much faster than

675
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,680
cutting hair for everyone

676
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,840
to earn money, right?

677
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,560
It was you!

678
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,640
I admit,

679
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,720
I took the deposit money.

680
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,080
As for Master Le's death,

681
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,600
but I definitely didn't kill Master Le.

682
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,160
Someone else must have done it.

683
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,680
I have evidence. I just remembered.

684
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,920
Let me show you.

685
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,280
Come on, I'll take you somewhere.

686
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
There's more evidence.

687
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,000
Where's the evidence?

688
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,080
The shop is right across the street.

689
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,000
Tui Haokan Barber Shop.

690
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,000
Here, Bali

691
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,680
Your money

692
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,240
Everyone's deposits are all here

693
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,440
I haven't touched a single cent

694
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,800
Your deposit is returned

695
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,960
By the way,

696
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,400
I have another piece of evidence.

697
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,000
Look,

698
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
this evidence can prove

699
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,080
that I'm really not the Long-haired Witch.

700
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Before,

701
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,800
I worked hard to collect

702
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,840
this whole bucket of hair.

703
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,400
But just the night before last,

704
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,560
1

705
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,720
I went to the bathroom,

706
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,520
and when I came back,

707
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,360
some jerk had stolen

708
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,520
all my hair.

709
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,920
Not a single strand left.

710
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,800
The thief who stole my hair

711
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,360
left something behind.

712
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,880
See if this is useful.

713
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,120
30

714
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,520
Number 31 is missing.

715
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,800
It's possible number 31

716
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,720
was taken by someone,

717
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,560
or something.

718
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,920
What I mean is,

719
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,680
when stealing the hair,

720
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,320
this fell here,

721
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,360
and then his was missing,

722
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,920
so he took

723
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,040
Brother Le's instead.

724
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,680
This is my family's flyer.

725
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,880
Here, everyone take a look.

726
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,640
Take a look.

727
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,520
"Tuihao Hair Salon"

728
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,760
Let's go back and discuss this.

729
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,960
It's freezing here, you know.

730
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,160
The murderer of Master Le

731
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,040
went to the barbershop

732
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,480
On the 31st, he went to steal hair

733
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,480
While stealing the hair

734
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
he left his work ID there

735
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,760
So he took

736
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,360
Master Le's work ID instead

737
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,200
This proves the murderer

738
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
took the murder weapon from that place

739
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,480
Now let's all state

740
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,200
what we were doing on the 31st

741
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,760
Let me go first.

742
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,120
On the 31st, I was there the whole time.

743
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,840
At this Tui Le Men, I was organizing clothes.

744
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,920
From morning until 7 p.m.

745
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Then at 7, I went across the street.

746
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,120
Adjusted some clothing items.

747
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,080
For the models to wear.

748
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,880
Then around...

749
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,520
At around 10 p.m.,

750
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,320
I returned home to Bajia Alley.

751
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,360
And went to sleep.

752
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,040
10...

753
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,200
Yes, I went home at 10.

754
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Now, tell me yours.

755
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,800
At 7,

756
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,880
I went to buy a chicken.

757
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,040
The chicken shop owner can confirm it.

758
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,920
I bought one chicken.

759
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,120
Where’s the chicken shop?

760
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,040
Tui Tu Chicken in Sanjia Alley.

761
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Tui Tu Chicken.

762
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,880
What’s Tui Tu Chicken?

763
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,920
That Tui Tu Chicken shop.

764
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,880
That shop exists.

765
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,760
9...

766
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,560
Stewed chicken soup.

767
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,480
Started stewing the soup.

768
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,840
Right.

769
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,600
10

770
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Her single dorm room

771
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,960
Knock on the door

772
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
Give her chicken soup

773
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,920
But there was no response

774
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,560
I had no choice but to go home

775
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
So I drank the chicken soup myself

776
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,800
They say your schedule on the 31st

777
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
They say your schedule on the 31st

778
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,080
What was it like?

779
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,360
I was here writing songs

780
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,680
After finishing,

781
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,600
I rushed to her place

782
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,400
I wanted her to revise it

783
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,920
When I left,

784
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,440
It was around 8:30

785
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
I arrived at her place by 10:45

786
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,480
But when I knocked,

787
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
There was no answer

788
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,480
So I hurried back

789
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:05,920
I came back

790
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,240
I waited until the next morning

791
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,000
And asked her to revise it as soon as she arrived

792
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,200
Then wasn't she lying?

793
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,800
Didn't she say she'd be home by 10?

794
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,280
She was exhausted after a busy day.

795
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,560
I fell asleep that night.

796
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,160
What about you?

797
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,840
And me?

798
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,160
I'm at home.

799
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,080
The 31st has no timeline.

800
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,680
Yes, there is.

801
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,560
8

802
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,840
He came to my place to have me alter his clothes.

803
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,440
The three of us live together.

804
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,240
Their current timelines are all...

805
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,560
...stealable.

806
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,080
This is our flyer

807
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,240
Feel free to take a look

808
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
Provides home haircut services

809
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,520
Service coverage

810
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,880
Limited to a 10-kilometer radius

811
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,200
Furthest reach is Bajia Alley

812
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,400
The information he needs to clarify is

813
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
From Sanjia Alley to Bajia Alley

814
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
is a distance of 10 kilometers

815
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,320
Quite a long walk

816
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,920
7:00 PM (departure)

817
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,160
I returned around 10:00 PM

818
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,960
to my home in Bajia Alley

819
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Went to sleep

820
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,600
At 7:00 I went to buy chicken

821
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,400
9

822
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,560
Made chicken soup

823
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,720
Probably left around 8:30

824
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,760
Arrived at her place at 10:45

825
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,560
I was at home

826
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,680
8

827
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,520
Asked me to alter his clothes

828
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,640
Bai's timeline

829
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,040
I can vouch for him

830
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,320
8

831
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
Bai Youcai was in Bajia Alley

832
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,880
If he wanted to commit the crime

833
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,600
He'd have to wait until

834
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,920
8

835
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,600
before leaving

836
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,760
No time to return home

837
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,280
Right

838
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,000
No time

839
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,680
So we can eliminate Bai first

840
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,280
The three of you now

841
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,480
only have your own statements

842
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,280
Except for Bai's

843
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,080
which I can verify

844
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,440
Something's wrong

845
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,800
Is there something between you two?

846
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,360
You immediately vouched for him

847
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,320
Who? Me and him?

848
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You don’t need to vouch for me

849
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,840
You’re acting strange

850
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,680
I vouched for you, and you’re not even happy about it

851
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,760
If you play it this way, you're protecting both of them.

852
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,240
Of course he'd protect him.

853
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,520
She's my sister, so I'd protect her too.

854
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,680
Just straight up threw Wang Chuanshuo under the bus.

855
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,840
This is just too...

856
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,480
Are you kidding me?

857
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,480
Yeah.

858
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,680
These two are my little buddies.

859
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,640
I’m protecting her.

860
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,240
Yeah, I’m protecting him too.

861
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,320
I’ll defend them to the death.

862
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,200
Alright.

863
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,560
It’s still Wang Chuanshuo who’s suspicious.

864
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,880
This changed so fast.

865
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,560
Still Wang Chuanshuo.

866
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,560
The way you're acting...

867
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,240
My face might as well say "culprit" on it.

868
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,480
The way you put it...

869
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,880
Brother

870
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,840
Brother, I'm truly at my wit's end

871
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,040
Actually, let me tell you

872
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,680
About that case later

873
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,160
Actually, Wang Esq. is your father

874
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,360
Wang Esq.

875
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,400
This is what got your father killed

876
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,080
There's another thing

877
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,160
You see

878
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Coming in all dramatic, saying

879
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,840
Let me see how interesting this point is

880
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,800
Although this point

881
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,440
might not be that interesting

882
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,920
But look

883
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,880
The murder motive

884
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,720
The intensity of it

885
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,160
I think

886
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,000
It might be even stronger

887
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,120
Why?

888
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,080
Because that day he suddenly

889
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,440
saw something from Phoenix Nightclub

890
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,840
For him, I think

891
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,720
this point might be even more intense

892
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,600
And he doesn't have to worry about

893
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,400
what consequences our handling of this matter

894
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,200
might bring

895
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,880
or anything else

896
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,040
That's what I think

897
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
Wang's alibi matches the crime timeline.

898
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,800
Right?

899
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,840
Exactly.

900
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,160
How does it match?

901
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,920
It matches, absolutely matches.

902
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
You left at 8:30 PM.

903
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,560
to meet Bali.

904
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,280
10.

905
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,640
In between you had.

906
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,680
2.

907
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,240
hours to walk from here to Bajia Lane.

908
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,120
Plus time to steal hair from the barbershop.

909
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,240
He went from here (Tui Le Gate).

910
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,520
to our dorm at Bajia Lane.

911
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,360
So during this time.

912
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,840
he had both motive and opportunity.

913
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,520
to commit these acts.

914
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,040
Then went to Bajia Lane to find.

915
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,840
Impossible, I couldn't have made it.

916
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
If you calculate by this timeline.

917
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,480
how could I possibly have gotten there?

918
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,360
How can you be so certain.

919
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,600
he's telling the truth?

920
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,960
His statements now contain.

921
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
numerous lies.

922
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,680
I had no time to go to the barbershop.

923
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,080
But your problem is.

924
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,520
nobody can verify.

925
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
you were home at 9 o'clock.

926
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,560
Do you understand?

927
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,120
Let's think back again

928
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,800
It's about this timeline

929
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,000
When both of us went to look for her

930
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
She wasn't there

931
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
Same with me

932
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,080
I went at 10:40 PM

933
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,680
to her single dorm in Bajia Alley

934
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,280
I knocked too, but got no response

935
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,120
Try to recall again

936
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,640
After you returned at 10 o'clock

937
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,720
you didn't go out again?

938
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,600
Yes, got home at 10

939
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,720
then I fell asleep

940
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,680
Right, I didn't go out either

941
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,560
So either both of you are lying

942
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
or you're the one lying

943
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,760
There's just nobody here.

944
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,000
There's just nobody here. Why is that?

945
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,640
You insist on pushing me out.

946
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,000
What good does that do you?

947
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,120
Why did you come?

948
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,360
To become my disciple?

949
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,760
The suspects are turning on each other.

950
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,160
Why did I come to be your disciple?

951
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,440
I thought you saved me.

952
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,000
So I wanted to repay you.

953
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,640
You were a ray of light in my life.

954
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,320
Yes, and I wanted to turn my life around.

955
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,280
To stop being so depressed.

956
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Only Bali was there the entire time from 7 to 10

957
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,400
at Sanjia Alley

958
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,400
Bali's location is here.

959
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,000
It's her.

960
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,440
She was at the clothing store in Sanjia Alley from 7 to 10 PM.

961
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,560
At the clothing store in Sanjia Alley.

962
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,600
So from 7 to 10 PM,

963
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,640
if she was in Sanjia Alley,

964
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,960
she could have stolen the hair.

965
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,840
Right.

966
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,560
Do you understand?

967
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Actually, I have a question.

968
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,640
About your...

969
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,920
When you were at the Push Music Club,

970
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,560
including passing out,

971
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,400
and waking up the next day

972
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,120
suddenly in a luxurious room -

973
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,000
that whole incident.

974
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,680
Yes, that part is quite strange too.

975
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,520
I feel like there are many things left unsaid.

976
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,080
Including her personal grudge against Master Le.

977
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,880
There's no personal grudge.

978
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
It's just that day I discovered

979
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,280
he was going to harm the woman with the sunflower.

980
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,200
But that sunflower woman

981
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,160
is my lifesaver.

982
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,480
I did consider killing Master Le,

983
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,040
but I planned to do it on February 1st,

984
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,720
after my fashion week was over.

985
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,760
Because I couldn't possibly

986
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,000
ruin this stage

987
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,600
I've dreamed of for so long.

988
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,320
I couldn't say

989
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,760
I would cause trouble

990
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,480
before this stage.

991
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,400
So I had this thought,

992
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,840
but I didn't act on it.

993
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,480
The decisive evidence right now

994
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,320
hasn't been found yet.

995
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,600
Right.

996
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,840
I don't think there will be

997
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,680
decisive evidence.

998
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,160
Really?

999
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,720
How is that possible?

1000
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
He's acting strange.

1001
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,080
You're being really erratic today.

1002
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,680
What do you mean by "erratic"?

1003
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
You don't seem eager for the truth.

1004
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,480
Don't you want the truth?

1005
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,320
I'm saying this case

1006
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,800
isn't that simple.

1007
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,640
You know that, right?

1008
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,360
Damn it, listen to me—

1009
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,000
Xiao X.

1010
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,000
Everyone, think about who the killer is

1011
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Then cast your final vote

1012
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,480
Okay

1013
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,960
Who

1014
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,840
Because I know who the real culprit is

1015
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,920
So I must protect the real culprit

1016
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,960
The only way is to dump this dirty water

1017
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,760
onto us

1018
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,560
<summaryA speaker admits knowing the real culprit's identity and resolves to protect them by shifting blame onto themselves or their group.

1019
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,080
Because the motives of us four

1020
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,920
are actually quite similar

1021
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,760
But why we ultimately chose him

1022
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,280
is because of one point

1023
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,440
The timing from Tuile Gate to Bajia Alley

1024
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,480
might have some issues

1025
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,120
This is my choice

1026
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,080
I know I made the right choice

1027
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,640
The crime process

1028
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,400
Actually the two investigators have

1029
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,920
already explained to us

1030
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,040
There's a hidden room over there

1031
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,840
From inside the hidden room

1032
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,520
It must be someone very familiar

1033
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
with this place to pull this off

1034
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,880
Compared to us three suspects

1035
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,120
Wang Chuanshuo has been

1036
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,080
working here for

1037
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,040
over a year

1038
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
Because back in 1923

1039
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,440
he already partnered with

1040
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,560
Pink Phoenix

1041
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,680
So I voted for Wang Chuanshuo

1042
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,000
Okay

1043
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,400
Rest in peace

1044
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,960
I hope my answer is correct

1045
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,640
Among our group

1046
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,400
everyone still has some doubts

1047
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,840
about Bari

1048
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,960
Because after all, her alibi

1049
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,800
couldn't be verified

1050
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
whether she was lying or not

1051
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,400
Alright

1052
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,680
I vote for Bari

1053
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,160
Actually I've always doubted

1054
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,920
Bari's previous account

1055
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,360
about her work experience

1056
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,280
She worked as a tailor at Tuile Gate

1057
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,280
then got recommended to Tuile Hui

1058
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,400
During those few days in between

1059
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,600
she didn't even know

1060
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,080
how she fell asleep at night

1061
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,480
and suddenly woke up

1062
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,400
in a completely new place

1063
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,920
This particular point

1064
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,600
was never properly explained

1065
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,280
I feel she's hiding something

1066
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,080
So I voted for Bari

1067
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,640
I want to vote for

1068
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,680
Next,

1069
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,360
we will announce the voting results of all players.

1070
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,320
Looking forward to it.

1071
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,760
Can't help it.

1072
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,080
Can't contain my excitement.

1073
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,720
You voted for me?

1074
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,560
What do you think?

1075
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,160
Now announcing:

1076
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,320
The player who received 0 votes is

1077
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,200
Bai Youcai.

1078
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,480
Bai Youcai

1079
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,560
I've already prepared everything

1080
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,120
Bai Youcai: 0 votes

1081
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,600
Apart from this,

1082
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,280
Young Marshal He also received zero votes.

1083
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,840
Who is it?

1084
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm speechless.

1085
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,800
Between Bali and Wang in the legends,

1086
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,840
who received more votes?

1087
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,960
It's a tie between the two.

1088
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,040
Three to three

1089
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,560
Tied vote

1090
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,680
Then how should we count this?

1091
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,280
Then a tie means we lose, right?

1092
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,840
No way, it can't be them, right?

1093
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,440
It's not them.

1094
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,600
Then we'll lose face.

1095
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,040
So between these two,

1096
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,200
is there actually a real culprit?

1097
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,520
Impressive.

1098
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,200
Hidden depths, Brother Xun.

1099
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,200
The real culprit is between these two

1100
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,360
What am I cheering about?

1101
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,960
Stop acting, Bali

1102
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,080
I'm truly speechless

1103
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,160
The real culprit is...

1104
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,680
Wang Esq. Legend

1105
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,080
My choice for this round is

1106
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,520
Wang Esq.

1107
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,440
So I voted for Wang Esq.

1108
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,640
I voted for

1109
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,320
Xiao Ba

1110
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,640
Voted for Xiao Ba

1111
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,240
The culprit I voted for is Wang Esq.

1112
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,200
Voted for Xiao Ba

1113
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,960
I just can't...

1114
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,400
X

1115
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,440
You're pretending

1116
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,120
Don't come closer

1117
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,480
Keqin, I'll reveal the answer

1118
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,840
How could it be me?

1119
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,520
Stop pretending

1120
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,080
Stop faking it

1121
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,200
Let's drop the act

1122
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,440
We've been coordinating for so long

1123
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,760
I wasn't coordinating with you

1124
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,040
I kept messaging you on WeChat

1125
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,560
Kept sending texts

1126
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,720
I kept texting him

1127
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,560
He actually...

1128
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,360
You all...

1129
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,120
No wonder I failed

1130
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,880
You...

1131
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,520
I messaged you repeatedly with no response

1132
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,760
What texts did you send me?

1133
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,000
Please announce, Wang Chuanshuo

1134
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,400
Who is your X?

1135
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,000
My X is him

1136
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,160
Isn't it obvious?

1137
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,560
That scared me to death

1138
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,800
I thought I didn't understand the game

1139
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,480
You know what?

1140
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,280
I thought

1141
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,360
I knew it

1142
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,560
These two are completely wicked

1143
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,360
Let me tell you

1144
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,600
He called me "bro"

1145
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,320
I said "big bro"

1146
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,880
What should we do?

1147
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,880
You're too suspicious

1148
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,760
Don't tell me you want me to

1149
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,480
pin this on my sister

1150
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,120
I can't help it

1151
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,640
No matter how I explain it, it's hard to justify

1152
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,160
Then we can only throw the dirty water

1153
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,640
onto our own

1154
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,040
Xiao Ba's shoulders

1155
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,880
It's okay

1156
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,840
You're a good person

1157
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,080
She's my biological sister

1158
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,520
I can prove her existence

1159
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,720
First, she's my sister

1160
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,520
Second, her

1161
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,960
explanation makes perfect sense

1162
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,320
I believe you

1163
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,640
I trust you

1164
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,840
My vote

1165
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,000
goes to Xiao Ba

1166
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,520
Sorry about this, sis

1167
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,080
And sorry to everyone else

1168
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,240
My apologies

1169
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,600
These two really

1170
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,440
Wait, who else voted for me?

1171
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,160
I voted for you

1172
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,200
You should be more careful

1173
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,440
You got tricked

1174
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,760
Just because I hit him with a sneak attack

1175
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,040
Now

1176
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,160
we will reveal this case's

1177
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,760
key evidence.

1178
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,120
During Wang Esq.'s commission of the crime,

1179
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,080
he lost his own

1180
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,280
January 31st work ID.

1181
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,640
After murdering Master Le,

1182
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,520
he stole Master Le's work ID.

1183
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,360
However,

1184
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,440
on Master Le's

1185
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,120
stolen work ID,

1186
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,640
hair dye from a wig was found.

1187
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,280
Such meticulous details.

1188
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,000
Hair dye.

1189
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,480
If that had been discovered,

1190
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,280
it would have directly identified the killer.

1191
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,520
Right.

1192
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,960
Since the real killer and suspect received equal votes,

1193
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,160
with no fewer votes than the suspect,

1194
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,160
the real killer in this case and X

1195
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,560
have failed.

1196
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,520
It is now February 2nd, 1924,

1197
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,760
6:00 PM.

1198
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,880
The murder case of Master Le, owner of the Tui Le Men Dance Hall,

1199
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,920
has concluded its investigation.

1200
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,200
As Sanjia Alley

1201
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,840
remains under 48-hour lockdown,

1202
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,120
the killer will temporarily remain at Tui Le Men

1203
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,640
until the lockdown ends,

1204
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,680
then be handed over to the police station.

1205
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,840
Although our case is closed,

1206
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,480
there are still several unresolved questions.

1207
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,560
that remain unanswered.

1208
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,640
First, why does

1209
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,760
the mysterious one call him Jiawei?

1210
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,840
Jiawei?

1211
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,320
Who?

1212
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,240
Jiawei.

1213
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,200
And why call her Baduanjin?

1214
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,240
Are you Baduanjin or Bali?

1215
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,400
Also, regarding the mysterious one,

1216
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,440
there's a high-power

1217
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,880
electronic lock in that room

1218
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,520
we still haven't opened.

1219
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:56,920
Right?

1220
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,400
Right.

1221
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,040
And another thing,

1222
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,560
we currently know nothing

1223
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,520
about the mysterious gathering.

1224
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,040
An orphan girl,

1225
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,400
whose body matches the examination,

1226
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,800
but what exactly is that standard?

1227
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,560
And what else?

1228
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,000
There's that room

1229
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,840
in the warehouse next to the upper rooms

1230
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,680
we discovered.

1231
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,160
Yes.

1232
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:17,920
We've never opened it.

1233
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,720
What's inside?

1234
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,200
Isn't that

1235
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,680
where the gathering takes place?

1236
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,560
We don't know.

1237
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,160
And there's actually

1238
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,120
a real Long-haired Witch.

1239
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,880
I think this is crucial.

1240
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,400
Overall, I believe there are

1241
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,280
still many mysteries here.

1242
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,200
Next up

1243
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,840
We will present the Golden Key

1244
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,840
Hey

1245
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,520
What's with the "hey"?

1246
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,200
I don't have it—you guys do

1247
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,040
The Legendary Wang

1248
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,600
will present the Golden Key to everyone

1249
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,280
Do we really have to do it like this?

1250
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,720
Congratulations

1251
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,520
I'll remember you, Bai Youcai

1252
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,640
Ke Shaoshuai

1253
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,240
Thank you

1254
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,800
I'll remember you too

1255
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,040
I'm sorry, Bali

1256
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,360
Heli Moyu, the Reasoning King

1257
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,560
Let the deduction begin

1258
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,240
Cousin Ke

1259
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,960
As the number one B-KING in Tui Town

1260
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,120
I'm back

1261
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,960
Young Marshal He

1262
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,520
The renowned B-KING

1263
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,760
Competing to see who can last

1264
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,960
four months in hiding

1265
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,000
without being discovered

1266
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,320
He lost this challenge

1267
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,240
Cousin

1268
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,480
I wrapped myself in bandages

1269
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,760
None of you found me

1270
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,080
Real cousin

1271
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,640
Who are you?

1272
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,520
You're fake

1273
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,760
You're Jiawei

1274
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,040
He's fake

1275
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,520
I'm Young Marshal He, not Jiawei

1276
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
How do you look exactly like me?

1277
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,240
And you call yourself Young Marshal He?

1278
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
You don't even have the face for it.

1279
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,160
I am the real Young Marshal He, everyone.

1280
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,400
The real and fake Young Marshal He.

1281
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,000
Everyone will have their darkest moments

1282
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,920
Everyone experiences their lowest points

1283
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,960
For most people, these dark times

1284
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,520
simply come from encountering

1285
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,680
significant difficulties

1286
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,440
or facing numerous doubts

1287
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,800
The noise and distractions from outside

1288
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,040
also play a part

1289
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,800
First, you must endure

1290
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,680
You need to find

1291
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,200
what you truly desire

1292
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,240
to pursue in your heart

1293
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,520
Once you have this direction

1294
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,280
and goal

1295
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,720
many external factors

1296
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,240
won't disturb you anymore

1297
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,840
You can be your own light

1298
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,320
You can save yourself

1299
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,840
When in your life

1300
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,520
you truly can't hold on anymore

1301
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,600
Your hands can push you up from the ground

1302
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,480
So I hope everyone

1303
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,200
can use their own methods

1304
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,640
to first relieve the pressure

1305
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,720
Then calm your mind to consider

1306
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,480
what your next step should be

1307
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,880
How can I, like

1308
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,480
when my mother held me

1309
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,320
hold and comfort myself

1310
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,720
Perhaps because

1311
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,280
when I was just over twenty

1312
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,040
back then

1313
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,840
somewhat like Wang Chuan said

1314
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,360
I had a musical dream

1315
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,600
So at that time I felt

1316
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,840
that if you want to succeed

1317
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,040
you must rely on yourself

1318
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,120
become stronger and more resilient

1319
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,440
After getting through that period

1320
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,040
when you look back

1321
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,600
you'll realize

1322
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
those darkest moments

1323
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,640
weren't so bad

1324
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,120
You must be

1325
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,080
your own light in the darkness

1326
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,280
In dark moments like Dilraba's,

1327
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,360
when nothing seems to go right,

1328
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,760
such times will come.

1329
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,960
Strive, compete,

1330
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,160
strengthen yourself

1331
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,640
to achieve greater fulfillment.

1332
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,560
Sometimes,

1333
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,400
you may rarely get help from others.

1334
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,840
So whenever you face

1335
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,800
these darkest hours,

1336
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,280
only you can save yourself.

1337
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,160
In this episode's story,

1338
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,440
Bali thought that Young Marshal He

1339
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,720
would have ill intentions toward her,

1340
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,160
so she hit him with a stick

1341
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,520
and knocked him unconscious, causing amnesia.

1342
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,560
This is what we call imaginary defense in criminal law.

1343
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,760
The difference between imaginary defense and legitimate defense

1344
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,080
lies primarily in

1345
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,560
whether there was actual unlawful infringement.

1346
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,160
Legitimate defense

1347
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,760
involves real unlawful infringement,

1348
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,960
while imaginary defense

1349
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,080
is based on imagined infringement.

1350
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,120
Therefore, imaginary defense

1351
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,160
must bear corresponding legal responsibility

1352
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,840
based on its consequences.

1353
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,880
In this episode's story,

1354
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,000
although knowing who the murderer was,

1355
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,080
they ultimately didn't vote for them.

1356
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,960
Of course we understand

1357
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,880
this was due to game mechanics,

1358
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,200
but in real life,

1359
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,120
how should we view

1360
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,120
such behavior?

1361
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,880
The Criminal Procedure Law stipulates

1362
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,840
that any organization or individual

1363
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,000
who discovers criminal acts

1364
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,600
or suspects

1365
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,320
has both the right and obligation

1366
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,280
to report to judicial authorities

1367
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,520
or file accusations.

1368
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,960
However, not reporting

1369
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,560
doesn't necessarily constitute harboring criminals.

1370
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,600
This isn't absolute,

1371
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,640
because the crime of harboring

1372
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,880
requires subjective intent -

1373
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,320
knowingly protecting criminals

1374
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,760
and objectively

1375
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,120
assisting in concealment,

1376
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,880
evasion, hiding, or fleeing,

1377
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,840
or providing false testimony.

1378
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,560
Another noteworthy point is

1379
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,320
that immediate family members

1380
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,880
can also commit harboring crimes.

1381
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,040
The Analects mention

1382
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,320
"fathers covering for sons, sons covering for fathers,"

1383
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,840
seeing righteousness in such acts.

1384
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,120
But in modern legal society,

1385
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,600
such familial concealment

1386
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,160
may lead to mutual incrimination.

1387
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,360
Thus we must abandon

1388
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,320
these feudal concepts.

1389
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,720
Our town of Tui Zhen has always had

1390
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,800
many strange occurrences happening.

1391
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,800
Are you Jiawei or Commander He?

1392
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,800
Are you

1393
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,520
Ba Duanjin

1394
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,040
or Ba Li?

1395
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,840
Tell me quickly!

1396
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,560
Where's Pink Phoenix?

1397
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,640
Is anyone here?

1398
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,040
I want to inspect

1399
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,720
the equipment here.

1400
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,080
The fortune teller died mysteriously.

1401
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,280
Didn't I tell you

1402
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:53,840
24

1403
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,600
to stop killing people?

1404
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,280
But

1405
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,600
sometimes I can't control

1406
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,480
my murderous impulses.

1407
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,000
All four have motives for murder.

1408
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,320
But we all

1409
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,480
have solid alibis.

1410
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,960
Someone's lying.

1411
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,760
I think there's another possibility.

1412
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,440
One person here

1413
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,320
is actually two people.

1414
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,000
So it must be him.

1415
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,560
But why couldn't it be you?

1416
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,680
This is the microphone cable

1417
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,680
used to bind the body.

1418
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,040
Young Master He

1419
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,520
Your knife skills

1420
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
are quite proficient.

1421
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,640
Can you hide your expression better?

1422
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:23,920
But I feel

1423
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,320
this is a serial killer's work.

1424
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,800
Who's in this family photo?

1425
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,960
Could it be...

1426
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,680
Pink Phoenix?

1427
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,080
This is my sister.

1428
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,040
Every girl sent to Tui Lao Hui

1429
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,560
met with misfortune.

1430
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,040
So your

1431
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,200
motive is very strong.

1432
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,360
There's a key

1433
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,240
to the warehouse passage -

1434
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,560
that sealed door.

1435
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,360
Tui Lao Hui's room.

1436
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,520
If we leave,

1437
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,880
this door will be sealed.

1438
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,040
I'll never escape.

1439
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,080
Only death...
