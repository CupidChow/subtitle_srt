1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm going to school

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,560
Carrying a dynamite pack

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,280
I thought it exploded

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,800
One-minute sunflower seed cracking contest

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,600
Should’ve let you do the cracking

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,320
My tooth would’ve chipped after a while

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,360
It wouldn’t be that bad

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,480
Mine already did

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,760
You’re cracking iron seeds

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
Sit here—what are you doing?

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,800
Why did those three take the initiative

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,080
to split off from us?

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,800
Sticking together

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,040
Mainly to pair those two together

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,840
Easier to scare them that way

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,400
You sit over here

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,640
No, I *actually* prefer sitting up front

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,560
What belongs to me

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,520
Why didn't you use this against them earlier?

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,560
I just forgot

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,840
Coming to catch you wasn't worth risking my life

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
You're only tough at home

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,720
Next up

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,120
is the private screening

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,160
of my new movie.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,840
Here are some golden eggs.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,040
Inside these golden eggs

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,640
are the challenges I've set

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,080
for these screening passes.

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
I thought it exploded.

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,320
What is this?

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,240
One-minute sunflower seed cracking contest.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,120
I should’ve let you do this earlier.

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,800
Invitation.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Invite Bai to join.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,040
The one who cracks the most seeds

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,320
wins a movie pass.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,640
Haven’t I already won?

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
No, right now we need to

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This person and this friend

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,480
You two will compete to see who can crack more

42
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,680
We'll compete to see who can crack more

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
Yes, one minute - whoever cracks more wins

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,200
Okay, then you win

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,480
Then you win

46
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,600
Then you can get the ticket, right?

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,040
Start cracking

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
How do we... what exactly are we counting?

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,400
What exactly are we counting?

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
Whoever cracks more shells in one minute

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Shells used before

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,480
Don't count those

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,480
Don't go easy

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,920
Just crack normally

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,600
I'll crack normally

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
I can't out-crack her

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,440
Begin

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,480
Okay, 3-2-1, begin!

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
My tooth chipped while cracking seeds.

60
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,720
That can't be from sunflower seeds.

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,760
But my tooth did chip.

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
You've actually chipped a tooth doing this?

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Yes, from cracking sunflower seeds.

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,600
Were you eating crab or cracking seeds?

65
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,360
Sunflower seeds, look.

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Were they iron seeds or something?

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,040
Or those golden investment seeds you have?

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
That you cracked open?

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,880
Go easy if you need to.

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
I know, I know.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
These are raw seeds.

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
Not even roasted.

73
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,280
They are roasted.

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,400
Raw seeds don't taste like this.

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,320
They're roasted, just a bit stale.

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,160
Guangdong's humidity affects them.

77
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,720
Stale.

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,240
Right, a bit damp.

79
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,880
A bit stale, yes.

80
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,240
I don't think you can beat Brother Bai at this challenge.

81
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,760
Brother Bai is our show's

82
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,880
Sunflower Seed King.

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,320
The Seed Terminator.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,360
He's our show's

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,360
Two, one, zero.

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
Zero, stop.

87
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Did I win?

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,440
You won.

89
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,560
Come look.

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,440
Let's see.

91
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,360
Well, I wanted to say...

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
How do we count this?

93
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,760
Never mind, I'll judge.

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,680
This is uncountable.

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
I've cracked them all open, how to count?

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,320
I think our contestant surnamed Bai

97
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,280
cracked more.

98
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,560
No, no, I am

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,640
Mine is, you see

100
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
Two count as one

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,240
People just know, right?

102
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
She's had work done

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
Yes, she's had work done

104
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,040
You see

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,440
That's right

106
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Then this lady

107
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,680
Then you can smash another golden egg

108
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,920
Okay

109
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Is it this one?

110
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,440
This one, the one below

111
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,960
Unity is strength

112
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,080
Challenger

113
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,200
Invite everyone to complete the song chain

114
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,480
Five consecutive lines from any song count as success

115
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
Then this song

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
Pick an easier one

117
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,840
Nursery rhymes definitely

118
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,160
We all know them

119
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay

120
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,200
The sun shines in the sky

121
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,720
Flowers smile at me

122
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,080
The little bird says

123
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,480
Good morning

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,280
Good morning

125
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,440
Good morning

126
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,520
Why do you carry your little backpack

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,800
I go to school

128
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,760
Carrying an explosive pack

129
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,480
Love studying

130
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,800
That's enough

131
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
Just five lines is enough, right?

132
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,200
That's enough

133
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
You didn't do it right just now

134
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,640
Let me explain the rules again

135
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,400
Song chain

136
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Not the same song

137
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,480
Connect by the last word

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,720
Right

139
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,440
Our movie fans

140
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,320
can sit in the front row

141
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,000
What?

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,880
Movie fans can sit in the front row

143
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
We're sitting in the front row, right?

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,440
Yes

145
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,800
Do fans really sit in the front row?

146
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,480
That friend there, please sit in the front row

147
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
This friend here, please sit in the front row

148
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
Because the front row is the best viewing spot

149
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
If you sit behind,

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
someone might hug your neck

151
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
If everyone is seated,

152
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
we'll begin the movie

153
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,360
Alright, let's go

154
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,520
You sit here - what are you doing?

155
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
No

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,840
Why did those three take the initiative

157
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
to split up from us?

158
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
Doesn't matter, it's fine

159
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,440
It's just temporary

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
They're just forming cliques

161
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
creating small groups

162
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
What nonsense

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,000
They're isolating the two of us

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,480
Forming factions

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,480
Something might happen later

166
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
What's with these two

167
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,160
These two are so strange

168
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,280
Mainly putting them together

169
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,440
makes it easier to scare them

170
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,920
True

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
You sit over here

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,840
No, I prefer sitting in front

173
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Really

174
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,360
No

175
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,920
No, you need to sit there

176
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,160
Follow the rules, Jiawei

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,280
Follow the rules, Jiawei

178
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
You follow the rules, Jiawei

179
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,680
Follow the rules, Jiawei

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,960
Come on

181
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,400
This definitely needs to be demolished.

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,840
Let's see what needs demolishing.

183
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,960
What demolition?

184
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,320
Are you saying this studio needs to be demolished like this?

185
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,000
You want to demolish everything in sight.

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,480
This definitely needs to be demolished.

187
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,560
Let me tell you.

188
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,840
This definitely needs to be demolished.

189
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,480
Let me tell you.

190
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,640
Really?

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,640
Demolition.

192
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,880
Now you're our new demolition team member.

193
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,280
Aren't you...

194
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,400
Director He's assistant casting directors?

195
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,360
We're not.

196
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,880
He is.

197
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,280
Director He scheduled us to meet in the props room...

198
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,320
for auditions.

199
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,960
Right.

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm Director He's son.

201
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Where's Director He?

202
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,160
This is Director He's son.

203
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,640
You're treating the enemy as your father.

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,280
Director He went back for dinner.

205
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,160
When Director He arrives later...

206
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,640
remember to let us know.

207
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,360
Got it.

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
Can this door be opened?

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,560
No.

210
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,520
No, it can't.

211
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,760
Okay.

212
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,840
Let's go.

213
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,320
Let's go find Director He.

214
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,120
Remember to tell us when Director He arrives

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
Okay

216
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
Remember

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,440
You

218
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,840
What are you doing?

219
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,360
Someone's changing clothes

220
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,280
And you want to peek inside

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Someone inside was laughing at me just now

222
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,840
The cameraman is laughing at you

223
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,560
Laughing at your Wei

224
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,200
They're laughing at this silly boy

225
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,760
Where did you lock up Director He?

226
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
Where is he locked up?

227
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,720
If you don't tell, you're not going home today

228
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,160
Don't go

229
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Not that one

230
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,760
Are you just letting her go like this?

231
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,240
It's fine

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,280
What are you standing here for?

233
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,240
Nothing

234
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,280
Completely useless

235
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,520
Wait a moment

236
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:45,960
They'll come out again soon

237
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Let me see what's going on

238
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,520
Shouldn't we chase after her?

239
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,000
You can't chase her

240
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,280
So you're just letting her escape?

241
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
That's just too... you know

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
Alright alright

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Let me take you to find

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,240
seven cyber robots

245
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,880
We just saw them inside

246
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Come on

247
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,960
With us, it's just the right number

248
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,880
One two three four five

249
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,640
Going up the mountain to hunt tigers

250
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
You can just wait outside for me

251
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Okay

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,760
Seven plus seven makes fourteen

253
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,040
Fourteen of us need to dance

254
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,000
Here they are

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
There's a whole bunch here

256
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
They still look impressive

257
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,680
Those aren't them

258
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,200
These are the violent ones

259
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,120
Those are the dancing ones

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,680
Yes, this is the violence team

261
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,800
Are you cold?

262
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,720
I'm cold. Thank you for saving me.

263
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,480
They...

264
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,320
What happened to them?

265
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,680
They threatened me to modify the game.

266
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,360
I didn't get to change it yet.

267
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,280
You don't need to change it.

268
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,200
Why? Really?

269
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
Because we've already altered the storyline.

270
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,680
That's great!

271
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Why do you sound like a robot?

272
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm not a robot.

273
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,960
He's coming.

274
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,440
That last star...

275
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,160
Should we rehearse?

276
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,560
It's already in our blood.

277
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
Do we even need to rehearse?

278
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
We've been doing this since childhood.

279
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,440
Brother Bai eats a banana

280
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,120
I still prefer

281
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
things that belong to me

282
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
Why didn't you use this against them earlier?

283
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,880
I just forgot

284
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
I was actually planning to fight them

285
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,280
It's not worth it

286
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,680
They'll just come arrest you

287
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
No need to risk your life for this

288
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,440
Swinging an axe at people

289
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,280
Now you're acting tough

290
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,120
You're just tough at home, that's what you are

291
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,640
Put it down, it's too dangerous

292
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
He just wants us to remember this move

293
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,640
Seriously?

294
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,920
Not this move, right?

295
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
The beginning part doesn't matter

296
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,880
What's important is

297
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,560
The start isn't crucial

298
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,200
Okay

299
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,040
For example, we could just walk through the beginning

300
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,640
Even just walking is fine

301
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,040
Our focus should be on this

302
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,680
Let's go

303
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,880
Patrick Star is the most important part

304
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,680
We should still learn the opening moves

305
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,200
We'll learn

306
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
It would be good if we can synchronize

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,080
We'll try our best to learn

308
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,000
We might not finish learning even by tomorrow

309
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,920
Keqin and I should join in too

310
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,960
Because we need fourteen people

311
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
Come on, you two stand in front

312
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,720
Okay, no problem

313
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
You two take the center positions

314
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,360
Right

315
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,560
You two in front

316
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,400
Isn't that mine then?

317
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,200
Okay, that works

318
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
Where are you going?

319
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
No, move forward a bit

320
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,760
Forward

321
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
We'll be at the very front later, remember?

322
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,400
Then shouldn't we just stand side by side?

323
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,880
Right, like this for us two?

324
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,680
And you two aren't

325
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,720
supposed to step back?

326
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,880
Let's watch it again

327
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
And follow along, okay?

328
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,280
Okay, let's go

329
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,480
Come on

330
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,880
Alright

331
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,120
This is how we follow along

332
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
So we'll

333
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,480
Okay

334
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
This marks the end of a season

335
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,440
The conclusion of this season

336
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,280
From our very first

337
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,800
This is about seeing things through

338
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,800
From start to finish

339
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,480
Our first episode

340
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,520
Came up with this idea

341
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,840
We’re committed to seeing it through

342
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,280
Whose idea was it?

343
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,920
Mine

344
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,400
But it’s your fault for loving it too

345
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,160
Deep down

346
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,880
I read online

347
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,320
Seems like we weren’t forced

348
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,600
Right

349
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
We were all willing

350
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
Very willing

351
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,160
Here we go, green light

352
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,960
Green light

353
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,520
Bye

354
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,160
Let's go

355
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,680
I feel like

356
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,280
We should probably do two more rounds of "haunting"

357
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,240
Haven't had enough fun

358
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,400
Bro, last one

359
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,160
Thanks

360
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
No, this is his

361
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,120
He just asked his teacher for it

362
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
Playing with my feelings

363
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,000
I really didn't

364
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,200
I've tried really hard to help you find it

365
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
He already gave me one before

366
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,400
He didn't give you

367
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,480
He said the last one was for me

368
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,880
Then he pulled out another pack

369
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,680
What do you say about someone like that

370
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,120
That's not mine

371
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,360
What a jerk

372
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
I'm speechless

373
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,240
I really am

374
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Feels like we're shooting some kind of poster

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,600
Exactly

376
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,240
Isn't this what they call composition aesthetics?

377
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,200
Strike a pose, that's right

378
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,400
You guys sit for a while

379
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,440
Why are you all standing?

380
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,640
Nobody said we're leaving

381
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,240
This is all about composition aesthetics

382
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,520
You make a good point

383
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,040
You're absolutely right

384
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,440
It's so hot, you're like a furnace

385
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,240
I'll sit right here

386
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,520
I want to sit

387
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,120
You sit

388
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,200
Jiawei, I'm coming

389
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,160
Go over there

390
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,200
Feel how hot he is

391
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,280
Want me to show you what sweating buckets means?

392
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm dying of heat

393
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,720
Coming

394
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,120
Come on, Brother Bai

395
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,560
Baby, don't cry anymore

396
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,400
This scene feels so familiar

397
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Holding your hand tightly

398
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,520
Neither of us wants to part

399
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,720
Why do you love singing so much?

400
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,040
You really love singing

401
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,320
I do enjoy singing

402
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
Brother Bai, do you feel a little reluctant?

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,600
It's over

404
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,920
How about you, Jiawei?

405
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,280
Do you...

406
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,000
Feel even a tiny bit reluctant?

407
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,800
Reluctant to leave

408
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,800
Really?

409
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,360
Don't want to go

410
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,600
Still trying to fool us again

411
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
Got a taste of victory

412
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
We fools feel we haven't been fooled enough

413
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
When did I ever fool you?

414
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,120
I've always been sincere

415
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
Jiawei is the ultimate winner

416
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,360
I've had enough

417
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,800
What's this?

418
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
What is this thing?

419
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,280
These lanterns will fly up later

420
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,680
Should be

421
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,760
Are these Kongming lanterns?

422
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,000
These are drone lights

423
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Unmanned Kongming lanterns

424
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,720
No, drone Kongming lanterns

425
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,640
Today might be

426
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,040
Our last meal together

427
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,160
For the second season

428
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,080
Let's go

429
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,920
Go

430
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,080
Go

431
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,160
Five guests

432
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,880
Having hot pot

433
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,560
Hot pot

434
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Why so formal?

435
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,920
Come on

436
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,600
So refreshing

437
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,640
Come on, everyone take your seats

438
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,680
Okay

439
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,800
Should we start eating?

440
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,280
Wait, the pot isn't boiling yet

441
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,600
It's boiling now

442
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,960
I really need to get a proper serving

443
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
The fire is out.

444
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,800
Does anyone have it here?

445
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,640
I do.

446
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,440
Isn't it hot? Be careful, it might burn you.

447
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,400
No, it's already cooled down.

448
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,720
Be careful.

449
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Light it.

450
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,040
Need to light it again.

451
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Next season, let's have some real fun.

452
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,040
Thanks, buddy.

453
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,320
Thank you.

454
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,080
Can you make pulled noodles?

455
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,160
Sure, come on.

456
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,400
Toss the noodles.

457
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
Is this Helimoyu?

458
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,680
Helimoyu

459
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
So beautiful

460
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
So cool

461
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,200
It turns into a question mark

462
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,840
Question mark

463
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,960
What’s this? The question mark is spinning?

464
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
It can spin like this?

465
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
So cool

466
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,120
I brought a gift for you

467
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,400
Thank you

468
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,360
Put it here, on the side

469
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,280
We’ll take it together later

470
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,920
Okay

471
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,120
Happy wrap-up
