00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,960
June 4, 2004

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
11:30 AM

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,800
During the performance of "Pushing Goose Lake"

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,280
Someone died

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,640
Someone come quick

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,920
Rui Sisi

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,640
was found dead in the courtyard

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,600
Director

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,320
Rui Sisi

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,880
After investigation

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,840
The victim fell from over 7 meters

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,760
high above

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,640
So she must have

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,920
fallen from over 7 meters

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,320
But all windows above the second floor were sealed

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,240
And the rooftop was also sealed

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,960
The surveillance didn't capture anyone else

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,880
We estimate the time of death was

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,120
We estimate the time of death was

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,440
between 10:15 AM

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,960
and 11:20 AM

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,240
No one passed through here

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
The killer's method

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,480
remains unclear

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,280
Furthermore

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
Canary

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,760
Ning Hao

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,840
Ke Daole and two others

29
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,880
were cursed and exhibited strange behavior

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,120
I teleported

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,440
and was eating dragon beard candy

32
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,720
Turned into a monster behind the white screen

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Lost control of my body

34
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,720
Just as I was about to fall asleep

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,000
I suddenly felt my body splitting open

36
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,720
Bleeding all over - this is her curse on me

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,000
I turned into a

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
person with a pig's head

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,120
Pig-headed human

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,080
So you were cursed by that person?

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,720
The curse is full of mysteries

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,120
Everyone went to the night study room

43
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,880
to investigate

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,240
We should go to the shrine now

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,960
It's already placed

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,720
It's fine

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
3 2 1

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,640
The secret room has opened.

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,960
It's just opened a door, that's all.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
This is that secret room

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
Can't see a thing

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
Wait a moment

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
Come, follow me

54
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Come

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
Where are you?

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm at the very front

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
Can you walk slower?

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,560
Okay

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,440
Touch my back

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,200
What is it? I can't see anything

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,480
Where is this place?

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,320
So dark

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,040
It's okay

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,520
This is you

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,400
This is Ba Zimei

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,280
I'm testing

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,520
Is this a wall or something?

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,560
Don't cut your hand

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Stop messing with it

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,040
There's a bright spot here

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,440
Revolving Door Instructions

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
This revolving door is for single-person passage

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,760
It only rotates when used by one person

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,000
Due to long-term disrepair

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
The revolving door

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,520
may rotate to different angles each time

77
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,000
Alright, I'm leaving

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,360
Goodbye

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,240
Then the places we might go

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,080
could be different

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,480
Different? What can we do?

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,680
Then I'll go with him

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Entering one by one

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,440
Only one person can go at a time

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,840
Single-line mission incoming

86
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,920
This is terrifying

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Revolving door activating soon

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,120
Please stand properly

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Goodbye

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,840
Goodbye

91
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,760
Bye bye

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,760
What was it? I didn't see anything

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,680
There's nothing here

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
Don't listen to his scare tactics

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,040
Who?

96
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,920
Always like this

97
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,640
Tap dancing

98
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,800
Bai Yangzuo

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,160
Don't break it while playing

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
You're in danger now

101
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,200
Yes, that makes sense too

102
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,360
Haven't turned to it yet

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,680
It keeps spinning

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,720
But there are many doors

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I stopped it

106
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,360
How many doors?

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,520
Bai Yangzuo

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,120
Bai Yangzuo

109
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,800
Do you want to go next?

110
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
I can go next.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
You go ahead.

112
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,280
Then you'll be last.

113
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
I'm fine with either.

114
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm scared.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,720
You're not scared?

116
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
I only went in because I saw you were scared.

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,480
We realized the five people behind us were gone.

118
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,080
The five people ahead are gone too.

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
Only you're left.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,880
I'll go in anyway.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,040
He's the killer, he's not afraid.

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,200
He's been here before.

123
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,440
Did he arrange this?

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,480
He's been here.

125
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,920
He must have been here.

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Why are you standing here

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,880
smiling so creepily?

128
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
It's terrifying.

129
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,360
Even scarier in the darkness.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,520
He wasn't cursed.

131
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,160
Because he's the one who cast the curse.

132
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Exactly.

133
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,880
Don't scratch it.

134
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,160
What was that?

135
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,040
So that's how it is.

136
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,000
Can you go third?

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sure.

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
Bye bye.

139
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Goodbye.

140
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
Bye bye.

141
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,600
Maybe I'll wait for you over there.

142
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
Are you scared?

143
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,440
I am scared.

144
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,600
Or I could wait for you there.

145
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,920
Okay.

146
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,040
But what if we get separated?

147
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,680
Would they send us

148
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,960
to six different places?

149
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,120
It's really a separate room

150
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,920
Friends

151
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,800
One for each

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
Right

153
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,800
I don't want to go in

154
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Someone's inside

155
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
Come out

156
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
She's being so blunt too

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,120
What is this thing?

158
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,840
Toilet

159
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,440
This is the toilet

160
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm not going

161
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,720
Put it back for me

162
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,320
Acting cute won't work

163
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
I really don't dare to go in

164
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,120
It's too dark, really too dark

165
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,760
How did she know it was the toilet?

166
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,160
Because I saw the sign

167
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,160
I'm scared

168
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,680
Then maybe you should turn back

169
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,800
Please, let me go back

170
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
You pushed/moved it

171
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,960
Don't break the machine by pushing it

172
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
It exploded

173
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,160
Explosion

174
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm so scared

175
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,760
I don't dare go into the toilet, really

176
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,160
The toilet has so many scary things

177
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,240
And it stinks

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
We'll get you out, don't worry

179
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm genuinely terrified

180
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,480
I might fall into the pit

181
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Just wait there

182
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,640
Don't go in then

183
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
It's a bit smelly, but

184
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,960
Is this really a toilet?

185
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm going in now, bye

186
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
Am I going to step into a pit toilet?

187
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,000
My palms are sweating.

188
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,400
Can you do it?

189
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,960
Not really.

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,000
Little troublemaker.

191
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,160
You don’t seem so timid today.

192
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,200
Do you know where this door

193
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,120
will take you?

194
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,800
Yes.

195
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,080
It will take me to

196
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,360
where I want to go.

197
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,160
The Anywhere Door.

198
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,120
Oh my.

199
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,520
This is so scary.

200
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,400
Be careful.

201
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,800
You still love me, right?

202
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,320
Go ahead.

203
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,000
Go on.

204
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,960
I’m your brother.

205
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,280
You didn’t even say goodbye.

206
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
Brother.

207
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Sister.

208
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,640
Brother.

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,160
This is a bit scary

210
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,000
Why do I already feel

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,480
so frightened?

212
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,360
Why has Xiao Ba stopped talking?

213
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,160
Xiao Ba

214
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,680
Dilraba

215
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,200
You're here

216
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,000
Who are you?

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,160
Where's Dilraba?

218
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm not Dilraba

219
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
Why are you looking for her?

220
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,840
Because in this place

221
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,000
The key to get out

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,960
Is in the toilet and bathroom

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,080
Sisi's Secret Space

224
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,920
I can't see

225
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,360
Please, give me some light.

226
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,520
Finally.

227
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,560
Every time I leave the secret space,

228
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,680
I have to remind myself

229
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,720
to hide the key in the abandoned toilet

230
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,640
and the abandoned bathroom.

231
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,320
We have to help each other.

232
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,120
Right.

233
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,000
What are you doing?

234
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,520
No, because the neighbors were shouting.

235
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,920
Then why didn't you come in?

236
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,240
I didn't know I had to come down and push the door.

237
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,400
There's a monster on my side.

238
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,480
We don't have any here, right?

239
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,120
Look at these words.

240
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,360
Those who spread rumors.

241
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,240
Will all be cursed.

242
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,840
What? Have you heard?

243
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,400
Xu Duocheng is the school director's illegitimate child.

244
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,920
He's only successful because of family connections.

245
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,120
That's how he got ahead.

246
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,960
Someone saw him here.

247
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
In the abandoned bathroom.

248
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,000
He had many injuries.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,240
His body was covered in bandages.

250
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,440
Have you seen Xiao Jiu recently?

251
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,000
It seems after Xu Duocheng died.

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Xiao Jiu hasn't appeared again, right?

253
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Bai Yangzuo.

254
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,200
Why can they meet?

255
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,640
Where did you go?

256
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,680
I'm at the door.

257
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,640
Brother Bai.

258
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,520
How did you open the door?

259
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
I just turned it and it opened.

260
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
Turned what to open the door?

261
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,480
Turned the doorknob.

262
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,680
Your question.

263
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
Really makes me feel a bit...

264
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,240
No, where is there a door?

265
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,040
Should we look for the key?

266
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,040
I didn't find any key.

267
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,960
Only found these things.

268
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
There are no keys in our room.

269
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,240
Ke Daole

270
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,760
What do you want with the bathroom key?

271
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,240
I need the key.

272
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,760
So it's just about the key?

273
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,640
We have a locked cabinet here.

274
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,520
We can't open it.

275
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,440
The lock won't open.

276
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,160
No one's hiding, right?

277
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,880
No.

278
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,360
We have the keys.

279
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
There are no keys in this room.

280
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Sorry.

281
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
No

282
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,600
None of them?

283
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
No

284
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,320
You've already searched here, right?

285
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
I did

286
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,160
I don't quite trust your search

287
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,280
I feel like you...

288
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
Then I'll go search again

289
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
Why don't you trust me?

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,200
You didn't even find this key

291
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm here

292
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,520
Hello everyone

293
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,880
Ba Zimei

294
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
Where are you?

295
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,040
I should be across from you

296
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,600
Check your location

297
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
Are there two keys?

298
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
Good heavens

299
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,920
I have to reach into the toilet

300
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,240
to find the keys

301
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,960
No

302
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,400
My keys are with you

303
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,240
Ba Zimei

304
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't mess around

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
You don't have my keys

306
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,160
Who is this?

307
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Come in quickly.

308
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,440
Who?

309
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,280
Me.

310
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,000
Give me a hand.

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,720
Thank you.

312
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,440
Come in quickly.

313
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay.

314
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,880
Damn, we're in the same boat.

315
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
There's someone ahead.

316
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,960
There's someone right in front of us.

317
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,960
Because there are some moving shadows.

318
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,400
Shadows.

319
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,120
I see it.

320
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,760
Right.

321
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Don't shout.

322
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,000
If you're something...

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
Whatever you do, don't shout.

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
You can appear...

325
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,840
But don't shout.

326
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,800
Alright?

327
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,680
Okay.

328
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,800
We're looking for the key.

329
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,320
He said their key is with us.

330
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,800
Like this.

331
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
Let's crouch down first.

332
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,760
Let's feel around, okay?

333
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,560
I'll feel, and you support me.

334
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,360
Okay.

335
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,840
What is this?

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,440
What's this?

337
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,520
A pool.

338
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,800
Boss.

339
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,320
Honorable bosses.

340
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,840
Have mercy.

341
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,280
Throw us the key.

342
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,320
Or I'll start singing.

343
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,360
Where is this?

344
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
Come in quickly.

345
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,320
Come in.

346
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,000
Get inside.

347
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,880
Be careful.

348
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
This is a mirror.

349
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,840
There's a pool down here.

350
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,680
This is a toilet, right?

351
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,920
Come, walk towards me.

352
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
Here.

353
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,200
We'll fall into the pit toilet.

354
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,080
Have you gone further inside?

355
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,800
There's a passageway here, right?

356
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,960
Ba Zimei.

357
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,000
Heh.

358
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,760
No.

359
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
Why can you be together?

360
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,560
It's over.

361
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,760
Are the magical beasts still here?

362
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,760
Come out and keep me company!

363
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,760
This should be a maze

364
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,400
Just a place where you can go in circles

365
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,160
We're in

366
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,560
No problem

367
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,280
Stop running

368
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
Don't run

369
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,280
Stay there

370
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,080
What is that?

371
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,480
Hold still

372
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,960
Who's this?

373
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,400
This way

374
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,520
Turn left

375
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,680
Up there

376
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,960
This is a toilet

377
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,360
Those behind me, listen to my warning

378
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,200
Don’t enter this abandoned toilet

379
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,800
There are many monsters inside

380
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,480
These monsters

381
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,720
Why are they gathered here?

382
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,320
I thought I was seeing things

383
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,480
Then I spotted a skull in an instant

384
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,600
Inside is just a wall

385
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,080
Then it must be in every pit

386
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,520
Then this door

387
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Is there a key in this pit?

388
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,400
No

389
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,480
What about this one?

390
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,720
Can't see clearly

391
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,240
There's a light here

392
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,280
What do you mean?

393
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,600
I've turned this whole place upside down

394
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,520
I found it

395
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes! Let's get out

396
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,240
So we need to go find that

397
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,080
Ke

398
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,000
It's open

399
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,800
Great

400
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Finally

401
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,920
These are steps

402
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,480
Steps, be careful

403
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,720
Slow down

404
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Where's the toilet key?

405
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,320
Give it to me

406
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,280
There's a lock here, right?

407
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,280
Give him the key

408
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,760
Here

409
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,800
Still missing one lock

410
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,080
The bathroom lock

411
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,640
Wait for them to come

412
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,560
How are you two doing?

413
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
Did you check this person?

414
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,560
Let's remove this bandage and see

415
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,480
Just tear it off

416
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,920
Anything?

417
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,640
Yes

418
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,400
Found it

419
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,960
Careful

420
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,120
Come

421
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,760
Who has the key?

422
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,320
The key

423
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,160
Open the door

424
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,040
Coming

425
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,920
I'll do it then

426
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,440
Be careful

427
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Whose head?

428
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
What is this thing?

429
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,680
They're all heads.

430
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,680
What?

431
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,440
This is a...

432
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,280
How can you see them?

433
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,240
There's a human head to my left.

434
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
Find the light.

435
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Was there a light when we came in?

436
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,600
I miss the light so much.

437
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
This is a bedroom

438
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,520
What is this thing?

439
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,920
What is this?

440
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,480
Is this a prison cell?

441
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
So many bloody handprints

442
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Bloody handprints

443
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,480
Search this place first.

444
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
There are comics here.

445
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,000
Come

446
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,520
Come here

447
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,400
Here

448
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,520
Hurry

449
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Ba Zimei

450
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,840
Your evidence

451
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,000
Forever friendless, pathetic loser

452
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,680
No one wants to play with Ba Zimei

453
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,880
Liar

454
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,440
I don't want to play with parentless kids

455
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,560
Orphan

456
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,120
Did you know

457
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,200
Ba Zimei is also an orphan

458
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,760
Ba Zimei the orphan

459
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,840
No parents? How pitiful.

460
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Didn't mean to push you, orphan.

461
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Parentless.

462
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,280
Bullying you.

463
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,080
And no one to protect you.

464
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
This is a drawing I made.

465
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,680
Because earlier, it was mentioned that...

466
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,840
I was adopted.

467
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,560
I grew up in an orphanage.

468
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,320
And then...

469
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,760
I became friends with Sisi.

470
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,960
Because we got along well.

471
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,600
So I shared my secret with her.

472
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,320
I told her I was an orphan.

473
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,440
But then she...

474
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,960
The result

475
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
She revealed my secret

476
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,680
Then everyone bullied me

477
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,760
And then I just...

478
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,560
Felt completely betrayed

479
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,360
But why is your painting here?

480
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,960
She might have seen this painting of mine

481
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,360
And brought it straight here

482
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,960
There's a note at the door

483
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
It says:

484
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,680
"This is

485
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,880
Rui Sibai's secret space."

486
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,400
Right

487
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,920
Yes, Rui Sibai bled here

488
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,600
Wait, wasn't it you who bled?

489
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,160
How could so much blood come out?

490
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,600
That day,

491
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,400
did you lose this much blood?

492
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,120
Yes

493
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,760
I started bleeding all over

494
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,960
Completely covered

495
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Like being slashed by knives

496
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,440
Did it hurt?

497
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,920
Excruciating

498
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,640
Because I had

499
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,920
Wounds in streaks

500
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,800
The blood was splattered

501
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,040
No idea why she's here

502
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,000
There's a password, everyone

503
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,520
Five digits

504
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,680
Are there any handprints underneath?

505
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,400
No.

506
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,960
Let's look around.

507
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,480
There's a note here.

508
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
It's almost June 4th now.

509
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,160
3:00 AM.

510
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,680
June 4th is today.

511
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,840
During the entire night study session,

512
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,480
I was in my secret space.

513
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,520
Never went out.

514
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,480
Tossing and turning,

515
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,840
I thought about it all night.

516
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,040
I decided that after dawn,

517
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,520
I must find a chance to tell the truth.

518
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,840
So she died because of this truth?

519
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,920
So she might not necessarily be

520
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,840
what you just said.

521
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,480
She might not be the one who cursed us.

522
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,480
The logic of this matter is:

523
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,240
That is,

524
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,600
Rui Sibai is leaving.

525
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,640
The three of us took her belongings,

526
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,440
and then the three of us

527
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,040
were cursed and returned,

528
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,280
found this note.

529
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,840
It mentions the curse.

530
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,280
Let's assume

531
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,480
Rui Sibai cursed us.

532
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,920
Why would she tell us herself

533
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,160
that she cursed us?

534
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,160
Do you understand?

535
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,240
So someone must be framing her.

536
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,160
Because this matter

537
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,600
If she were

538
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,080
acting alone,

539
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,160
it wouldn't make logical sense.

540
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
That means Rui Sibai also knew

541
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,040
the three of us

542
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,840
went to the shrine.

543
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,600
She didn't know.

544
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,400
I think Rui Sibai

545
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
didn't know about the curse.

546
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,040
I think what you said earlier,

547
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,640
the theory about hacking her QQ,

548
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,280
someone contacted us using her QQ,

549
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
and placed the items

550
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,000
at her dorm room door.

551
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,120
There's an elevator here.

552
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,400
Died here

553
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,960
Elevator shaft

554
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,920
Small Auditorium

555
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,440
Go that way and you'll reach the Small Auditorium

556
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,160
Do you see it?

557
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,240
We're currently in the dormitory building

558
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,560
But it connects to the small auditorium

559
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,360
There's a passage

560
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,040
Yes, that's right

561
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,280
After our rehearsal ended

562
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,600
that small auditorium

563
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,760
has access to this place

564
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,560
Someone went down from here

565
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,720
You understand?

566
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,360
Is it possible that

567
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,560
she slipped, or perhaps

568
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
or came up from there

569
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,560
But this height is

570
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,880
more than 7 meters

571
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,400
Right

572
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,600
Let's estimate visually

573
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,880
More than 7 meters?

574
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,960
Down there, look

575
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,200
There's blood on that cardboard, right?

576
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,600
Yes

577
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,240
Do you see it?

578
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,560
Can you see it?

579
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,880
Is that blood?

580
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm not sure

581
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,840
Yes, it's blood

582
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,160
No, look

583
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,520
There's a puddle of something below

584
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,040
There should be bloodstains on it

585
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,120
It's possible that

586
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
the body was thrown from here

587
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,120
and she died from the fall

588
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,960
This thing

589
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,680
What is this?

590
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,520
This thing is for dragging

591
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,120
Look

592
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,160
Isn't this for tying feet?

593
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,000
Exactly

594
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,960
That makes sense

595
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,800
While unconscious anyway

596
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,920
I tied her up

597
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,880
then let go

598
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,640
and she fell

599
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,000
Before our rehearsal,

600
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,640
after someone finished all this,

601
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,520
directly, it's quite possible

602
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,960
they found Sisi here,

603
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,160
and murdered her here.

604
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,680
The whole bed was covered in blood,

605
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,680
then from here

606
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,320
they transported the body downstairs.

607
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,520
After finishing all this,

608
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,240
they went to join us at the auditorium (for the performance).

609
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,280
All that blood on the bed proves

610
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,960
that Sisi must have died here,

611
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
murdered on the pillow.

612
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,240
Right, he just

613
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,840
bang!

614
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,400
and then

615
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,600
she died, splattering blood everywhere - that's not important.

616
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,840
Then at this point,

617
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,080
he tied her ankles,

618
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,200
and lowered her down with this rope.

619
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,040
He needed to move the body.

620
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,720
Then I have a question:

621
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,480
Did she die from the fall?

622
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:58,960
Let me tell you,

623
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
there are two possibilities for how she died:

624
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
First, she was unconscious,

625
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,720
and then fell

626
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,800
7 meters from here,

627
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,080
dying from the fall while unconscious.

628
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,840
Second possibility is

629
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,360
she was already dead

630
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,640
before being tied up.

631
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,360
Only these two possibilities exist.

632
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,480
I think she was already dead,

633
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,960
otherwise what does all this blood on the bed

634
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
signify?

635
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,040
What is this?

636
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Bloody handprints.

637
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,320
So someone struggled here.

638
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,960
They struggled before dying too.

639
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,560
They're all over here.

640
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,440
Then she's not dead.

641
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,960
Wait a minute.

642
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,360
You...

643
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,560
When you said you were covered in blood...

644
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,440
That was earlier last night.

645
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
Not today.

646
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,160
This morning...

647
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,680
Didn't we all see Sisi?

648
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,960
She was still alive.

649
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,480
But the problem is this window is too narrow.

650
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,200
The killer couldn't have manipulated...

651
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,360
something this big.

652
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,120
So we should go take a look there

653
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,400
Slide down

654
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,320
Are you joking, bro?

655
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,200
We have to go back from here again

656
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,000
It probably won’t

657
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,640
happen again with that thing appearing

658
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,000
Let's go

659
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,560
Go

660
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,640
Go, Wu Tan

661
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Let's set off

662
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,960
Thank you

663
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,760
There's a platform here.

664
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,760
There's another platform here.

665
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,320
Going down.

666
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,840
You go behind.

667
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,960
Small Auditorium

668
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,240
No

669
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,760
He transported the body to the Small Auditorium

670
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,680
Why?

671
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,960
I can only tell you one thing

672
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,760
What?

673
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,440
That this is a door

674
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,960
How do you know?

675
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,120
Look

676
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
He's been here

677
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,880
Turn right for the Small Auditorium

678
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,320
How do we get there?

679
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,600
Could it be?

680
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Just as I thought

681
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,120
What are you doing here?

682
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,960
Up to no good, huh?

683
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Then this

684
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,760
changes the nature of this matter

685
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,360
What is this?

686
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,760
This device can be remotely controlled

687
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,400
Wait a minute

688
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,560
Pulley tightening

689
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,360
Pulley

690
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,880
What's wrong?

691
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,400
Tape

692
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,200
The tape was applied from the inside here

693
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,200
For sealing the door

694
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,880
That tape for sealing the door

695
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,680
What is this thing?

696
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,360
Take all of these

697
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,680
Map

698
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,600
Abandoned ventilation shaft in the art building

699
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,960
It's from the art building

700
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,720
Abandoned space

701
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
There's something behind this

702
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Friends

703
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,800
Wait a moment

704
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,960
They're crowding in

705
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,720
They're crowding in

706
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,520
Look

707
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,880
They've passed out

708
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,360
Unconscious immediately after inhaling

709
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,800
Won't wake up until a full day passes

710
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,640
Do you know how he

711
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,600
transported the corpse over there?

712
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,760
How was it transported?

713
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,800
No way...

714
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,640
Is that true?

715
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,680
The laundry room.

716
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,040
That is

717
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
Did you bring the corpse directly here?

718
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,160
No

719
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,800
He arranged to meet in the laundry room

720
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,280
Because he arranged to meet in the laundry room

721
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,600
After drugging her

722
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,160
For her

723
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,840
Hang her up here

724
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
To fall to her death

725
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,640
Haven't you been to the laundry room before?

726
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,040
When you come to do laundry

727
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,960
Did you discover there's a hidden door here?

728
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,760
What are you talking about?

729
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,480
That's strange

730
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,320
I was right

731
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,440
What you're saying is strange

732
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:31,840
No

733
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,280
I think you

734
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,760
When coming to do laundry discovered

735
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,680
I started bleeding all over

736
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,520
So then I

737
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,480
Took these shirts

738
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,760
To the laundry room to wash

739
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,240
What is this?

740
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,680
I heard you cursing at Ruisi Bai

741
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,120
I can give you

742
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,560
Provide a murder plan

743
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,160
If you're interested

744
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,880
Anyway you don't know me

745
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Let's not meet

746
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,160
Just pass notes through the door

747
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,000
Okay

748
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,640
You can do it this way

749
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,560
He's not one of our six

750
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,480
Xiaowei or Xiaorou

751
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,000
We passed notes through the door

752
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,560
These two never met in person

753
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,760
Xiao

754
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,480
Wait a minute

755
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,360
There's something behind this

756
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,960
This is that person

757
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,200
who gave him a map

758
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,360
That's how he learned about

759
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,760
this space and method

760
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,680
Meaning he was used as a murder tool

761
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,960
I think this person resembles a senior student

762
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,680
Why?

763
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,880
Because they know the school very well

764
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,120
Not necessarily

765
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,680
Lived nearby

766
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,360
Right

767
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,400
So which door was this note-passing through?

768
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,760
The dormitory door

769
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,240
Let's check the dorm courtyard for the body

770
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,360
Isn't the body here?

771
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
Isn't this the body?

772
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,920
After our rehearsal ended

773
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
That small auditorium

774
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,720
connects to this place

775
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,640
There is this logic

776
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,600
I think the murderer did this:

777
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,960
Killed her in that courtyard

778
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,240
She definitely died there

779
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,080
He carried her body

780
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,880
to this place

781
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,080
and placed the body here

782
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,640
Then take everything

783
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,600
and create a false impression

784
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,760
Then

785
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,960
close the door from the inside like this

786
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,520
apply adhesive tape

787
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,600
After applying it

788
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,920
stick stick stick

789
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,840
But using a knife

790
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,040
after slicing it from bottom to top

791
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,280
He wants to make it a locked room

792
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,600
Because a locked room can't be created here

793
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,400
No

794
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
Huang Xi said he initially pushed

795
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,440
but couldn't open it

796
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,680
He could fail to push it open

797
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,040
Why couldn't he push it open?

798
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,440
Give it to me

799
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,200
There's a note on top that says

800
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,280
"Can withstand 100kg of pulling force"

801
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,600
"Easily cut by sharp objects"

802
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,840
"Human strength cannot tear it apart"

803
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,040
"Only sharp tools can cut it"

804
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,240
Meaning this tape

805
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,960
If you want to open it

806
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,560
you can only use a knife

807
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,200
Brute force

808
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,160
But

809
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,240
The sharp tool will leave tape residue

810
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,680
On the knife we just used

811
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,440
Is there any residue?

812
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,160
I want to know

813
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,240
Go check

814
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,840
That was Huang Xi who opened the door

815
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,240
Yes

816
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,920
Let's see

817
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,040
He saw a dead body from the second floor.

818
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,280
Then after he came over,

819
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,360
he couldn't open this door.

820
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,600
That's when he noticed the tape.

821
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,520
Then he went to get a knife,

822
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,720
cut through it, and entered.

823
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
That's what happened.

824
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,280
Does this count as residue?

825
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,520
Is there any residue?

826
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,040
No residue.

827
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,240
You came in,

828
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,160
I understand what you mean.

829
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,840
It's fine.

830
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,200
What's wrong, X?

831
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,680
Are you afraid we're getting too close to the truth?

832
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,800
If this knife was

833
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,720
thrown on the ground at the time,

834
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
why are there no marks?

835
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,720
I think the knife's tip

836
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,200
including the clue on the tape,

837
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,240
proves that

838
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,800
I believe this door is a fake locked room.

839
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,920
He wanted us to think it was a locked room.

840
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,240
Look,

841
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,400
assuming this thing is

842
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,800
this place,

843
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,160
a place you can't get out of.

844
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,600
After I moved the body in,

845
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,920
wouldn't I need to get out?

846
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
But if I were to leave,

847
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,040
and put tape on it,

848
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
wouldn't I be trapped inside?

849
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,240
Right.

850
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,400
Then I wouldn't be able to

851
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,280
apply the tape from the outside.

852
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,600
So the only thing I could do is

853
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,960
slap the tape on,

854
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,200
cut through it,

855
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,720
and then leave.

856
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,160
But doing it this way is

857
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,280
something I can't understand.

858
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,680
Namely,

859
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,920
if he cut through this thing

860
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
and then left,

861
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,600
then there'd be no point in applying the tape.

862
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,360
No

863
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,920
He couldn't have left at this time.

864
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,240
Because the surveillance was always on.

865
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,080
Only Xiao Huang and Ruisi were seen moving around.

866
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,040
Only these two people appeared.

867
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,960
There was no one else.

868
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,040
He must have set this up

869
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,400
very early.

870
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,040
The first time, he couldn't push it open.

871
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,600
The second time, he could.

872
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Classmates

873
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,200
I've obtained

874
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,800
Ruisi Bai's autopsy report

875
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,080
You can take a look

876
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,040
It really wasn't you?

877
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Not me

878
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,280
Severe head trauma

879
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,400
Intracranial hemorrhage

880
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,440
Multiple organ injuries

881
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,920
From about 8 meters

882
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,080
Estimated time of death was

883
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,800
Between 10-11 AM

884
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
So how did she die?

885
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,800
Fell to her death

886
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,920
Fell from about 8 meters high

887
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,920
I want to ask

888
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,600
To be honest

889
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,560
Where did you find this door?

890
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,400
It was sealed shut

891
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,600
I was on the second floor

892
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,200
Upstairs

893
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,680
I saw it

894
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,400
Yes, through the glass window

895
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,600
Did you come down to open this door?

896
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,680
I couldn't push it open

897
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,800
So you used this knife to cut?

898
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,080
Yes

899
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,680
While cutting, did you feel

900
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,920
Anything stuck?

901
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,200
I just cut like this

902
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,080
You can try it

903
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,600
Then let's try

904
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Just close the door

905
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I'll try cutting

906
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,040
I'll do it

907
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,240
Watch your hands

908
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,720
Cut

909
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,200
Careful, we're going to cut

910
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,840
Down

911
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,680
It can open

912
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,880
So I want to tell you one thing

913
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
What's the logic?

914
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,600
This must be the killer

915
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,360
who left this way

916
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,120
I think this is solid evidence

917
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,160
It already is

918
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,680
Where's the surveillance?

919
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,480
Which way

920
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,440
is it pointing?

921
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,880
I'll take my leave now

922
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,640
Go about your work, thanks

923
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,360
Okay

924
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,520
The camera points from here to here

925
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,040
Yes, that's right

926
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,680
Exactly

927
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,040
How do you know?

928
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,560
This is a blind spot

929
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,320
Exactly

930
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,120
Blind spot

931
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,760
Whose dorm is 101?

932
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,680
Not 101.

933
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,760
It's this dorm.

934
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,200
Then theirs...

935
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,880
Rui Sisi and the others have their own rooms.

936
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,240
This is also a blind spot.

937
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,200
The laundry room is also a blind spot.

938
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,640
Blind spots - this whole area is blind spots.

939
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,160
What do you mean?

940
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,560
This is a blind spot.

941
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,640
This area isn't covered.

942
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
Can't see anything here.

943
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,360
Is this a blind spot?

944
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes.

945
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
The camera points from there to there.

946
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,360
That leaves many possibilities.

947
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,520
I could come to switch knives.

948
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,560
Or I could come to slash.

949
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,040
I could...

950
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,880
You know what?

951
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,200
This is Xiao Huang's discarded knife.

952
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,320
Which means...

953
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,160
When Xiao Huang slashed,

954
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,880
the tape was already loose.

955
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
So that means...

956
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,680
Xiao...

957
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,160
I've got it.

958
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,920
Give me the notebook.

959
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
11:26.

960
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,760
He pushes the door

961
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,320
At 11:27 he runs over

962
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
So if I were the killer

963
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,560
I'm here

964
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,640
Pushes, but it won't open

965
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,560
Right

966
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,400
That's exactly it

967
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,920
Gone

968
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,400
Why wouldn't the killer let him open it himself

969
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,840
The killer wants to open it for him

970
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,480
Locked-room murder

971
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,600
Creating a locked-room scenario

972
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,480
She actually makes a good point, really

973
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,320
Why

974
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,000
He cuts it open himself

975
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,600
He cuts it open himself

976
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,880
Same as someone else cutting it

977
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,520
Exactly

978
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,560
He needs to get out of this locked room

979
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,640
The killer

980
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,280
Brother

981
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,440
You've sealed yourself inside

982
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
What to do

983
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,400
Right

984
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:44,760
Alright then

985
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,560
Brother, let me tell you

986
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I know after he glued it

987
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,160
He finished cutting

988
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,920
Opens the door, comes out, closes it

989
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,520
That's the only way

990
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,640
Let me demonstrate.

991
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,400
After the killer placed the body inside,

992
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,080
they wanted to create a locked room.

993
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,400
They wrapped all the tape around it.

994
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,000
So did they succeed in making this locked room?

995
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,880
They absolutely,

996
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,840
had to break this tape

997
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,400
open.

998
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,280
They had to break it first,

999
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,840
then send a message saying,

1000
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,040
"Huang, go check the second floor immediately."

1001
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,920
When they closed the door,

1002
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
the killer hid here.

1003
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,880
When Huang came to push the door,

1004
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,560
they were actually already inside.

1005
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,400
So they didn't come out.

1006
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
While Huang went to get the knife,

1007
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
they immediately came out

1008
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,840
and hid here again.

1009
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,880
When Huang was getting the knife,

1010
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,640
they thought the door couldn't be opened.

1011
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,200
Huang could also see them.

1012
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,040
The first time he

1013
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,720
When Huang Xi was looking, he was outside

1014
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,280
When Huang Xi went downstairs

1015
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,080
He ran inside to block the door

1016
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,640
No

1017
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,280
If Huang Xi saw him outside

1018
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,720
That's the logic

1019
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,520
I think what he said makes sense

1020
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,640
Let's demonstrate again

1021
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,720
The crime was committed

1022
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,680
The door was opened

1023
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,160
Send a message

1024
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,680
Huang Xi goes to check the second floor

1025
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,720
Second floor

1026
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,720
Go up

1027
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,320
I rushed upstairs

1028
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,520
Then I went up to the second floor first

1029
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,880
I was at that window on the second floor

1030
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,080
I saw this

1031
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,080
Below

1032
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,520
The body was there

1033
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,680
There was tape on the door

1034
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,520
I ran quickly

1035
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,640
Down

1036
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,160
I ran inside

1037
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,400
Hold it

1038
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,040
Go get the knife

1039
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,960
Tape

1040
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,520
Alright, get the knife.

1041
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,080
Get the knife.

1042
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,520
Then I run out.

1043
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,400
Here comes the knife.

1044
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:15,880
Pull it open.

1045
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
One, two, three.

1046
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,320
On his knife,

1047
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,400
there wouldn't be any tape marks, right?

1048
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,880
Brilliant.

1049
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
No problem.

1050
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,400
The method is like this.

1051
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,160
I think this method

1052
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,800
is a very feasible one.

1053
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,880
In other words,

1054
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,680
It's fine.

1055
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,480
Later, we'll arrange that

1056
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,920
alibi of ours.

1057
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,800
Right.

1058
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,360
But,

1059
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,160
why would there be that?

1060
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,360
I provide you with a murder method.

1061
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,200
That's someone you don't know.

1062
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,600
Or he knows our

1063
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,720
motive to kill Ruisibai.

1064
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,520
Look,

1065
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,600
I heard you cursing Ruisibai.

1066
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,320
I can give you a murder plan.

1067
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,040
That is,

1068
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm the accomplice.

1069
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,520
I provide all the methods to him.

1070
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,360
The premise is I heard you want to kill her.

1071
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,160
I'll induce you to do this.

1072
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,680
Right?

1073
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
Then who am I?

1074
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,600
I'm Ruisibai's good friend.

1075
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,400
But Ruisibai doesn't know

1076
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,800
I want her dead.

1077
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,080
So I kill by proxy.

1078
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,200
But whose knife do I need to borrow?

1079
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,240
Who wants to use the knife?

1080
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,640
I need to know.

1081
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,000
Right?

1082
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,000
Is this the logic?

1083
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,720
Yes, exactly.

1084
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,680
Not bad

1085
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,960
Little Conan running around busily

1086
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,160
But still no clue who it is

1087
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,400
There's an autopsy report

1088
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,760
Ligature marks on the victim's ankles

1089
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,880
Severe head trauma

1090
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,960
Intracranial hemorrhage

1091
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,600
Multiple internal organ injuries

1092
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,160
According to autopsy findings

1093
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,000
Cause of death confirmed

1094
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,920
Fell from approximately 8 meters high

1095
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,880
Preliminary time of death

1096
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,840
Morning of June 4th

1097
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,080
Between 10-11 AM

1098
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,240
She was below the building

1099
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,560
After being drugged unconscious

1100
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,720
Tied up down there

1101
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,640
Then hoisted up

1102
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,800
Dropped to her death

1103
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,640
She died during unconsciousness

1104
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,320
Correct

1105
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,640
The laundry room drugged her directly

1106
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,320
Brought her here

1107
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,520
Strung her up immediately

1108
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,680
Let go to kill her

1109
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,920
Just left her there

1110
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,920
Died here, right?

1111
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,360
Right

1112
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,880
Didn't even need that room

1113
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,920
You mean the upstairs room?

1114
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,200
Yes

1115
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,160
No need at all

1116
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,200
Why bother?

1117
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,960
Let's disregard the blood evidence

1118
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,560
Look at her autopsy report

1119
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,320
She died while unconscious

1120
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,360
From the fall

1121
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,040
Because?

1122
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,920
It's an abandoned space

1123
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,280
Not something one person could do

1124
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,520
Only she could access

1125
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,840
Not her alone

1126
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,680
Perhaps

1127
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,000
Those people before

1128
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,640
Did anyone hear us rehearsing?

1129
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,280
They told us

1130
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,520
not to stay in the small theater

1131
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,400
because it might damage the props

1132
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,880
So none of us were here

1133
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,080
Right

1134
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,800
It's already 10 o'clock now

1135
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,840
Before the official performance

1136
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,440
we need to protect

1137
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,640
the stage setup

1138
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,200
So you all

1139
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,400
shouldn't stay in the small auditorium

1140
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,040
That's why no one could hear

1141
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,760
Because he knew

1142
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,480
no one would be here at this time

1143
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,480
What time did Sisi go to the laundry room?

1144
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,080
10:15

1145
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,800
15

1146
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,840
Appeared on the surveillance

1147
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,320
And what about Xiao Huang?

1148
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,720
Yes,

1149
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,520
received a text at 11:20,

1150
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,680
came once at 11:26,

1151
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,040
then took a knife at 11:27,

1152
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,960
and came back once more,

1153
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,320
and then it was discovered.

1154
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,280
Okay,

1155
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,080
so what we need

1156
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,560
is from 10:00 to 11:30.

1157
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,720
Let's each state our timeline.

1158
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,000
Alright, I'll go first.

1159
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,240
After 10 o'clock,

1160
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,720
I was feeling particularly emotional,

1161
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,040
so I asked Ke Daole for

1162
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,440
his copy of "The Love Between Us Three"

1163
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,240
and went to the props room.

1164
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,480
I listened to it alone for a while.

1165
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,240
At 10:30, I went to the dance studio

1166
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
to practice with Ke as we'd arranged.

1167
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,360
We practiced until 11:15,

1168
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,760
then at 11:30 I came here

1169
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,560
for the live broadcast.

1170
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,120
So you were with him at 10:30,

1171
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,600
right?

1172
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,080
Yes, and then straight

1173
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,680
until 11:15.

1174
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,720
We finished our practice session.

1175
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,440
So we have mutual alibis, correct?

1176
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,200
Right.

1177
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,960
That means from 10 to 10:30

1178
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,080
you were alone

1179
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,160
in the props room.

1180
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,720
Okay.

1181
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,720
From 10 to 10:30,

1182
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,440
I was alone in the school courtyard

1183
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,000
reading "How to Win Over Handsome Boys".

1184
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,320
Then from 10:30 to 11,

1185
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,280
you came to find me.

1186
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
We had an argument.

1187
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,480
Yes, that's right.

1188
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,160
Then from 11 to 11:10,

1189
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,800
I thought about

1190
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,920
my brother committing murder,

1191
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,360
so I went to the riverside

1192
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,600
and couldn't help but cry.

1193
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,840
After that I went to the backyard

1194
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,200
and continued reading alone,

1195
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,320
trying to calm myself down.

1196
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Then we all came here.

1197
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,280
I was the one at 10 o'clock

1198
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,640
who went to the recording studio to record songs

1199
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,080
After finishing recording

1200
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,280
at 10:30 I went to argue with her

1201
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,680
Argued until 11 then went back to recording

1202
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,760
Kept recording until the performance

1203
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,440
After rehearsal ended at 10

1204
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,480
I wanted to find Rui Sisi

1205
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,880
to ask about last night's 2B pencil

1206
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,680
curse incident

1207
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,240
But I couldn't find her

1208
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,280
So I went by myself to

1209
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,320
the Wukenai River

1210
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,520
to watch a movie called

1211
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,760
"Monster Shrek"

1212
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,720
Then Hedinhong approached me

1213
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,400
at 10:30 for extra practice

1214
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,840
Although he's my love rival

1215
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,800
I didn't think too much about it

1216
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,160
and just practiced with him

1217
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,440
Then the two of us

1218
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,080
practiced together

1219
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,800
until 11:15

1220
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,840
After finishing at 11:15

1221
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,640
I remembered my "Monster Shrek"

1222
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,520
wasn't finished yet

1223
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,560
So I went back alone

1224
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,920
to watch 15 more minutes

1225
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,080
The place I watched was

1226
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,000
the school's front lawn

1227
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,120
At 11:30

1228
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,240
we all returned together

1229
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,560
We are all alone

1230
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,200
There was someone

1231
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,360
Then alone again

1232
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,520
So it's all between 10 to 10:30

1233
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,040
This place

1234
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,200
No one was present during this period

1235
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,680
Neither of you has an alibi

1236
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,760
You were alone together, right?

1237
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:47,960
I think he probably was too

1238
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,360
I think he probably was too

1239
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,960
Me too

1240
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,720
So what's the significance of this timeframe?

1241
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,360
What is it?

1242
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,600
She fell to her death while unconscious

1243
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,880
These two time periods

1244
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,440
probably aren't the same

1245
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,200
He first killed (Ruisibai)

1246
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,600
After the death, he came out to do some things

1247
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,640
Created an alibi

1248
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,200
Then went back to dispose of the body

1249
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,280
Sent a message to Xiao Huang

1250
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,960
That's possible

1251
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,600
Two separate timeframes

1252
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:05,840
Right

1253
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,240
Definitely two distinct time periods

1254
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,400
So we must find

1255
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,160
Between 10:15 to 11:00

1256
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,800
What?

1257
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,360
Don't always be so jumpy

1258
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,560
And then give such weak answers

1259
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,000
He's extremely suspicious

1260
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,280
What makes him so suspicious is

1261
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,360
First he went to watch a movie

1262
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,120
All by himself

1263
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,720
Then went to watch a movie again

1264
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,280
These two time periods happen to be

1265
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,240
When the murder could have occurred

1266
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,840
And when he finally sent that message to Xiao Huang

1267
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,960
Actually, we're all the same

1268
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,640
We all have the same timeframe

1269
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,680
Actually, every one of us

1270
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,560
Had the opportunity to commit the crime

1271
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,440
Go further down

1272
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,560
We need to unravel this clue

1273
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,960
We have to figure this thing out

1274
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,080
This is the clue about the killer

1275
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,200
Exactly when

1276
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,240
was this note given?

1277
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,880
I got it

1278
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,680
Alright

1279
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,760
Someone who studied abroad

1280
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,240
His response has always been

1281
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,280
Alright

1282
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,440
Studied abroad

1283
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,320
Alright

1284
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,480
Did you just look at this?

1285
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,040
Yes

1286
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Someone told us

1287
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,160
about the killer's methods

1288
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,080
The killer carried out

1289
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,480
Right

1290
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,000
Because today

1291
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,520
I think the killer has only one motive

1292
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,400
Which is what?

1293
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,320
This person might have taught the killer the murder method

1294
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,200
And then used this method to kill Rui Sibai

1295
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,880
Today we just need to find Rui Sibai's killer

1296
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,120
That's all

1297
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,040
But we don't know the murder motive

1298
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,120
Because the accomplice said

1299
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,000
"I heard you insulting Rui Sibai"

1300
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,240
He must be certain this person

1301
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,120
wanted to kill her before helping

1302
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,880
Only then could he "borrow this knife"

1303
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,200
Now we need to find out

1304
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,640
who has this "knife"

1305
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,960
About the knife - I have crucial information

1306
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,440
There are no knives in the dorms

1307
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,880
Whether in the dorms

1308
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,560
Whether there are knives

1309
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,080
All marked with X's

1310
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,640
Yes

1311
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,560
So at 1 AM

1312
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,640
I checked the dorms with the matron

1313
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,440
The dorms were empty

1314
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,360
None of us were there

1315
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,560
And no one had knives

1316
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,440
No, I mean this "knife"

1317
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,480
is the metaphorical knife in "killing with a borrowed knife"

1318
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,720
Not an actual knife

1319
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,240
No, it's not the murder "knife"

1320
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,360
The tool used to break in

1321
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,520
There's a note on top that says

1322
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,640
"Can withstand 100kg of pulling force"

1323
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,920
"Easily cut by sharp objects"

1324
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,200
"Human strength cannot break it"

1325
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,360
"Only sharp tools can cut it"

1326
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,600
Meaning this tape

1327
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,320
If you want to open it

1328
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:19,880
You can only use a knife

1329
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,480
But

1330
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,560
The sharp tool would leave tape residue

1331
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,000
On the knife we just examined

1332
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,720
Was there any residue?

1333
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,280
No residue

1334
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,240
What's with all the blood in her room?

1335
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,960
Wasn't the pillow completely covered in blood?

1336
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,000
Whose blood was that?

1337
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,000
And those hands begging for help...

1338
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,600
Those hands were also in the abandoned ventilation shaft.

1339
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,280
That place...

1340
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,080
Was it Ruisi Bai?

1341
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,760
She tied up many monsters there.

1342
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,240
The monsters' blood and all this...

1343
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,960
Everything...

1344
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,120
Was all done by Ruisi Bai.

1345
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,520
This...

1346
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,320
What's it called?

1347
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,200
The Seven Urban Legends.

1348
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,800
Right.

1349
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,200
All done by Ruisi Bai.

1350
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,560
She's a female demon.

1351
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,440
What we know is...

1352
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,920
Only Ruisi Bai knows about that space.

1353
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,600
And she said...

1354
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,760
What was written there was...

1355
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,000
Everyone else was terrified.

1356
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,680
Today, what was written on the door was...

1357
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,720
No one would ever find the key.

1358
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,520
Because they were all too scared to come here.

1359
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,520
Right.

1360
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,120
Because the Seven Urban Legends warned against it.

1361
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,400
Did you get your pencil back then?

1362
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,680
I got it last night.

1363
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,240
We all got ours.

1364
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,440
So it was the three of you

1365
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,080
who already knew yesterday

1366
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,360
that Ruisi was behind all this.

1367
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,080
Of course.

1368
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,160
But one thing's strange.

1369
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,880
None of us felt

1370
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,840
our curses would recur.

1371
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,640
Only you thought yours would return.

1372
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,920
You even took precautions

1373
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,400
by getting handcuffs.

1374
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,920
No, his would recur too.

1375
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,840
He didn't think his would return.

1376
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,480
Repeatedly.

1377
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,760
Recurring episodes.

1378
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,440
Exactly.

1379
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,440
As for murder motives, you all had them.

1380
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,800
The three of us are cursed.

1381
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,160
Must we kill her?

1382
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,840
You want to break this curse.

1383
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,920
I want to break it.

1384
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,000
Do I have to wait for her to tell me...

1385
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,160
...before I kill her?

1386
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,240
Does she have to die to break it?

1387
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,880
Possibly.

1388
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,240
The three of you

1389
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,120
All want to break the curse

1390
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,320
This also provides a motive

1391
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,360
On the night of June 3rd

1392
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,400
At 11:30 PM

1393
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Sisi told me

1394
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,720
She asked me to give her

1395
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,800
A personal item of mine

1396
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,520
She needed it urgently

1397
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,800
Then she said to me

1398
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,160
"Give me one of your personal items"

1399
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,680
"I need it urgently"

1400
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,120
You also asked for personal items

1401
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,720
No

1402
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,920
Was there a note that wrote this?

1403
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,360
It's currently

1404
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,440
It's almost 3 AM on June 4th now

1405
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,040
During the entire night study room opening hours

1406
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,840
I was in my secret space

1407
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,240
That is, before 3 o'clock

1408
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,480
She didn't leave

1409
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,680
Never left before 3 o'clock

1410
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,960
That secret space of hers

1411
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,480
How do you know

1412
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,800
it was Sisi who cursed it

1413
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,880
Because she asked for your personal belongings

1414
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,400
Right

1415
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,360
But how can you prove

1416
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,600
that she was the one who attached it

1417
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,720
and placed it in the shrine

1418
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,720
Someone hacked Sisi's QQ account

1419
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,800
and privately contacted us

1420
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,280
We only

1421
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,440
left our personal belongings

1422
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,520
at her dormitory door

1423
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,200
We didn’t hand them to her directly

1424
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,960
Exactly

1425
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,280
Did you see it with your own eyes

1426
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,840
You're the only one not cursed

1427
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,040
You're the one who's still sane

1428
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,360
What time did you see

1429
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,920
the letter from your ex-girlfriend

1430
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,600
at your doorstep?

1431
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,360
Last night at 10 PM

1432
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,040
If there's anyone directly connected to her

1433
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,920
it's only him

1434
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,880
This letter was from yesterday

1435
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,160
After we got news of Xiao Ai singing

1436
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,240
and her jumping off the building

1437
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,760
that's when I received it

1438
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,080
I know Sisi bullied Xiao Ai

1439
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,880
I know Xiao Ai

1440
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,880
was my childhood friend

1441
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,040
All of this happened last night

1442
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,360
That night

1443
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,240
We went to see Rui Sisi

1444
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,000
Or perhaps scolded Rui Sisi

1445
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,040
None of us were sober

1446
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,160
Only he was clear-headed

1447
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:25,800
Right

1448
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,760
And his motive

1449
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,880
Would be stronger than yours

1450
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,280
He could have taken that note

1451
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,600
X, say something

1452
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,000
Say something, X

1453
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
What do you think happened?

1454
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,320
Between them

1455
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,680
I don't think there's much to say

1456
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,960
I'll vote

1457
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,320
I already have someone in mind to vote for

1458
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,800
You guys speak first

1459
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,120
That's enough

1460
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,280
You've held on long enough

1461
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,440
He's the only one

1462
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,520
Who didn't need a curse

1463
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,080
Yet wanted to kill her

1464
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,560
You'd face no risk killing her

1465
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,760
Right

1466
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,520
We don't need to kill her today

1467
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,760
I'm not protecting them

1468
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,440
I'm just saying

1469
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,920
I don't need to kill her today

1470
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,760
Another logical point is

1471
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,440
What?

1472
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,160
And the logic is...

1473
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,040
The method used in that case earlier...

1474
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,640
I think it was...

1475
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,720
an extremely difficult technique.

1476
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,200
His reaction speed...

1477
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,680
Within just a few minutes...

1478
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,440
something...

1479
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,720
A sudden inspiration struck.

1480
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,320
I think that earlier...

1481
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,120
the method of hiding behind the wall...

1482
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,560
Because in such a short time...

1483
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,400
I first thought about the knife...

1484
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,120
might have been broken beforehand.

1485
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,840
But he quickly...

1486
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,880
figured out all of Xiao Huang's movements...

1487
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,760
and pieced them together.

1488
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,920
After the killer placed the body inside...

1489
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,600
he wanted to create a locked room...

1490
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,960
by sealing it with tape.

1491
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,560
So he must have created this locked room...

1492
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,440
He absolutely...

1493
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,360
had to break this tape...

1494
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:46,920
to break it...

1495
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,800
first.

1496
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,360
Then sent a message saying...

1497
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,560
"Xiao Huang, go check the second floor immediately."

1498
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,480
When he closed the door...

1499
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,800
the killer was hiding here.

1500
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,440
When Xiao Huang came to push the door...

1501
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,120
he was actually already inside.

1502
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:58,960
So he didn't come out.

1503
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,760
When Xiao Huang went to get the knife...

1504
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,720
he immediately came out...

1505
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,360
and hid here again.

1506
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,400
When Xiao Huang was getting the knife...

1507
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,160
he thought the door couldn't be opened.

1508
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,280
If you're not the killer...

1509
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,600
then it just shows you're very clever.

1510
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,240
You're playing amazingly well

1511
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,960
If you put it that way

1512
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,200
I don't know whether to be happy

1513
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,440
or sad about it

1514
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,440
Then why would he say it himself?

1515
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,880
Isn't that strange?

1516
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,920
Right, why would he admit it himself?

1517
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,440
He's trying to prove himself

1518
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,920
See, you've clearly never played as the killer

1519
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,520
That makes sense too

1520
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,000
When I explained the method

1521
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,680
We both demonstrated it

1522
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,000
at the same time and place

1523
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,680
Yes

1524
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,600
I did come up with this idea

1525
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,080
But you suddenly

1526
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,880
abandoned your previous theory

1527
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,920
and agreed with mine

1528
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,840
and even demonstrated it

1529
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,760
simultaneously with me

1530
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,680
I think his point makes sense

1531
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,400
I think this method

1532
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,000
is completely plausible

1533
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,000
Why did you immediately

1534
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,920
accept that I was right?

1535
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,960
Are you using some clever

1536
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,920
killer strategy?

1537
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,840
It's like you immediately

1538
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,680
understood my thinking

1539
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,360
I confirmed your theory was right

1540
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,880
to cover up being the killer

1541
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,800
If you're playing like this

1542
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,840
then I'm sure it's you

1543
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,400
At first I wasn't sure about you

1544
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,200
That's why I asked

1545
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,680
But you immediately accused me

1546
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,720
So it must be you

1547
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,520
Alright

1548
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,040
Speaking of which,

1549
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,520
If we end up accusing each other,

1550
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,680
that would be awkward.

1551
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:16,640
I'll take it.

1552
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,880
Fine.

1553
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,680
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

1554
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,640
Today was really enjoyable.

1555
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,320
Today's session was brilliant.

1556
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,440
Do you have any leanings?

1557
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,920
I think what you just said

1558
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,400
might not necessarily be accurate.

1559
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,280
Because it's too obvious.

1560
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,080
What makes it obvious?

1561
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,560
You're taking the blame for him.

1562
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,760
You tell me what makes it obvious.

1563
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,760
Right.

1564
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,640
And X today...

1565
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,360
Yes.

1566
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,600
The silent X.

1567
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,280
No, what I mean is

1568
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,240
it might not be him.

1569
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,520
Because he's too obvious.

1570
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,280
No, then why completely

1571
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,240
rule him out?

1572
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,600
You're being mean.

1573
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,560
You're even dragging me into this.

1574
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,680
There's no personal grudge.

1575
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,760
You're pulling me down.

1576
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,040
No, you're even dragging me in.

1577
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,240
You've already brought one person in.

1578
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,000
Now you're pulling me in too.

1579
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,320
I didn't bring him in.

1580
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,560
I'm saying it can't be him.

1581
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,360
I didn't involve him.

1582
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,080
I'm talking about this situation.

1583
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,040
Why do you say it can't be him?

1584
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,360
He thinks you're being mean.

1585
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,560
No.

1586
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,680
What I mean is,

1587
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,560
why couldn't it be you?

1588
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,600
Because the night before,

1589
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,720
he had already been to the laundry room.

1590
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,760
Who? Who went to the laundry room?

1591
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,120
You went to the laundry room.

1592
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,200
When you were injured,

1593
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,520
you still went immediately.

1594
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,200
Out of everyone,

1595
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,760
you were in the most pain.

1596
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,080
Now they think you're my X.

1597
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:39,880
Let's go

1598
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,600
Vote first

1599
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,120
Vote first

1600
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,160
Then who do you think it is?

1601
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,200
Who do you think it is?

1602
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,120
It must be him

1603
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,800
Don't even think about it

1604
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,960
It's not him

1605
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,120
Just listen to him

1606
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,240
Definitely not him

1607
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,040
She's X

1608
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,760
You're his (Ke Daole)'s X

1609
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,400
I haven't even spoken up for Ke Daole

1610
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,880
about anything

1611
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,200
She keeps saying you're suspicious

1612
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,160
Keeps saying he's suspicious

1613
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,560
But never mentions him (Ke Daole)

1614
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,560
Then when someone says he's suspicious

1615
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,440
she starts protecting him

1616
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,080
Who are you talking about? Her?

1617
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,320
I don't think so

1618
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,400
Good heavens

1619
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,240
All four of you are suspicious

1620
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:10,840
You know what?

1621
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,480
Saying everyone's suspicious at this point

1622
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,680
is suspicious itself

1623
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,200
Too late

1624
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,000
In this case,

1625
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,520
I'm voting for

1626
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,360
He

1627
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,160
because firstly, I believe

1628
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,520
among all four of us suspects,

1629
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,360
he had the strongest motive.

1630
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,040
Another point is

1631
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,720
when I considered this might be

1632
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,960
a fake locked-room scenario,

1633
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,720
he immediately came up with

1634
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,600
the murder method

1635
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,360
and then

1636
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,320
refined my theory.

1637
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,960
Because I think either

1638
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,280
he's too clever,

1639
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,800
or

1640
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,320
he actually knew

1641
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,080
the real murder method.

1642
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:57,840
Therefore,

1643
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,240
I am Ke Daole

1644
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,800
Today, my prime suspect is

1645
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,920
He Dinghong

1646
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,320
The reason for choosing him

1647
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,880
is quite straightforward

1648
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,040
It's simply because

1649
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,600
in the end, we could only identify

1650
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,720
the most compelling

1651
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,000
direct motive for murder

1652
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,240
on him.

1653
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,680
I think today's real culprit is

1654
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,200
Ning Hao

1655
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,960
It's actually not that clear-cut

1656
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,040
Among the three people in my view

1657
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,440
they're all actually

1658
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,640
trying to lift the curse

1659
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,720
I'm really torn

1660
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,560
between Ning Hao and Ke Daole

1661
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,800
but I'll still choose Ning Hao

1662
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,520
Ning Hao suffers the most intense pain

1663
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,880
First because he

1664
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,880
has recurring episodes

1665
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,320
Second

1666
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,200
his whole body bleeds with knife-like wounds

1667
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,280
This

1668
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,600
feels like it would be

1669
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,560
the most agonizing kind

1670
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,720
Therefore

1671
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,400
I feel his murder motive

1672
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,600
would be stronger

1673
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,480
But if it's really

1674
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,840
the Canary

1675
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,720
then this episode gets interesting

1676
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,040
I voted for

1677
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,200
No particular reason

1678
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,280
I just wanted to vote for them

1679
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,760
I am the canary

1680
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,840
This is my vote

1681
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,280
Today's prime suspect

1682
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,120
I chose

1683
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,920
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Case 6

1684
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,680
Tui Town 2004

1685
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,080
"Tui Arts Horror: The Midnight Curse"

1686
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,320
Comes to an end

1687
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,680
Everyone has completed voting

1688
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,480
The suspect this time is

1689
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:20,880
What a mess

1690
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,280
The most innocent me

1691
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,480
Canary

1692
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,400
Innocence

1693
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,480
Among the other three players

1694
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,680
Who has more votes?

1695
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,400
You voted for me, right?

1696
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,200
I don't know

1697
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,320
You'll find out soon

1698
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,880
Next, I announce that one player

1699
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,320
has received 3 votes

1700
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,920
It's not me, is it?

1701
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,720
It is you

1702
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,960
It's him

1703
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,800
Hello.

1704
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,600
The smile instantly vanished.

1705
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,760
The corners of your mouth dropped.

1706
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,080
Stop pretending.

1707
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,400
Did everyone succeed in identifying the culprit?

1708
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,440
Stand up

1709
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,120
Clap

1710
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,640
The killer and X voted for me

1711
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,280
That's two votes

1712
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:27,800
There's one more person

1713
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,760
Hutu voted for me

1714
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,800
Everyone, lock onto the suspect

1715
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,160
Failure

1716
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,720
The real culprit in this case is

1717
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,480
Canary

1718
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,640
The true culprit of this case, please step forward to the X mark.

1719
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,800
Brother

1720
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,720
The two of us were

1721
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,760
reconstructing the case when

1722
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,240
those two stopped us.

1723
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,680
Why wouldn't the killer let him open it himself?

1724
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,120
The killer wanted to open it for him.

1725
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,000
A locked-room murder.

1726
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,120
Creating a locked-room scenario.

1727
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,000
She actually makes a good point, really.

1728
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,840
Why?

1729
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,520
He could have cut it open himself.

1730
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,120
He could have done it himself.

1731
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,400
It's the same as someone else doing it.

1732
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:09,880
Right.

1733
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,520
Xiao Huang could see him too.

1734
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,280
Ladies and gentlemen of the Black and White Swan

1735
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,720
What are you doing?

1736
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,480
What are you all doing?

1737
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,360
What are you all up to?

1738
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,600
Who voted for me?

1739
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:29,960
You.

1740
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,720
Me.

1741
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,040
Who did you vote for?

1742
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,360
I voted for He.

1743
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,560
Who did you vote for?

1744
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,440
I voted for him.

1745
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,120
Why did you vote for me?

1746
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,160
Then she must be X.

1747
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:46,800
Because I'm not X.

1748
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,280
Is she X?

1749
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,480
Then she kept talking beside me.

1750
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,760
Kept saying he's suspicious.

1751
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,200
Then it's just between you two.

1752
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:51,880
Between the two of you.

1753
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,200
I think you're more suspicious.

1754
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,240
Brilliant.

1755
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,680
You're amazing.

1756
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:58,960
So today,

1757
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,600
she later turned against me.

1758
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,680
I think she's acting very strange today.

1759
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,520
Isn't it normal for Ba Zimei to mess with you?

1760
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,200
No.

1761
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,600
In the end, she was screaming.

1762
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,560
Just to accuse me.

1763
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,560
Made this whole situation even messier.

1764
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,320
This is exactly what X does.

1765
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,040
They must create chaos in this game.

1766
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,760
She's very clever.

1767
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,280
Followed my lead to target you.

1768
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:13,880
Went along with me to pressure you.

1769
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,000
Then protected you.

1770
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,240
Then made him completely believe.

1771
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
That you're the target.

1772
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,400
She argued with you.

1773
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,000
To make you think.

1774
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,880
She was arguing for He Dinghong's sake.

1775
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,480
Yes, exactly.

1776
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:38,960
Who told her?

1777
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,320
Bite Ning Hao to death

1778
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,520
Making Brother Bai Yu lose a precious lock

1779
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,520
Making him fall from grace

1780
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,640
Dream shattered push 2

1781
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,560
Making him fall from grace

1782
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,000
All of you had motives to kill

1783
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,360
The three of us were cursed

1784
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,720
Does that necessarily mean we wanted to kill her?

1785
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,400
You want to break this curse

1786
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,480
I want to break it

1787
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,560
Do I have to wait for her to tell me

1788
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,720
Before I can kill her?

1789
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,360
Does she have to die to break it?

1790
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,000
Possibly

1791
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,800
What time did you see

1792
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,360
The letter from your ex-girlfriend

1793
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,040
At your doorstep?

1794
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:14,800
Last night at 10 PM

1795
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,480
If there's any direct connection to her

1796
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,360
It can only be him

1797
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,160
None of us were sober

1798
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,280
Only he was sober

1799
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:22,920
Right

1800
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,880
And his motive

1801
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,000
Would be stronger than yours

1802
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,560
That's enough

1803
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,720
You've held on long enough

1804
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,920
He's the only one

1805
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,000
Who didn't need the curse

1806
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,560
Yet still wanted to kill her

1807
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,040
You could kill her without risk

1808
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,240
Right.

1809
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,840
Aren't you also particularly clever

1810
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,800
with this "killer" strategy

1811
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,720
where it seems he can immediately

1812
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,560
understand my thoughts

1813
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,240
so I confirm your theory is correct

1814
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,520
while hiding that I'm the killer

1815
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,680
If you play it this way

1816
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,720
then I'm sure it's you

1817
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,280
Him saying it himself

1818
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,720
isn't that strange?

1819
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,760
Right, why would he say it himself?

1820
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,080
Too obvious, right?

1821
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:55,880
What's obvious about it?

1822
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,360
You're taking the blame for him

1823
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,560
You tell me what's obvious

1824
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,560
Right.

1825
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,440
And X today

1826
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,160
Yes

1827
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,400
The silent X

1828
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,120
No, then why completely

1829
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,080
rule him out?

1830
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,440
You went to the laundry room

1831
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,680
When you were injured

1832
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,880
you immediately went there

1833
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,600
Out of everyone

1834
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,000
you were in the most pain

1835
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,760
Wait, now you're dragging me into this?

1836
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,960
You've already implicated one person

1837
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,720
Now you're pulling me in too

1838
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,040
I didn't implicate him

1839
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,280
I'm saying he couldn't have

1840
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,080
I didn't accuse him

1841
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,920
They now think you're my X

1842
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,280
Next, we announce

1843
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,640
the critical evidence everyone overlooked

1844
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,440
The weapon used by the killer

1845
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,920
was a knife that cut through the tape.

1846
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,320
While Xiao Huang went to the store to fetch a knife,

1847
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,040
the killer left the courtyard,

1848
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,680
passed through the laundry room, and returned to the auditorium.

1849
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,320
The knife was hidden along the way—

1850
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,600
in the corner of a chair in the laundry room.

1851
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,040
Traces of tea leaves,

1852
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,600
often consumed by Canary, were found in the knife's crevices.

1853
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,160
Next, we present the Golden Key

1854
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,480
Golden Key

1855
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,400
There's something I want to say

1856
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:20,960
Our grudges between us

1857
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,160
Can we use this key

1858
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,720
to wipe the slate clean? Okay?

1859
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,400
Okay

1860
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,080
Thank you

1861
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,960
You were amazing today

1862
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,920
Absolutely incredible

1863
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,400
I'm completely speechless

1864
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,280
Speechless

1865
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,120
Now I need to go to

1866
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,440
Ruisi Bai's room

1867
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,400
to check some other things

1868
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,680
So I'll take my leave now

1869
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:47,400
Alright?

1870
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:47,640
Okay

1871
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,280
Alright

1872
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,640
Bye

1873
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,160
Bye

1874
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:51,880
Bye

1875
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,480
How are you doing, Brother Bai Yu?

1876
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,800
How have you been feeling these past two episodes?

1877
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,320
Really great

1878
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,560
Does my presence make you unhappy?

1879
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,800
I'm so happy

1880
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,680
You're really my jinx, Bai Yu

1881
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,320
Completely jinxed me

1882
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:04,880
Totally jinxed

1883
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,200
Two episodes

1884
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,080
Jinxed for two episodes

1885
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,280
Come on

1886
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,360
The four of us guys

1887
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,200
No

1888
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,360
Do you know your biggest problem?

1889
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:13,840
What is it?

1890
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,120
Everyone's energy today

1891
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,800
was too intense

1892
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,400
I could barely get a word in

1893
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:19,960
I want to ask

1894
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,960
how you managed to get that person

1895
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,920
dragged up there

1896
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,800
I tied her to the feet

1897
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,320
Electric

1898
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,240
With the remote he mentioned

1899
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,560
How did you move her with all that blood?

1900
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,000
I wrapped her in plastic sheeting

1901
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,280
It doesn't matter anymore

1902
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:39,680
What's important is

1903
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,040
The four of us men have met our Waterloo

1904
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,560
What's important is we're ruined

1905
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,760
We just argued way too fiercely

1906
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,400
You know what?

1907
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,360
Look, when we were arguing

1908
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,840
She was probably laughing her head off inside

1909
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,120
"What are these idiots even fighting about?"

1910
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,640
Did you really come up with this method?

1911
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,440
Using this method, right?

1912
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,160
Yes, I thought of it.

1913
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:01,800
That's impressive.

1914
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,640
That's really impressive.

1915
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,600
How did you suddenly become so smart?

1916
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:04,840
Right.

1917
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,680
Because I was thinking

1918
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,560
how this thing could

1919
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,280
during that middle phase

1920
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,600
have her block this door.

1921
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,720
I thought about it for a long time but couldn't figure it out.

1922
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,280
But you

1923
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,400
suddenly thought of it.

1924
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,680
And the only feasible way

1925
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,800
is what he suggested.

1926
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,680
Yes, he's so smart.

1927
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,040
Because I thought about the surveillance

1928
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,000
and remembered yesterday

1929
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,400
there were blind spots in the surveillance.

1930
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,560
Could we hide there?

1931
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,880
Then I simulated it,

1932
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,000
and it actually works.

1933
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,360
The main thing is Huang couldn't push it open no matter what.

1934
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,840
Were you holding it that firmly?

1935
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,440
Strong as an ox.

1936
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,040
Okay.

1937
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,320
Actually, there are still

1938
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,160
five of the seven strange tales that have come true.

1939
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,680
There are two left.

1940
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,720
The first one is

1941
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,280
Don't forget to close the dorm door.

1942
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,880
Be careful of someone under the bed lying back-to-back with you.

1943
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,120
And the other one is what?

1944
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,880
Don't take the library elevator.

1945
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,960
Be careful of going to non-existent floors.

1946
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,960
That's terrifying.

1947
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,520
These are the two that haven't come true yet.

1948
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:58,720
There's one more

1949
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,600
This box to this day

1950
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,720
we haven't opened it

1951
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,280
So this must be

1952
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,680
something we need to uncover the truth

1953
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,120
The key to opening this

1954
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:05,400
is

1955
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,600
Also in Sisi's secret space

1956
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,560
Someone struggled here

1957
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,120
They fought before dying

1958
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,720
This place is full of

1959
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,800
So many inside

1960
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,440
Former classmates who were bullied

1961
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,920
Turned into monsters inside

1962
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,520
And her room was covered in blood

1963
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,040
And there's Xiaorou and Xiaowei

1964
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,720
Xiaorou and Xiaowei

1965
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,600
Why did they swap personalities?

1966
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,280
Keep it up

1967
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,360
She likes you

1968
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,240
Xiaowei rolls her eyes at me

1969
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,920
Xiaorou stammers when she sees me

1970
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:42,680
This is the third one

1971
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,360
The fourth one is

1972
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,120
Who taught you the murder method?

1973
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,000
Yesterday's piano room

1974
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,040
When you went to the crime scene

1975
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,960
Weren't you looking at that piano?

1976
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,280
Was it really moving by itself?

1977
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,120
Yesterday's mechanism

1978
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,320
Actually, I set it up

1979
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,480
But when I set the timer

1980
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,880
I set it to activate in the afternoon

1981
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,880
The one we all saw was the activation

1982
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,120
That was your timer?

1983
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,320
Yes

1984
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,760
When we first entered,

1985
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,520
the piano was playing by itself.

1986
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,200
How could it play on its own?

1987
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,280
We really don't know.

1988
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,240
I believe there is

1989
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,040
something bigger behind this

1990
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,520
Someone is plotting a greater conspiracy

1991
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,040
A major villain

1992
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,400
And this

1993
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,880
Right now, it's June 4th

1994
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,600
3 AM already

1995
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,800
This Sisi said

1996
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,240
She must find a chance to reveal the truth

1997
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,040
Then what is this truth?

1998
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,560
Because the truth died

1999
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,400
This truth must be related to

2000
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,040
the one who gave you the method

2001
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,560
And our curse

2002
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,560
Who exactly cast it?

2003
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,920
The curse is real

2004
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,560
I don’t think Sisi cast it

2005
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,040
There must be someone

2006
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,520
watching us in the shadows

2007
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,640
Someone is observing us secretly

2008
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,880
manipulating everything

2009
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,480
Classmates,

2010
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,200
It is now 8 PM on June 4th.

2011
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,880
Those who have registered to attend

2012
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,800
the Mysterious Art Exhibition of Tuiyi,

2013
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,360
please arrive at the library promptly at 12 AM

2014
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,920
to participate in the event.

2015
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,200
Let's go visit the library.

2016
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,720
Today, let's talk about

2017
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,840
the causes of school bullying

2018
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,360
and issues of prevention and correction.

2019
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,960
The reasons for being bullied at school can be bizarre—

2020
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,440
maybe because you're short or overweight,

2021
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,520
wear braces,

2022
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,600
are quiet,

2023
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,920
or even just because you glanced at them.

2024
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,640
Bullying takes many forms—

2025
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,400
most commonly verbal abuse,

2026
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,840
false accusations of theft,

2027
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,720
or exposing your privacy.

2028
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,960
Everything you say or do is deemed wrong.

2029
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,960
Everyone burst into laughter together

2030
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,880
None of them considered themselves the culprit

2031
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,720
Each person added a small piece of firewood

2032
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,200
And so the house burned down

2033
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,920
The legal concept corresponding to school bullying

2034
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,520
is called student harassment

2035
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,680
According to the "Law on the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency"

2036
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,360
Preventing juvenile delinquency

2037
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,760
should be carried out under the organization of governments at all levels

2038
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,440
through comprehensive management

2039
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,400
For example

2040
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,240
First, at the prevention level

2041
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,000
Schools should establish

2042
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,840
a student harassment prevention and control system

2043
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,800
and provide education and training

2044
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,840
on preventing student harassment to faculty and students

2045
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,920
Schools should employ full-time

2046
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,240
or part-time mental health education teachers

2047
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,160
to conduct mental health education

2048
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,680
Schools should strengthen daily safety management

2049
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,800
Improve the detection of student bullying

2050
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,520
and refine the handling procedures

2051
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,960
Conduct strict inspections and promptly eliminate

2052
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,320
potential factors that may lead to

2053
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,440
student bullying incidents

2054
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,000
Second,

2055
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,640
Regarding intervention for misconduct,

2056
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,960
schools must immediately stop

2057
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,680
any acts of student bullying,

2058
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,040
notify the guardians of both the bullies

2059
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,160
and the bullied underage students,

2060
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,200
and involve them in identifying and addressing the bullying.

2061
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,760
Provide necessary family education guidance to them.

2062
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,960
For severe bullying cases,

2063
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,400
schools must not conceal them

2064
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,200
but should promptly report to public security authorities

2065
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,040
and educational administrative departments,

2066
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,680
and cooperate with relevant departments in legal handling.

2067
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,680
According to China's Criminal Law,

2068
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,800
individuals aged 16 or older

2069
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,520
shall bear criminal responsibility.

2070
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,640
Those aged 14 or older

2071
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,920
but under 16

2072
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,800
who commit serious crimes like intentional homicide

2073
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,240
shall also bear criminal responsibility.

2074
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,440
The 2020 Criminal Law Amendment XI

2075
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,720
further stipulates

2076
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,160
that individuals aged 12 or older

2077
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,320
but under 14

2078
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,960
may bear criminal responsibility

2079
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,400
under specific conditions.

2080
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,240
These include committing intentional homicide

2081
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,440
or intentional injury,

2082
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,840
resulting in death

2083
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,760
or causing severe disability through

2084
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,600
exceptionally cruel means,

2085
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,040
with particularly heinous circumstances.

2086
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,920
Procedurally, approval from the Supreme People's Procuratorate

2087
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:17,840
is required for prosecution.

2088
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,920
The 2004 Tuiyi Basketball Friendship Match

2089
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,400
is about to begin.

2090
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,640
Nice shot!

2091
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,880
Oh no!

2092
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,840
Xiao Ba is in trouble!

2093
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,040
What?

2094
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,680
Don't take the library elevator.

2095
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,880
Detected six people in the elevator.

2096
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,920
Now overloaded.

2097
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,320
There's someone else in the elevator besides us.

2098
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,720
Those who spread malicious rumors.

2099
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,840
Those who manipulate others with connections.

2100
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,560
Those who isolate others.

2101
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,000
Last wishes turned into curses.

2102
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,600
Welcome everyone.

2103
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,960
To the Mystical Art Exhibition.

2104
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,680
It's basically forming a locked room.

2105
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,520
He wants to...

2106
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,560
during the ritual...

2107
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,440
kill that person.

2108
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,280
At 10:25 you developed murderous intent.

2109
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,800
Which means you...

2110
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,960
killed two people yesterday.

2111
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:09,680
Let me tell you...

2112
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,520
I'll kill both of you eventually.

2113
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,240
We can create an impossible murder.

2114
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,040
She was bullied as a child.

2115
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,760
No one cared about her.

2116
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,640
This is the real exhibition hall

2117
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,080
Staff operation area

2118
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,760
This is a cheating room

2119
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,120
Another double murderer case?

2120
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,560
You're just a tool.
