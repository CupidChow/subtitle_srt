1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,520
This song again

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,240
Scared to "death"

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,920
I feel like today's recording session

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
It won't be as scary as last time.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,840
This episode

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,520
Not necessarily.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,400
Really?

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
Not necessarily.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,280
It's upgraded.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,120
Because in the past few episodes, we weren’t really scared.

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,520
It might escalate.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm speechless.

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,280
Let's farm together

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,840
You actually guessed it right

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,080
Since you didn’t participate, you’re speaking boldly now, huh?

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,960
They even showed your live broadcast footage.

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,880
It’s all because of your livestream.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,960
This identity is self-given

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
This "deadly" angle

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,040
We're all the same

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
Don't overthink it

22
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,880
A piece of cake

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
Having just a head is too scary

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,480
My clothes have merged into one

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,040
Right

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
Why is there still a flashlight?

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,160
Yes, everyone has one.

28
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,240
A light.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,120
Seems like there is.

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,040
A light.

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,320
You haven't used it, right?

32
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,040
I have.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,840
When you're away from home, your identity is what you make of it.

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm sorry

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,920
Suspenseful stories usually happen at night.

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,760
These high heels are even scarier—I find this sound unsettling.

37
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
Look, I'm holding the door handle

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm afraid someone might open it

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,920
"You're such a chuunibyou"

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,840
So full of energy

41
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
What's going on here?

42
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,360
Shooting for a magazine.

43
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
Do you have these?

44
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,880
Yes

45
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,480
"Liu" half-step

46
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,080
How long did you record that day?

47
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,160
Mine was quite long.

48
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,640
I just felt a bit embarrassed.

49
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,920
There were real tears

50
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,280
It was real

51
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,240
I was really torn at that time

52
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,520
I didn't want to delay the recording

53
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
But I was genuinely scared

54
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
I thought I shouldn't hold up the people behind me

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,200
Why is it so dark?

56
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,800
It was really dark that night.

57
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,520
Truly dark.

58
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Without that flashlight in your hand,

59
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,080
you can't see anything.

60
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,640
Absolutely nothing is visible.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,480
Extremely dark.

62
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,360
So scary.

63
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,880
This is quite scary

64
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
This is really frightening

65
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,840
This is pretty terrifying

66
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,760
The expression is really...

67
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,280
He's about to break

68
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,600
He's going to shatter

69
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,880
You are

70
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
Kneeled down

71
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,200
The staff felt so accomplished it scared you

72
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,280
You...

73
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,520
I remember there was a scary one right behind me

74
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,000
There's one in the bushes

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
There's one in the grass

76
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,040
There's another one behind us

77
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,440
It's in that garden

78
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,920
Right

79
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,960
So happy

80
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,040
Truly "perverted"

81
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,680
So fierce

82
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,520
Lift its skirt

83
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,880
Too "bold"

84
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,920
Even the town mayor would be scared by you

85
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,680
Didn't you see that opera performer?

86
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,480
I saw them

87
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,040
You went looking for them

88
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,040
It didn't scare him at all

89
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,120
Not scared at all

90
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,400
He got scared

91
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
That left people speechless

92
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,320
No

93
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Kick you out

94
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,720
He said do it again

95
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,880
I thought there was a clue

96
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,440
I just waited for him to sing, you know

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,280
The music is completely different.

98
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
You'll be scared later then

99
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,240
I got scared by the chicken

100
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,600
Me too

101
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
I was also the one who caught the chicken

102
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,080
Just the chicken

103
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,120
The rest were fine

104
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,800
The one who caught the chicken

105
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
Why did the lights go out?

106
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,160
Can't see.

107
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,040
You turned them off yourself.

108
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,880
The brighter the light, the less you can see, right?

109
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
Right.

110
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,400
From the "death" angle, it held up.

111
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,720
Held up.

112
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
What is this?

113
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,160
You kicked and damaged the props.

114
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,480
But missed.

115
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,640
So silent

116
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,080
So terrifying

117
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
It might suddenly make noise

118
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,720
If there were sounds, I wouldn't even think of going in.

119
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,920
You guys actually went in—that's really bold.

120
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Very reasonable

121
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,840
Block it a bit

122
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,760
It pecks people

123
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Would you like to try Xinjiang-style big plate chicken?

124
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,040
Why are you laughing? What's so funny?

125
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,840
I was terrified.

126
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,200
So when people reach peak fear, they start laughing, huh?

127
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,800
That's what it means?

128
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,320
Yeah.

129
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,200
Here.

130
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,040
You picked it up

131
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,920
Bai Yu isn't like you

132
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,120
You didn't even touch the melon seeds and peanuts on the table

133
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,920
You were scared stiff too, right?

134
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,240
Right

135
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,080
Admit it

136
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,720
Yes

137
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,560
I took the mayor's lamp

138
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,760
Take two lamps

139
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,560
What are you doing?

140
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
You're so polite.

141
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,280
Don't do this—what are you up to?

142
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,440
You're holding hands with it.

143
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,480
You’ve got some nerve.

144
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,160
How lonely you must be.

145
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
Let me check the maze first.

146
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Start point, end point.

147
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,800
2024

148
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Did anyone solve its...

149
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,920
Did you realize it's a 3D maze?

150
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,720
Fold it up?

151
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah, you figured it out.

152
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,600
1924

153
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,960
You're quite smart

154
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,360
Indeed, a true master

155
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
Of course, my skills speak for themselves

156
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,200
Master

157
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,040
Is this it?

158
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,160
You're smart too, going straight for the back ones

159
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,600
You didn't open them all before finding it, did you?

160
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,520
No way, of course not

161
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,760
Getting cocky

162
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,440
Yes

163
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,880
Even after folding it, it still doesn't work

164
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
You folded it wrong back then, didn't you?

165
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
Listen to the sound inside, right?

166
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,960
You could actually hear that?

167
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,840
This works too?

168
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,640
We really found it!

169
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,920
Even this works?

170
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,320
Just like me

171
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,080
Practicing rap

172
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,160
Memorized all of it

173
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,200
Even the recitation is ready

174
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,880
This is amazing

175
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,040
Don't sing it

176
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,960
You need to remember the melody

177
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,960
Just memorize the lyrics directly

178
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,240
Why are you so disorganized?

179
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,320
Original song

180
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,280
Aren't you the same?

181
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,600
You...

182
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,480
Okay

183
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,000
Go back and listen to it again

184
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,720
You didn't go back again, did you?

185
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,480
Is that true or not?

186
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,600
How many times have we walked this path

187
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,480
It's so hard, I really can't memorize it

188
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,960
Hello "pervert" you

189
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,120
How are you even scarier than the town mayor

190
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,480
Village Head

191
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Where are you going with me?

192
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,360
She's the real "Nightingale of Tuizhen," I'm telling you.

193
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,240
Help me!

194
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,560
Guess what it is

195
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,480
What was it back then

196
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,880
I've completely forgotten

197
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,320
I forgot too

198
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,720
Half-believing, half-doubting

199
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,600
Right

200
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,560
Yes, that's it

201
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,720
It's "half-believing, half-doubting"

202
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,200
Following the crowd

203
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,080
No

204
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,880
What's next to the single person radical?

205
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,760
You got half of it right

206
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,800
Almost guessed it

207
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,000
It's "belief" and "doubt," right?

208
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Half believing, half doubting

209
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,320
Looks good

210
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,600
Love watching, want more

211
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
Love watching but don't scare me too much

212
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,320
Not necessarily

213
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,200
Also not certain

214
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,960
You should be careful

215
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,640
I'll cling to you for help

216
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Haven't seen enough

217
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,200
Still don't understand how this works

218
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,640
Keep watching a bit longer

219
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,760
Okay

220
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,760
Really good but a bit scary

221
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
Anyway, it's really good

222
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Never thought it would be this embarrassing

223
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,280
I think you're quite amusing

224
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
Dilraba is also quite funny

225
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,480
Tell me

226
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,120
Right

227
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,320
It can turn around quickly

228
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,560
Turn around what?

229
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,040
The character's persona

230
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,800
Character reversal

231
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,480
Yes, me too

232
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
Just play and enjoy

233
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,440
Just have fun with it

234
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
You're really enjoying this

235
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,400
Yeah

236
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,800
Hope everyone can enjoy it too

237
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,400
Right

238
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,480
Actually just the first episode was scary

239
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,360
The rest were okay

240
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,000
Alright
