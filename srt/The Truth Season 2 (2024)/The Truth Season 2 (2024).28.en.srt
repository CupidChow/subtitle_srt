00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,770
Tui Zhen Art Academy

2
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,250
The first day of the annual school festival

3
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,650
Everyone is rehearsing

4
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,970
During the musical performance of "Swan Push Lake"

5
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,730
There was a

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,530
I was right

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,410
inside the cabinet

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,170
In the cabinet

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,530
Zhi Daole was found

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,770
dead inside the sealed prop cabinet

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,650
During the subsequent investigation of the crime scene,

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,010
carotid artery

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,890
Another murder occurred

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,290
piano music

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,250
A deadly melody

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,490
TYP's corpse

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,610
was discovered behind the screen in the music room

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,130
Someone died here

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,730
from poisoning

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,810
After questioning witnesses, it was learned that

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,690
TYP had a conflict with Golden Monkey

22
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,730
TYP pushed Golden Monkey

23
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,650
who fell into a pool of blood and died

24
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,010
So to take revenge,

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,930
you killed TYP

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,570
But the actual victim was Ning Hao

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,810
From that day on,

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,570
we switched identities

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,130
So the one who died was Ning Hao

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:30,770
Yes

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,930
I'm your sister

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,650
As strange sounds came from the laundry room,

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,850
the campus legends continue to come true

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,250
What other secrets

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,530
is the school hiding?

36
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,330
Got it

37
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:05,410
What the heck

38
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,050
Bai Yangzuo, you're so powerful.

39
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,450
Come out.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,770
Missed it

41
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,650
That hurts

42
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,650
Who's talking?

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,170
It hurts

44
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,050
It hurts

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,050
Why so many wounds?

46
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,570
So much blood

47
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,490
Where is he?

48
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,250
This campus urban legend

49
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,050
There's a monster in the laundry room

50
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,730
Don’t linger in the laundry room

51
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,370
Beware of the hideous-looking freak

52
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,130
Alright

53
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,650
You saved me, Ba

54
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,650
What is this?

55
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,450
Just now on his body

56
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,570
It hurts so much, thrown like that

57
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,890
Take it off

58
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,570
Classmate Jiang

59
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,370
I want to file a complaint

60
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,290
The washing machine at the far right of the second row

61
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,370
Every time I finish washing, there are dirty footprints

62
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,970
Far right of the second row

63
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,810
The far right of the second row is

64
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,730
What is this?

65
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,610
Secret passage

66
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,410
How to open

67
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,330
Finish watching first then go

68
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,050
Watch first then go

69
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,650
Come back

70
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,410
The code on that washing machine is really strange

71
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,330
I tried to decipher it

72
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,170
Unexpectedly

73
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,130
I think I've discovered something

74
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,210
But I'm afraid to look

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,210
Code

76
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,690
0101

77
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,130
Xu Duocheng said,

78
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,530
I've also deciphered it.

79
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,810
When rotating,

80
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,010
remember to pause for 2-3 seconds each time.

81
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,930
Rotate.

82
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,610
Can it rotate?

83
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,330
It can rotate.

84
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,890
Which one is 0?

85
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,610
Which one is 1?

86
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,210
Could it be a clock?

87
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,810
This is the washing machine's mode.

88
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,650
Look what's behind this

89
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,450
There is

90
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,530
Binary quick-reference dictionary

91
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,850
It's an English letter, right?

92
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,410
Yes

93
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,250
01010100

94
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,370
Which letter is it?

95
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,730
None?

96
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,250
It must be this one

97
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,490
No need to

98
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,250
Initial letter

99
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,850
No need to think about it

100
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,130
Yes, it has an initial letter

101
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,090
That would mean it's D G J K

102
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,450
Let's fill it in first

103
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,490
Right

104
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,010
We should fill it in first

105
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,130
Who knows how to write in binary?

106
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,930
Do you know?

107
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,810
This is easy

108
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,930
It's just binary

109
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,250
What does binary mean?

110
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,730
It carries over when it reaches 1

111
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,610
There's no 2

112
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,370
Only two digits: 0 and 1

113
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,090
1

114
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,610
10

115
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,810
11

116
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,530
Then comes 100

117
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,450
101

118
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,130
110

119
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,530
Then comes 111

120
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,490
Didn't we attend the same school?

121
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,530
Why didn't I learn this?

122
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,050
I understand now

123
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,810
This is 1010

124
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,090
Here it is

125
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,970
T

126
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,290
T - the first one is T

127
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,930
1011

128
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,490
K

129
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,090
K

130
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,010
100 is

131
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,610
Here

132
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,330
D

133
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,250
111 is G

134
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,690
Confirmed

135
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,290
First T

136
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,490
K

137
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,010
D

138
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,850
G

139
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,250
One two three

140
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,410
It's open

141
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,970

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,290
Quick! Wu Tan City (by Bai Yang)

144
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,890
What is this thing?

145
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,170
What is this place?

146
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,970
These glasses

147
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,930
They look familiar

148
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,330
The high-tech smart assistant from Tweet Empire

149
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,130
Tap them, and the glasses will speak

150
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,810
Wait

151
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,450
What's wrong?

152
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,250
There's a sound

153
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,730
Tweker Empire

154
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,290

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,250
November 2001

157
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,570
Discovered the laundry room secret chamber

158
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,890
Established this secret base

159
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,090
Developed services like paper rewriting

160
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,370
QQ account hacking

161
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,730
The same month

162
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,810
Founded Tui Town Art Academy

163
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,250
Created an encrypted network zone

164
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,490
January 2002

165
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,290
Discovered the master key

166
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,010
Anyone could use this key

167
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,050
To log into Tweker Empire

168
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,730
Expanded with sections like "Little Killer"

169
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,010

To communicate freely

172
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,810
It was essentially

173
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,530
A local area network

174
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,610
An underground network

175
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,290
I have to say this

176
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,650
These sunglasses are really amazing

177
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,970
Truly remarkable

Yes, this is the website.

182
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,330
He just mentioned a key date.

183
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,210
What was the date?

186
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,250
Try 200110.

187
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,450
No

188
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,090
In November, the washing machine secret room was discovered

189
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,690
That would be 200111

190
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,330
200111

191
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,050

That's me

196
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,010
You were classmates with Zidaole

197
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,610
Yes

198
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,610
Did you also have feelings for her?

199
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,730
You didn't like her

200
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,050
Why were you two standing together?

201
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,250
Isn't it that thing?

202
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,050
That curse

203
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,210
The photo might include

204
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,170
someone you don't recognize

205
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,010
Right

206
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,610
Don't stare at classmate group photos

207
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,610
or you might spot an extra classmate

208
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,970
Yes, don't look too closely at group photos

209
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,010
This is the fourth one

210
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,690
11

211
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,530
15

212
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,050
20 21

213
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,770
25

214
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,850
31

215
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,650
There are 30 people in our class

216
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,690
There's 1 extra person

217
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,770
Who's the extra one?

218
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,250
Among our classmates

219
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,490
I only remember three

220
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,290
Xiao Rou, Xiao Wei

221
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,730
and Zidaole

222
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,090
We haven't cracked this password yet, right?

223
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,730
Is the password inside this thing?

224
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,170
But we can't open it.

225
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,090
Up there

226
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,730
Did you check high enough?

227
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,690
No, nothing there

228
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,570
Absolutely nothing

229
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,210
Here

230
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,970
Come on, open the door

231
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,210
Yes

232
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,770
Founders of Tweet Empire commemorative photo

233
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,250
Two people have been erased

234
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,370
There's writing on the back

235
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,770
Xiaonan

236
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,570
I erased myself from the photo

237
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,730
After becoming a monster

238
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,690
I didn't want to face my former self anymore

239
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,250
Xiaoxi

240
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,090
Erase my head too

241
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,930
We founded it with that boy on the far left

242
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,490
We co-founded Tweet Empire together

243
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,970
Why don't I remember him at all?

244
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,290
I don't remember this person either

245
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,250
I only remember

246
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,690
The two of us founded it with Xiaowei

247
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,410
That computer here that won't turn on

248
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,770
Probably belongs to him

249
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,490
We need to say this person's name

250
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,010
Look

251
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,290
Xiaonan

252
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,730
I erased myself from the group photo

253
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,530
After turning into a monster

254
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,650
That earlier one was a monster

255
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,650
That was actually himself, right?

256
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,490
Right

257
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,290
Xiaoxi, erase my head too

258
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,370
I only remember

259
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,570
The two of us founded it with Xiaowei

260
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,930
Xiaowei is next to us

261
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,050
And this one

262
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,890
We founded it with that boy on the far left

263
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,170
We co-founded it together

264
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,130
This person

265
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,890
This one

266
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,730
That computer here that won't turn on

267
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,130
Probably belongs to him

268
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,170
Should we look for it here?

269
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,490
Start from the first one

270
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,130
Xiaonan

271
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,730
Xiaonan

272
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,210
Xiaoxi

273
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,970
Where's Xiaoxi?

274
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,450
Next to Xiaonan is him

275
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,330
Xiaowei is next to us

276
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,450
This person

277
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,250
This boy on the far left

278
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,650
That is Xiaodong

279
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,250
Xiaoxi, Xiaonan, Xiaowei, Xiaodong

280
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,010
Try entering "Xiaodong"

281
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,530
This can't possibly be

282
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,490
an illegal internet cafe

283
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,050
that opened

284
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,330
a "Little Assassin" section

285
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,050
Highly paid for a method

286
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,490
Requires 100% success and escape

287
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,650
OP: Anonymous User111

June 3rd

289
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,370
Tuizhen Art Academy

290
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,210
Offering large reward for a method

I can provide you with a method

294
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,130
No charge

295
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,650
OP replies:

296
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,970
Then what do you want?

298
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,170
I want you to help me

299
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,690
Because at the same time and place

300
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,090
I want someone dead

301
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,650
They went private

302
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,370
Probably switched to private chat

303
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,050
This OP

304
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,690
Only reached agreement with 555

305
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,370
Right

306
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,850
Which means

307
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,370
This OP was seeking a method

308
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,810
This person said "I have a way"

309
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,210
But I want someone else dead

310
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,210
I'll tell you the method

311
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,970
You carry it out

312
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,690
That's the logic

313
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,290
The murderer should be

314
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,770
The OP

315
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,810
Is the OP definitely the killer?

316
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,090
Because

317
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,090
555 provided the method

318
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,770
There's another possibility

319
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,890
555 and the OP are probably

320
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,490
Two of our four suspects

321
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,130
Exactly

322
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,290
Two people

323
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,650
Right

324
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,410
Correct

325
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,610
In other words,

326
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,810
One person wanted to kill TYP,

327
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,530
and another wanted to kill Zidaole.

328
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:57,810
Yes.

329
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,090
That's exactly it.

330
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,050
Then they encountered 555,

331
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,490
who was one of them.

332
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,330
He provided the method,

333
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,370
and the two reached an agreement.

334
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,330
After that, they privately—

335
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,530
Right.

336
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,410
met offline.

337
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,250
Maybe it's two killers plus an X

338
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,290
Impossible

339
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,690
If three killers teamed up

340
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,890
they'd be invincible

341
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,690
How could we compete?

342
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:33,970
Right.

343
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,370
That's too much.

344
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,690
What?

345
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,170
Piano.

346
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,130
The piano is playing.

347
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,930
Someone is going to die.

348
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,490
Piano room.

349
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,690
The piano room—it's the piano room.

350
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,970
He went out

351
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,850
And closed the door

352
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,810
Brother Bai

353
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,570
Stop messing around

354
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,050
Hurry up

355
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,570
We're scared

356
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,970
No, he's the killer

357
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,250
Is it playing by itself?

358
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,690
I don't know

359
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,930
Behind the piano

360
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,730
Let's move it

361
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,130
Gently, it's expensive

362
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,330
Done

363
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,250
Timer speaker

364
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,530
Check its set time

365
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,530
6:20 PM

366
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,530
What's significant about 6:20 PM?

367
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,330
Right now

368
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,730
Why set it for now?

369
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,850
This proves the legend was premeditated

370
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,690
Who planned this?

371
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,730
The killer, obviously

372
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,730
Who's behind this?

373
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,930
A fabricated urban legend

374
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,850
To make everyone believe

375
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,450
This is actually a legend-based murder

376
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,370
How did you find the body?

377
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,370
It was triggered by this too

378
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,330
But the piano was playing at the time

379
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,250
Yes, the piano was playing by itself

380
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,810
How was the piano playing automatically?

381
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,050
This button is for going down

382
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,250
Right

383
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,010
It's playing by itself

384
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,410
How magical

385
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,970
Then I think it's

386
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,170
someone who has spent

387
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,610
a long time at school

388
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,130
and knows this legend well

389
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,170
That makes sense

390
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,290
Old Bai, I won't cover for you today

391
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,410
You don't need to cover for me

392
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,450
You want to protect him?

393
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,690
You're X.

394
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,810
Why are you coughing?

395
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,250
I've been coughing constantly.

396
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,690
Little sister, let's team up.

397
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,210
Understood.

398
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,010
We'll beat them today.

399
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,450
Today we'll wipe them all out.

400
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,330
Complete wipeout.

401
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,490
Someone's here.

402
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,650
Hurry!

403
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,930
What is that?

404
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,850
Why is there a corpse here?

405
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,890
You just noticed now?

406
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,170
It's been here for ages.

407
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,890
Today it's my turn to be here.

408
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,890
To clean out this cabinet.

409
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,210
No wonder the box was so heavy today.

410
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,650
Turns out there was a corpse inside.

411
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,370
The person who moved the box told me...

412
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,450
Said what?

413
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,210
That it was just full of props.

414
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,450
So I believed them.

415
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,650
Who told you that?

416
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,690
The person who moved the box...

417
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,130
Seems like...

418
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,610
Wait no...

419
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,290
Actually, it was you, wasn't it?

420
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,930
No

421
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,090
How about this?

422
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,930
Take a look at this

423
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,090
I'm a bit face-blind

424
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,370
That's what I mean

425
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,450
We all have average-looking faces

426
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,330
I have things to do

427
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,170
I need to leave now

428
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,690
Why are you leaving?

429
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:40,930
How could you

430
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,490
Come back

431
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,370
The effect is achieved

432
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:49,730
Alright, little sister

433
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,610
That person

434
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,170
He pushed the box

435
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,850
He said it on purpose

436
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,650
He said this box was normal

437
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,770
If you put it that way

438
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,410
Only the two of them pushed the box

439
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,290
Right, between the two of them, who's lying?

440
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,250
Is it heavy or light or what?

441
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,530
I don't think my brother would lie

442
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,890
Because he's a golden snub-nosed monkey

443
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,650
Only humans lie

444
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,410
Have you found the murder weapon?

445
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,090
No.

446
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,530
Look for other clues.

447
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,330
Are there any other clues here?

448
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,290
Did you open this box?

449
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,770
Isn't he handsome?

450
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,890
Is it this one?

451
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,370
Is this the murder weapon?

452
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:57,570
No.

453
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,210
That's just a prop.

454
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,090
Where is the murder weapon?

455
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,890
Zidaole entered through Gate 2

456
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,810
at 1:10 PM

457
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,690
into the props storage

458
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,130
TYP

459
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,770
and never came out again

460
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,970
The murder weapon

461
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,490
Could it be in the props storage?

462
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,090
Props storage

463
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,850
Haven’t checked the props storage

464
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,650
Right, the props storage

465
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,290
Props Room

466
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,210
This is the primary crime scene

467
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,010
Very likely

468
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,730
This is definitely the crime scene

469
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,210
Zidaole

470
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,170
came here

471
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,210
and likely died here

472
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,290
then was moved over there by something

473
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,770
The murder weapon might be here

474
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,290
Search

475
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,970
No

476
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,050
If the person was killed here

477
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,410
There should be bloodstains here

478
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,610
The bloodstains must be on the clothes

479
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,130
What's wrong?

480
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,370
The paint here is peeling

481
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,410
Trying to be mysterious

482
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,090
No, look inside this cabinet

483
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,010
I told you to check inside the cabinet

484
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,010
For any bloodstains

485
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,130
The body might have been placed here

486
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,570
Nothing

487
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,370
Could it be on the floor?

488
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,810
Wait, look at this.

489
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,690
Is this blood?

490
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,850
These are drag marks.

491
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,690
All the way to here.

492
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,890
He must have dragged it this way.

493
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,330
See? Just this trail.

494
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,010
Do you see it?

495
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,290
Someone's coming

496
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,490
Hello

497
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,530
Hello, Respect

498
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,610
My "Swan Lake" cast

499
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,210
Greetings

500
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,530
I'm the director of this "Swan Lake"

501
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,610
Respect

502
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,850
I've lost something very important

503
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,130
in the recording studio

504
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,210
Could you help me look for it?

505
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,690
Sure

506
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,850
Opposite

507
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,450
Recording studio

508
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,650
Are you sure you lost it here?

509
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,090
Yes, right in this room.

510
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,130
I found it.

511
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,610
Is this what you're looking for?

512
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,330
This is it.

513
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,170
Thank you.

514
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,250
I just saw you guys

515
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,370
walking around this area.

516
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,290
Near the dance studio.

517
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,330
Are you looking for something?

518
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,850
We're looking for the killer.

519
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,890
I know there's a surveillance camera in the dance studio.

520
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,450
I heard

521
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,050
the dance teacher always sets the password

522
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,450
related to his favorite song.

523
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,090
This is a book he often reads.

524
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,290
Take a look.

525
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,050
I'll head out first.

526
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,770
Goodbye.

527
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,570
Respect.

528
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,290
There's a photo.

529
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,410
Top six of the Talent Star competition.

530
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,410
Top six of the Talent Star competition.

531
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,970
That's your song, right?

532
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,090
By Bai Yang.

533
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,210
The song from the Talent Star top six.

534
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,690
It must be me.

535
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,690
It's me.

536
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,010
Wait, what do these colors mean?

537
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,570
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti.

538
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

539
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,850
Let's try again later.

540
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,290
Let's go.

541
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,210
This one.

542
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,210
This is an electronic keypad lock.

543
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,170
Could it be musical notes?

544
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,690
The password should be derived from

545
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,530
the musical notes of this lyric line.

546
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,210
If you say

547
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,730
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti

548
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,730
Right?

549
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,090
Yes.

550
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,690
Then it's Mi.

551
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,130
Do Re Mi

552
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,610
Mi Do

553
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,930
La

554
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,810
Do

555
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,610
La Ti

556
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,610
La Ti Do Mi

557
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,730
Mi Re Do Re

558
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,050
What song is this?

559
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,730
Do Re Mi

560
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,050
Just follow this.

561
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,370
It wouldn’t be this long.

562
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,650
No.

563
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,650
Is it these two?

564
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,010
The ones circled here.

565
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,130
Mi and Do.

566
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,010
Could it be

567
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,970
these two words in this line?

568
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,610
The top six sang that song—it was so good.

569
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,930
The top six songs...

570
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,810
"Super Star"

571
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,850
Let’s sing two songs.

572
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,730
Mi do la do

573
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,650
La si do mi

574
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,770
Mi re do re

575
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,650
Isn't this "Meteor Shower"?

576
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,490
Really?

577
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,050
"Meteor Shower"

578
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,570
Let's sing "Meteor Shower" from the beginning

579
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,330
Come on, who should start first?

580
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:17,930
You take the first line

581
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,450
You go first, then continue

582
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,890
The gentle starry sky

583
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,090
Don't you dare be sad

584
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,890
Don't you dare

585
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,490
Now that you have me

586
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,170
You'll never lose your way again

587
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,290
Is this it?

588
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,770
Now that you have me

589
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,010
You'll never lose your way again

590
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,010
Right

591
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,770
Now that you have me

592
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,770
You and me

593
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,330
Come on, press it

594
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,530
You and me

595
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,250
You

596
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,450
You and me

597
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,850
Yes

598
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,410
I was about to activate demolition mode

599
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:15,930
So refreshing

600
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,450
Here, the computer

601
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,450
The computer with the dance studio surveillance footage from the arts building

602
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,970
Set to record daily from 12:30 PM to 10:30 PM

603
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,370
Turn on the computer

604
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,130
Let's go

605
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,290
June 3rd dance studio surveillance footage

606
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,450
Who's this? This is Zidaole

607
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,210
At 1:10 PM, Zidaole went first

608
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,410
Went to the props room

609
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,090
Can't see the face clearly

610
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,170
TYP

611
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,330
He blocked the view

612
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,690
Next is me

613
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,290
Hello

614
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,490
He should be coming out now

615
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,450
Came out 5 minutes later

616
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,570
Looks very light

617
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,850
Next timeline

618
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,410
See?

619
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,050
Here I come

620
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,050
Canary

621
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,770
Sneaking around

622
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,850
As expected, it's our family's heirloom

623
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,890
This stealthy walking technique for stealing

624
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,250
Our golden monkey and canary

625
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,850
Next we'll play the role of a Bonnie and Clyde duo

626
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,570
3 PM, you're here

627
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,290
You pushed it with one hand

628
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,850
So effortlessly

629
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,730
This is me

630
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,690
3:30 PM?

631
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:45,810
Gone

632
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,410
None left. He was the last one.

633
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,650
Actually, if this were normal...

634
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,010
It would prove...

635
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,090
That blind spot...

636
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,530
No one was moving around randomly.

637
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,450
Each of us...

638
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,290
Took exactly five minutes to handle this.

639
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,730
But if someone took an extra step...

640
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,890
They should have taken longer than us.

641
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,250
How could it all be five minutes?

642
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,770
Is it possible...

643
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,730
That the two handling the box and the painting...

644
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,410
Had the chance...

645
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,010
To collude?

646
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,930
For example, the first one pushed the box...

647
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,170
The second one pushed the painting...

648
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,930
You two could have worked together.

649
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,850
He pushed the painting...

650
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,530
He pushed the box...

651
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,010
You two might have colluded.

652
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,850
If we need to provide cover,

653
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,410
only a painting can serve as cover.

654
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,570
We have to hide the person behind this painting.

655
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,650
Because our surveillance cameras

656
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,890
are all positioned here.

657
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,610
He can keep hiding here,

658
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,570
then be transported out.

659
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,610
Here's how he gets out:

660
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,570
The art handlers can conceal him,

661
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,130
since the painting is 1.8 meters tall

662
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,050
and you're all around 1.7 meters.

663
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,050
He can hide behind the painting

664
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,530
and exit with the art handlers.

665
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,970
I can prove there's nothing wrong with my painting

666
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,610
Then the problem must be with your painting

667
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,770
On what grounds?

668
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,570
I can prove it too

669
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,530
Because I'm completely relaxed

670
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,850
Haven't you watched the video?

671
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,650
You might be pretending to be relaxed

672
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,170
You're putting on a relaxed act

673
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,330
This... take it easy on this point.

674
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,490
I don't think this will become an issue.

675
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,530
The school strictly prohibits open flames.

676
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,690
Why were you burning things by the Wukenai River?

677
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,330
Does this metal bucket belong to you?

678
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,330
There's a pile of stuff inside.

679
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,570
Take a good look at this.

680
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,730
The murder weapon

681
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,810
was something relatively long

682
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,570
It was directly thrust into

683
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,850
her left carotid artery

684
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,330
causing her to bleed to death

685
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,050
There was poison

686
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,490
His lips turned black and purple

687
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,050
He likely died from poisoning

688
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:58,810
What's this?

689
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,810
Meet at the piano room at 11:30

690
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,970
Need to talk to you privately about something important

691
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,730
11:30

692
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,810
Piano room

693
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,370
11:30

694
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,170
is when the surveillance cameras weren't active yet

695
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,010
Right

696
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,450
At the piano room

697
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,170
He had already arranged to meet him at the piano room

698
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,370
Let's see what else is here

699
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,210
This is that person's hat

700
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,890
So there were two sets of clothes

701
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,210
Yes, this set belongs to the killer

702
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,330
Did he wear this or something?

703
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,370
Who would have had the chance to know

704
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,290
that TYP would wear this outfit today?

705
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,330
QQ Space

706
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,210
Didn't he post

707
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,570
a QQ Status update?

708
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,090
Didn't it say

709
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,250
it was his first time buying formalwear

710
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,290
and he'd wear it today?

711
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,450
Let's go back to

712
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,450
our shoe sizes and clothes

713
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,170
Actually, some of them

714
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,370
must be related

715
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:00,970
Right

716
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,410
Inside TYP's jacket

717
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,090
there's a size label

718
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,930
marked as 175

719
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:08,810
Canary

720
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,610
Height 1.72m, shoe size 40

721
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,570
Ning Hao

722
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,890
Height 1.77m, shoe size 43.5

723
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,410
Bai Yangzuo

724
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,330
Height 1.77m, shoe size 43

725
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:17,770
Ke Daole

726
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,490
Height 1.74m, shoe size 44

727
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,610
These shoe sizes and clothes

728
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,650
could fit all four of us

729
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,370
After TYP went in

730
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,050
we didn't see him leave on camera

731
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,090
So someone must have

732
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,370
helped him get out

733
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,850
from here

734
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,090
If at 11:30

735
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,290
this TYP was real

736
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,610
was lured to the piano room

737
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,610
and killed—dead

738
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,930
The next two TYPs were fakes

739
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,930
When you were filming that video,

740
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,810
didn't it also capture

741
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,530
the voices of all three of you?

742
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,130
Yes.

743
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,290
Were you together?

744
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,090
Together.

745
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:58,930
Definitely together.

746
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,810
Who else could it be at this time?

747
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,450
That fake one...

748
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,250
If the three of us can prove

749
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,090
our own alibis,

750
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,570
then someone must be imitating TYP.

751
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,930
The killer is among the four of us.

752
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,010
It must be him doing the imitation.

753
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,250
Unless you have a reason...

754
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,170
A reason that can prove

755
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,690
the first appearance of TYP was genuine.

756
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,770
Not you.

757
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,890
Why?

758
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,690
What were you doing at 12:30?

759
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,530
I was waiting in line at that restaurant.

760
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,650
No one can verify that.

761
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,130
But there's truly no way to prove it.

762
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,090
I think the person impersonating TYP

763
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,770
might not be among the four of us.

764
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,090
An internet user.

765
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,010
An enthusiastic viewer.

766
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,650
Wait a minute.

767
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,890
In this case, the killer

768
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,010
not only has an X helping,

769
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,970
but also an internet user assisting.

770
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,250
Sorry.

771
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,770
There's an X helping,

772
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:44,970
and another internet user.

773
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,610
How to fight this?

774
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,730
How to play this episode?

775
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,250
Case Five: How to Play.

776
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,610
The concept of netizen

777
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,690
is because this must be

778
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,370
a murder committed by two people working together.

779
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,170
The person he's impersonating is that

780
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,490
not someone from our group.

781
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,490
It's 555.

782
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,930
Netizen.

783
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,810
555 is a netizen, isn't he?

784
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,810
You're using a variant script.

785
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,530
That's not your theory.

786
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,810
You're wrong, Old Bai.

787
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,130
You're really wrong this time.

788
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,610
We consider both 555 and the poster

789
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,450
to be the murderers.

790
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:16,930
Right.

791
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,810
Dual perpetrators.

792
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,370
Didn't I just mention this

793
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,290
there's moving paintings back and forth and pushing boxes

794
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,010
two people can coordinate

795
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:40,850
I assume

796
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,330
if he is

797
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,890
the one pretending to be TYP

798
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,650
he's the fourth

799
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,690
he's the third

800
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,610
since he's disguised

801
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,850
he's already inside here

802
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,530
after you two finish moving things

803
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,570
transport him out

804
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,930
you go in with the painting

805
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,610
bring out the one wearing red clothes

806
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,250
then he'll be outside by himself

807
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,570
then I come out and change clothes

808
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,490
then I go back in

809
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,170
right

810
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,450
I didn't transport him out

811
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,250
it could also be her

812
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,850
I didn't say, just hypothesizing

813
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,610
yes, hypothesis

814
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,330
just talking about this method

815
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,930
boxes and paintings work the same way

816
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,130
Possibly

817
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,290
Because there are two boxes

818
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,210
You pushed the first box

819
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,250
You pushed a real person

820
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,050
He pushed the second box

821
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,850
His was heavy - it was a corpse

822
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,410
Alright, let's sort this out.

823
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,010
Who has a motive to kill whom.

824
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,610
Okay?

825
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,210
Let's start by looking at the motives.

826
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:47,930
That's the logical approach.

827
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,570
Everyone has a motive to kill.

828
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,010
No.

829
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,810
But some people

830
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,490
might only need to kill one person,

831
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,130
while others might need to kill two.

832
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:58,850
This person probably

833
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,410
only intended to kill one person.

834
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,930
Because killing the second person was likely

835
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,170
an additional requirement from 555, right?

836
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,170
So my motive for killing

837
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,450
actually involves two people.

838
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,610
Therefore it couldn't be me.

839
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,850
Eliminated.

840
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,890
Why do you want to kill two people?

841
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,730
Because Zidaole buried my brother.

842
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,610
She didn't do it herself,

843
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,330
she forced me to bury my brother.

844
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,850
And TYP killed my brother.

845
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,170
Maybe you happened to see someone

846
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,850
and wanted to kill them too.

847
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,250
You thought you could use them.

848
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,250
You're clearly targeting me.

849
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,610
The strongest murder motives

850
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,690
belong to you and him.

851
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,050
What's yours?

852
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,210
I must kill

853
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,850
because Ninghao died.

854
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,810
But you have no grudge against Zidaole.

855
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,610
I have no feud with Zidaole.

856
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,810
See, he only has one murder motive.

857
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,890
How many murder motives do you have?

858
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,810
Two.

859
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,370
Because he hates both

860
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,890
Zidaole forcing him to sing

861
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,770
and TYP controlling him.

862
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,290
Is that so?

863
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,770
TYP doesn't control me.

864
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,130
Doesn't he?

865
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,690
Aren't you from TYP company?

866
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,410
Yes.

867
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,730
Didn't he send you emails

868
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,610
to sign supplementary agreements?

869
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,530
He's Zidaole's

870
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,730
That was my

871
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,570
sister.

872
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,170
Her heart was full of you.

873
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,210
So you want to kill Zidaole

874
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,730
as your strongest motive, right?

875
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,850
You want to kill both.

876
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,250
Yes.

877
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,090
Then I also want to kill both.

878
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,810
You could barely be considered

879
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,850
Both want to kill

880
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,450
Zidle threatened to ruin my future

881
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,130
Right, let him

882
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,090
TYP wants to take 5 million from me

883
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:25,890
Yes

884
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,490
So that's two people to kill

885
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,650
Yes, correct

886
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,530
The one who wants to kill someone

887
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,410
Is both of you

888
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,330
Is it possible

889
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,610
The thread starter and 555

890
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,770
are two of the four suspects

891
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,090
among us.

892
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,610
That was always a possibility,

893
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,250
but it could also be

894
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,930
that either the thread starter or 555

895
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,530
is one of us.

896
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,330
That would be ridiculous.

897
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,090
Adding 555 into the mix

898
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,890
just complicates things.

899
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,570
If there were two culprits,

900
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,570
X wouldn’t be involved.

901
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,410
Can I go get

902
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,530
those documents?

903
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,250
Let’s go get them.

904
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,650
We should cross-check the timelines.

905
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,090
Let’s go.

906
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:08,810
Let’s verify.

907
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,850
We need to check

908
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,290
who fabricated their alibi.

909
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:11,610
Right.

910
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,410
Are you X?

911
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,290
You are X, don't deny it.

912
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm not.

913
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,530
I swear on my honor.

914
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,170
Then I'm not either.

915
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,210
If I were, I would have helped.

916
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,650
I haven't helped anyone.

917
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,970
Is it possible there is no X?

918
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,370
Do I look like a liar to you?

919
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,650
There must be an X.

920
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,970
There can't possibly be an X now.

921
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,650
Bai Yangzuo, I really suspect...

922
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,610
...that you're the killer.

923
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,290
No problem, you can suspect me.

924
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,370
We haven't discussed...

925
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,490
...about Zidaole's case.

926
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,570
Who did it?

927
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,210
Who killed Zidaole?

928
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,130
She died in this room.

929
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,090
Right?

930
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,890
In the closet.

931
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,930
No one could have...

932
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,370
...hidden in this room first...

933
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,250
...and waited for Zidaole.

934
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,970
That's impossible.

935
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,530
Because there were too many people.

936
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,370
Why? Why is it impossible?

937
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,970
Because the surveillance was already on.

938
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,930
From 12 o'clock...

939
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,290
...we actually had surveillance.

940
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,090
That's when it started, right?

941
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,210
From 12:00 to 12:30...

942
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,730
And then, yes...

943
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,050
...no one could have entered first.

944
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,330
There's no evidence...

945
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,930
...that someone was waiting inside first.

946
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,650
Generally, I think...

947
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,770
...the most likely possibility is...

948
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,410
...the person disguised as TYP...

949
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,850
...who entered at 1:20...

950
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,770
...and killed Zidaole...

951
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,490
...who was already inside.

952
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,730
Then hid inside.

953
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,330
So the person pretending to be TYP

954
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,410
must be the murderer

955
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,930
He couldn't be just a netizen or someone else

956
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,090
Moreover, at TYP 11:30

957
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,170
when he arrived at the piano room

958
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,010
there might not have been a murderer inside

959
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,730
he might have just touched something

960
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,130
and got poisoned to death

961
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,690
Was it sprayed on his face? That's what the poison description says

962
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,170
It wasn't sprayed on the face

963
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,450
It was on his clothes

964
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,370
There was a fragrance

965
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,970
What kind of fragrance?

966
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,050
Perfume scent

967
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,130
No, if it was sprayed in the room

968
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,090
the clothes wouldn't have such a strong scent

969
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,770
It was most likely sprayed directly at him

970
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,650
At 11:30

971
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,370
The TYP he invited arrived at the music room

972
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,290
When there was no surveillance

973
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,410
He was already hiding

974
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,330
inside the music room

975
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,290
First killed that TYP

976
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,330
11:30

977
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,330
We were all free at that time

978
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,050
So at 11:30

979
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,370
the four of us could still be suspects

980
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,610
So between 11:30 and 12:30

981
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,330
where were each of you?

982
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,330
Eating

983
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,370
You were eating?

984
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,090
I was at Haidilao

985
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,250
I was eating

986
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,490
Which restaurant?

987
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,170
A Northeastern cuisine restaurant

988
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,250
From what time to what time?

989
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,090
Right after our activity

990
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,690
ended, I went to eat

991
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,210
Ate and then before 12

992
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,450
I came here for our shoot

993
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,810
Arrived here before 12

994
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,290
Got here before 12

995
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,850
I went to the fishing gear store, yes

996
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,930
The same one I went to

997
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,970
last time

998
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,930
What time did you go?

999
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,010
Went at 11

1000
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,850
Went and came back by 12

1001
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,290
So between 11:30 and 12

1002
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,610
All of you could be

1003
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,290
In my opinion,

1004
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,210
From my personal perspective,

1005
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,490
One person killed two people.

1006
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,850
This is my viewpoint.

1007
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,690
How did he do it?

1008
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,090
First, at 11:30,

1009
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,050
it was a completely safe

1010
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,050
time to commit murder.

1011
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,650
Because the surveillance wasn't activated yet.

1012
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,490
He prepared in advance

1013
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,890
the crime scene in the piano room.

1014
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,050
And also the "Pushing Arts Strange Tales" incident.

1015
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,610
After setting this up,

1016
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,170
at 11:30,

1017
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,690
he arranged to meet TYP there beforehand.

1018
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,050
TYP ended up dead inside.

1019
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,610
No problem.

1020
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,930
Good, that's the first one dead.

1021
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,490
Next,

1022
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,570
another person

1023
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,610
helped create an alibi for him.

1024
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,810
By 1:20,

1025
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,970
it was Zidaole's turn.

1026
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,410
He needed to get this person,

1027
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,530
Zidaole, to also come to

1028
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,770
this storage room.

1029
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,210
After getting them to the storage room,

1030
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,050
at 1:10 she (Zidaole) arrived,

1031
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,530
and at 1:20 he entered and killed her.

1032
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,370
Then,

1033
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,850
his accomplice came to remove the body.

1034
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,450
Yes.

1035
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,050
That's how

1036
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,250
one person killed two people.

1037
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,730
This might be the method

1038
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,170
suggested by that enthusiastic netizen.

1039
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,010
I think these two siblings

1040
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,610
are highly suspicious

1041
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,050
but we can't find concrete evidence

1042
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,530
Why do you think

1043
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,090
these siblings are suspicious?

1044
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,730
Because we could easily collaborate

1045
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,530
Is it possible that

1046
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,170
they actually

1047
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,850
discovered each other long ago?

1048
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,090
If we were collaborating as siblings

1049
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,010
there would be no reason for me to kill

1050
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,210
since my brother is alive

1051
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,210
This point actually works in our favor

1052
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,730
If they killed first

1053
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,890
and then discovered

1054
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,890
he was my brother

1055
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:53,410
Right

1056
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,730
What if that's the case?

1057
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,690
But is it possible that

1058
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,650
you didn't know you were siblings

1059
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,810
but found out through private conversation?

1060
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,890
and realized you were siblings?

1061
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,530
How could that be?

1062
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,210
If we had recognized each other

1063
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,130
there would be no motive for murder

1064
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:03,690
Alright

1065
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,730
Let's not focus on whether you recognized each other

1066
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,970
The fact remains you two are prime suspects

1067
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,010
You need evidence first

1068
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,290
before making accusations

1069
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:14,610
I understand.

1070
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,570
I believe the most perfect deduction

1071
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,690
is that

1072
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,850
Bai Yangzuo at 11:30

1073
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,690
first sprayed this perfume

1074
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,850
all over that room,

1075
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,490
then arranged to meet the real TYP,

1076
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,370
and then he left.

1077
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,170
Since there were no cameras,

1078
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:29,730
at 12:00,

1079
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,370
he started recording with us.

1080
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,610
Meanwhile at that exact time,

1081
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,650
his other accomplice

1082
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,810
who was going to kill Zi Daole

1083
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,610
was Ke Daole.

1084
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,370
Dressed in TYP's clothes,

1085
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,450
he hid in the small auditorium,

1086
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,490
then at 12:00 disguised as TYP,

1087
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,490
he went out.

1088
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,730
Then he entered again disguised as TYP

1089
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,850
and killed Zi Daole who had entered

1090
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,650
the warehouse at 1:10,

1091
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,490
stabbing her to death,

1092
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,770
then stuffed her into that crate.

1093
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,450
Doesn't this sound perfectly reasonable to you?

1094
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,370
Absolutely reasonable.

1095
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,290
Before you said this,

1096
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,410
I wasn't even sure I'd vote for you.

1097
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:57,930
But after hearing you,

1098
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,210
I must vote for you now.

1099
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,250
Why does it have to be the two of us?

1100
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,890
Neither of us can impersonate TYP.

1101
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,130
We both can't pretend to be

1102
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:04,970
the first wave's TYP.

1103
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,250
What makes you say it's the two of us?

1104
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:06,730
Exactly.

1105
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,290
Why must these two impersonate TYP?

1106
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,450
What he means is

1107
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,490
it must be you two pretending.

1108
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,410
Fine, his concept is always that

1109
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,570
an anonymous netizen (555) is pretending.

1110
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,730
Let me give an example -

1111
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,770
what if we spent money to hire someone

1112
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:16,290
paid a sum

1113
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,050
to have her pretend for us?

1114
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,250
Another double murderer scenario,

1115
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,250
plus another netizen involved,

1116
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,290
and you have an X factor too.

1117
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,250
We could each pretend once.

1118
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:23,890
That's possible too.

1119
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:24,410
Why wouldn't that be possible?

1120
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,010
Right.

1121
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,290
How would we pretend?

1122
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,090
The two of us couldn't possibly have any opportunity.

1123
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,210
Old Bai, listen to me.

1124
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,050
Just vote like this.

1125
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,690
This time, just vote like this.

1126
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,410
Vote for us two, okay?

1127
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:35,730
Okay.

1128
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,290
You can't vote for us.

1129
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,330
If you're not the killer,

1130
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,770
voting for us means helping the killer.

1131
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,570
But you're definitely the killer.

1132
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:41,930
Four choose two.

1133
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,450
You can't vote.

1134
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,290
You can't vote for us.

1135
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:43,850
There's no way you can vote for us.

1136
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,930
You can't vote for us.

1137
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,890
Why can't I vote for you?

1138
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,890
My hand is my own.

1139
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,890
I can't vote for you.

1140
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,290
You're messing with me.

1141
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,970
You're controlling me.

1142
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,650
Brainwashing failed.

1143
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,970
Let's try again.

1144
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,490
Playing like this as the killer

1145
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,250
is correct.

1146
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,850
Yes, that's right.

1147
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,570
I am the killer.

1148
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,370
No matter what, I'm voting for you.

1149
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,370
I'm convinced it's you now.

1150
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,290
Let me summarize.

1151
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,490
I think this round X.

1152
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,930
There might really be no X.

1153
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,130
I vote for two people

1154
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,090
One is her, one is him

1155
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:15,490
This is my

1156
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,090
You know

1157
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,650
Why I can be so certain

1158
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,970
The accomplices are those two

1159
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,650
You must be involved anyway

1160
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,810
Because all three were present

1161
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,450
Their motives

1162
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,930
I think would be very strong

1163
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,330
But his

1164
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,250
I can't explain it, you know

1165
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,490
My mind feels so empty right now.

1166
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,010
Say

1167
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,010
It's you, right?

1168
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,410
It's me

1169
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:05,890
Let's vote

1170
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,890
Let's go

1171
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,290
Goodbye, everyone

1172
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:08,850
Farewell

1173
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,130
I just want to see the final result

1174
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,410
I'm really speechless

1175
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,090
I just can't believe it

1176
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,090
Getting worked up

1177
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,770
Brother Bai is playing very seriously today

1178
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,610
My prime suspect is

1179
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,650
Ke Daole

1180
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,490
I believe he killed Zi Daole

1181
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,690
The real culprit I suspect is

1182
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,130
Bai Yangzuo

1183
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,370
He killed TYP

1184
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:17,290
He

1185
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,690
Originally intended to kill Zi Daole

1186
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,410
Posted online seeking help

1187
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,610
Met netizen "555"

1188
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,130
(Parentheses)

1189
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,210
who was actually Ke Daole in disguise

1190
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,930
Thus learned the murder method

1191
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,330
Then helped Ke Daole

1192
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,810
kill TYP first

1193
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,370
Then for this episode,

1194
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,410
I vote

1195
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,730
so I think

1196
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,570
the murderer of TYP is

1197
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,130
I believe

1198
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,170
the killer of Zi Daole is

1199
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,450
The hardest thing for me is

1200
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,610
who killed TYP

1201
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,050
Actually, I've been struggling with

1202
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,130
whether TYP was actually

1203
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:41,970
a canary

1204
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,090
or

1205
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,170
Bai Yangzuo

1206
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,970
Today's case is extremely complicated.

1207
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,810
There are two killers.

1208
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,490
After my own

1209
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,450
round of brainstorming,

1210
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,810
I think

1211
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,370
that alibi

1212
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,050
is quite crucial.

1213
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,090
But

1214
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,290
then it really means

1215
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:14,370
Ke Daole

1216
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,690
killed Zi Daole.

1217
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,170
Then,

1218
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,410
TYP was

1219
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,530
killed by Canary.

1220
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,730
Canary killed TYP because

1221
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,130
she believed her brother was killed by TYP.

1222
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,010
That's it.

1223
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,570
That's how it happened.

1224
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,330
I voted for

1225
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,050
I voted for

1226
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,050
I'm here to surrender

1227
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,770
the murderer of Zi Daole

1228
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,970
The one who killed Zi Daole today is

1229
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,450
Now I'm going to vote

1230
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:32,010
for the murderer of TYP's boss

1231
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,370
The real culprit I choose is

1232
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,090
Next, we will announce

1233
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:50,530
the voting results from all players

1234
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,770
Help, I'm so nervous.

1235
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,330
That scared me to death.

1236
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,050
First of all,

1237
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,570
There are three types of votes today.

1238
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,410
What is this?

1239
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:11,730
Three types.

1240
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:12,650
Three voting types.

1241
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,610
The first voting type is...

1242
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,530
This is so difficult.

1243
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,810
The one who killed Zidaole...

1244
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:23,610
It's you.

1245
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,010
It's Kedao Le.

1246
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,890
The one who killed TYP is

1247
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:42,650
Canary

1248
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,810
The second voting pattern is

1249
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,170
the one who killed Zi Daole

1250
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,250
was Ke Daole

1251
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,130
He was involved in both

1252
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,610
The one who killed TYP was

1253
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,170
Bai Yangzuo

1254
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,530
Bai Yangzuo

1255
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,170
Nice throw

1256
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,330
It wasn't you, was it?

1257
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,850
The third type of vote is

1258
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,290
Both votes were cast for Ke Daole

1259
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,410
You killed both of them

1260
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,010
Everyone voted for me

1261
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,330
You definitely are

1262
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,330
Ke Daole is already the public wolf

1263
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:56,090
Public wolf

1264
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,010
Ke Daole

1265
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,010
I think he killed Zi Daole

1266
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,690
Ke Daole killed Zi Daole

1267
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,490
Ke Daole murdered Zi Daole

1268
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,570
Ke Daole

1269
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,770
Ke Daole

1270
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:09,970
Me

1271
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,850
I chose myself

1272
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,330
The reason I wanted to kill Zi Daole was

1273
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,570
because I needed to protect myself

1274
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,570
Because when I was with her

1275
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,730
going out to eat

1276
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,650
I heard her make a phone call

1277
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,930
That phone call

1278
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,930
made me realize that despite thinking

1279
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,930
we had a chance to reconcile

1280
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:28,450
I heard

1281
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,210
she intended to ruin my future

1282
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:32,970
No romantic relationship

1283
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,650
should affect Ke Daole's future

1284
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,050
So

1285
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:40,210
I decided

1286
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,010
to kill her to protect my own future

1287
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,010
Among the three voting options

1288
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,690
the highest votes went to

1289
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,770
No, wait a minute

1290
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,570
Ke Daole

1291
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,850
Bai Yangzuo

1292
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,370
Okay

1293
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,970
The murderer of TYP

1294
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,010
Bai Yangzuo

1295
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,090
Bai Yangzuo

1296
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,330
He killed TYP

1297
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,170
Bai Yangzuo

1298
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,090
TYP was

1299
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,250
killed by the Canary

1300
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,770
Canary

1301
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,290
I voted for

1302
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,730
Ke Daole

1303
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:44,770
killed two

1304
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,610
The Canary is an accomplice

1305
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,130
What's going on?

1306
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,650
Then this group

1307
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,450
is truly the culprit or not

1308
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,170
Now I declare

1309
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,450
the suspect in this case is confirmed

1310
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,090
No way

1311
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,890
Wrong

1312
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,090
Failure

1313
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:30,890
Who is it?

1314
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,330
The real culprit is

1315
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,290
The killer of Zi Daole is

1316
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:37,610
Ke Daole

1317
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,730
The killer of TYP

1318
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:41,970
Who could it be?

1319
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:45,610
If it's you

1320
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,610
Tonight I'll come across and "kill" you

1321
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,770
Let me tell you

1322
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,650
The killer of TYP is

1323
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,210
Ning Hao

1324
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,170
This victory feels so satisfying

1325
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,250
It's really him

1326
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,170
How can we fight each other

1327
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,730
How did you do it

1328
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,410
How do you have a new identity every episode

1329
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,130
Can't he just be a normal person

1330
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,290
No one actually voted for me

1331
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:28,890
I took all the blame for you

1332
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,930
Yes

1333
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:27,010
Look how fiercely you two are fighting.

1334
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,770
What's going on?

1335
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:30,410
Why are you directing the fire...

1336
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,450
I shouldn't have listened to you.

1337
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,210
This ridiculous love story.

1338
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,730
Who here hasn't killed someone?

1339
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,010
I've never killed anyone.

1340
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,130
Those who kill often would know...

1341
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,290
It's him.

1342
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,450
He's behind all these schemes.

1343
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,610
He's definitely suspicious.

1344
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,090
You've worn perfume.

1345
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,130
Used knives.

1346
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,530
He's done every terrible thing.

1347
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,130
Let me tell you...

1348
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,650
He even stole his brother's woman.

1349
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,090
You're terrifying.

1350
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,450
But I was once your brother.

1351
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:04,050
Have you forgotten?

1352
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:04,810
I was your brother.

1353
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:08,130
Your brother.

1354
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,450
And your father.

1355
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,930
He also acted as my father

1356
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,690
Not ordinary at all

1357
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,730
Every round has a special role

1358
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,530
Just now you told me

1359
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,810
He can't be the killer consecutively

1360
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,450
Right

1361
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,130
I thought so too

1362
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,490
I mean, it can't always be

1363
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,130
Playing the reverse psychology

1364
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,290
Never expected

1365
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,170
Tomorrow it's still me

1366
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:37,370
I don't know why

1367
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,290
None of you suspect me

1368
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:38,930
Why is that?

1369
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,450
You've always stayed out of their conflict

1370
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:42,610
You know what?

1371
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,330
We're both trapped in this

1372
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:46,810
Isn't that right?

1373
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,690
Trapped in the painting hiding living people

1374
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,250
It wasn't me

1375
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,530
You're the one who insisted the painting hides people

1376
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,250
Then I'll start dealing with you

1377
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,730
When does your box open?

1378
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,130
Which way did he go?

1379
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,370
He is

1380
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,250
Even if I pause for one second

1381
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,530
He'll come out as soon as he pulls the door

1382
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:02,330
Then I'll go

1383
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,570
It's the same as the drawing

1384
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,450
Same principle

1385
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:05,050
But indeed

1386
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,530
This drawing is very misleading

1387
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,050
Especially the 1.8 meter part

1388
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:08,890
Right

1389
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,530
If the 1.8 meters wasn't drawn

1390
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,490
As a clue

1391
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,090
During the first round

1392
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,730
You could have pinned it on both of us

1393
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:14,370
Yes

1394
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,650
So which one of you is Anonymous555?

1395
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:18,690
I'm Anonymous555

1396
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,410
He's Anonymous555

1397
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,450
I'm the thread starter

1398
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,610
So does this case involve X?

1399
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:37,210
You and him

1400
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:37,850
No

1401
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:39,690
I'm a good person

1402
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,530
I'm not X

1403
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,210
This case doesn't have X

1404
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,130
I just

1405
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,370
definitely doesn't have

1406
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:07,610
This victory feels so good, bro

1407
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,530
Can't take it anymore

1408
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:10,610
This round was so frustrating

1409
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,290
Look at it like this

1410
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:13,770
It's too painful

1411
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,530
How did you do that? So impressive

1412
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,370
Actually not about being strong

1413
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,050
It's about logic

1414
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,090
This case was truly difficult

1415
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,130
That's why we deliberately didn't choose X

1416
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:23,730
Well, not exactly

1417
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:24,210
Just joking

1418
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:24,970
Well, not really

1419
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,730
We genuinely couldn't solve it

1420
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,970
Now revealing this case's

1421
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:34,250
crucial clue

1422
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,610
Inside the iron bucket everyone received

1423
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,010
there was a piece

1424
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,130
of the killer's burned clothing fragment

1425
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:42,970
Is this it?

1426
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,330
Young Marshal 101?

1427
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,370
This is it

1428
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,370
What's this?

1429
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:53,770
On this clothing fragment

1430
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:54,970
there's the killer's remaining

1431
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:56,090
perfume scent

1432
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:06,370
However,

1433
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,570
but no one would have thought

1434
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,970
to smell the clothes burned to ashes.

1435
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:13,850
Moreover,

1436
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,610
the pattern on this piece of clothing

1437
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,010
matches with the outfit

1438
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,170
in a group photo under one of the posters

1439
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:22,330
on the bulletin board.

1440
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,970
Thus we can confirm

1441
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,930
that Ning Hao is TYP's murderer.

1442
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,450
As for Zi Daole's killer,

1443
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,650
we can deduce through logic

1444
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,130
that it's Ke Daole.

1445
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,290
Well, this...

1446
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,170
This is too...

1447
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,250
Tui Town 2004

1448
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,970
"Tui Arts Mysteries: The Blood Cabinet Case"

1449
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:44,050
has been fully investigated.

1450
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:44,810
Next,

1451
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,490
the Golden Key will be awarded by Tui Tan.

1452
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:50,730
Let them take it themselves.

1453
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:52,210
We're done here. Let's go.

1454
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,450
Utterly humiliating behavior.

1455
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,730
Heli Mojinyu

1456
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,250
Let's start deducing.

1457
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,050
You two killed someone

1458
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:27,850
Will it be you two tomorrow

1459
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,010
who get taken away

1460
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,010
Go ahead and arrest them

1461
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,210
You two are getting arrested, right?

1462
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:32,570
Let's go right now

1463
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,330
Because we have a performance tomorrow

1464
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:34,850
Yes

1465
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,170
Tomorrow we have the "Swan Lake" performance

1466
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,290
What's wrong?

1467
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,090
What's with you now?

1468
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,090
What happened again?

1469
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,450
I just saw in the dorm courtyard

1470
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,650
Ai Sing jumped to her death

1471
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,850
She's been taken to Tui Town Hospital

1472
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:53,570
for emergency treatment

1473
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,010
But probably

1474
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:55,650
she's gone

1475
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:58,890
The courtyard is sealed off now

1476
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,090
Just stay here

1477
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,050
Don't go anywhere

1478
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,090
It's too dangerous outside

1479
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:03,970
I'll go tell the others first

1480
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:04,890
about this news

1481
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,170
Don't open cabinets randomly.

1482
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,650
Be careful inside the cabinet.

1483
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:20,450
There's a person.

1484
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,170
A person covered in blood.

1485
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,210
It's a dead body.

1486
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:23,370
Zidaole.

1487
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,210
Don't casually enter.

1488
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:25,730
Someone died here.

1489
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:26,290
The empty piano room.

1490
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:29,930
Beware of the deadly piano music coming from there.

1491
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:33,250
In the dormitory courtyard.

1492
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,170
Xiao Ai jumped to her death.

1493
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,490
In this episode, let's first talk about

1494
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,330
"meritocracy"

1495
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:46,210
In our premium content

1496
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:48,050
we often hear in success guides

1497
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,930
"Just work hard and you'll succeed"

1498
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,650
"Why haven't you achieved"

1499
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:52,730
what you want yet?"

1500
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:54,930
"That's because you're not working hard enough"

1501
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,570
This is actually

1502
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,890
a manifestation of "meritocracy"

1503
01:03:58,450 --> 01:03:59,650
The term "meritocracy" comes from

1504
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:00,730
American philosopher

1505
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,050
and Harvard professor

1506
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,050
Michael Sandel's book

1507
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:05,450
"The Tyranny of Merit"

1508
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,050
How should a good society define success?

1509
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,810
The principle of "meritocracy" emphasizes that

1510
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:12,930
social and economic rewards

1511
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,370
should be based on talent,

1512
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:16,650
effort, and achievement -

1513
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:17,770
these merits should decide

1514
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,770
Under conditions of equal opportunity,

1515
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:21,810
people compete fairly,

1516
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:23,730
and the highest achievers win

1517
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:25,530
The author argues that

1518
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,130
this seemingly fair concept of success

1519
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,770
breeds arrogance among elites

1520
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,730
and resentment among the underprivileged

1521
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:34,170
making successful individuals believe

1522
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,610
their achievements stem solely from personal effort

1523
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,330
while forgetting the role of

1524
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,850
opportunity and luck

1525
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,090
They look down upon those less fortunate

1526
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,330
or deemed less qualified

1527
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,370
This hinders social mobility

1528
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:45,970
fuels social antagonism

1529
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,530
and creates societal issues

1530
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:50,050
This is the "meritocracy trap"

1531
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,050
How can we escape

1532
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,210
this meritocracy trap?

1533
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,210
We must reconsider

1534
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,970
education's fundamental nature and purpose

1535
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:58,930
recognize the value

1536
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,170
and dignity in all occupations

1537
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,770
and redefine success

1538
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,690
not simply by

1539
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,290
market competition outcomes

1540
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,250
but by their moral significance

1541
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,250
to societal welfare

1542
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,730
This reminds us to stay humble

1543
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,890
value everyone's contributions

1544
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,970
and actively discuss measures

1545
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:19,370
that promote social justice

1546
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,610
toward public life with less resentment

1547
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,770
and more inclusivity

1548
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:26,210
Let's discuss

1549
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,370
the legal issue in this case

1550
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:28,970
In this case, Tui Youpin

1551
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,290
pushed Fake Golden Monkey

1552
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,690
resulting in his death

1553
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:33,290
How should this action be

1554
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:34,130
legally defined?

1555
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:35,770
We can see that

1556
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,490
the two didn't know each other

1557
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,170
but Fake Golden Monkey rushed

1558
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,850
to scold Tui Youpin

1559
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:42,690
who didn't understand

1560
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,490
what Fake Golden Monkey was saying

1561
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:46,250
and pushed him out of impatience

1562
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,570
Based on current information

1563
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,210
we tend to believe Tui Youpin

1564
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:52,090
had no intent to kill

1565
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,050
so it's not intentional homicide

1566
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,290
But does it necessarily

1567
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,730
constitute negligent homicide?

1568
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,250
We still need to consider

1569
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,890
the scene environment,

1570
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,090
perspectives and actions

1571
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,890
It might be an accident

1572
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,170
In criminal law, an accident

1573
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,890
means the perpetrator objectively

1574
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,650
caused damage

1575
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,930
but without intent or negligence

1576
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,930
no subjective fault

1577
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,650
but due to unforeseeable

1578
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,810
reasons

1579
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,650
If ultimately deemed an accident

1580
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,650
then it's not a crime

1581
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,450
no criminal liability

1582
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:29,770
However, we also see

1583
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,730
Zi Daole exploited this incident

1584
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,130
faking Bai Yangzuo's murder photos

1585
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:35,290
and threatened Bai Yangzuo

1586
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,490
If Zi Daole obtained

1587
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,970
Bai Yangzuo's property through threats

1588
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,690
like direct cash

1589
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:41,970
or illegally possessed

1590
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:42,810
intellectual property

1591
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,050
then Zi Daole might

1592
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:46,570
commit extortion
