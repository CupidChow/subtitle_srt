00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm your host Xiao Le

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,680
also a senior student here

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,080
Now

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,480

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120

officially open

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,920

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,320
let's welcome representatives

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,720
from each grade

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,600
to introduce themselves

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,120
This is

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,800
with props

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,600

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,840
That's right

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,000
Everyone who interacts with me

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,800
politely says "Hello" first

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,480
Not because you're polite

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,520
but because my name is

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,720
Ning Hao ("Hello")

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,680
Good

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,400
Acting is my passion

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,640
Best Actor is my honor

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,520

Welcome Ning Hao

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,560
Now let's welcome the next person

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,000
Hello everyone

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,960
My name is Canary

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,280
Friends from the north

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,440
You can also call me Jin Si Qiao

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,600
I'm the youngest

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,480
A sophomore student

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,400
I've heard

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,800
Many people say I resemble

43
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,480
The purity of morning dew

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
And then

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't laugh

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:57,880
No laughing

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,520
Then

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,920
I won

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,760
The Best New Artist award at the Tuilaimi Awards

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
Because my throat

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,440
Contains a motorcycle

52
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,280
I am the Angry Voice

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,360

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,520
Thank you

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,960
Alright, welcome our Angry Voice DIVA

56
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,200
Forgot to throw flowers

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,120
Now let's welcome the next contestant

Hello, sister

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Hello, little sister

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,560
Actually in musical theater

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,040
I've achieved some success

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,200
As a student

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,280
You see over there

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520

69
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
And "Phantom" in the cinema

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,960
Those were all performed by me

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,400
In the music circle

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,720
I have a well-known name

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,520
Called "Soul Sniper"

74
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,240
Born into a prestigious family

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,320
Dangerously charming

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,520
Hello everyone

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm a sophomore at our Tui Zhen Art Academy

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
My name is He Dinghong

Senior

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,720
I can't take it anymore

82
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Although last year

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
I only transferred here in September

84
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,880
But in the music industry's

85
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,720
circles

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,240
I've already gained some fame

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,680
I've served multiple times

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,800
as the male lead in our Bazimei productions

89
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,040
Yes

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,880
Because my singing style is quite unique

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,800
And also very

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,640
I have a rich, powerful voice

93
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,360
I have a resounding nickname

Producer and musician

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,080
All our hits were created by me

115
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
For example

116
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,160
"Do You Know Purple"

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,240

00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
You know purple

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,640

Anyway, I don't know purple either

124
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,040
That's how it is

125
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Everyone knows purple now

126
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,000

Thank you both for the wonderful performance.

201
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,160
You're amazing, senior

202
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
So impressive

203
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
You two, take a seat and rest for a while

204
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,520
We need to compose ourselves

205
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,560
Why?

206
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,640
Because we...

207
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,520
Tuiyi's newest girl group

208
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
Gen1es

209
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,960
will present to everyone...

210
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,280
a spectacular performance

211
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,960
Let's welcome Gen1es!

212
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,560
I've never seen a girl group perform live before

213
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,440
Really

214
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
It's fantastic

215
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Looking forward to it

216
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
How cute

217
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,800
This is what youthful energy feels like

218
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,480
Absolutely amazing

219
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,720
Thank you to our Gen1es

220
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
Truly a feast for the eyes

221
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,400
Worthy of our rising girl group

222
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,280
As expected

223
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,040
Full of vigor and unstoppable momentum

224
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,680
Their potential is limitless
