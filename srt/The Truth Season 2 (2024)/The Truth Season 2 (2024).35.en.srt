1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,080
Today, we...

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,040
He Dinghong is a bit...

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,520
Right from the start, they framed me.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,640
As soon as the two arrived...

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,800
First, they voted against you.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,120
What? You don't have a kissing scene, right?

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,360
Is there a kissing scene?

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,560
How come I didn't see it?

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,160
Let's add a kissing scene, okay?

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,480
Just add one scene.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,720
What else do you want to do?

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
What more do you want?

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,720
Hello.

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,680
So beautiful.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,520
It's not this long.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,840
That's it.

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,640
After finishing this...

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,040
I won't get any more roles.

19
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,080
Today I'll hit...

20
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,360
I'll hit you with this.

21
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,120
I've been trying really hard...

22
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,040
to do this part.

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,360
You're just putting on a show for me here, huh?

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm telling you, there are still people inside.

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,720
I heard it just now.

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,440
In here...

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
Not bad, it's okay.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,880
Big brother, are you well-rested?

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,240
We're going all out today.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,400
Exactly.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
I want one too.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
I was just telling them yesterday

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,960
I suddenly

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,440
realized your handsome point yesterday.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,160
That masculine charm kind of

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,680
handsome point.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
Stop doing this, okay?

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,360
What's wrong?

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,160
What's wrong with me complimenting him?

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm complimenting him publicly, not privately.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,560
You're not bad either.

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,560
Okay, little sister.

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
Little sister.

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,960
This is our script.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,200
Your script.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,400
Was the last page torn out?

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,880
The last page was torn out.

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
You even noticed that.

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Looks like you're really going all out today.

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,920
Today I'm mainly focusing on

51
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
just relaxing.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,160
Mainly focusing on that

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,320
recklessness.

54
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
spouting nonsense.

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,080
I'll start spouting nonsense soon.

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,120
Our Hedinhong is being a bit

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,200
framing me right from the start.

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
As soon as these two came in,

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,960
they voted for you first.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,400
Aren't you feeling pressured?

61
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
This isn't fun.

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,360
This not being fun is actually fun.

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,040
Come

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,080
The sword you love to play with

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
Here it is

66
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Your legs are so long

67
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,360
Compare them with ours

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,640
Legs up to here

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
I need to get some stilts

70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,680
Don't insult my sister like that

71
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,400
She's my girlfriend

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
Right, brother-in-law

73
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,680
I have rehearsal soon

74
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
Stop messing around with me

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
You're not my leading lady

76
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,560
What, no kissing scene for you?

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,000
Is there a kissing scene?

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
I didn't see one

79
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,560
I have gum

80
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll chew some gum

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,840
Add a kissing scene

82
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,440
How about it?

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,960
Just one scene

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,720
What else do you want?

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,840
How beautiful

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040
Oh my god

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,960
Why is it so beautiful

88
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,040
So gorgeous, right?

89
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,760
Victoria's Secret

90
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
Yes, that's right

91
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,160
Victoria's Secret, right?

92
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,040
This is my leading lady

93
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,200
Are you嫌弃ing me now?

94
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
Don't be like this, brother-in-law

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,920
I think I also have some chicken wings

96
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,080
I forgot to bring them

97
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
You go get them

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
Next part (bring it)

99
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,200
Okay, next part

100
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:19,880
I'll hit today

101
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,160
I'll hit you with this

102
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,360
Today it's him

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
Got it?

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, I'll vote for him today too

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
So this is how you're doing it today

106
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Still you

107
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,760
Let me tell you

108
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,880
Let me share with everyone

109
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,840
Hedinghong is acting too normal today

110
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,000
I spent ten minutes with him

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,120
He didn't step on anyone

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,120
He did step

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,640
He texted me this morning to step on me

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
When he woke up he called me "little murderer"

115
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
At the scene, I

116
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,720
So you were mass messaging

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Let me tell you

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,080
Don't be incoherent today

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
When he saw me this morning it was like this

120
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,480
Morning, wearing mic

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,080
So you won't communicate, right?

122
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,240
It's just that look - he wouldn't meet my eyes

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Come on, let's go in

124
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,800
Seriously?

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
This is how he's acting today

126
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,400
I just woke up this morning

127
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
and sent one little "murderer" message

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,240
Who else did you send it to?

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
I pressed the wrong button

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,680
Didn't you send a message?

131
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
I clicked on my own profile picture

132
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,320
Act One: The Curse

133
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,200
In the Rain Kingdom where it rains year-round

134
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,760
there exists a lake under clear blue skies

135
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,520
called Goose-Pushing Lake

136
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,320
Here lives a group of beautiful

137
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,720
black swans

138
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,880
Among them

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,000
the one that always stands out in beauty

140
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,080
is actually Princess Jinka from a neighboring kingdom

141
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,760
Jinka

142
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
Jinka

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
The poor girl was recently

144
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,320
by Goose-Pushing Lake

145
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
cursed by the Demon King White Goose

146
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,720
and transformed into a black swan

147
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,880
Wait a minute

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
If I was transformed into someone as beautiful as this

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,720
why would I want to change back?

150
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,320
If I could effortlessly

151
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,920
become like her

152
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,040
This plot doesn't make sense

153
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,920
There's no character logic

154
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:08,880
No

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,040
Actually it's

156
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,240
something with a higher purpose

157
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,320
Yes, it's a curse

158
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,480
It's meant to tell girls

159
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,080
that looks aren't the most important thing

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,400
but they're still quite important

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,560
Okay, little sister

162
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,240
They say

163
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,320
Poor girl recently

164
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,080
by Swan Lake

165
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,680
was turned into a black swan by the demon king

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
Only true love's kiss

167
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
can break the spell

168
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,560
It's the cruelest curse

169
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,480
What do you mean?

170
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
After finding true love

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
I turned back

172
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,080
So then

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
the love was gone

174
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,440
and my beauty too

175
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,760
Let's welcome Princess Jinka

176
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
and Bai Yangzuo

177
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,280
Finally it's your turn

178
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,760
Three, two, one, action!

179
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,440
No music?

180
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,040
Just perform dry

181
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
Should I sing something?

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,160
Let me...

183
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,360
First I was lost

184
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,800
Then my beloved

185
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,280
My...

186
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,800
Didn't I rescue you?

187
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
Drool

188
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Burst out laughing

189
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,440
Your drool gave her a shower

190
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,400
For her

191
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,880
Oh my

192
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,680
What

193
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,720
My little trick made them drool uncontrollably

194
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,000
It's pouring down like a waterfall

195
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,520
Do it again

196
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
Swallow your drool

197
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,840
Give Prince Xiaoyu another chance

198
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,720
Okay

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,640
I usually only take one

200
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,640
Before you "died"

201
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,200
I wanted to give you a true love's kiss

202
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
So you want me to "die" immediately?

203
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,440
Our Bai Sect's entertainment career

204
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
is "ruined."

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
Everyone, go outside for some free time.

206
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,760
Let's the three of us rehearse the act.

207
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,000
You perform the first part first.

208
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,120
The two of us will come out to rescue you.

209
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,320
Any time.

210
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,280
Any place.

211
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,960
Heavy rain.

212
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Light rain.

213
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,080
Drizzle.

214
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,760
Look at me.

215
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,800
I am the Demon King.

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,520
You are the Demon King.

217
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Right.

218
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,840
Alright, let's start from the push-down.

219
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,760
Black Goose transformation.

220
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
You have to join too.

221
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Why am I here?

222
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,360
He "died."

223
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,680
Then she turns back into me.

224
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,440
First, he turns you into her.

225
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,400
Then the two of them perform first.

226
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,200
After the performance,

227
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,440
you turn back again.

228
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,800
You go first.

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,040
I'll start with a singing and dancing segment.

230
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,400
Isn't it about shining alone?

231
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,560
Gold card.

232
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm a goose, I'm a big white goose.

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,920
Stop singing.

234
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,600
Stop singing.

235
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,200
Then I turn into you.

236
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,960
He Gatling.

237
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,480
After the "bara bara" transformation, I sing.

238
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,680
Why did a slap send them flying?

239
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,480
Let's rehearse in the small auditorium.

240
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Then you two back me up with dancing.

241
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,200
Okay.

242
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,800
Just follow along and sway with me.

243
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,440
Ready, go.

244
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,040
Gold card.

245
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm a goose, I'm a big white goose.

246
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,800
Push-pull energy.

247
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,600
Black Goose transformation.

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,520
What's your song?

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
Old driver, take me along

250
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,880
I want to go to Kunming

251
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
Let’s see how you switch it up

252
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,800
We can’t mess up the lines

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,040
You have to go on stage too

254
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,920
Okay, I’m fine with it

255
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
You clearly have a lot of skit experience

256
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,440
Yes

257
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,600
Aren’t you a professional skit actor?

258
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,640
Then he has to dance too

259
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,320
While he’s dancing

260
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,360
He suddenly pulls out a Gatling

261
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,680
You’ll need a song too

262
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,440
You’re the one who goes

263
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
Bang bang bang

264
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,800
Gatling goes bang bang bang

265
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,920
Can you come up with a funnier, smarter joke?

266
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,840
This one’s a bit lame, I think

267
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,400
You think of one and help me

268
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,120
I’ll think of one

269
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,240
Bang bang bang is fine

270
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,680
Bang bang bang

271
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,040
Moo moo moo would be better

272
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
I have moo moo moo later

273
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Sorry

274
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,920
Stop stealing the jokes

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
Ready, three, two, one

276
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
The Rain Kingdom where it rains year-round

277
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
There lies a lake under eternally clear skies

278
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
Called Swan Push Lake

279
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,800
Here lives a group of

280
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
beautiful black swans

281
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,920
The most beautiful among them

282
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,320
is actually a princess from a neighboring kingdom

283
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,080
Jinka

284
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,280
Jinka

285
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm a goose

286
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,760
I'm a big white goose

287
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,840
Jinka

288
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm the prettiest

289
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm prettier than Ba Zimei

290
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
Suddenly one day

291
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
a Demon King appeared by Swan Push Lake

292
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
You'd better approach from that side

293
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,960
Okay, no problem

294
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,720
Right

295
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,920
Shalala energy

296
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,520
Big black goose transform

297
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,640
The Demon King used his magic

298
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,040
to turn the white goose into a black swan

299
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,840
You two still have to be backup dancers

300
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,360
You two can't go down

301
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,640
No, you'll always be beside the goose

302
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,640
It's not this long

303
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,000
That's it

304
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,840
I think

305
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,360
After we six finish rehearsing this

306
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,840
We won't get any more gigs

307
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,480
Let's create our own skit

308
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,080
Let's go out

309
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,400
Let's go out and get commercial performances

310
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,640
Just perform this scene

311
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,400
We'll strike it rich, I'm telling you

312
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,520
Then

313
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,120
Then after I finish dancing, I'll exit

314
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Then at this moment you enter

315
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,600
Here I come

316
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:19,960
Okay

317
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
Then you two exchange some moves

318
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,200
Alright, let's come from this side.

319
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,720
What a useless big brother.

320
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,680
Any time.

321
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
Any place.

322
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,400
Heavy rain.

323
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,200
Light rain.

324
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,480
Drizzle.

325
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,840
No, while you guys were fighting

326
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,200
I should have been dancing here

327
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,480
Both of us dancing on the side

328
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,280
Who would win?

329
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,640
Okay

330
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,400
Alright, let's try it once

331
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,160
Come on

332
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,640
Where's the person behind me?

333
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,800
Sorry

334
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,000
Here lives a group of

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,440
beautiful black swans

336
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,160
The most beautiful one

337
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,200
is Princess Jinka from a neighboring country

338
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
Jinka

339
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm a goose

340
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm a big white goose

341
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,640
Then one day

342
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,400
a great demon appeared by Tuie Lake

343
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
Push-Pull Energy

344
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,960
Big Black Goose Transformation

345
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,280
No, we need to freeze first

346
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,520
I should... wait a moment

347
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
There's a turn

348
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,280
Ready, go

349
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,880
Come, on stage

350
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,000
Backup dancers on stage

351
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Backup dancers

352
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,840
What's going on?

353
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,880
These two backup dancers

354
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,240
Begin

355
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
The Demon King is speechless

356
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,640
Why pick me?

357
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,560
The Demon King is speechless

358
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,840
Turn her into a goose

359
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
Legend says only the black swan

360
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,920
After finding true love

361
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,960
Can transform back

362
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,400
Hurry up

363
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,360
Prince Xiaoyu

364
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,880
Came to Push-Goose Lake to relax

365
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,640
Met the beautiful lone black swan

366
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,840
You're here

367
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
You two met

368
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,120
They bonded instantly

369
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,360
Fell in love with each other

370
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,400
Prince Xiaoyu secretly vowed

371
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,560
Vowing gesture

372
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,880
I'll defeat him

373
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,680
Must turn the princess back

374
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,720
Okay, I should go down now

375
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
Demon King enters

376
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,920
Issues a challenge

377
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,080
Here I come

378
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,720
Today either you die

379
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,600
Or you die

380
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,720
The Demon King is here

381
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,040
Who dares to misbehave?

382
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,120
Are you okay?

383
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm fine.

384
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,120
Heavy rain.

385
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,760
Light rain.

386
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,680
Drizzle.

387
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Let's step down.

388
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,240
I still have a...

389
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,160
And a "death."

390
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,880
For example...

391
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,320
Like this.

392
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,120
One, two, three.

393
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,440
Squat.

394
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
Okay.

395
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,800
I win.

396
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,680
And finally changed back into a gold card

397
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,640
Okay, he's lying down

398
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,880
Xiaoyu still needs to come up, right?

399
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,040
Yes, I'm lying here

400
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,280
I told you

401
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,040
But I worked so hard to become like this

402
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,280
Only to be changed back

403
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Our performance was truly breathtaking

404
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,720
Well done

405
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,080
Can you go third?

406
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,480
Sure.

407
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,440
No lights.

408
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,640
What?

409
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,520
Damn it.

410
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,320
I have to put my snacks down.

411
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,520
This is bad.

412
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,720
We have to go out first for the others to move.

413
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
Can’t we wait up front?

414
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,480
So scary.

415
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,360
Brother Bai.

416
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,320
Oh no, I’m kinda scared of the dark—what do I do?

417
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,640
You and Bai Yang aren’t together yet, right?

418
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,280
I don’t know.

419
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,480
There’s nothing here, just darkness.

420
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,000
From what I know about Bai,

421
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,560
he’ll probably try to scare us.

422
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,200
Who?

423
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,120
He went out.

424
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,160
Go up

425
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,600
Be careful

426
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,280
Watch out

427
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,800
Wait until it stops

428
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,720
Go up after it stops

429
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,760
Okay

430
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,200
Alright

431
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,200
Where did they go?

432
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,960
Could they have sent us to six different places?

433
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,120
Impossible, there's no place that big

434
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Bai Yangzuo

435
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,840
Look

436
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,440
Are you there?

437
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
This is

438
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,280
She's close

439
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,840
She's nearby

440
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,000
That means she'll reach that door soon

441
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,520
Right

442
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,360
I hear movement inside

443
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,920
There's a cameraman in there

444
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,560
Don't worry

445
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,680
Are you the cameraman?

446
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
I really don't dare go in

447
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,480
Too dark, it's really too dark

448
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Cameraman

449
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,080
What's that sound?

450
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
Wait a moment

451
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,800
Hey

452
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,200
What happens if I never come down?

453
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,200
We'll just pack up and leave anyway

454
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,800
You haven't gone down yet

455
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,320
No, I haven't

456
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm still on this elevator

457
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
So you're still in there, right?

458
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,640
I don't want to go to the toilet

459
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,880
Can you give me a different location?

460
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,520
Hello

461
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,520
The faithful girl is praying online

462
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,760
Next one's scarier - the morgue

463
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,840
You choose

464
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,080
No way

465
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm going in now, goodbye

466
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,320
You go ahead

467
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Can you handle it?

468
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,200
How could I not handle it?

469
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,400
Alright, fine

470
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,320
Good luck

471
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,920
Go get 'em, angel

472
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
My palms are sweating

473
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,360
I'm your brother and you didn't even say goodbye?

474
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,560
You might go in there

475
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
and never come back

476
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,400
Seriously? Don't scare me

477
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,160
See you in the next life

478
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,120
Brother

479
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,640
After entering the door

480
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,280
Can she not speak anymore?

481
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
She can speak

482
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,040
Xiao Ba

483
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,400
Soundproof

484
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,160
This is kinda scary

485
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,880
Why isn't Xiao Ba talking anymore?

486
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
Who

487
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,560
Bai Yangzuo

488
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,360
Bai Yangzuo

489
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,760
Why can they meet each other?

490
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Where is this place?

491
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,960
Huh

492
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Where am I?

493
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,600
What is this place?

494
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,200
The killer

495
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,320
Who's this?

496
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,080
Here, be careful.

497
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,760
Not a solid door

498
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,280
It's so dark I thought it was a solid door.

499
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,360
Is anyone there?

500
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,640
Is anyone there?

501
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,200
Bros, come save me quick!

502
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,520
Hurry, come save me!

503
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,360
If you don't save me soon, I'm gonna crash, fam.

504
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,360
I remember back in our first season,

505
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,800
were all the segments like this?

506
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,720
So many.

507
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Really?

508
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,520
Crawling through pipes,

509
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,720
and there was one time

510
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,440
when we had to push a whole floor together,

511
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
and then the floor would rotate.

512
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
That was fun, I think.

513
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,160
Yeah.

514
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,920
There was mystery and horror too.

515
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,920
I even had snacks in my pocket.

516
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,800
Who? We're trapped here,

517
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,880
yet we still have snacks?

518
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,800
To last a few days.

519
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
I just kept eating candy.

520
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Snacks stuffed in my pockets.

521
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
I’m telling you, there’s someone else here.

522
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
I heard it just now.

523
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,800
Inside here,

524
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,240
Didn't you see the big white coat hanging there?

525
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,120
Did you see it or not?

526
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,080
Okay

527
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm both scared

528
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,360
but also looking forward to this kind of thing

529
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,240
What should we do?

530
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,720
How about you go first?

531
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,960
No way

532
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,240
Brother Ning, you go first

533
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,680
If I go first

534
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,320
I might swing my arms around

535
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,040
and hit the people behind me

536
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,640
knocking over our own teammates

537
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,320
He even got my head stuck in the toilet

538
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,760
Seriously?

539
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,400
For real

540
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,920
I was looking for keys inside

541
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,160
He suddenly closed the door

542
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,360
and got my head stuck inside

543
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,440
Were there really keys in the toilet?

544
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,680
No

545
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,240
My head was inside

546
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,080
My head got squeezed by the door just now

547
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Got stuck in the door

548
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Ke Daole

549
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,880
Ke Daole

550
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,080
Why is your butt dirty again?

551
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,520
Is this dirt or manure?

552
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,240
Haven't I been risking my life for all of you?

553
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,880
Young Marshal He, you're being quite difficult today

554
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,080
Young Marshal Ning, you're like this every single day

555
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,360
Just go ahead and pin it all on me

556
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,640
Ever since early morning

557
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,760
It's Liu Yuning, no one else

558
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,520
The group has started investigating the little culprit

559
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
You caught me

560
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,920
He's feeling really bad today.

561
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,640
Stop looking at me.

562
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
The way you're looking at me today...

563
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,520
It's you.

564
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,440
There's no one else.

565
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,160
Do we even need to deduce this?

566
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,960
We can identify the culprit right now.

567
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
Your eyes are giving you away, I'm telling you.

568
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,040
I'll go get the microphone.

569
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,000
Randomly selected a passerby

570
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,520
You need to change your clothes

571
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,560
I'll put on my wings

572
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,400
What kind of thing

573
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
Wings, little wings

574
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,560
You're even wearing wings

575
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
I must have

576
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,880
a suspect

577
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
among the four of us, right?

578
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,680
Don't be nervous, don't talk too much

579
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,840
You've been acting strange since morning

580
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,920
Let me test them first

581
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,160
First of all, here's the situation.

582
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,960
Among the four of us,

583
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
we two were the culprits yesterday.

584
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,360
Who do you think might be the culprit?

585
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,360
Us two.

586
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,120
Right, so you two.

587
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,560
So what?

588
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,240
He said it was them yesterday.

589
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
So today it can only be

590
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,760
me and Zhang Linghe.

591
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,360
I also think you seem likely.

592
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,240
You think I seem like one?

593
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,040
You're picking a fight with me again today, huh?

594
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's keep going today then.

595
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,960
We'll settle this today.

596
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,320
I'll keep coming at you, mark my words.

597
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,680
If you lose to me twice,

598
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,560
will you cry?

599
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,480
I won't cry.

600
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,120
Why aren't you wearing your wings today?

601
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,360
They're inconvenient for killing.

602
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,200
There must be a reason.

603
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,160
What's going on?

604
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,480
Yesterday you were all "Sis this, Sis that,"

605
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,080
today you're the murderous demon—must be me!

606
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,800
If you can't have me, you'll destroy me?

607
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,160
The murderous demon is right beside you.

608
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
Watch your back.

609
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,720
Just figure out his game.

610
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,040
Forget it, don't play like this.

611
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,560
She'll break down if we push her today.

612
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,840
Let's wait till the end to expose her.

613
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,280
Are you just

614
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,560
using us again?

615
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,760
I need to watch out for you now.

616
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,760
No worries, listen—

617
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,800
I think you're a wolf in sheep's clothing.

618
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,640
Don't be nervous

619
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,880
Just act like the killer

620
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Sit down and rest for a while

621
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,480
Pressing me right now is really bad timing

622
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,400
It's a bit too early now, don't rush

623
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,880
You can't afford to be impatient right now

624
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
No, relax a little

625
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,040
Don't be so tense

626
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,280
No

627
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,240
Your mistake

628
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,560
was confronting me at this moment

629
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,480
Then you'll be in trouble

630
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,640
Who's against whom?

631
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm targeting you now

632
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
You must protect me

633
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,360
Only then can you survive

634
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,960
Alright

635
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,680
Do you understand?

636
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,400
You've fallen under his "mind control" again.

637
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,080
Great Demon King, just step on him.

638
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,200
I'll help you step on him too.

639
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,880
He's really suffering.

640
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,120
He's truly in pain today.

641
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,200
I don't think this is good for me.

642
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,360
How did I become Bai Yu?

643
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,600
Stepping on others without reason, huh?

644
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,320
In the first four episodes, he bullied you.

645
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,000
Then in the next four episodes, it was my turn.

646
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240
This poor guy.

647
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,160
This variety show has become traumatic.

648
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,240
I don't want to record anymore.

649
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,600
Every time my brother "mentally controls" me.

650
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,400
Mentally tortures me.

651
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,040
Fortunately,

652
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,440
Brother Yu was restrained yesterday.

653
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,120
By the reinforcements you called yesterday.

654
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,200
The reinforcements you brought dealt with him.

655
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,760
I really messed him up.

656
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,440
Made you so proud.

657
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,000
Made you so happy.

658
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,440
After playing so many episodes,

659
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,480
Can't I win just once?

660
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Were you ever close

661
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,280
to being caught yesterday?

662
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,280
I knew I had won yesterday.

663
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,120
When I was halfway through,

664
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,000
I knew victory was certain.

665
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Because he was already confused yesterday.

666
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,880
I really knew I had won yesterday.

667
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,320
I'm talking about that painting.

668
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,520
Only the painting can transport people.

669
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,440
Were you overjoyed?

670
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,400
Thinking, "What an idiot."

671
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,160
Not really.

672
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,960
Not that schadenfreude.

673
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,720
You three idiots, really.

674
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,440
Stepping on each other.

675
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,000
You kept repeating one thing:

676
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,040
"One box, one painting."

677
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,760
Then it seems

678
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,120
either he escapes or I escape.

679
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
We always win.

680
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,760
When we get into the plot later,

681
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,200
then you can step on me.

682
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,560
Stepping on me now is pointless.

683
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,160
Alright, I'm leaving.

684
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,240
I said today's thunder rumbling

685
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,520
must be Liu Yuning killing again.

686
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,080
Then we'll start searching for others' evidence

687
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,280
No, let's examine the evidence first

688
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,920
Let's take a look first

689
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,000
The evidence inside this

690
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,400
We haven't seen any of it

691
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,320
This is mine, right?

692
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
You're so familiar with this process

693
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,600
What's wrong?

694
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Just focus on being a good investigator

695
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,080
I'm already working very hard on this part

696
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,920
What I have here is the killer's evidence

697
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,520
You're acting really unusual, I'm telling you

698
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,480
You should watch your behavior a bit

699
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,800
You're unusually excited today

700
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,280
No, when he was still a commoner

701
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,320
he didn't act like this either

702
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,800
Don't tell me how to behave

703
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,800
It's not because of me, is it?

704
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,880
This catfish of mine

705
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,760
I don't even want to look at it.

706
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,920
Your evidence is so disgusting.

707
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,880
What's wrong with you?

708
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,080
I really don't dare to look.

709
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,800
Whose is this?

710
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,880
This belongs to our classmate Ning Hao.

711
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,960
A blood-stained cloth.

712
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Sorry about that.

713
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,280
The stain is huge, oh my god.

714
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,440
Didn't you go get a blood transfusion?

715
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,120
You've lost too much blood, right?

716
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,520
You have so much evidence today

717
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,320
A lot indeed

718
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,160
Let's examine them carefully

719
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
Please let us examine them carefully

720
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,880
If I were the murderer

721
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,280
Would you protect me?

722
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,440
Of course not

723
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,120
Become my X

724
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,000
Wait, I have quite a lot of evidence here

725
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,080
No problem, take your time

726
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,760
We need to open and check everything

727
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,920
Whose are you looking at?

728
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
Yours.

729
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
You... this man.

730
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,960
And you said you forgot me?

731
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,240
Finished reading.

732
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,120
Fine.

733
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,520
I never thought you were this kind of person.

734
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,920
Breaking up with you was the right choice.

735
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,240
Otherwise, my life would be in danger too.

736
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,560
I never noticed before

737
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,480
that you like to play these games

738
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,040
Wait a second

739
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,000
Wait, let me explain

740
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
I don't want to hear your explanations anymore

741
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,560
This explains everything

742
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,480
Wait, I have more evidence

743
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,720
Still want to see it?

744
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,280
Show it first, then we'll talk

745
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,560
Too much

746
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,720
The killer is like this

747
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,920
If this shot goes in, you're the killer

748
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,800
Killer

749
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,360
Wait till you see Brother Ning's hairstyle

750
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,960
Red hair

751
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,520
Very handsome

752
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,440
No

753
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,120
This basketball hoop is too high

754
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,720
Let's try touching the hoop first

755
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,640
Let me try

756
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,520
It is indeed higher

757
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,880
This is kind of bullying Bai Yu

758
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,680
You're really bullying people

759
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
I can't take it anymore

760
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,120
I killed people just yesterday and the day before

761
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,840
What about it?

762
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,920
I'm still standing here

763
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,440
Can't deal with you

764
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,080
I'm still standing here

765
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,040
Want me to help you stay alone?

766
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,160
After all, I am your girlfriend

767
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,200
Get out

768
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,280
Something's off, and you're closing the door

769
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,400
You're never this diligent normally

770
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,600
My suggestion is we should still look

771
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,280
The B in front isn't really B

772
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,920
Can one of you tanks come out?

773
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,880
No tanks, just us two

774
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,560
Please

775
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,720
We're all cowards

776
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,640
Please

777
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,080
Then let's do this

778
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,720
We won't let this door close

779
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,320
Right?

780
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,200
What's wrong?

781
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,480
Old Bai touched your thighs

782
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,600
Protect her

783
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,360
Whoever you say to vote for, I'll vote for

784
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,040
Protected
