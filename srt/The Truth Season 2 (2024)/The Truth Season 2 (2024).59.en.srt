"Start Reasoning" Trial Version

00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,440
Game Rules

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,440
Six players per episode

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,720
Divided into four suspects and two investigators

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,760
To solve the case

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,360
The real culprit is hidden among the suspects

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,120
The culprit's task is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,400
Without being discovered by other players

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,760
Only the real culprit is allowed to lie

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,800
Notably

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,440
A new gameplay element has been added

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,280
The player who is the culprit

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,280
If they pass a certain test

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,520
Can choose between the two investigators

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,680
To select one

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
And turn them into X

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,840
X's mission is to

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,160
During the investigation

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,200
Actively help the culprit escape

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,040
Victory conditions

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,640
After solving the case

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,600
Players vote for the culprit

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,240
If the culprit receives

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,880
Fewer votes than other suspects

25
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,120
Then the culprit and X win

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,000
Otherwise, players who voted correctly win

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,160
Welcome to

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,040
"Start Reasoning" Trial Version

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,360
I'm Reasoning Bao

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,200
Before the official recording

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,440

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,760
We've invited

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,920
Hou Zhuocheng and Yang Ruqing

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,640
Huang Kai and Hu Minghao

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,120
Six guests to visit Reasoning Town

37
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,760
For a trial gameplay experience

38
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,240
Now let me, Reasoning Bao

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,800
Watch and explain with everyone

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,440
The wonderful performances of Reasoning Town's new residents

41
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,000
The day before yesterday was the first day

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,560
of Reasoning Arts Academy's anniversary celebration

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,160
To win this Reasoning Arts Star award

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,000
First I want to thank everyone for your recognition

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,640
Outstanding graduate representative TYP

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
and classmate Zidaole were murdered

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,040
TYP

48
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,680
Classmate Ai Changge committed suicide by jumping off a building

49
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,880
I just saw in the dormitory courtyard

50
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,200
Ai Changge jumped to her death

51
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
Ai Changge

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Second day of the school anniversary

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,080
Someone has died

54
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
Classmate Ruisibai was murdered

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
Ruisibai

56
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,600
Everyone failed to catch the real culprit

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
letting them escape

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,560
As murders occurred one after another

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,880
students kept encountering

60
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,080
the strange phenomena described in campus horror stories

61
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm almost crying

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
Bloody footprints

63
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,080
What secrets are hidden

64
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
behind these urban legends?

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
Can everyone safely get through

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,000
the final day of the anniversary?

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,440
Today is the last day of the school anniversary celebration.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,920
The 2004 Tuiyi Basketball Friendship Match

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,120
is about to begin.

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,000
Now we'll use a

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
fun little game

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,760
to divide everyone into groups.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,880
This game is called

74
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,680
"Who calls whom dad"

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,520
Have you played before?

76
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,160
No

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,640
No

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
"Who is whose dad?"

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,120
Right

80
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
That's how it works

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,600
Let me demonstrate with Zhuocheng

82
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,640
"Who is whose dad?"

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,320
"I'm your son"

84
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
Right, that means I lose

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,440
So how do you win?

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,040
How do you win then?

87
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,000
Your seniority must be higher than the other person's

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
Just have higher seniority than them, right?

89
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,240
Yes

90
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,560
Okay

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,320
Another way to ask is

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,160
"Who calls whom dad?"

93
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
"I call you"

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,720
Saying it this way means I lose

95
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,400
If he says

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,760
"I call"

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,120
"I call you son"

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
Right, that would be correct

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,720
Understood

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,840
Okay, everyone do "rock-paper-scissors" first

101
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Rock-paper-scissors

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,880
Go

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,160
Alright

104
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,480
Losers do rock-paper-scissors

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,600
To see who wins and loses

106
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Who goes first

107
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
Okay, Zhuocheng goes first

108
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,920
Ready

109
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,320
Are you ready?

110
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,880
Start

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,520
"Who is whose son?"

112
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,520
"I call you dad"

113
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
This game

114
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,440
So how can we win in this situation?

115
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,360
He lost, right?

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
The loser - Nengneng

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,960
Now it's Minghao and Akai's turn.

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,640
Let's go.

119
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
This game.

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,440
The winner gets to attack, right?

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,480
Yes, first you decide who attacks whom.

122
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,680
One attack per round, correct?

123
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,640
Right, one round.

124
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,720
You can also do best two out of three.

125
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,800
It's up to you.

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,840
Rock, paper, scissors.

127
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,520
Scissors, paper.

128
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,320
You go ahead and attack.

129
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,760
Okay.

130
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,080
Between us, who's whose dad?

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,800
Between us, I'm your dad.

132
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,480
Which of us is whose son?

133
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,160
Between us, you're my son.

134
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,200
Which one of us is my son?

135
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,160
Between us, you're my son.

136
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,320
Which of us is whose father?

137
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,440
Between us, I'm your father.

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Which one of us calls the other father?

139
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,520
Between us, you call me father.

140
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,040
How about we just play rock-paper-scissors

141
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
Whoever wins takes it all

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,920
What's going on?

143
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,280
So...

144
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,120
You need to clap faster

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,520
Find your own rhythm

146
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,600
Yes, you're too slow

147
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
Which one of us is the dad here?

148
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,680
Then follow the beat

149
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, ready

150
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
Come on everyone, keep the beat together

151
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,680
Okay

152
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Put your ball down

153
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,840
Ready

154
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,120
Which one of us calls the other dad?

155
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
You should call me dad

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,720
Which one of us...

157
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,640
Who calls whom son?

158
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,920
You should call me son

159
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,840
Fine, as long as the rhythm's faster

160
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,440
Alright

161
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Then we'll automatically split into

162
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,960
Nengneng and A'kai as one team

163
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,680
Minghao and Zhuocheng as another

164
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
Now everyone come up with team names

165
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
Let's call it...

166
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
"Cheng"

167
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,120
"Cheng Ming"

168
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
"Make Cheng Ming in one battle"

169
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
"Kelly Oneng"

170
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,240
What about Kelly Owen?

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Kelly Owen

172
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,680
Kelly Oneng

173
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,120
Good

174
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,160
After choosing team names

175
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,040
a 2v2 basketball game

176
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
began in full swing

177
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,600
Kelly Oneng looks to pass this ball

178
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,720
No pass

179
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,360
Nengneng chooses to shoot directly

180
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,080
Beautiful!

181
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,800
Nice shot!

182
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
Our Oneng

183
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,200
What a beautiful shot

184
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,720
Kelly Owen

185
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,240
Block him

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Possession returns to

187
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
Nice shot

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
Okay

189
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,640
Our battle will make us famous

190
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
Guardian

191
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,840
The score is 10 to 4.

192
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,560
Alright, our game.

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
Only three minutes left.

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,080
Come on, basketball warriors!

195
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,640
Can we make a name for ourselves in this battle?

196
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Nice!

197
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,360
Beautiful!

198
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
Here we go again.

199
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,800
Another one in!

200
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:17,920
Great shot!

201
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,560
Nengneng, this is it.

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
Does this count as a three-pointer?

203
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Can we shoot directly?

204
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,200
Double-team!

205
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,720
Okay, last thirty seconds.

206
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,120
Nengneng, get ready.

207
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,400
Three-step layup.

208
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,280
Three.

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,760
Two.

210
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,400
One.

211
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,880
Alright.

212
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,360
It's over.

213
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,880
Good.

214
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,320
The victory goes to our team.

215
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,120
Kaili O'Neng

216
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
That's our Brother A'Kai

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,200
and Brother Nengneng

218
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
Awesome

219
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,000
For our annual basketball tournament

220
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,760
the award presenter

221
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,280
is always that year's Tuiyi Star

222
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,520
Isn't Ruqing this year's star?

223
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,360
Where's Ruqing?

224
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,920
Right

225
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Where is our Ruqing?

226
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,440
Have you seen her today?

227
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,480
No

228
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,280
Something's happened

229
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,680
Someone died in the library

230
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,440
Come quick

231
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
There's been a death in the library

232
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,320
Right when the Tuiyi basketball tournament ended

233
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,880
Xiao Wei came running to tell everyone

234
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,360
Someone died in the library

235
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,400
The library

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,000
Hurry

237
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,480
Hurry

238
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
Here

239
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,840
Everyone follows Xiao Wei

240
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,720
They go to the library exhibition hall and discover

241
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,720
Ru Qing

242
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,800
dead inside a cabinet in Exhibition Hall A

243
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
Ru Qing

244
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,800
This morning

245
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,200
I came to the library as a volunteer

246
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
Then at 11:20

247
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,640
I was about to leave

248
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,600
when I suddenly remembered I hadn't cleaned

249
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,160
last night's horror story exhibition

250
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,920
So I came to clean

251
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
When I arrived at Exhibition Hall A

252
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,720
I opened the cabinet door to wipe it down

253
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
and suddenly discovered a corpse inside

254
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
I was so scared I didn't even see the face clearly

255
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,920
and immediately came to tell you

256
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,200
I'll leave this to you

257
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
I need to get back to work

258
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,000
Bye

259
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
Thanks for your hard work, Xiao Wei

260
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,440
There's a knife.

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
Let me carry her out.

262
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,440
There's also a doll placed on top.

263
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,920
Is it a curse?

264
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
It looks like a voodoo doll.

265
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Right here in the middle of the doll...

266
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,440
There's also one...

267
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,040
There's also that...

268
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,760
There's a knife wound.

269
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,520
A knife wound, right?

270
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
So following this doll's...

271
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,000
pattern...

272
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
"Let's Start Deduction" Trial Version

273
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
Case Three:

274
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,120
Mystery Tales: Deadly Art Exhibition

275
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,560
Officially begins.

276
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,200
The date is June 5, 2004.

277
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,960
The victim in this case, Ru Qing,

278
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,960
was discovered

279
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
murdered in the library's

280
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,520
exhibition room cabinet.

281
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,480
Through initial investigation,

282
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
the perpetrator has been narrowed down to

283
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,320
A-Kai,

284
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,160
Luo Luo,

285
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,720
Zhuo Cheng,

286
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,960
and Ming Hao.

287
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Neng Neng is temporarily not a suspect,

288
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
and thus becomes this case's investigator.

289
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,600
After the investigators finished collecting evidence at the crime scene,

290
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,320
they brought the four suspects to the small auditorium.

291
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,840
for questioning.

292
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,640
As you all saw this morning,

293
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,240
Xiao Wei discovered the library

294
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,600
after we finished playing basketball.

295
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,040
There, we found

296
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,200
one of the victims—

297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
Ru Qing—

298
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,240
dead.

299
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,720
So, the time of the crime

300
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,960
was right after we finished playing basketball.

301
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,880
Then yesterday at dawn,

302
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,360
we went to visit

303
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,880
that interactive art exhibition

304
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,720
inside the library.

305
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,920
Today at midnight,

306
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
Nengneng,

307
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,960
Ruqing,

308
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,320
Luoluo,

309
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,240
Zhuocheng,

310
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,120
Akai,

311
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,040
and Minghao - all six of them

312
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
went to the library as agreed

313
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,840
to participate in the school anniversary event,

314
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,120
the "Mystical Arts Exhibition."

315
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
According to the exhibition rules,

316
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
they could only see each other

317
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,520
during the pre-show lottery draw.

318
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,560
After that,

319
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,080
they entered their assigned exhibition halls

320
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
and didn't meet again

321
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
until leaving after the show ended.

322
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,440
It wasn't until this morning's basketball game

323
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
that the five of us met again.

324
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,640
But Ruqing was nowhere to be seen.

325
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
Where's our Ruqing?

326
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
Did any of you see her today?

327
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,880
No.

328
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,440
Ruqing's body

329
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,480
was discovered in

330
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
the cabinet of Exhibition Hall A

331
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
where she had been during the exhibition.

332
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,400
The murder weapon

333
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,680
was a knife stabbed into her left chest.

334
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
Detective Nengneng put forward

335
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,560
his initial suspicions.

336
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,760
The exhibition lasted from

337
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,680
midnight to 12:30 AM,

338
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
so during that time

339
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
everyone saw Ruqing present.

340
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,480
But this morning,

341
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
none of us saw Ruqing.

342
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,360
Right, so

343
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,240
I deduce that

344
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,920
Ruqing's

345
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,000
time of death was likely

346
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,240
between midnight and 12:30 AM.

347
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,520
The time Ruqing was killed

348
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,560
probably occurred during the exhibition.

349
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,520
Therefore,

350
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,600
Nengneng focused his investigation

351
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,080
on the exhibition.

352
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,320
Nengneng found the exhibition hall's

353
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,520
reservation log

354
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,160
and exhibition guide.

355
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,040
This exhibition hall

356
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,720
was built in 2003.

357
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,680
It opens annually during the school anniversary.

358
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,840
Only six visiting slots are available each year.

359
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,960
First come, first served.

360
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,480
The first two registered visitors

361
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,640
will automatically reserve Hall A and Hall B.

362
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,200
The remaining four visitors

363
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,480
will be assigned based on registration order

364
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
through a lottery

365
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,680
to select from Halls C to F.

366
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,440
Ruqing was the first to make a reservation.

367
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,240
I was the second to make a reservation.

368
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,120
Following this order,

369
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,040
Ruqing is in Hall A.

370
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,760
I'm in Hall B.

371
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,360
The remaining spots were assigned by lottery.

372
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,400
So,

373
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,480
Who's in Hall C?

374
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,640
Zhuocheng is in Hall C.

375
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,360
Yes, I'm in Hall C.

376
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm in Hall C.

377
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
Who's in Hall D?

378
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,880
Hall D is me.

379
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,840
Akai.

380
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,000
Hall E.

381
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Hall E is me.

382
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
Hall F is me.

383
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,200
After identifying everyone's assigned exhibition halls,

384
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
Nengneng shared with everyone

385
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
a document found on the computer -

386
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,240
the audio guide for the experience exhibition.

387
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,880
This guide carefully helped everyone

388
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
review

389
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,960
the experience process from early morning.

390
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,040
Welcome students

391
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,680
to the Tuiyi Mystery Art Exhibition.

392
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,920
The first two students who reserved

393
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,800
are assigned to visit Hall A.

394
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,720
Students ranked third to sixth in reservations

395
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,480
will need to draw lots

396
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
according to reservation order.

397
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,920
All members present

398
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,120
All exhibition hall doors

399
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,520
are now locked

400
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,200
Students in the previous room

401
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
Before unlocking the door

402
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,880
you cannot return

403
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,320
Please observe your current exhibition hall

404
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
At the center of each hall

405
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,680
lies a magic circle

406
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,280
The circle surrounds a central display cabinet

407
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,760
Everyone, begin circling the magic array

408
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,720
counterclockwise

409
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,360
Then, focus on the doll at the cabinet's center

410
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,880
visualize it as your deepest fear

411
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,040
Pick up the knife in your hall

412
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,280
and stab it

413
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,640
Attention, everyone

414
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,200
From this moment onward

415
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,320
you must stay in place

416
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Do not move

417
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,040
until the candle ignites

418
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Please blow out the candles in front of you

419
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,640
Pull the knife out of the doll

420
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,040
The exhibition experience ends here

421
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
Exhibition Hall B

422
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,440
Exhibition Hall C

423
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Exhibition Hall D

424
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,440
Students in Exhibition Hall E

425
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,600
Press the access control button on the connecting door

426
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,560
Students in Exhibition Hall A, please leave the hall

427
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,560
Students in Exhibition Hall B, please leave the hall

428
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,280
Students in Exhibition Hall C, please leave the hall

429
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,800
Students in Exhibition Hall D, please leave the hall

430
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,600
Students in Exhibition Hall E, please leave the hall

431
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,160
Students in Exhibition Hall F, please leave the hall

432
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,480
Move forward

433
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,800
Don't look back

434
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,600
So when it officially begins

435
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,760
Main gate

436
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,520
The gate connecting to Hall A

437
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,480
Will all be closed

438
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,160
Correct

439
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,840
Halls ABCDE

440
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,160
All doors will be closed

441
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,920
Until the exhibition concludes

442
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,880
Only then

443
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,600
Will all gates be unlocked

444
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,000
Moreover, in each exhibition hall

445
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,400
There are one-way access controls

446
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,840
What does one-way access control mean?

447
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,760
For example,

448
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,160
students who enter Exhibition Hall F

449
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
if they want to exit,

450
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,360
only students in Exhibition Hall E

451
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,480
can press the access control button

452
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,400
to let them out.

453
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,840
This pattern continues accordingly:

454
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,960
When students in Hall E want to exit,

455
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,280
only those in Hall D

456
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,880
can press the button

457
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,640
to release them.

458
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,680
Another important point is

459
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,760
I noticed on the lottery box

460
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,600
(where you all drew your lottery balls)

461
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,880
there was an access control

462
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
usage log nearby.

463
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,360
Exhibition Hall Access Button Usage Log

464
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
All access controls were used once

465
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,360
at

466
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,840
12:30 AM on June 5th.

467
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,400
At exactly 12:30 AM,

468
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
all halls A through F

469
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,480
access controls

470
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,200
were activated once.

471
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,440
This was presumably when the exhibition ended

472
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,320
and everyone released each other.

473
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,800
Therefore,

474
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,320
when the experience exhibition concluded

475
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,880
at exactly 12:30 AM,

476
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,400
all doors were opened

477
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,560
just this one time.

478
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,800
There are no other access control

479
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
usage records at any other time.

480
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,880
So,

481
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
here comes the doubt.

482
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,240
After it ended,

483
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,520
Ruqing from Exhibition Hall A left first.

484
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,480
After a while, the guide led me

485
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,160
from Exhibition Hall B

486
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,880
During the process, we were told to move forward without looking back.

487
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,760
Did you see Ruqing leave?

488
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,960
No, I didn't.

489
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,680
Actually, I waited

490
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,120
until Ruqing left,

491
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,440
then moved from Hall B to Hall A

492
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,840
before finally exiting.

493
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,160
But when I passed through Hall A,

494
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,400
I didn't see Ruqing.

495
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,680
So she might have died at that time,

496
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,960
or possibly after midnight,

497
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,160
after everyone had left.

498
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,680
She might have been killed and brought back.

499
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,600
There are several possibilities.

500
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,440
Actually, in this

501
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,080
exhibition hall reservation list,

502
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,280
as you can see in 2003,

503
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,040
I mentioned there were six people.

504
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,040
In 2004, it was the same six of us.

505
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,160
Other than these six who made reservations,

506
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,680
no one else knew the hall's layout

507
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,240
or how to use it.

508
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
Apart from the two who died,

509
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,760
there are ten people left.

510
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,320
Xiao Dong, Xiao Xi, Xiao Nan, Xiao Wei,

511
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,560
and the five of us.

512
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,640
Only these ten of us

513
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,600
know the entire internal layout,

514
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,760
the visiting procedure,

515
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,080
and the security access sequence.

516
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,640
One possibility is that

517
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,960
Xiao Dong, Xiao Xi, Xiao Wei, or Xiao Gang

518
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,560
might have first

519
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,400
informed one of us.

520
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,920
So, if this year's people want to know

521
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,960
the details of this exhibition hall,

522
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,560
they must have learned in advance—

523
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,280
either they are

524
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
the same people from last year,

525
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,880
or last year's participants told them.

526
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Right—or they truly experienced it

527
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
during the exhibition themselves.

528
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
They saw it firsthand.

529
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,200
Another possibility is

530
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,480
that last year's participants

531
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,280
told them.

532
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,320
Or, among us,

533
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
there might be someone from last year.

534
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,720
Since the exhibition hall is usually closed to the public

535
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,920
and the exhibition process is highly complex,

536
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,360
everyone believes

537
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,040
that if someone wanted to kill Ruqing

538
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,080
during the exhibition,

539
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,400
they would need prior knowledge of the layout.

540
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,920
Thus, they might have some connection

541
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,240
to those who attended last year's exhibition.

542
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,880
Somehow, they're linked.

543
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,880
As the questioning continued,

544
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,720
each person's motive for murder

545
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,360
gradually came to light.

546
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,920
Let me share with everyone

547
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,400
my evidence.

548
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,520
Luoluo found in the music room

549
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,800
a sheet music folded into a butterfly shape

550
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,320
titled "A Butterfly".

551
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,440
Both lyrics and music were composed by Zhuocheng.

552
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,680
Only then did everyone realize

553
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,840
Zhuocheng had a very close cousin

554
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
I once had

555
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
a very close cousin

556
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,040
whose name was Hudie (Butterfly).

557
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,560
He was extremely kind

558
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,080
but somewhat introverted.

559
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,840
However, in the eyes of teachers and parents,

560
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,360
he was an exemplary student

561
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,080
or rather, a particularly sensible

562
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,640
child.

563
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,840
And then,

564
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,360
I cared for and loved him deeply,

565
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,880
looking after him.

566
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,920
Our relationship was extremely close.

567
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,400
But because

568
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,600
his name was Hudie (Butterfly)

569
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,120
and he was a boy,

570
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,560
he would often face

571
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,320
mockery from classmates

572
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,960
who thought he was a girl.

573
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,680
After hearing about this situation,

574
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,360
I was still comforting him,

575
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
telling him to just ignore them,

576
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,520
that they were just joking with him,

577
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,680
and so on.

578
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,080
Then I even wrote

579
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,200
this song for him,

580
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,240
"A Butterfly".

581
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,640
But unexpectedly his pride

582
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,560
was extremely strong.

583
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,480
After seeing this song,

584
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,640
when I asked if he liked it,

585
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,600
he wouldn't respond.

586
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,640
Asked him to get noodles,

587
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,760
he wouldn't go with me.

588
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,800
Later when I tried contacting him again,

589
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,920
he never replied anymore.

590
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,840
So your younger brother,

591
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,520
your brother

592
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,320
now just

593
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,400
has no contact with you?

594
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
Basically after hearing the song you gave him,

595
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,040
he stopped contacting you.

596
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,440
Right, he got angry.

597
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,560
So what we know is

598
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,480
you have a

599
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,800
brother you don't contact.

600
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,360
Yes.

601
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,720
Cousin.

602
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,240
Okay.

603
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,000
Good, this is the second piece of evidence.

604
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,480
The memory box

605
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,520
Then in one filled with

606
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,240
Hu Die's memories,

607
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,200
everyone found that Hu Die was mocked

608
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,320
for having a girlish name.

609
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,400
There was a boy's photo

610
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,800
but it seemed someone had drawn

611
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,960
some feminine features on it.

612
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,120
Beside it was written:

613
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,360
"Little butterfly in floral dress,

614
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
dancing gracefully while singing,

615
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,280
turns out he's a flower girl."

616
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,000
So after cutting ties with cousin Zhuocheng,

617
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
he changed his name to Hu Jie,

618
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,800
who is A-Kai's roommate.

619
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,160
He hoped that by changing his name,

620
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,840
he could leave the mockery behind.

621
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,800
The school's certificate states

622
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,880
Hu Die, a student from Class 1, Grade 8 of our school

623
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,600
due to her name being frequently misunderstood by classmates

624
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,320
has now changed her registered name to Hu Jie

625
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,200
There was a sentence written below:

626
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,480
"Farewell to the past"

627
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,440
"Start anew, Hu Jie"

628
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,160
But unexpectedly,

629
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,680
when Hu Jie entered university,

630
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,480
he still endured

631
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,360
the covert bullying from classmates.

632
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
I thought leaving behind

633
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,240
Hu Jie's hellish past

634
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
would welcome a new world,

635
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,280
but Hu Jie's kindness

636
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,080
was just self-deception all along.

637
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Like someone trapped in quicksand,

638
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,680
struggling with all their might

639
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
only sinks deeper instead.

640
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,320
When selected as the last

641
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,400
"Pushing Art Star" nominee,

642
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,520
#600 - Hu Jie.

643
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
Because they didn't want to face

644
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,920
the pain of being treated as invisible

645
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,240
and chose to commit suicide by jumping into the Wukenai River

646
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,880
When did Hu Jie commit suicide?

647
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,400
On the evening of June 4th

648
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,680
Because I saw this letter

649
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,880
and then in the Wukenai River

650
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,120
Hu Jie's body was discovered

651
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,160
Apart from those related to my cousin,

652
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
there's another memory box.

653
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,000
Zhuocheng has another box,

654
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,520
which was found yesterday at Ruisi's

655
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,040
secret hideout.

656
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,520
That locked box

657
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,640
has now been opened.

658
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,280
Inside were

659
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,040
notes between Ruisi and Ruqing.

660
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,240
The notes revealed that

661
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,080
when they were young, Ruisi's careless remark

662
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
led to Ruqing being bullied.

663
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,840
Under her grandfather's

664
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,800
harsh demands,

665
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,160
Ruqing became increasingly extreme,

666
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,120
targeting every

667
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
classmate who outperformed her.

668
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,880
Ai's singing voice and skills were too good.

669
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
No matter how hard I try,

670
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
I could never surpass her before

671
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,840
the Carmen auditions on June 8th.

672
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,960
Ruqing demanded Ruisi manipulate

673
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
the Star Pushing contest votes,

674
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
making both Ai Singing and Hu Jie

675
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,000
finish last in the competition,

676
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,400
being ignored by the whole school,

677
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,760
which led to both their suicides.

678
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,040
Ruisi wanted to expose Ruqing's misdeeds

679
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,840
but was killed the night before.

680
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,960
When questioned about

681
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
how he got the box,

682
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,400
Zhuocheng claimed ignorance.

683
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,480
"That box mysteriously

684
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,840
appeared in my room.

685
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,240
When we took it from Ruisi's

686
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,000
secret hideout yesterday,

687
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,160
it was locked.

688
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,760
Yes,

689
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,120
but when it reached my room,

690
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,680
it was already open.

691
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Could it be that

692
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,920
the person who slipped me that note

693
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,480
was Ruqing?

694
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,560
For our safety,

695
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,400
don't meet in person.

696
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,320
Just pass notes

697
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,760
through the door."

698
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,720
I think his current attitude towards

699
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
Ru Qing's motive for murder

700
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,800
is quite obvious.

701
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,200
After all, his dearest younger brother

702
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
because of this incident,

703
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,680
whether it was suicide or homicide,

704
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
had suffered from

705
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,160
because he had been bullied.

706
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
Zhuo Cheng sought revenge for his cousin,

707
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
but then why did Luo Luo

708
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
A Kai found

709
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,600
a notebook documenting Luo Luo's daily behaviors.

710
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,880
It recorded Luo Luo's catchphrases,

711
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,560
behavioral habits,

712
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,960
favorite foods,

713
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
preferred hairstyles, and other details.

714
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,240
The tone of description wasn't Luo Luo's own,

715
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,560
but more like someone else imitating Luo Luo,

716
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,720
reminding themselves how to act.

717
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,080
Must remember to maintain Luo Luo's

718
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,840
occasional body twitches

719
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,560
from yesterday.

720
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,640
What's with the body twitches?

721
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Some of these past two days'

722
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,280
were just being cursed.

723
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,680
Right.

724
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,560
So who wrote about Luo Luo?

725
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Do you want to explain?

726
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,680
You wrote it yourself.

727
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,640
So you're not Luo Luo

728
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,040
I

729
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,800
Alright, since you've watched this far

730
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,320
you should be able to guess

731
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,240
that in fact this entire segment

732
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
was written by Ai Singing

733
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
This body belongs to Luoluo.

734
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,760
It's Ai Singing who entered into me.

735
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,360
into Luoluo's body.

736
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,600
Then the one who jumped off the building...

737
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,800
was it Luoluo or Ai Singing?

738
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,920
It was Ai Singing.

739
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,200
I thought I had died.

740
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
But unexpectedly, I'm still alive.

741
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,320
Then I found another piece of evidence.

742
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
Also in your pillowcase.

743
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,400
It was a voice recorder.

744
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,240
Let's play it.

745
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,520
Ruqing.

746
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
Last year I did as you told me.

747
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,000
Made sure no one could vote for Ai Singing.

748
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,160
You successfully became

749
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
the female lead of "Trapped in Carmen".

750
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,000
Isn't that enough?

751
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,360
Now you want me to block votes for Hu Jie again?

752
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,080
How many more dirty deeds must I do for you?

753
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,640
You're quite amusing.

754
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,040
I suggest you think carefully.

755
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,920
I understand.

756
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,720
I'll do it.

757
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,920
These two girls must be

758
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,480
Ruqing and Ruisi Bai, right?

759
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,040
Yes.

760
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,840
Why do you have this?

761
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,920
Didn't Ruisi Bai die last night?

762
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,000
At night, I secretly entered

763
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,320
their room.

764
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
I was looking for evidence.

765
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,880
Because I was wondering

766
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
why they would treat me this way.

767
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,360
Am I really

768
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
so detestable to everyone?

769
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,760
Right?

770
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,880
I really want to know

771
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,840
exactly why.

772
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,120
To Luoluo,

773
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
I was always just her servant.

774
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
I treated her as a friend,

775
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,520
yet this is how she treated me.

776
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,640
This truly makes me feel so miserable.

777
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,560
And the last place in the "Push the Star" competition

778
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,360
was actually manipulated by Ruisi Bai

779
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,720
to rig the votes.

780
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,280
I can't understand what reason

781
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,720
could be behind this.

782
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,920
Because Ruqing, who was clearly in second place,

783
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,120
in this "Push the Star" competition,

784
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,200
benefited from this.

785
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,280
If I hadn't been ignored

786
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,760
and lost my partner,

787
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
it would have been hard for her to surpass me

788
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,720
and become the female lead in "Carmen Inside."

789
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,640
But she appeared so kind-hearted

790
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,040
Could she really have done such a thing?

791
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,560
So I carried this doubt with me

792
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,400
and came to their dormitory

793
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,320
I wanted to know the truth

794
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,280
That's why this voice recorder

795
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,000
was what I found in their room

796
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It was secretly recorded by Sisi

797
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,560
Their conversation

798
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,040
So all of this

799
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,080
was Ru Qing's doing

800
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,120
She was the real mastermind

801
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,080
Now I've seen through this

802
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,600
hypocritical woman

803
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,480
I'll expose her true nature

804
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,920
for everyone to see

805
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,760
So your motive for killing Ru Qing

806
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,320
was quite obvious, right?

807
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,680
I didn't know when I could

808
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,160
while in Luo Luo's body

809
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,640
So I also didn't know

810
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,760
when I could kill Ru Qing

811
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,320
Because at any moment

812
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,200
"Brothers, why am I here again?"

813
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,720
It's that Luo Luo didn't want to kill

814
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
but Xiao Ai wanted to kill

815
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,480
Sister Xiao Ai

816
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,080
Wasn't she already dead?

817
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,800
Last night at 8 PM

818
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,600
What were you doing after 8 PM?

819
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,520
From 8 PM to midnight

820
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
what were you doing during that time?

821
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
I was just...

822
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,200
Right, I don't remember

823
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,120
Because I was...

824
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
I was Xiao Ai singing

825
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,680
Meaning last night

826
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,280
You were still Xiao Ai singing

827
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,440
My memories are very confused

828
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
I only remember that I...

829
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,120
When I became Xiao Ai singing

830
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,480
I went rummaging through things

831
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,760
That angry-voiced DIVA tone of yours

832
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,560
Must be Luo Luo

833
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,800
No

834
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
Luo Luo likes putting on a sweet voice

835
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
To tell everyone

836
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,600
Only this way can she show off

837
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,480
Her angry-voiced DIVA side

838
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,040
Which is very sexy

839
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,120
I don't need to peacefully break up

840
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,880
with that Luo Luo anymore

841
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,400
She's both Xiao Ai singing and Luo Luo anyway

842
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,640
You're quite happy about this, aren't you?

843
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,560
Spending all day dreaming this nonsense

844
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
Luoluo

845
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,440
No, it's Ai Singing

846
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,440
Ai Singing found out

847
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,840
that Rü Qing was the mastermind behind bullying her

848
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,760
and thus developed a murderous intent towards Rü Qing

849
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,400
Similar to Xiao Ai singing,

850
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,920
A-Kai also discovered last night

851
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,480
the evil deeds Ruqing had committed.

852
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,400
After opening it, there was this

853
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,040
search engine.

854
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,320
It said "search here"

855
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,120
There was a browsing history, and then

856
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,040
Tweeter Empire.

857
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,960
Tweeter Arts Horror Section.

858
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,480
Horror Truth.

859
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,800
Exclamation mark!

860
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
"Destined visitors only."

861
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,320
"Posts deleted after 24 hours."

862
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,560
Then this post could be clicked into,

863
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,200
inside was our old friend

864
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Tweeter Empire's forum.

865
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,000
It said "Chapter 1: Casting Curses."

866
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,520
"Tweeter Arts Horror was formed by ancient curses."

867
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,640
"Any student who transforms into a monster on campus"

868
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,480
"was cursed by the same method."

869
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
"The curse method is as follows:"

870
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,920
"In the night study room,"

871
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,360
"there's a secret shrine with special magnetic fields."

872
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,440
"On the secret shrine,"

873
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,520
"place a person's personal belonging"

874
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,160
"and attach a curse to that item,"

875
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,720
"then the curse will take effect."

876
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,880
"Then Chapter 2 is about breaking curses,"

877
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,960
but this part wasn't captured.

878
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,280
Then there was a school uniform top,

879
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,880
with a name tag saying "Ruqing."

880
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,560
Except the "qing" character's

881
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,840
right side was cut off.

882
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,960
So it was Ruqing's name tag

883
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,480
that appeared in this picture.

884
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,720
Although this post

885
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,040
didn't show the specific curse-breaking method

886
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,200
but A-Kai analyzed the photo information

887
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,240
Then I examined the photo carefully

888
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,600
and noticed the character "Ru" written nearby

889
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,040
probably referring to Ruqing

890
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,560
And the bed behind her

891
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,760
looked like a dormitory bed

892
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,640
So I wondered if it might be Dorm 102

893
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,920
I concluded that the poster

894
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,120
was in Ruqing's dorm

895
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,360
when they took the photo

896
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
So I went to Ruqing's dorm

897
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,800
to look for clues

898
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,280
I suspected Ruqing might be

899
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,040
the one who cursed me

900
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,520
So I went to Dorm 102

901
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,720
to investigate everything

902
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,120
Her door was slightly ajar

903
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,000
I pushed it open and saw no one inside

904
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So I entered

905
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
I searched through everything

906
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,000
In her drawer

907
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,040
I found a document folder

908
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,360
containing a document

909
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,040
that mentioned cursing and curse-breaking

910
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,400
The curse-breaking method stated:

911
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
The curse-caster and the cursed person

912
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,200
will share the same fate

913
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,720
Unless the caster dies

914
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,840
the curse will never be broken

915
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,600
Then I found a sticky note

916
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,320
with a QQ number and password

917
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,520
I immediately ran back to my dorm

918
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,360
to try logging in

919
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,400
and discovered that

920
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,680
it was Rui Sisi's account credentials

921
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,040
So at that time I thought

922
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Could it be that Ruqing herself believed

923
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,840
if she asked me for personal belongings

924
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,520
I wouldn't give them to her

925
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,280
That's why she pretended to be Ruisi Bai

926
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,960
Using this method

927
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,840
To make me give personal items for her to curse me

928
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,160
What I thought was

929
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,360
I found a way to break the curse

930
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,200
Her reason for cursing no longer mattered

931
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,680
All I thought was I must kill her

932
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,240
To lift the curse on me

933
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,120
That's all

934
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,360
As coincidence would have it,

935
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,080
Minghao's experience last night with Akai

936
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,040
was almost identical.

937
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,640
He also saw

938
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,280
the same post on Tweet Empire,

939
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,000
went to Ruqing's dorm to verify,

940
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,600
and found the sticky note

941
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,840
that Akai had left behind.

942
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,480
At 10:25 PM on June 4th,

943
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,680
I went to Sisi's dorm room 102,

944
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,880
and found a sticky note

945
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
in her cabinet.

946
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,760
It had a QQ number and password.

947
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,360
I tried logging in

948
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,320
and actually

949
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,360
accessed Sisi's QQ account.

950
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,280
This proves Ruqing had

951
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,560
Sisi's QQ account and password.

952
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,280
So the one who messaged me

953
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,080
asking for my personal items

954
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,320
must have been Ruqing.

955
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,280
Minghao also believes

956
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,520
Ruqing used Sisi's QQ account

957
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,360
to request his personal items

958
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,720
to curse him.

959
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,240
To break the curse,

960
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,520
Ruqing must be killed -

961
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,840
the one who cast the spell.

962
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,720
No matter why she cursed me,

963
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,320
the only way to lift this pig transformation curse

964
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,680
is to kill her.

965
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,520
So I have to kill her

966
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,080
to remove the curse on me.

967
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,520
At this point,

968
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,560
the murder motives of all four suspects

969
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,040
have become completely clear.

970
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,680
But could there be an X in this case?

971
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,920
Next,

972
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
we will proceed to the X confirmation phase.

973
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,440
I think today's question

974
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
should have an X in it

975
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,040
Yes, I am X

976
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,840
Whether there's really an X today

977
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,720
Let's continue watching to find out

978
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,240
Alright, let's take a look one by one

979
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,120
at the exhibition halls each person stayed in, okay?

980
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,720
Let's go

981
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,680
This is the exhibition hall corridor.

982
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,040
This is Exhibition Hall A.

983
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,200
It's the crime scene from earlier.

984
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,680
Right.

985
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,280
Did you search this room earlier?

986
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,360
Just this one and the hallway.

987
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,480
Then should we go inside first?

988
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,000
Let's go to Room B first.

989
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,440
Okay.

990
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,160
Could there be something in the painting?

991
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,960
Alright, we're in Room B now.

992
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
B is where Nengneng was before.

993
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes, it's my room.

994
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,320
There's a knife here.

995
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,320
Everyone has one.

996
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,280
So we need to insert this doll...

997
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,960
...with this knife, right?

998
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,720
Yes, for this ritual.

999
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,280
So the knife in Room A...

1000
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,680
...is on Ruqing's body.

1001
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,840
On Ruqing's body.

1002
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,840
The access control for C...

1003
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,800
...you have to press it to open.

1004
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,960
In each exhibition hall...

1005
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,320
...there's one-way access control.

1006
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,600
If someone in E wants to come out...

1007
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,520
...only someone in D can press the control...

1008
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,240
...to let them out.

1009
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,920
The door only opens when you press the control.

1010
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,360
There's an extra ball here.

1011
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,360
A lottery ball.

1012
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,560
Is this a ball for drawing lots?

1013
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Because sections A and B

1014
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,480
don't have these lottery balls.

1015
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:29,880
Right.

1016
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,280
Only sections C through F have them.

1017
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,480
Visitors with reservations ranked last four

1018
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,560
will draw lots in order of reservation

1019
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,640
to determine

1020
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,640
which exhibition hall (C-F) they'll visit.

1021
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,960
Correct.

1022
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,480
Let's take a look first.

1023
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,360
Room D.

1024
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,440
Why is A-Kai walking so fast?

1025
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,760
Are you trying to make us miss some clue?

1026
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,280
Hiding something?

1027
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
No.

1028
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,120
This is D's access control.

1029
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,360
But to exit, then how exactly...

1030
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,160
It's one-way.

1031
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,080
The person ahead must press this button

1032
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,840
for the door to open.

1033
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,600
Only then can people leave this room.

1034
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,320
Check if there's anything in the cabinet.

1035
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,200
Nothing in the cabinet.

1036
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,240
There's a carpet here.

1037
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,720
There wouldn't be a hole here, would there?

1038
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,640
It won't open.

1039
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,880
This is the E access control, right?

1040
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,720
Who stays in E?

1041
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
E is where Luo Luo stays.

1042
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,800
E is Luo Luo's, correct.

1043
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,840
Let's open F instead.

1044
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,560
There's nothing left here.

1045
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,760
What's the matter?

1046
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,680
Annoying.

1047
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,600
Come here.

1048
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,960
This is the last door.

1049
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,160
Then F and A are connected.

1050
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,760
Do you have a diagram?

1051
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
You just drew a diagram, right?

1052
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,720
So impressive

1053
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Then these rooms

1054
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,760
seem to have nothing in them

1055
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,040
Then how do we get out from F?

1056
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,240
E would let me out

1057
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,240
then D would let E out, like this

1058
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,600
According to current clues, that's how it works

1059
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,880
What's behind this?

1060
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,720
Access control system with one-touch fingerprint unlock

1061
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,600
All who have registered fingerprints at the library

1062
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,840
have access privileges

1063
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,760
After touching the fingerprint scanner

1064
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,840
all exhibition hall doors will unlock

1065
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,160
Doors from Hall A to F will become bidirectional

1066
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,080
All doors can open/close freely up to six times total

1067
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,360
Each opening must be closed within three seconds

1068
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,080
Note: after six total openings/closings

1069
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,680
all one-way doors will lock

1070
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,520
Can only open via door access buttons

1071
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,360
So when it's dark

1072
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,880
this door doesn't need outside activation

1073
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,760
it can still open outward

1074
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,120
It remains bidirectional

1075
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,160
So I can exit by myself?

1076
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,360
Each of us can

1077
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,080
use this

1078
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,440
They all use this fingerprint

1079
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,960
And the fingerprint recognition is

1080
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,560
The fingerprint recognition is on this part

1081
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
It's this sun

1082
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,160
Only you have this

1083
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,240
This is my room

1084
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,480
But only I have this here

1085
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,320
But there's one issue with this

1086
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,160
It might not necessarily be him

1087
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,680
Because it's currently Room F, right?

1088
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,640
This one in front

1089
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,960
Its only exit is E, right?

1090
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,400
This person in front

1091
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,600
And he could also press this

1092
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,760
Taking advantage of the darkness

1093
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,520
Then if you walk out

1094
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
Wouldn’t you be seen?

1095
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,760
No

1096
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,840
Because there’s a period when it’s dark

1097
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,880
From now on

1098
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,560
You must stay where you are

1099
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,840
Don’t move

1100
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,040
Until the candle is lit

1101
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,400
And the music starts playing

1102
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,720
You might not hear footsteps

1103
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,240
He’s using this gap

1104
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
He said we'd have to come back six times

1105
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,600
He actually didn't do it enough times, right?

1106
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,640
Let's try walking through

1107
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,280
Let's give it a try

1108
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,080
You press it

1109
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,960
Once

1110
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,400
Right

1111
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,600
Then we need to walk through quickly

1112
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,160
Twice

1113
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,080
There's music

1114
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,760
Twice

1115
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,440
Three times

1116
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,920
Four times

1117
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,800
That makes four times now

1118
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,200
I can't go back

1119
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,320
I can't go back now

1120
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,800
But the last person doesn't need to go back

1121
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,760
Because when we leave

1122
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,640
We go one by one

1123
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,520
If you don't go back, no one will notice you did

1124
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,920
Four times, then what?

1125
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,680
Then you go again

1126
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,080
Watch your step

1127
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,160
Five times

1128
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,640
Okay, I need five times to get here

1129
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,520
Then I'll...

1130
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,120
Kill her

1131
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,080
Kill her

1132
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,840
Put her in

1133
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,520
Then put her body inside

1134
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:26,960
Put it in

1135
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,440
Then I...

1136
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,480
Then you leave

1137
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
You mean then I open the door and leave, right?

1138
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,960
Take a look at our

1139
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,480
Everyone, please blow out the candles in front of you

1140
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Pull the knife out from the doll

1141
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,880
The exhibition experience ends here

1142
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,400
So you must go back

1143
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,080
Otherwise you can't blow out your own candle

1144
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,520
Everyone is in Minghao's F Exhibition Hall

1145
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,040
They discovered a fingerprint unlocking system

1146
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,200
They deduced that someone could move around when the lights are off

1147
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,640
Go to the F Exhibition Hall

1148
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,480
Press the fingerprint to unlock

1149
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,000
Within six door-opening opportunities

1150
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
Go to Ruqing's A Exhibition Hall

1151
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,720
And kill Ruqing

1152
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,520
Akai thinks since Minghao is in the F Exhibition Hall

1153
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,640
He doesn't need to open the door for anyone at 0:30 AM

1154
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,120
[repeated context from previous line]

1155
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,880
So after killing Ruqing

1156
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,120
He could leave directly

1157
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,360
But Minghao points out that according to exhibition rules

1158
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,440
He needs to blow out the candle in his own exhibition hall

1159
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
The length of the burned F Hall candle

1160
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,200
Is the same as everyone else's

1161
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Which proves

1162
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,440
That at 0:30 AM

1163
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,960
He was in the F Hall blowing out his candle

1164
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,080
Just as the case investigation stalled

1165
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,040
Everyone discovered new clues

1166
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,520
Is there anything in the guestbook?

1167
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,640
Let's take a look

1168
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,760
Friends

1169
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,200
Can someone tell me how to go upstairs in our library?

1170
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,640
[repeated question about going upstairs]

1171
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Then someone answered

1172
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,280
The key is the painting on the first floor wall

1173
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,880
The clue is in the painting

1174
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,480
But I think this might be

1175
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,520
hinting to us that

1176
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,800
this answer is how it was derived

1177
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,320
Right, the two added together equal that

1178
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,680
I think it

1179
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,880
should be a deer head.

1180
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,840
Right?

1181
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,680
If we follow this logic,

1182
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,760
if we assemble it this way,

1183
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,880
let's try the deer.

1184
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,600
Is there any mechanism?

1185
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,320
Should we try it?

1186
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,040
Let's try.

1187
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,320
It's open

1188
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,360
Let's go

1189
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,480
Wow, this can go upstairs

1190
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,680
Where does this lead to?

1191
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,040
This is an elevator

1192
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,200
Press it again

1193
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,560
Press it

1194
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,600
Can it go down if pressed again?

1195
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,080
It can come up

1196
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,120
There's also an announcement

1197
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,600
Right.

1198
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Come in first.

1199
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,720
Public elevator.

1200
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,840
has been frequently overloaded without reason.

1201
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
To ensure the safety of all faculty and students

1202
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,840
when using the elevator,

1203
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
the elevator will undergo maintenance for three days.

1204
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,720
Not only can no one see me anymore,

1205
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,520
they don't even remember me, Xiao Dong.

1206
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,280
Not even my best friend...

1207
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,240
Xiaoxi, Xiaonan, Xiaowei

1208
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,480
They don't remember that I was with them

1209
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,560
when we founded the Tweet Empire

1210
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,800
It seems Ruqing is just like me

1211
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,200
What do you mean "Ruqing is just like me"?

1212
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,880
That man in the photo is

1213
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,120
Detected six people in the elevator

1214
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
Elevator capacity limit

1215
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,160
is currently five people

1216
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,440
Now overloaded

1217
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,920
What does that mean?

1218
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,880
It means I

1219
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,440
No

1220
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,280
One of us should get off

1221
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,920
Someone needs to exit

1222
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,680
Someone must get off

1223
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,560
Won't let us off

1224
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,600
Elevator passenger count normal

1225
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,120
About to operate

1226
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,960
Give it a pull

1227
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,040
Sense of security

1228
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,440
It's always been the second floor

1229
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,320
It keeps going down

1230
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,480
Something's about to happen soon

1231
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,320
It's getting too close

1232
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,560
Help!

1233
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,280
Look how the numbers keep jumping around

1234
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,920
Oh my god

1235
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,280
If we die, we die

1236
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,880
Help!

1237
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Back to the third floor again

1238
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,280
Now second floor, now first floor

1239
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,520
The killer has strong nerves too

1240
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,280
Elevator malfunction

1241
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,040
Help!

1242
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
The elevator stopped at a non-existent floor

1243
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,840
Night blindness time

1244
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,000
Everyone hold hands

1245
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,000
I'll go ahead then

1246
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,200
There's light over there

1247
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,400
There's light there

1248
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,040
Be careful

1249
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,560
Careful not to fall

1250
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,800
Can you hold onto me?

1251
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,360
Okay

1252
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,320
Can I hold onto the person in front?

1253
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,840
You hold onto Xiao Hou

1254
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,760
I'm holding on

1255
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,440
But now I'm the last one, baby

1256
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
I'm here

1257
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,120
You're on my right side

1258
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,240
It's fine, hold onto both

1259
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,880
We need to move forward

1260
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,520
Go

1261
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:53,960
Go

1262
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,960
Move forward

1263
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,760
Oh my god

1264
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,960
But where should we go?

1265
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,080
Careful

1266
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,280
Sorry

1267
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,960
Who's holding me now?

1268
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,480
Me

1269
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,080
Who's holding my hand right now?

1270
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,440
Me.

1271
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,640
Who's poking me?

1272
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,760
So who are these people?

1273
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,480
Victims.

1274
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,920
What did you just see?

1275
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,520
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

1276
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,040
It's like...

1277
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,880
There were sheets covering the walls.

1278
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,000
Is anyone there?

1279
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,560
Who?

1280
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,080
Is anyone there?

1281
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,440
Who?

1282
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,040
I'm Luoluo.

1283
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,240
You're Luoluo?

1284
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,120
Luoluo, where are you?

1285
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,640
Luoluo is now Ai Singing, so...

1286
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,720
Who are you?

1287
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,240
Luoluo?

1288
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,080
Brother?

1289
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,040
Huh?

1290
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,640
Are you calling me?

1291
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,400
Why are you saying "huh"?

1292
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,640
Please save me!

1293
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,840
Where are you, Luoluo?

1294
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,680
Why do I hear...

1295
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,120
a girl's voice outside?

1296
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,560
She's Ai Singing.

1297
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,440
The fake Luoluo.

1298
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,360
Right, it's the fake Luoluo.

1299
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,200
We all know now.

1300
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,920
Yes.

1301
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,680
Give me back my body!

1302
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,760
Give it back!

1303
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,320
Give it back!

1304
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,160
Then we...

1305
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
How can we help you?

1306
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,040
She's not talking.

1307
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,600
Is anyone there?

1308
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:51,960
Who?

1309
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,840
It's Xiao Wei.

1310
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,480
Xiao Wei?

1311
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,680
Xiao Wei, how did you get in?

1312
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,160
How did you get in, Xiao Wei?

1313
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,000
I've been trapped here for two years.

1314
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,120
Two years.

1315
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,840
Was that Xiao Wei this morning?

1316
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,680
That wasn't Xiao Wei this morning.

1317
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,720
She was a fake Xiao Wei.

1318
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,360
Then there was another one called Xiao...

1319
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,080
Xiao Dong.

1320
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,000
Who is Xiao Dong?

1321
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,520
I don't remember him.

1322
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,280
Xiao Xi, Xiao Nan.

1323
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,560
The three of us created the Tweet Empire together.

1324
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,240
But it says there were four people.

1325
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,640
There are four people in that picture.

1326
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,200
Right.

1327
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,760
When we created the Tweet Empire,

1328
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,800
there was also a group chat.

1329
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,320
Yes, I remember.

1330
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,520
I remember that group chat.

1331
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,240
Let me tell you my QQ number.

1332
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,080
Write it down.

1333
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,240
Wait a moment for the QQ number.

1334
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,400
If you don't believe me, you can log into my account.

1335
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,840
Go check the group chat contents.

1336
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,400
What's your QQ number?

1337
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,640
My QQ number is

1338
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,160
3852026260.

1339
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,000
26260.

1340
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,120
What's your password?

1341
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,880
My password is xv123456.

1342
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,680
Xiao Wei.

1343
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,040
Got it?

1344
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,560
Quick, log into my QQ.

1345
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,760
See if there's any way

1346
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,040
to get us out of here.

1347
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,640
Alright, let's go log into QQ.

1348
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:00,840
Let's go.

1349
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,120
If Ruqing is the curse caster,

1350
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,720
Right.

1351
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,480
then her death should break the curse.

1352
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,120
But now...

1353
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,240
So the mastermind is the curse caster.

1354
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:07,920
So we killed the wrong person.

1355
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,440
Let's go.

1356
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,520
We killed the wrong person.

1357
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
You killed the wrong person.

1358
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,440
Let's go to that exhibition hall - there's a computer there.

1359
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,520
We can log into QQ.

1360
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,000
Right.

1361
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,000
This computer?

1362
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,320
Yes, this exact computer.

1363
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,800
QQ

1364
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,920
Everyone logged into the newly obtained

1365
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,280
Xiao Wei's QQ account

1366
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,280
and discovered a group chat between Xiao Wei, Xiao Dong,

1367
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,920
Xiao Nan, and Xiao Xi.

1368
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,400
The four of them shared stories in the group

1369
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,000
about bullying other classmates

1370
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,760
their acts of bullying other students

1371
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,960
and took pleasure in it.

1372
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,920
Xiao Dong also mentioned

1373
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,000
his plan to establish a hacker organization

1374
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,760
Xiao Dong said, "I've decided to create

1375
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,400
a hacker group

1376
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,320
called Tweet Empire

1377
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,200
so we can hide in

1378
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,720
the shadows of the internet

1379
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,000
and freely exchange all those

1380
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,680
shady encrypted school secrets.

1381
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,200
We won't need to hide our secrets

1382
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,560
in those little hidden compartments

1383
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,520
on the first-floor library shelves anymore."

1384
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,440
Go look for them

1385
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,640
Feel around for them

1386
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,360
those hidden compartments on the shelves.

1387
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,600
It might be up high

1388
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,480
This

1389
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,920
Found it

1390
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,840
There's one here

1391
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,640
There's one in the small hidden compartment

1392
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,840
First, take everything out.

1393
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,480
Let's look at them on that table over there.

1394
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,240
There's an exhibition hall blueprint in the hidden compartment.

1395
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,120
And a staff access card for the spatial gate.

1396
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,200
Also, there's...

1397
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,000
a weathered piece of parchment.

1398
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,040
It holds the secret of the Wukenai River.

1399
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,400
The reason everyone turned into monsters.

1400
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,800
The desperate ones—

1401
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,200
placed drift bottles with their final wishes

1402
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,080
into the Wukenai River.

1403
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,920
Those wishes would manifest

1404
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,240
after their deaths.

1405
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,840
In 1988,

1406
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,640
several victims of covert bullying—

1407
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,800
the desperate—

1408
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,320
turned their final wishes into curses

1409
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,960
by the Wukenai River.

1410
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,880
A curse on those who manipulate others:

1411
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,280
to become puppets themselves.

1412
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,720
Those who isolate others:

1413
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,960
to become truly invisible.

1414
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Those who spread malicious rumors:

1415
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,480
to suffer wounds equal to their lies.

1416
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,440
Those who mock others with nicknames:

1417
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
to become the monsters they named.

1418
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,000
These curses took effect after

1419
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,960
Ai Sing and Hu Jie—

1420
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,040
the bullied—passed away.

1421
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,440
And unless bullying stops, the curses remain.

1422
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,120
Besides this,

1423
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,760
they also found

1424
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,200
Xiao Dong's diary.

1425
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,680
And another—

1426
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,800
This is a diary.

1427
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,080
Turns out Xiao Dong, for isolating others,

1428
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,240
had turned invisible.

1429
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,560
Two days ago, in the music room...

1430
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,200
He's the one who played "The Deadly Tune"

1431
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,680
This is the piano room

1432
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,080
The piano started playing

1433
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,520
Because he became invisible

1434
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,200
So people could only see the keys moving

1435
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,960
But couldn't see the player

1436
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,720
That same night

1437
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,280
Xiaodong accidentally witnessed Hu Jie's suicide

1438
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,360
And found a message bottle

1439
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,880
Documenting the 1988 curse of unfulfilled wishes

1440
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,480
Learning the whole truth

1441
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,600
Discovering the complete truth

1442
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,040
Xiaodong believed the bullying must stop to break the curse

1443
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,880
Which meant killing

1444
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,200
The current bullies at school

1445
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,960
To lift the curse and become visible again

1446
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,760
Xiaodong tried to kill Rui Sibai

1447
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,400
But found he couldn't physically

1448
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,600
Harm anyone

1449
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,560
So Xiaodong framed Rui Sibai

1450
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,880
Making Akai, Minghao and Luoluo

1451
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,280
Believe Rui Sibai had cursed them

1452
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,360
Using them to kill Rui Sibai

1453
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,280
Later Xiaodong discovered

1454
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,600
The real bullying mastermind was Ru Qing

1455
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,840
So Xiaodong planned to manipulate someone

1456
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,040
At the Weird Art Experience Exhibition

1457
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,440
To kill Ru Qing

1458
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,840
That's why he asked us for personal items

1459
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,320
It was him all along

1460
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,840
Not Ru Qing

1461
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,080
Yes, this diary

1462
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,360
The diary belongs to Xiaodong

1463
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,440
Let's check under the prize box

1464
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,840
But he said there's a mechanism under the prize box

1465
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,920
A mechanism

1466
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,280
Is this it?

1467
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,040
This is it

1468
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,960
Then how do we unlock it?

1469
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,720
Exhibition hall staff

1470
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,600
Access card for the control room

1471
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,240
The control room is located

1472
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,240
Under the prize box in the hallway

1473
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,200
Control room

1474
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,440
So this is the room

1475
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,720
Swipe it

1476
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,280
Brother, seriously

1477
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:22,760
Oh my god

1478
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:23,880
Grab it, there's something

1479
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,760
There's something, grab it

1480
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,320
Grab it

1481
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,360
There's really a remote

1482
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,280
This can control our door

1483
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,760
There's a remote control

1484
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,520
That can open and close the door

1485
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,000
And the balls

1486
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,000
E

1487
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,840
They're all E

1488
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,600
Who is E

1489
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,720
Luoluo

1490
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,160
It's me

1491
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,880
E is Luoluo

1492
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:44,800
E

1493
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,520
All these balls are E

1494
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,360
Why are all the balls E?

1495
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,200
Why does it have to be E?

1496
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,360
That means you want to draw E

1497
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,600
No

1498
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,440
The drawing order is

1499
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,640
Luoluo draws first

1500
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,560
If she's first

1501
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,720
She can ensure

1502
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,880
she draws E

1503
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,920
Then those after her

1504
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,960
Why can't they draw E?

1505
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,760
Behind here is

1506
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,800
Behind here should be

1507
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,840
Yes, he can

1508
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,720
The back can be opened

1509
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,360
So after she drew first

1510
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,800
Look, look at my hand

1511
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,920
Reach in and you can touch my hand

1512
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,080
She directly took that

1513
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,400
ball and threw it away, right?

1514
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,280
Actually, someone could be behind

1515
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,560
controlling what you draw

1516
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,840
Actually, it's not just E

1517
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,840
No, there must be someone behind it

1518
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,360
Each person only drew once

1519
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,440
Then he hands it to you

1520
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,520
He can make you draw whatever he wants

1521
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,640
Then why were they all E?

1522
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,800
So the E room is crucial

1523
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,080
Press the remote

1524
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,120
to rotate the connecting walls of exhibition halls CDEF

1525
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,720
Using the hall door as the radius from the connection point

1526
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,760
Rotate 90 degrees clockwise

1527
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,840
That thing

1528
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,800
That whatchamacallit

1529
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,360
The carpet area can rotate

1530
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,240
It's a circle

1531
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,400
Let's try rotating it

1532
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:57,880
This is it

1533
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,000
It can rotate

1534
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,360
Try it

1535
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,440
It rotates

1536
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:03,880
Careful

1537
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,520
I'll do it

1538
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,360
It can rotate.

1539
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,240
Press once, it turns clockwise.

1540
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:17,880
Press it again,

1541
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,640
it turns counterclockwise back.

1542
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,080
It's meant to return to its original position.

1543
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,320
But there will be an alarm.

1544
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,800
Three seconds.

1545
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,840
Three seconds.

1546
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,400
Do not stand in the rotation zone.

1547
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,960
You're standing in the rotation zone.

1548
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,080
So it will trigger the alarm.

1549
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,240
You need to step down when it rotates.

1550
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,240
Oh.

1551
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,600
Got it.

1552
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,560
Then you try rotating it first.

1553
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,040
Oh.

1554
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,480
If he uses F, he can go directly to C.

1555
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,960
That skips many steps.

1556
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,720
Oh.

1557
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,240
After repeatedly testing the remote control,

1558
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,440
they found it can control the exhibition hall door's

1559
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,640
clockwise rotation.

1560
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,920
But it can only rotate 90 degrees clockwise

1561
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,320
before rotating back.

1562
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,000
And people cannot stand on it

1563
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,080
while it's rotating.

1564
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
In other words,

1565
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,840
the killer's goal

1566
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,360
was to manipulate the door's position remotely

1567
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,240
to kill Ruqing within six door-opening chances

1568
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,560
and return to their own exhibition hall.

1569
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,320
With this crucial information,

1570
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,440
everyone began the final group discussion.

1571
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,240
All who registered fingerprints at the library

1572
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,640
have access permission.

1573
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,360
After touching the fingerprint scanner,

1574
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,120
all exhibition hall doors unlock.

1575
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,200
<summaryThe group discovers how the remote control operates the exhibition hall doors' rotation mechanism and deduces the killer's method of committing the murder within limited door operations.

1576
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,600
After touching the fingerprint scanner,

1577
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,480
all exhibition hall access controls will unlock.

1578
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,360
Doors from Hall A to F

1579
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,000
will become bidirectional.

1580
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,560
All doors can be freely opened/closed

1581
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,280
six times in total.

1582
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,560
After each opening,

1583
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,520
it must close within three seconds.

1584
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,200
Once opened, it can't be closed again,

1585
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,760
or once closed,

1586
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,320
it can't be passed through again after opening.

1587
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,680
You can't leave the door open

1588
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,960
for convenient return later.

1589
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,280
Each exit and entry counts as one use.

1590
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:58,960
What we've confirmed is:

1591
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,440
He must first go to F,

1592
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,680
right, then press that fingerprint scanner.

1593
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,280
Correct.

1594
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,200
Let me explain this:

1595
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,280
Why would I need to press it?

1596
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,880
I have enough steps.

1597
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:07,480
No,

1598
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,920
because if you don't press that wall button,

1599
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,160
you can't go from C to B

1600
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:11,840
or B to A.

1601
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,320
Right.

1602
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:13,760
Isn't that so?

1603
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,360
Yes.

1604
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,960
Actually we can count the steps -

1605
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,720
just tally the steps.

1606
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,880
If I (at C) want to commit the crime,

1607
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,360
I must first go to F,

1608
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,800
press that F button,

1609
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,120
then step count resets to zero.

1610
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,200
He pressed the revolving door's button

1611
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,440
allowing him to move from F to C

1612
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,800
F to C to B to A

1613
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,000
then back to B

1614
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,240
then back to C

1615
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,160
I have enough steps

1616
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,560
I could have committed the crime

1617
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,840
The suspicious part is if he went back

1618
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,880
Room A would be empty

1619
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,920
But this access control system

1620
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,440
shows that at exactly 12:30 AM

1621
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,080
there must have been someone in Room A

1622
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,960
The access control was used once

1623
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,400
Yes

1624
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,440
So he definitely wouldn't return to Room C

1625
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,240
He would only stay in A

1626
00:54:59,440 --> 00:54:59,920
If he stayed in A

1627
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,880
C would be empty

1628
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,760
Then D and E couldn't exit without someone in C

1629
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,720
Therefore he must return to C

1630
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,080
But if he returns to C, who would open the door for B?

1631
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,760
The Invisible Man can press the door in Room A

1632
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
Does he have this ability?

1633
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,160
The Invisible Man can indeed

1634
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,840
He has a physical form

1635
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,120
He just can't kill people

1636
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,040
Then the Invisible Man could help everyone

1637
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,120
That seems unlikely

1638
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,280
Because he said when he held a knife

1639
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,560
and swung it at someone

1640
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,360
he couldn't harm them

1641
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,760
But he can pass notes

1642
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,360
He can put balls inside

1643
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,560
He should be able to press buttons

1644
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,360
He can play piano

1645
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,240
At this moment from the opposite piano room

1646
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,680
came very eerie piano music

1647
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,720
We discovered at the door

1648
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,040
there was no one inside

1649
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,000
The piano was playing automatically

1650
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:45,640
Right

1651
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Can play piano, correct

1652
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,840
Right, that means pressing buttons

1653
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,440
So it should be finally in Room A

1654
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,160
The Invisible Man is in Room A

1655
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,280
pressed the door between A and B

1656
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:54,920
to open it

1657
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,880
Right, I think it must be the Invisible Man helping

1658
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,080
Then if that's the case

1659
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,720
In that case anything is possible

1660
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,840
We could calculate E, I think

1661
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,200
E is crucial, right

1662
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:06,720
Let's calculate E

1663
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,120
He pressed the revolving door button

1664
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,440
allowing him to go from F to C

1665
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,720
Then C to B

1666
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,280
Then B to A

1667
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,040
Then A to B for the fourth time

1668
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,840
B to C five times

1669
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,640
Then C to D

1670
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,440
From D to E

1671
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Right, seven times

1672
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,960
So E is impossible

1673
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,520
But F is possible

1674
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,800
Let's calculate the others

1675
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,200
D is also possible

1676
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,680
Because D is exactly one step less than E

1677
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,680
Right at the six-step boundary

1678
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,640
Even CDF can do it.

1679
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,160
Why give it to E?

1680
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,880
Giving this ping pong ball to E.

1681
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,040
What's the real reason?

1682
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,440
Each person only draws one.

1683
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,400
Then he hands it to you.

1684
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,920
He can make you get whatever position he wants.

1685
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,800
Then why are they all E?

1686
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,320
I'd like to ask

1687
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,240
Where did everyone get this from?

1688
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,200
It was in the staff workroom

1689
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,280
And that workroom

1690
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,000
Had a notebook with several pages torn out

1691
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,320
But because the writing was heavy

1692
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,960
I managed to make an imprint of it

1693
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,320
I know you want to kill Ruqing

1694
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,200
You could use tonight's opening of

1695
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,360
"The Weird Tales Art Experience Exhibition"

1696
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,320
I've experienced this exhibition before

1697
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,560
I know there are some secret mechanisms inside

1698
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,480
You could use the mechanisms to kill someone

1699
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,960
And escape perfectly

1700
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,960
If you're willing to cooperate with me

1701
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,840
I'll tell you

1702
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,440
The detailed plan of how to coordinate with me

1703
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,240
This means today's murderer

1704
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,920
Actually collaborated with this person

1705
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,400
Meaning they knew about

1706
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,640
All these mechanisms beforehand

1707
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,240
So now we're figuring out

1708
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,560
Their

1709
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,360
This

1710
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,120
Secrets within some mechanisms

1711
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,280
What exactly is special about

1712
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,960
This space E?

1713
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,720
The special thing about E is

1714
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,200
it's the only one among the four

1715
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,280
innocent room

1716
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,040
It's also possible

1717
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,160
he wanted to ensure the first person to draw

1718
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,880
would get E

1719
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,800
Because the E space

1720
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,000
was useless to him

1721
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,080
He needed to ensure he

1722
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,960
could enter CDF

1723
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,280
Putting

1724
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,720
more E balls was just to ensure

1725
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,120
an unrelated person

1726
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,760
So when I reached in to draw

1727
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,160
they were all E

1728
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,120
So those three E balls became duds

1729
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,720
to guarantee you'd draw E

1730
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,400
Because CDF wasn't available then

1731
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,080
But he was afraid if you drew first

1732
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,680
finding only one ball would seem odd

1733
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,080
so he gave you three fakes

1734
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,680
to make it feel like a real draw

1735
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,760
So Luoluo is innocent

1736
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,360
Right

1737
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,920
Luoluo is cleared

1738
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,120
So I'm the least suspicious

1739
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,360
CDF could be any

1740
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,400
Now we just need to deduce which one

1741
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,480
has stronger motive and suspicion

1742
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,320
Looking at previous evidence

1743
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,760
that showed murderous intent

1744
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,760
No need to check Luo Luo.

1745
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,440
Can't kill.

1746
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,200
C

1747
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:14,960
I think C

1748
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,200
is the most likely.

1749
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,280
C is the most convenient.

1750
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,160
Most convenient.

1751
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:21,920
The motive is

1752
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,080
breaking the curse

1753
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,560
and avenging his cousin.

1754
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,640
C is the most probable.

1755
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,760
Based on step calculations,

1756
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,040
Luo Luo in Hall E is ruled out.

1757
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,960
Among A-Kai, Minghao, and Zhuocheng,

1758
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,600
who do you think is the real culprit?

1759
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,360
I voted for

1760
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,320
I believe the real culprit is Zhuocheng

1761
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,040
So I'm casting my vote for Zhuocheng

1762
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,880
His motive was his cousin Hujie being bullied

1763
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,080
and subsequently committing suicide

1764
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,800
So he discovered Ruqing was the real culprit

1765
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,480
This gave him strong motivation

1766
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,120
to kill Ruqing

1767
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,240
Hence my vote for Zhuocheng

1768
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,400
This time I'm voting for Minghao as the killer

1769
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,880
And he has an X

1770
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,600
He is our detective Nengneng

1771
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
The killer is

1772
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,520
I thought this thing

1773
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,640
was connected to the Tweet Empire

1774
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,120
I voted for

1775
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,320
Based on the final statements

1776
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,640
I voted

1777
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,880
Next, we'll announce the voting results from all players.

1778
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,880
After everyone's voting,

1779
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,040
our voting results are:

1780
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,560
Among the four suspects,

1781
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,240
two have received votes.

1782
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
They are:

1783
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,600
Zhuo Cheng.

1784
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:11,800
And Minghao

1785
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,680
Now between these two candidates

1786
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,960
I now announce

1787
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,120
The one who received the most votes is

1788
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,080
The highest vote recipient is

1789
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,040
Zhuocheng

1790
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,840
He received four votes

1791
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,360
My vote is for Zhuocheng.

1792
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,440
I voted for Zhuocheng.

1793
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,800
My vote went to Zhuocheng.

1794
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,920
I believe the real culprit is Zhuocheng.

1795
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,680
So I cast my vote for Zhuocheng.

1796
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,640
Did we successfully identify the culprit?

1797
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,440
Now, the real culprit please stand up.

1798
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,360
You're still competing with me

1799
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,440
Stand up, right?

1800
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,640
I voted for Zhuocheng.

1801
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,040
Listening to the final statements,

1802
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,200
it seems Nengneng also

1803
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,080
wants to vote for Zhuocheng.

1804
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,640
In that case,

1805
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,680
it should be three to two,

1806
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,760
which would be enough to win.

1807
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,920
Anyway, the goal is

1808
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,120
to push his votes up.

1809
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,320
I think

1810
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,760
he shouldn't be called a rapper,

1811
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,080
but a murderer.

1812
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,120
He's become the Grim Reaper of Tui Town.

1813
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,800
Is there an X in this case?

1814
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,200
This case involves X

1815
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,080
I am X

1816
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,200
I help Minghao

1817
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,160
You can't just leave that door open

1818
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,280
for your convenience to return later

1819
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,600
Each exit and entry must count separately

1820
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,680
If he goes back

1821
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,840
Room A would be empty

1822
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,120
The invisible person could

1823
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,320
press the door in Room A

1824
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,280
He can't harm anyone

1825
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,680
but he can pass notes

1826
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,520
He can

1827
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,280
insert balls inside

1828
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,480
He should be able to press buttons

1829
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,280
He can play piano

1830
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,560
Right

1831
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,840
Can play piano, correct

1832
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,120
So E is impossible

1833
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,560
Why give E then?

1834
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
Give E this ping pong ball

1835
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,360
What's the real reason?

1836
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,800
To ensure you'd draw E

1837
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,480
Because CDF weren't present then

1838
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,160
But he worried if you drew first

1839
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,760
finding only one ball would be suspicious

1840
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,160
So he gave three decoys

1841
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,640
to make the draw seem authentic

1842
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,160
CDF are all possible

1843
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:52,960
Now just deduce

1844
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,120
which suspect has

1845
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,320
stronger motives

1846
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,280
The motives are

1847
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,440
breaking the curse

1848
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,920
avenging his cousin

1849
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,800
C is most likely

1850
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,160
I think C is most probable

1851
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,480
Initially we thought

1852
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,640
A must have someone

1853
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,480
If not returning, only F is possible

1854
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,680
But he used the invisible person to trick me

1855
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,680
In the end, I thought

1856
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,480
Since I'm not

1857
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,880
You couldn't possibly

1858
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,320
Then between the two of them

1859
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,440
I said if that's the case

1860
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,160
Then we can only choose the one with stronger motives

1861
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,400
Otherwise there's no way

1862
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,360
Wrong, I won't believe it anymore

1863
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,840
First, let me talk about that

1864
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,640
There really was an invisible person opening the door

1865
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,840
The invisible person was about to help me kill someone

1866
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,760
What's wrong with him pressing a button?

1867
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,320
So it was really him helping you

1868
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,240
Yes

1869
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,080
The invisible person's motive for choosing the killer

1870
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,400
was actually the same as HR's

1871
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,440
All three of us were

1872
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,640
members of his talent pool

1873
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,080
At first he wanted to choose Zhuocheng

1874
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,600
because Zhuocheng wasn't cursed

1875
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,240
He wouldn't turn into a pig halfway through killing

1876
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,000
But you took way too long eating noodles

1877
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You were still eating at 11:30 PM

1878
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,560
And Akai would drip blood

1879
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,440
If he transformed during the killing process

1880
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,960
his bleeding would leave traces

1881
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,760
But I would just turn into a pig head

1882
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,360
I wouldn't make noise or draw attention

1883
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,120
I think the invisible person considered

1884
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,920
me to be the safer choice

1885
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,640
So the key evidence everyone missed

1886
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,080
was

1887
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,160
in the library bookshelf's

1888
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,480
corner pages

1889
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,320
There were pencil-written responses

1890
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,000
That control room's

1891
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,720
notebook had several pages torn out

1892
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,800
And the person who owned this pencil

1893
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,160
was from the previous case -

1894
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,760
the one cursed by personal belongings

1895
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,640
Minghao

1896
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,360
As I said yesterday

1897
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:45,760
I believe

1898
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,160
being kind to others is being kind to yourself

1899
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,080
Then we learned

1900
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,160
that this bullying includes not just physical bullying

1901
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,800
but also the neglect of such bullying

1902
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,240
And there's one point

1903
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,320
that if a classmate

1904
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,120
has indeed done something very bad

1905
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,520
and everyone isolates them at this point

1906
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,680
does this count as bullying?

1907
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,240
How bad must their actions be

1908
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,160
for their isolation by others

1909
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,920
to not be considered bullying?

1910
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,320
Or should bullying itself as a behavior

1911
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,480
never be considered

1912
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,840
an acceptable way to treat classmates?

1913
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,280
I think this is also

1914
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,000
a point very worthy of consideration

1915
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,440
As a parent,

1916
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,160
I pay special attention

1917
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,400
to my child's mental state.

1918
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,480
I basically ask him every week

1919
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,240
how he's getting along with classmates,

1920
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,720
if anything bad happened,

1921
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,760
and to tell me if anyone bullies him.

1922
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,800
But children won't say.

1923
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,920
From a parent's perspective,

1924
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,880
we sometimes easily overlook things.

1925
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,320
Even when I ask,

1926
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,120
sometimes I still

1927
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,600
can't get clear answers.

1928
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,240
Then one day I noticed

1929
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,400
he was using his allowance

1930
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,640
to buy classmates gifts.

1931
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,720
I found it strange,

1932
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,320
then he replied:

1933
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,360
"This way they'll play with me."

1934
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,280
I was terrified,

1935
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,640
because sometimes

1936
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,520
children don't realize they're being bullied.

1937
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,240
They think it's just

1938
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,880
a way to make people like them.

1939
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,400
This is actually quite scary.

1940
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,080
So we adults around them

1941
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,360
should guide them to understand

1942
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,600
that making friends

1943
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,120
should be based on

1944
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,040
shared interests or goals,

1945
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,400
not because you're constantly

1946
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,320
trying to please others.

1947
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,760
That's not true friendship.

1948
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,360
And when your efforts

1949
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,000
stop being enough for them,

1950
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,440
you might get hurt.

1951
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,960
Just like Ai Sing in this story.

1952
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,800
So beyond bullying,

1953
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,800
we should pay more attention

1954
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,320
to what children this age

1955
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,480
might experience.

1956
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,080
We should give them more

1957
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,400
positive guidance.
