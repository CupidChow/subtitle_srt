00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,560
Welcome to the show sponsored by all you bulldozers

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,720
with your generous support

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,240
"Let's Deduce! X"

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,960
I'm Cui Shaoyang

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,360
After the last murder case occurred

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,160
Rui Sibai actually

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,600
mysteriously died in

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,200
a tightly sealed courtyard

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,360
While the killers Canary and X Ba Zimei

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,080
managed to escape again

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,240
In this perplexing case full of mysteries

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,200
how did Canary pass X's test

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,080
and how did they work with X to deceive everyone?

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,600
Now, let's all together

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,120
"Let's Deduce! X"

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
Please accept this episode's X test

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,320
Beautiful

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,000
These past two days I've been receiving

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,200
nothing but the word "beautiful"

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,280
What is the production team hinting at?

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,440
Has the director always liked me?

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,760
Been telling me I'm beautiful?

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,440
Today I must answer correctly

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,200
I've made complete preparations

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,840
Last night I researched many graphic puzzles

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,600
Finding more than nine counts as passing the test

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,360
So difficult

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,960
Finding more than nine

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,600
doesn't include itself

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,720
So difficult

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,880
I don't understand what makes this question difficult

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,920
To be honest

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,560
Okay, first

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
Hundred

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,640
Self

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Eye

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,720
One

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,480
I only found five

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
I don't understand what makes this question difficult

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,600
To be honest

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,240
Can I break these down?

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,520
Break them however you want

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,120
You should've said so earlier

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,920
I thought we had to follow its original shape

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
Then what's so difficult about it?

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
Tell me

47
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,160
Ten

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,440
Done, Hundred, Self, Eye

49
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,880
One, Two, Three, Wide, Mouth, Sun

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,040
Wide doesn't count

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,040
Wide, like in Guangdong

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,920
You can only break down from the original shape

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,000
Done, Hundred, Self, Eye

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
One, Two, Three, Mouth, Sun

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,640
Okay, first is Dog

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,880
Dog is deformed

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,160
Deformed Dog doesn't count, right?

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,160
First is this person, Arrow, Marquis

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
One, right?

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Then there's Two, and Three

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,960
Right?

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,520
Three

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,800
And Big

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,680
And Sky

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
One two three four five six seven eight nine

66
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,360
Alright

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,920
Know

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
Mouth

69
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,520
Arrow

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,240
Wide

71
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,080
Factory

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,960
Big, Person, One, Two

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Know, Mouth, Arrow, Wide, Factory

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
Fly, Big, Person, Sky, Two, One

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
Fly

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,200
If Fly strictly doesn't have a mirror image

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,560
Then it doesn't count if it doesn't count

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,200
Ten is enough

79
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
This should work

80
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,600
That's about enough.

81
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,320
Let's save some face for others too.

82
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,320
It's about finding the common characters
contained within this "beauty" character.

83
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,320
containing nine or more commonly used characters.

84
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,160
I've chosen: big, sky, king, master.

85
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,200
Then one, two, three, work, person.

86
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,080
All these don't really matter, right?

87
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
One, two, three.

88
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,840
Earth King Dry Knight Ten Sheep

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
Alright, alright, so I'm the X again today

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,920
Good

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,480
Small

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
Few

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,640
Stop

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,440
Does master count?

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,200
Does king count?

96
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
Does person count?

97
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,960
Does it count?

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
Let's count three

99
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,960
If three counts, then two should too

100
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,240
If two counts, then one should too

101
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,960
One two three four five six seven eight nine

102
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Time's up

103
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
Got the X test question right

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
Our teacher Bai Yangzuo

105
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,360
Was extremely arrogant in previous cases

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,920
His arrogance knew no bounds

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,400
I came here to destroy him

108
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
So today I choose Ba Zimei

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,240
I will personally destroy him together with Ba Zimei

110
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,800
It's finally your turn now.

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,080
Will you choose me?

112
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Pick me!

113
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
How exciting!

114
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,840
Look over here from the music room across.

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
Look this way.

116
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,560
The killing intent is so strong.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,760
You're unusually calm.

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,080
She's not calm.

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
She seems a bit angry.

120
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,080
Liu Yuning chose her, didn't he?

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,880
Today I'm the X again, huh

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,000
You're so fake

123
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
So exaggerated

124
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,240
Who told her?

125
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Bite Ninghao to death.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,240
Because today

127
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,600
I think there's only one reason for the murderer

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,320
Which is what?

129
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,760
This person might have taught

130
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,200
the murder method to this killer

131
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,080
Then he used this method to kill Sisi

132
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
Today we just need to find Sisi's killer

133
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,000
and that's it.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
But we don't know the motive

135
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,000
Because the accomplice said

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,880
"I heard you insulting Sisi"

137
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,120
He must be certain this person

138
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
wanted to kill her to be able to

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
borrow this "knife"

140
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,120
So now we need to know

141
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
who has this "knife"

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,880
About the knife - I have crucial information

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,360
There are no knives in the dorm

144
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,600
No, the "knife" I'm talking about

145
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
is the knife in "killing with a borrowed knife"

146
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Not

147
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,720
him

148
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Not a murder weapon

149
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
His door-breaking knife

150
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,880
What's with all the blood in her room?

151
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,560
Wasn't the pillow completely covered in blood?

152
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,920
Whose blood was that?

153
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,280
And those hands begging for help...

154
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,600
Actually...

155
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
That hand was also in the elevator...

156
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,880
That exact spot.

157
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
Was it Ruisibai?

158
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,640
He tied up many monsters there.

159
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
The monsters' blood and all this...

160
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,840
Everything...

161
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,000
Was all done by Ruisibai.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,880
From what we know...

163
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,360
Only Ruisibai knows about that space.

164
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,200
And today the door had writing saying...

165
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,960
No one would ever find the key...

166
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,760
Because they're all too scared to come here.

167
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,040
All of you had motives for murder.

168
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,040
The three of us were cursed.

169
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,400
Does that necessarily mean we wanted to kill her?

170
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,280
If you wanted to break this curse,

171
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,160
and I wanted to break it,

172
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,240
wouldn't I have to wait for her to tell me

173
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
before killing her?

174
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,040
Does she have to die to break it?

175
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,000
Possibly.

176
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,360
What time did you see

177
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,560
the letter from your ex-girlfriend at your door?

178
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,720
Last night at 10 PM.

179
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,200
If this is directly related to him,

180
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,320
then it's only him.

181
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,360
That night we went to see Sisi,

182
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,080
or rather, cursed at Sisi.

183
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,040
We weren't in our right minds.

184
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,640
Only he was sober.

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,400
Right, and he had more motive than any of you.

186
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,800
He could have taken that note.

187
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,840
You've held on long enough.

188
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,000
When we're deducing the motive,

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,320
his must be the strongest.

190
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,080
Exactly.

191
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes.

192
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
He's the only one

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,920
who wanted to kill her without needing a curse.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,560
Killing her carried no risk for you.

195
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,680
Right.

196
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,000
Another logical point is

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,760
the method used in that earlier case.

198
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,080
What?

199
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
His reaction speed...

200
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,800
Something that happened in just minutes.

201
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,120
A sudden inspiration.

202
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,080
Wouldn't it be strange if he admitted it himself?

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
Right, why would he say it himself?

204
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,200
I did consider this possibility,

205
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,760
but you suddenly

206
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,640
from your previous stance

207
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,600
agreed with my theory.

208
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,800
and even demonstrated it with me simultaneously.

209
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,760
Why did you immediately accept

210
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,840
that I was correct?

211
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,600
Are you employing some clever

212
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
killer's tactic?

213
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
As if you could

214
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,280
instantly grasp my thoughts

215
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,960
and endorse them as correct

216
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,760
to conceal your own guilt.

217
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
If you want to play it this way, then I'm sure it's you.

218
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,960
Today's been quite exciting.

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,000
I think what you just said about him

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,640
might not necessarily be accurate.

221
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,400
Because it's too obvious.

222
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,080
What's so obvious about it?

223
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,600
You're taking the fall for him.

224
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,920
Tell me, what's so obvious?

225
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
Silent X.

226
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
No, I...

227
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,880
No, what I mean is

228
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
It might not be him.

229
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,360
Because he's too obvious.

230
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,440
No, then why completely rule him out?

231
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
That's too cruel, you're even dragging me into this.

232
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,840
Why are you dragging me down?

233
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
No, you're even pulling me into this.

234
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
You've already dragged one person in.

235
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,000
Now you're pulling me in too.

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,280
I didn't drag him in, did I?

237
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm saying it can't be him.

238
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,320
I didn't pull him in.

239
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,080
I'm talking about this situation.

240
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
Why do you say it can't be him?

241
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,360
She thinks you're bad.

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,880
No, what I mean is...

243
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,720
Why couldn't it be you?

244
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,560
Because the night before...

245
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,960
He had already been to that laundromat.

246
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,840
Out of everyone, you're the one who cares most.

247
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,120
They now think you're my X.

248
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,960
Everyone, go vote.

249
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,160
Then who do you think it is?

250
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,320
So who do you think?

251
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
It must be him.

252
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,040
Don't bother thinking.

253
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,600
Is there even a need to think?

254
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,680
This is how you play?

255
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,280
It's not him, just listen to him.

256
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,120
It's definitely not him.

257
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
I'm really done with this.

258
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,080
You're his X.

259
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,400
I didn't even speak up for Ke Daole.

260
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,360
What nonsense.

261
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
She kept saying you're suspicious.

262
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Kept saying he's suspicious.

263
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,880
Just never mentioned him.

264
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,960
Then when someone said he's suspicious...

265
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,680
She immediately defended him.

266
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Good heavens.

267
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
All four of you are suspicious.

268
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,440
At this point still saying everyone's suspicious...

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,040
That's suspicious itself.

270
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,320
Too late.

271
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,000
Make Bai Yang painfully lose a lock.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,720
Make him fall from grace.

273
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,760
Dream shattered, push 2.

274
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,760
Make him fall from grace.

275
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Hello everyone, I'm Canary.

276
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,160
My prime suspect is Ning Hao.

277
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,920
The killer and their motive are:

278
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,600
They're completely innocent.

279
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,400
The crime process:

280
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,360
Details will be in my upcoming case reenactment.

281
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,720
I voted for Ning Hao.

282
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
No particular reason.

283
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
Just felt like voting for them.

284
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,800
Actually, I'm quite torn.

285
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Between Ning Hao and Ke Daole.

286
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
But I still chose Ning Hao.

287
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560
But if it's really Canary,

288
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,920
then this episode gets interesting.

289
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,840
For this case,

290
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm voting for He Dinghong as the killer.

291
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,840
He Dinghong.

292
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,240
Today I chose Ke Daole as the real culprit.

293
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,680
Everyone failed to identify the killer.

294
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,520
The real killer in this case is Canary.

295
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,640
The true culprit of this case, please step forward.

296
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,280
Brother

297
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
When the two of us were reconstructing the case,

298
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
those two kept obstructing us.

299
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,880
Black and white swans, everyone.

300
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,920
What are you doing?

301
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,480
So today with all her antics targeting me later,

302
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,520
I think she was acting extremely abnormal today.

303
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,080
She went all out screaming to accuse me in the end,

304
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,720
making this whole situation even messier.

305
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,520
She cleverly joined me in putting you down,

306
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,600
yet still protected you,

307
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,320
then made him absolutely determined to take you down.

308
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,600
She just argued with you

309
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,640
to make you think she was arguing

310
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,040
because of Hedinhong.

311
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
Right.

312
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Exactly.

313
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm completely speechless.

314
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,760
Absolutely speechless.

315
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Dilraba and Canary's coordination was truly impressive.

316
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,160
This is next-level skill.

317
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,200
Absolutely masterful.

318
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,320
So what exactly is the truth of this story?

319
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,360
I'm a canary

320
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,800
I've lived in the care and affection of others since childhood

321
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,760
Receiving kindness from others

322
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,800
has always been something I took for granted

323
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,720
That's why I can't stand the slightest criticism

324
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,160
Yesterday was the school anniversary

325
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,800
My boss TYP and Zidaole died

326
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
I also discovered my brother isn't dead

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but had completely transformed into Ning Hao

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
and became a film emperor

329
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,120
He kept this from me for so long

330
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
and didn't come forward to acknowledge me

331
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Knowing he was in the wrong

332
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,880
After the case investigation ended

333
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,200
he scheduled a talk with me at 10:30 the next morning

334
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,040
Then we all went our separate ways

335
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
While I was practicing alone in the dance studio

336
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,520
I suddenly lost consciousness

337
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,240
and found myself in a blank white space

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
No matter how I struggled, I couldn't escape

339
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,400
When I regained consciousness

340
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,960
I realized I wasn't in the dance studio anymore

341
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,360
but at a convenience store

342
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,560
eating dragon beard candy that I don't even like

343
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,240
I had no explanation for this

344
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,480
But afraid someone might notice something was wrong

345
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
and affect my acting career

346
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,840
I could only try my best to act normal

347
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,280
Early this morning

348
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
After Sis Li and I finished checking the dorm rooms

349
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,720
I saw a tea box when I returned to my room

350
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,600
and realized the strange things happening to me

351
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
might be due to a curse

352
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,680
Then, in the night study room,

353
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,080
I actually discovered

354
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,440
that Ruisi Bai used the book she previously asked me for

355
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
"How to Conquer Handsome Boys"

356
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,960
to curse me into becoming a monster in the white void,

357
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,160
losing control of my body.

358
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
The more I thought about it, the angrier I got.

359
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,720
I couldn't help but give Ruisi Bai a good scolding.

360
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,800
No one has ever dared to target me before.

361
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,840
She picked the wrong person to mess with.

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
I returned to my dorm room

363
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,440
threw the tea box and "How to Conquer Handsome Boys"

364
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,680
into the dorm trash bin

365
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,920
As I was racking my brains in the dorm

366
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,440
about how to kill Sisi

367
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,520
without ruining my future

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,240
a note was slipped under the dorm door

369
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,640
Opening it, I found

370
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,160
a message from a mysterious person

371
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,600
They said they heard me cursing Sisi

372
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
knew I wanted to kill her

373
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,760
and could help me

374
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,720
They already had

375
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,600
a plan to kill her

376
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
He said I don't know him

377
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,440
So we shouldn't meet

378
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,160
I gladly agreed

379
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,000
The mysterious person came up with a brilliant idea

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,520
We could frame Ru Sibai's death

381
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,360
as a suicide

382
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,400
So I took what the mysterious person

383
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,360
gave me - the pulley remote control and strong adhesive tape

384
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,520
Following the instructions on his map

385
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,840
I went through the laundry room's back door

386
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,160
to reach the abandoned ventilation shaft in the arts building

387
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,560
Here I set up plastic sheets

388
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,640
prepared knockout drugs and gas masks

389
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,800
and a small knife

390
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,000
preparing for the murder at daybreak

391
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,920
At 8 AM

392
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,440
we all gathered at the small auditorium

393
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,240
to rehearse "Swan Lake Push"

394
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,840
After two hours of rehearsal

395
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,680
by 10 o'clock

396
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,280
we dispersed for free time

397
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,720
I pretended to read in the school courtyard

398
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,280
while hearing Ning Hao in the recording studio

399
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,200
playing loud backing tracks

400
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,240
So before he came looking for me

401
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,720
I completed the first step of the murder plan

402
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,440
First, I secretly gave Rui Sisi

403
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,800
a hidden note

404
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,160
asking her to meet in the laundry room

405
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,760
to tell her the truth about Ai Sing's suicide jump

406
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
Yesterday, Ai Sing committed suicide

407
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,880
As her worst bully

408
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,960
I knew she'd be interested

409
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,520
Then through the auditorium's hidden door to the ventilation shaft

410
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,640
and back to the laundry room

411
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,720
Wearing a mask, I lit the knockout drug

412
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,200
Soon after

413
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,680
Rui Sisi arrived as promised

414
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,760
and quickly passed out

415
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,800
After she passed out,

416
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,360
I took her to the abandoned ventilation shaft.

417
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,360
I tied her feet with the rope from the pulley.

418
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,240
Then I tightened the pulley.

419
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
Raising Sisi to the highest point.

420
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,880
I spread a plastic sheet on the ground.

421
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,720
Then I quickly returned to the art building plaza.

422
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
After waiting for a while,

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,320
Ning Hao came to meet me as promised.

424
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,600
Now he became my alibi.

425
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,960
While talking to him,

426
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,400
I pressed the button.

427
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,760
The pulley released.

428
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,160
I knew at that moment,

429
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,400
Sisi had already fallen to her death.

430
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,120
After scaring Ning Hao away,

431
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,440
I stayed alone for a while.

432
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,720
Seeing no one near the small auditorium,

433
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,880
I re-entered the ventilation shaft from there.

434
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
After confirming Sisi's death,

435
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,200
I wrapped the body from the shaft

436
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,520
in the plastic sheet.

437
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,640
Then moved it to the dormitory courtyard.

438
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,400
Finally, I took out Sisi's suicide note

439
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
and placed it beside her.

440
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,840
Faking a suicide scene.

441
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,120
After completing everything,

442
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,600
I packed up the plastic sheet.

443
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,920
Sealed the courtyard door with tape,

444
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,200
then cut the tape with a craft knife.

445
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,160
Using an anonymous phone,

446
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,960
I messaged the school's most nosy

447
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
busybody, Xiao Huang.

448
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,160
Then hid in a blind spot outside the courtyard.

449
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,200
Xiao Huang came as expected.

450
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,520
He discovered Sisi's body

451
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
in the dormitory courtyard

452
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,120
and the taped-up door from the second floor.

453
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,200
While he was coming downstairs,

454
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,600
I sneaked in to block the door.

455
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,240
Huang Xi didn't open the door.

456
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,320
Thinking it was because of the tape,

457
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,400
they went to the store to look for a utility knife.

458
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,000
I took the chance to sneak away from the courtyard.

459
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,560
While Xiao Huang was on his way from the convenience store to the courtyard,

460
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,800
I exited through the laundry room's back door

461
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,280
and returned to the arts building

462
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
then casually joined

463
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,360
the performance of "Swan Lake Push"

464
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
Xiao Huang thought he had cut through the tape with a craft knife

465
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,520
and entered the dormitory courtyard

466
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,200
only to find Rui Sibu dead

467
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,120
At that time, I

468
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,760
was already performing in the arts building's small auditorium

469
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,720
completely free from suspicion

470
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,160
Though I was curious

471
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,240
about the mysterious person who provided me the murder method

472
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,120
who exactly they were

473
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,480
but it didn't matter

474
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,280
as long as they helped me achieve my goal

475
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,440
I smiled on stage

476
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,520
knowing Rui Sibu would never appear in

477
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,920
"Swan Lake Push" again

478
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,560
Well then, thank you all

479
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,400
for watching this episode of "Let's Push It! X"

480
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,680
To find out what happens next

481
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,320
stay tuned for Shao Yang's continued explanation next time
