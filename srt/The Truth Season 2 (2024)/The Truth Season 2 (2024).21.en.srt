1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,680
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Game Rules

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,840
Six players per episode

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,360
Divided into four suspects

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,120
and two investigators solving cases

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,840
The real culprit hides among the suspects

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,800
The culprit's objective

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,480
is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,320
without being discovered by others

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,920
Only the real culprit may lie

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,640
Notably,

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,560
this season introduces new mechanics

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,240
The player as culprit

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,160
if passing a certain test

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
can choose between the two investigators

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,600
to corrupt one into becoming X

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,720
X's mission is

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,640
during subsequent investigations

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,480
to actively help the culprit escape

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
Victory conditions:

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,040
After investigation concludes

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
players vote for the culprit

22
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,400
If the culprit receives

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,040
fewer votes than others

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,800
then culprit and X get golden keys

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,040
Otherwise, correct voters

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,440
receive golden keys

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,440
Saturday was supposed to be lively

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,520
busy preparing for the foreign trade company's

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,560
8th anniversary celebration

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,360
We're at Manghuo Street

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,760
HR manager Thomas died in public

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,880
Boss Thomas

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,200
Boss Thomas

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,400
is dead

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,840
After investigation

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,360
They failed to identify the real killer

37
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,360
Regrettably letting them escape

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,040
I told you

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,200
I told you it was him

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,680
Since it's not yet the Sunday reset point

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,240
The killer remains at Manghuo Street temporarily

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,000
After the cycle ends

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,320
They'll be handed over to authorities

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
Manghuo Street still has

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
many unsolved mysteries

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
What did you say?

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
This fax machine

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,560
was working fine a week ago.

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,960
Suddenly, it stopped working.

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,880
The technician said

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,760
this fax machine

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,160
has no issues at all.

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,160
Those with unresolved obsessions bring about the loop.

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,480
Resolve their obsessions,

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,760
and the loop will end.

57
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,680
The key is this symbol.

58
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,600
There’s someone over there.

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,680
He’s wearing a plague doctor mask.

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Do you think tomorrow

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,640
we’ll break free from this loop?

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,720
I'll teach you to be arrogant

63
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,280
Put more strength into it

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,600
I can feel it

65
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,600
Right?

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,040
Yes

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,320
I still have plenty of strength

68
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,760
Plenty of strength

69
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
I think I won't compete with you anymore

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,160
You're a bit mean

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,640
I can't go on

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,440
My hips hurt a bit

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,760
We've been competing all night

74
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,440
Decide the winner

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
No one can change this

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,600
You're not good enough

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,960
Look how you're shaking

78
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,680
You're too skinny

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,000
You're hurting me, oh my god

80
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
I was born tough

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
Last round, let's go

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
I'll find a technique

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,120
Let me see what happens if my leg is outside

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
It can start like this?

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,640
Let me try

86
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:13,840
Okay

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,400
Three, two, one, go

88
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,640
It's still quite difficult, isn't it?

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,520
Right?

90
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,560
Too difficult.

91
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,120
It's too hard to open.

92
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,560
What was that sound?

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,360
What sound?

94
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,880
Not sure.

95
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,280
What's that noise?

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,520
Sounded like a loud bang.

97
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,400
What was that?

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,720
Sounded like something fell.

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
It's coming from that direction.

100
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,920
Yes, right over there.

101
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
The skating rink.

102
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,520
Should we go check it out?

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
Let's wake the others first.

104
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,960
Let's go.

105
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Anyone here?

106
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,760
Are you awake?

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Time to get up!

108
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,320
Wake up, little killer.

109
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Who

110
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,640
Brother Wang

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,480
Time to get up

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,120
Wake up

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
My Xiao Ba

114
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,160
Xiao Ba

115
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,000
Rise and shine

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Did you sleep well?

117
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,680
Pretty good

118
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,400
Time for work

119
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,800
Work

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,880
Copy me

121
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
The three of us have such great chemistry

122
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
We were wrestling all night

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Turned our hair white from the struggle

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Wait, isn't there one more?

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,240
There's one more

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,120
We completely missed each other

127
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,320
Little killer

128
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
Little killer

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,440
They can just break down the door now.

130
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm here to arrest you right now.

131
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
Why is there an axe too?

132
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,600
The most ruthless man.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,640
Wait a second.

134
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,560
Get up first.

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,440
What for?

136
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,400
Did you just hear that?

137
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,240
A loud noise.

138
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,640
I heard it.

139
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,800
The other three didn't hear it.

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,680
Only you heard it.

141
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,160
Right.

142
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,560
How did you hear it?

143
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,360
Get up quickly, hurry!

144
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,120
Little assassins.

145
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,280
Your whole look today is kinda...

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
Getting some bandit vibes.

147
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,200
Stylish.

148
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Classy.

149
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,240
What's the plan?

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,440
Put your hands down

151
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Don't touch

152
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,960
Did you guys hear that noise just now?

153
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
Did you hear that loud bang?

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,920
Didn't hear it.

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,200
No.

156
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,760
Honestly didn't hear anything.

157
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,560
Bai Sect heard the sound.

158
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,000
Right.

159
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,720
What sound?

160
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Heard the sound of you killing someone.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
Stop messing around, okay?

162
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,200
Okay.

163
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,560
None of us heard anything.

164
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,080
Should we go check...

165
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,440
the skating rink?

166
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,400
That sound seemed...

167
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,920
to be coming from the skating rink.

168
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,960
It felt like it was inside the rink, right?

169
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,720
Yeah.

170
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,080
Have some snacks when you wake up.

171
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,800
We started eating as soon as we arrived.

172
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,040
Let's have breakfast first.

173
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,680
Explain this.

174
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
What should I explain?

175
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
Why didn't you two sleep?

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,520
No.

177
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
They just...

178
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,480
Spent the night together.

179
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,000
Just to prove their...

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
They spent the night together.

181
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,360
Warming the bed.

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,680
Keeping each other warm in bed.

183
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,800
Professional bed warmers.

184
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,640
We were on the rooftop.

185
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,760
We were arm wrestling all night.

186
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,520
Who won?

187
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,880
He couldn't possibly beat me.

188
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,760
You beat me.

189
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,720
I didn't beat him either.

190
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
Right.

191
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,720
Because his legs were already weak.

192
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,160
Isn't that right?

193
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
Between us...

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,640
Whose legs were weak?

195
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,760
I'm really shipping them.

196
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,320
Oh my god.

197
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,720
Where could that sound be coming from?

198
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,160
There's no sound at all

199
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,360
In the cabinet

200
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
Be careful, something might come out

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Wait a moment

202
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
Hold on

203
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,280
I'm here

204
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,280
Just a second

205
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,760
Who's this?

206
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,880
Me

207
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,600
Who is this?

208
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,520
Me, Ning

209
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,800
Where are you?

210
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,120
Quick, gather around me.

211
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
Today, whoever comes out, we'll catch them.

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,400
Return to homeland

213
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,240
Return to what?

214
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,640
Return to homeland

215
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,200
What are you saying?

216
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,000
Return to homeland

217
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,280
Please

218
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,880
Every grievance has its cause, every debt its debtor

219
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,800
Just them

220
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,960
Just those few little bald guys of theirs

221
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,000
They're coming, they're coming

222
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,720
Ugh, ugh, ugh

223
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,520
Back off, back off, back off

224
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,600
We can't fight so many of them

225
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
These two went to catch them

226
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,960
Can't see a thing

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,000
The drowning person

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,760
What returns

229
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
Returns to homeland

230
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,840
Drowning

231
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,360
Here it is

232
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,200
Big Scar

233
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,080
Big Eyes

234
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,720
Big Waves

235
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Big Baldie

236
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,000
The three of us are the most timid

237
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,840
They all charge ahead first

238
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,920
Those three rush to the front

239
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,600
Where did you just come from?

240
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,520
Here

241
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,520
From here?

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,480
Warehouse

243
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,120
There's a person

244
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,080
Birdman

245
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Masked figure with a bird's head

246
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,480
The Birdman left

247
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,440
There's someone with a gun in here

248
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:08,960
What does this mean?

249
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,480
Who is this?

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
Put the headgear on the person

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,320
Here it is

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Got shot

253
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,600
That thing on the forehead...

254
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,640
He wrote an "8."

255
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,280
Ba.

256
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,760
It's me.

257
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, it's you.

258
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,440
What's this?

259
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,720
This can be played.

260
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,360
Tui Town 1988.

261
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,560
"The Busy Street with No Exit."

262
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,360
Officially begins.

263
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,560
It's currently Sunday.

264
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,080
6:30 in the morning.

265
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,960
The deceased in this case.

266
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,000
is the person wearing the bird-beak mask from yesterday.

267
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,600
After preliminary investigation,

268
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
the death of the bird-beak mask wearer

269
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
cannot rule out the possibility of homicide.

270
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,960
The murderer who killed him

271
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,200
is narrowed down to Bai Mai,

272
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Sister Ba,

273
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,960
Wang Juanwang,

274
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,520
and Captain Ning—among these four.

275
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Hekefu and Kelidu

276
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,400
can provide alibis for each other,

277
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,640
so they are this case's investigators.

278
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,120
Now,

279
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
the two investigators will remain at the crime scene

280
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,120
to conduct preliminary evidence collection.

281
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,880
Picture album

282
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,480
There's also a box here

283
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,320
This is a combination lock

284
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,440
There's a poem here

285
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I think this

286
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
should be related to the six of us

287
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,840
There's a letter in his pocket

288
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,680
I know you're following me

289
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,040
Go to the skating rink's warehouse at 6 AM

290
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,760
Press the play button on the disc

291
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,360
Then sit down

292
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,960
Watch the images on TV carefully

293
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,080
Remember

294
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,240
Make sure to watch till the end

295
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,960
After watching, your wish will be granted

296
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,840
Disappear from here

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,640
This...

298
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,520
So that was written to him by the killer

299
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,120
Have him come here to see this thing

300
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,000
He's following this person

301
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,000
He's following

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He's following this person

303
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,760
He

304
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,080
This person with the bird beak

305
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,680
Right?

306
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,040
Yes

307
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,400
Then this bird-beaked person

308
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,920
was following the murderer

309
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,800
but was discovered by the murderer

310
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,720
So the murderer lured him here to kill him

311
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
Click to play

312
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,680
Sit down and watch what's on TV properly

313
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,240
Sit down

314
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,560
Watch what's on TV properly

315
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,080
The way you're sitting

316
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,600
Is insulting to him

317
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,400
No

318
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,560
I think there might be some

319
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,520
Is it possible that

320
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,800
From a certain perspective, it can only be this

321
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,680
That's the sound we heard this morning

322
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,280
Just that one gunshot

323
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,160
It was that one gunshot

324
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,320
Keep playing it

325
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,280
Nothing else

326
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
It's playing

327
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,680
After that, it's just this

328
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,040
It was that one gunshot

329
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,240
Bang

330
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,000
Then this footage

331
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,520
Why hasn't it stopped for so long

332
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,640
It's been stuck on this image

333
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
But actually, I feel

334
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,760
that

335
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,600
Do you think it's possible

336
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,280
that his shot

337
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,920
went straight through here

338
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,760
and came out the other side?

339
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,640
Right?

340
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,440
Under normal circumstances, would there be bullets

341
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,960
Could it be that...

342
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
It's also possible

343
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,920
Moreover, this bloodstain

344
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,480
came from behind

345
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,400
emerged from the back

346
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
The attack likely came from the front

347
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,720
Right?

348
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,080
Bang

349
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,720
This spot

350
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,320
After it exploded

351
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,280
It reminds me of a movie

352
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,760
Where someone in the TV screen

353
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,080
fires a gun at someone

354
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,800
and the real person dies

355
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,680
Disc

356
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,960
"The Cursed Disc"

357
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,000
Beware, the person in the disc

358
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,920
might go "bang"

359
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,040
and kill you.

360
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,920
That's the movie I just mentioned—

361
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,120
someone on TV fires a gun,

362
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,920
and in reality,

363
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,800
a person gets shot.

364
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,840
This room is completely empty.

365
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,400
Right.

366
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,200
No way...

367
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,640
How did he die

368
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,360
Well

369
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,640
Suppose I'm the deceased

370
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm sitting here watching TV

371
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,920
Then my heart just explodes

372
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,320
No external force

373
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,760
Nothing from outside hit me

374
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,040
That's more like a superpower

375
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
That kind of thing

376
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,720
But

377
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,560
If we rule that out

378
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,360
If it was a real gunshot

379
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,760
aimed at him

380
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,200
It couldn't be from the front

381
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,360
From the front, he wouldn't

382
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,720
He'd still be unharmed

383
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,520
sitting here

384
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,040
It must have been

385
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,640
when he was completely off guard

386
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,160
Right

387
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,440
The preliminary search of the crime scene is complete.

388
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880
Let's take this box over there.

389
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,080
Officers, please escort the suspect.

390
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
Proceed to the Interrogation Hall.

391
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,400
Prepare for questioning.

392
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,920
Move out.

393
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,680
While investigating the crime scene

394
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,520
members of the Think Tank also collected

395
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,280
some evidence related to this case

396
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,800
Players, please examine the evidence.

397
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,120
First-round deduction.

398
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,480
Everyone's in different states.

399
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,960
At the beginning, everyone first...

400
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,520
Can't hide their excitement.

401
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,280
Why do I have evidence on two people?

402
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,680
The gameplay has leveled up.

403
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,160
The killer can get everyone's evidence.

404
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,640
Really?

405
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,200
Yes.

406
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm deducing, I don't know.

407
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,080
Why are you laughing so...

408
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
You've foreseen you're X.

409
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,640
How could I foresee I'm X?

410
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,800
X hasn't been revealed yet.

411
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,080
Little X.

412
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,200
Little killer.

413
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
You two are X.

414
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
You've infiltrated the deduction team, haven't you?

415
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,880
Now you already know you're X.

416
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Let him show off first.

417
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,840
Let him first...

418
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,680
Soon he'll know he's X.

419
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,480
He'll be stunned himself.

420
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,680
So watch what you say.

421
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,120
Let me tell you.

422
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,760
Little X is between you two.

423
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,920
Don't mention X.

424
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,960
Mentioning X makes you uncomfortable.

425
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,560
Why should you feel uncomfortable?

426
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,960
He's on pins and needles, you know.

427
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,440
This position.

428
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,080
Did you notice

429
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,040
These few people

430
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,520
Especially Brother Bai and Brother Ning

431
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,960
Whether they're playing deduction games

432
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
Or suspect games

433
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,800
They always dominate

434
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,120
They crushed me yesterday, almost got me

435
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,560
Look at them with UV lights

436
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,520
Acting all serious like it's real

437
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,680
Finished watching

438
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,520
Done watching

439
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,080
Finished watching, let's begin

440
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,400
Then let's start

441
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
First, everyone explain

442
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
Your relationship with the deceased

443
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
I'll start

444
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,480
I didn't know the deceased

445
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,320
I had no relationship with the deceased

446
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,920
Didn't know them either

447
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,680
Didn't know them

448
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,520
What about Brother Bai?

449
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,760
We have deep connections

450
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,200
Can't say right now

451
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,520
Stop trying to steal the spotlight

452
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,200
Please

453
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,880
Fine, okay

454
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,040
No relationship, okay

455
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,440
Sis Dilraba

456
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,480
I didn't know the deceased, no relationship

457
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Didn't know them, no relationship

458
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,320
I didn't know the deceased either

459
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,160
Didn't know them either, okay

460
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,560
None of us knew them

461
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,400
Next,

462
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
we'll share with everyone

463
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
some relevant evidence

464
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,800
we found at the crime scene.

465
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,720
The incident occurred at

466
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,440
around 6:30 in the morning.

467
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
The location was

468
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,160
inside the skating rink's warehouse.

469
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
We estimate the time of death

470
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,600
was around 6 AM.

471
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,120
Because Hercule and I

472
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,880
heard a loud noise

473
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
at around 6 AM,

474
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,880
similar to a gunshot.

475
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,560
Notable characteristics on the body:

476
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,320
First, we found

477
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,080
he was wearing this plague doctor mask.

478
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,960
The bleeding was

479
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,440
from the left side of the heart,

480
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,240
piercing completely through

481
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,200
from chest to back.

482
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
A significant amount of blood

483
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,080
flowed down his back,

484
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,400
onto the chair,

485
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,560
and then dripped to the floor.

486
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,680
His state at death

487
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
was very peaceful -

488
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
very calmly

489
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,240
sitting in this chair,

490
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,080
watching TV,

491
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,880
and then he died.

492
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,960
Therefore we conclude

493
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,040
there were no obvious signs

494
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,800
of resistance or struggle.

495
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,840
This means

496
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,560
it's highly likely the victim

497
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
was killed completely

498
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,880
unaware and defenseless.

499
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,000
And what was he watching on this TV

500
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,040
and why he was watching TV

501
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,240
is quite intriguing.

502
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,600
In the deceased's pocket,

503
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,760
we found a letter.

504
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,800
There was a letter in his pocket.

505
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,600
The letter stated:

506
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
"I know you're following me."

507
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,000
"Go to the skating rink's warehouse at 6 AM,"

508
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,080
"press play on the disc,"

509
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,560
"then sit down"

510
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,480
"and watch the footage carefully."

511
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,200
"Remember,"

512
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,480
"you must watch until the very end."

513
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,080
"After that, I'll disappear as you wish."

514
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,480
"I'll vanish from here."

515
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,400
From this letter,

516
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
we can gather a few clues:

517
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,560
First,

518
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,600
the killer was being followed by the deceased,

519
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,320
and the deceased wanted the killer gone.

520
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,840
What is this thing that killed him?

521
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,280
The disc he was watching is called

522
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,360
"The Cursed Disc"

523
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,880
It says here

524
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,040
"Beware of being killed by someone from the disc"

525
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,680
with a loud "bang" sound

526
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,840
This disc

527
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,120
He Tuitan and I also watched it at the scene

528
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,040
It showed

529
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,600
just some very partial footage

530
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,040
close-up shots

531
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,600
Then suddenly a person

532
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,280
appeared holding a revolver

533
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,880
slowly raised the gun

534
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,960
and with a "bang" sound

535
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,480
This "bang" sound

536
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,000
is similar to what He Tuitan and I

537
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,160
heard around 6 AM

538
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,520
But at the scene

539
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,160
we didn't find any murder weapon

540
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,280
or traces of ammunition or gunpowder

541
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
which means

542
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,680
it might not have been a gun that killed him

543
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,200
It could have been another object

544
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
that pierced his heart

545
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,760
Or perhaps he set up some kind of mechanism

546
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,160
in advance at the scene

547
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,440
or something similar

548
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,200
Did you find any mechanism?

549
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,560
No

550
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,480
Just speculation

551
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,480
So

552
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,080
How did he manage to do this?

553
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,000
I think

554
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,440
My personal judgment is

555
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,960
that

556
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,600
when the culprit committed the crime,

557
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,640
he may not have been at the scene.

558
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,320
Because at the scene,

559
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
we didn’t find

560
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,880
any obvious hiding spots.

561
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,200
This warehouse is very small—

562
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,880
there’s basically no space in the front,

563
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,680
and this cabinet

564
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,560
couldn’t hide anyone either.

565
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,120
This cabinet can’t conceal a person.

566
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,640
So this proves

567
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,880
that if this logic holds,

568
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,000
today’s culprit

569
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,600
most likely has an alibi,

570
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,560
because when committing the crime,

571
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,480
he didn’t necessarily have to be present.

572
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,080
Regarding the corpse and crime scene details

573
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,800
That's about it

574
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
Next we have many

575
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
pieces of evidence found at the scene

576
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,560
Let Detective He share them with us

577
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,680
Yes

578
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,600
First

579
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,960
What we found at the scene was a

580
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,520
picture book

581
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,520
Then in this photo album,

582
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,880
there's a photo of each person

583
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
with a little boy.

584
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,000
In my photo with him,

585
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
we're just standing together posing.

586
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,280
In Captain Ning's photo,

587
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,680
he's feeding strawberries to the boy.

588
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,200
In Ke Lidu's photo,

589
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,400
they're playing games at an arcade.

590
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,200
In Wang Juanwang's photo,

591
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,240
the boy is riding on his shoulders.

592
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,200
In Sis Ba's photo,

593
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,560
there's an abacus -

594
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,520
probably teaching him arithmetic.

595
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,080
In our Bai Sect's photo,

596
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,400
they're eating noodles.

597
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,280
And in every picture, the boy

598
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,040
is holding those marbles

599
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,640
we found yesterday.

600
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,760
Right, and the number varies each time.

601
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,440
No, something just bounced down.

602
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,280
Yes, that person at the door just now.

603
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,760
Dropped a few things on the ground.

604
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
Marbles.

605
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,640
I've got one here.

606
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,360
And here's another one.

607
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,200
I have two here.

608
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,760
What's most peculiar is the boy's head.

609
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,440
Also has the number "8."

610
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,960
This "8" is the same as the one on the victim's head.

611
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
So it's actually quite obvious.

612
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,200
We can deduce that this boy.

613
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,080
and the victim are the same person.

614
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,920
Actually, it's clear to see.

615
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,520
This boy has connections.

616
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,920
with all of you.

617
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,760
Speak up.

618
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Why do you all claim.

619
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,800
not to know the killer?

620
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,760
But the "8" on the killer's head.

621
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,800
should be in your memories.

622
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,920
It must have appeared before.

623
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,560
The killer.

624
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,360
Right.

625
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,720
This boy is clearly the killer.

626
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,680
On his head is...

627
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
The boy is clearly the victim.

628
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,080
The victim.

629
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,680
The victim.

630
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,520
The boy is the victim.

631
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,080
Damn it.

632
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,080
Confused detectives.

633
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
What are you playing at?

634
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,920
Don't target my teammate.

635
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,720
You two detectives speak first.

636
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,840
I know about this.

637
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,200
Because when I was young.

638
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,600
I taught this kid to play games.

639
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
He loved drawing.

640
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,920
He drew a picture.

641
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
of us playing games together.

642
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,920
He sketched it.

643
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,600
In my memory.

644
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,000
that's the only thing.

645
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,240
But one thing I'm unsure about.

646
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,040
is whether the boy in the drawing.

647
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,640
is actually him.

648
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,160
I don't quite remember if he.

649
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,440
looked exactly like in the drawing.

650
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,240
In everyone's memory,

651
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
do you have any experiences

652
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
of interacting with children?

653
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,400
I do have one.

654
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,000
I actually remember this drawing.

655
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,880
Because when I was little,

656
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,440
I met a little boy.

657
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,160
While playing together,

658
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,600
he wanted to take a photo.

659
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,160
At that time,

660
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,240
I taught him a pose -

661
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,960
my signature pose:

662
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,880
crossing my legs.

663
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,720
This little boy

664
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,840
loved drawing,

665
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,160
so he drew

666
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,920
this photo.

667
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,720
That's why I remember this drawing.

668
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,400
But whether the boy had an "8" on his face,

669
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,920
I really don't recall.

670
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,000
Wasted purchase.

671
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,160
I suspect he might be

672
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,560
that little brother I remember.

673
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:45,520
Blood relation?

674
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,640
He was a child

675
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
our family took in.

676
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,920
I often took him out for noodles.

677
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,080
Right.

678
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,840
That's when he drew this picture.

679
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Yes.

680
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,920
So we're not actually certain.

681
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,080
What did you just say?

682
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,120
Took into your home?

683
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,800
Yes.

684
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
We can only say it's possible.

685
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,840
Because we did similar

686
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,760
but can't confirm.

687
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,600
Yes, things like in the drawing.

688
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,920
Right, but can't confirm.

689
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,000
Captain Ning

690
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,720
The one who feeds strawberries

691
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,320
Do you remember?

692
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,400
This photo

693
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,360
I do remember this painting

694
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,680
Because when I was little at home

695
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
adopted one

696
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,280
adopted a child

697
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,560
Big Cousin

698
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,880
I was stunned after hearing you two

699
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,800
You know what?

700
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,320
It's fine, we'll talk later

701
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,880
I remember this child

702
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,600
But I don’t remember

703
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
whether he had an "8" on his head

704
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,760
I don’t remember his face

705
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,520
But when I was little

706
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,200
our family adopted a child

707
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
The scene of feeding him strawberries

708
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,920
he drew it

709
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,120
He liked drawing

710
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,520
so he drew it

711
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,200
We’re the same now

712
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,920
Don’t remember the "8"

713
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,240
We probably share the same memory

714
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,640
Next

715
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Wang Esq.

716
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,640
Let me see

717
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,800
I don't really remember this child

718
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,080
No impression at all

719
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,200
Has any child ever been this close to you?

720
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,320
Well, my child used to play like this with me

721
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Often lifting them like this

722
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,000
You have a son?

723
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,840
I have a son

724
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,360
Your son...

725
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,960
But I have no connection with this child at all

726
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,520
So where is your son now?

727
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,520
My son...

728
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Is at home

729
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,040
At home

730
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,000
So his son is at home

731
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,240
That was a deceased person

732
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,080
That one was dead

733
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
How old was he then?

734
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,200
My son doesn't...

735
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,840
A child, right?

736
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Yes

737
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,600
A child

738
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,960
Your son is still a child now?

739
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,360
Child

740
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,760
Why are you...

741
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,320
Smirking like that?

742
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,040
Alright, next one.

743
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,640
Dilraba

744
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,360
I have no memory

745
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,920
of this child with an 8 on his head.

746
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,960
But

747
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,480
I did teach my younger brother

748
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,960
how to use

749
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,760
the abacus.

750
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,000
You taught your brother?

751
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,760
Yes.

752
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,520
But I'm not sure if this person

753
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,560
is actually my brother.

754
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,360
Because I don't remember

755
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,040
my brother having an 8

756
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,000
shaped scar on his head.

757
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,720
This is getting complicated today.

758
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,680
Wait, so we're all family?

759
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
We're one family.

760
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,120
One big happy family.

761
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,920
Actually, it's not all of us.

762
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,520
Only he is...

763
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,640
You're X.

764
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,440
Okay.

765
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,120
These six drawings

766
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,880
actually have one more thing in common.

767
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,440
On each of our clothes,

768
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,920
there's this same symbol.

769
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,080
What symbol?

770
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,120
A symbol of running forward.

771
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,040
Right.

772
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,240
You can take a look.

773
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,000
Running forward.

774
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,880
Correct.

775
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,480
It's the same on everyone.

776
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,160
An identical symbol.

777
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,120
So what does this mean?

778
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,120
Don't you understand what it means?

779
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,040
Exactly.

780
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,080
Aren't you clear about it?

781
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,880
I know it very well.

782
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,960
Little killer.

783
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,120
The evidence found later was

784
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,200
a locked case.

785
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,920
There's also a box here.

786
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,560
This is a combination lock.

787
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,200
Five

788
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,320
Pinyin letters.

789
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,720
There's a poem here.

790
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,080
And a piece of parchment was found.

791
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,720
On the parchment,

792
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,480
it's that song we often hear.

793
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Busy Street, flickering candlelight,

794
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,000
Helpless River, endless cycle,

795
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,200
Drowning souls return home,

796
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,120
Starry night divides two realms,

797
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,360
Wandering spirits, don't look back,

798
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,280
Move forward, driven by obsession,

799
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,520
Boats capsize, spring awaits,

800
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,760
Inside "Town Push," people fall,

801
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,960
Winter passes, by your side,

802
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,080
Unrecognized kin, how strange.

803
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,920
This is

804
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,480
This is the poem's

805
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,360
first half.

806
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,760
The second half has another clue:

807
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,400
Front is heaven,

808
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,280
Back is earth,

809
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,480
Heaven meets earth, truth revealed.

810
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,840
Then there's a word puzzle.

811
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,080
Take a look.

812
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,520
Rearrange the initials.

813
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,600
Who wrote it?

814
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,920
It was already there.

815
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,840
At the same time, a

816
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,880
five-digit code was found.

817
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,000
It's in English letters.

818
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,800
For the Alices.

819
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,320
No way.

820
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,560
There's also one inside the skating rink.

821
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,440
Inside the skating rink,

822
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,600
Right.

823
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,760
a calendar was found.

824
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,200
Calendar

825
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,440
Isn't this just...

826
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,760
The Ten Heavenly Stems

827
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,880
Front represents heaven, back represents earth

828
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,960
Front is heaven

829
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,480
Heavenly Stems come first

830
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,000
Back is earth

831
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,560
So it's about the year then

832
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,800
Earthly Branches come after

833
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,520
Then

834
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,160
Manghuo Street counts as heaven

835
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,800
Candlelight flicker counts as earth

836
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,040
Is this what's underneath?

837
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,000
Isn't this it?

838
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,160
This is the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches

839
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,880
You need to use this to solve that puzzle

840
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,880
Explain to us how to solve it

841
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,120
It doesn't say

842
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,640
What's written above is

843
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,760
The clue is "front is heaven, back is earth"

844
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,560
When heaven and earth meet, truth appears

845
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,320
My intuition tells me it's

846
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,240
The sequence is scrambled

847
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Then we talked about Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches

848
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,920
So I took the calendar's

849
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,720
Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches

850
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,080
And arranged them all

851
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
The first parts all use Heavenly Stems as markers

852
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,880
So starting from Manghuo Street

853
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,000
To the ten phrases about unrecognized relatives

854
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,680
All use Heavenly Stems

855
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,720
A B C D E F G H

856
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,520
Let's assign numbers

857
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,400
These are the ten Heavenly Stems

858
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,440
The latter half represents

859
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,640
The first ten Earthly Branches

860
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,600
Arranged from top to bottom

861
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,400
Then there's a sequence

862
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,480
A meets B at position

863
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,720
Then we rearrange starting from each marker

864
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,760
Reorganize the order

865
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,120
After rearrangement

866
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,080
It forms a new poem

867
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,400
Busy Street, so strange

868
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,640
Helpless River divides two realms

869
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,440
Boats capsize, people fall

870
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,200
Starry night, candlelight flickers

871
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,640
Drowned souls return home

872
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,760
In "Town Push", eternal cycle

873
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,240
Wandering souls, bound by obsession

874
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,400
Unaware of loved ones nearby

875
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,400
Winter passes, spring follows

876
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,200
Move forward, don't look back

877
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,120
This is the recomposed poem

878
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,920
Its meaning has changed significantly

879
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,080
I've rearranged it

880
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,560
Now it's four lines per stanza

881
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,040
Exactly a five-stanza poem

882
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,440
And this locked case

883
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,000
Has a five-letter combination

884
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Formed by English letters

885
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,680
Corresponding to initial letters

886
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,720
B S D C W

887
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,600
Impressive

888
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,000
I want to

889
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
apologize for calling you a clueless investigator earlier

890
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,640
I'm sorry

891
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,200
This is getting interesting

892
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,080
What is this?

893
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,680
It's a notice

894
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,520
The ill-fated ship

895
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,800
No. 4444

896
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
Missing persons investigation announcement

897
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Ship No. 4444

898
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,600
The bottom part is smeared with ink

899
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,800
It's already covered

900
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,680
Let us pray for the missing

901
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,520
Mr. Wang

902
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,280
Mr. He

903
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,040
Mr. Bai

904
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,480
Person A

905
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:07,800
Person B

906
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,160
Person C

907
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,760
Mr. Thomas

908
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,160
Mr. Ke

909
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,440
Mr. Ba

910
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,120
Mr. Ning

911
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,880
Let me see

912
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,040
We all went missing

913
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,520
We all disappeared from the ill-fated ship

914
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,920
Let us pray for the missing Mr. Wang

915
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,040
Is Mr. Wang him?

916
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Is Mr. He him?

917
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,480
Mr. Bai

918
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,160
Persons A, B, and C

919
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,640
These three are already dead

920
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,480
They were killed

921
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,080
Three of our employees died unexpectedly

922
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,280
Three employees

923
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,920
They were all outstanding employees

924
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,800
Then Mr. Thomas

925
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,120
Thomas

926
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,120
Mr. Ke, you

927
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,840
Mr. Ba, you

928
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,880
Mr. Ning, me

929
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,480
Which means we were all

930
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,840
passengers on Ship No. 4444

931
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,920
And we all went missing

932
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,680
Right

933
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,000
Then this ink splatter

934
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,080
What information is being covered by the ink splatter?

935
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,320
It must be very

936
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,520
We'll have to rely on guesswork

937
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,360
Things like the timeline

938
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,280
Right?

939
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
It should be about the ship capsizing incident

940
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,000
And the entire accident's

941
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,280
Description

942
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,760
Look

943
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,080
This part here has names

944
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,160
Comma

945
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,840
There are many people we can't see

946
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,680
And many others

947
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:14,880
Yes

948
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,400
So there are still many people

949
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,080
So in this town,

950
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,560
all the people

951
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
are those who have already lost contact.

952
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,760
If what's written here

953
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,960
about these missing people

954
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,120
refers to one, two, three, four, five, six

955
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,360
meaning the six of us

956
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,520
then why are we here?

957
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
Or to make an analogy

958
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,200
if this week is a cycle

959
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,000
have we through this cycle

960
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,120
returned to this town again?

961
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,040
So what exactly are we?

962
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,800
In that poem you just recited

963
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,240
there was something about returning

964
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,800
Yes

965
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,360
This

966
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,200
This is my rewritten version

967
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,160
Rewritten?

968
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
The boat capsizes, the person...

969
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,840
The person falls

970
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,360
On this starry moonlit night

971
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,840
The candlelight flickers

972
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,240
This line

973
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,160
actually refers to the capsized boat and lost contact

974
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,280
The drowning victims

975
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Return to their homeland

976
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,040
Doesn't that mean they've returned?

977
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,760
We've returned

978
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,240
In "Zhen Tui", it's an eternal cycle

979
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,040
We're cycling within it

980
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,840
Tui Zhen

981
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,480
What's "Zhen Tui"?

982
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,760
It should clearly be Tui Zhen

983
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,320
Right

984
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,000
Tui Zhen

985
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,040
"Zhen Tui"

986
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,080
It's reversed

987
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
And Tui Zhen

988
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,200
"Zhen Tui"

989
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,720
So the world we're in

990
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,560
isn't the real world

991
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,840
Therefore the space we currently exist in

992
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,320
should be called "Zhen Tui"

993
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,080
Yes, we're currently in "Zhen Tui"

994
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,160
So we're in a cycle

995
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,920
Correct

996
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,480
Then you see these wandering spirits, bound by their obsessions,

997
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,360
unaware their loved ones are right beside them.

998
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,120
They don't realize their family

999
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,920
is actually right here with us.

1000
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,480
In truth, we are all

1001
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,560
one loving family.

1002
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,240
But we just don't realize it.

1003
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,800
Is that what you mean?

1004
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,920
Possibly.

1005
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
If he's the elder cousin,

1006
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,320
the elder cousin...

1007
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,200
This...

1008
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,720
This is just speculation.

1009
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,560
Right, just a hypothesis.

1010
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,320
Exactly, hypothetical.

1011
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,320
Say your girlfriend and cousin go missing,

1012
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,920
right?

1013
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,440
Yes, they eloped together.

1014
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,880
You...

1015
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,640
Your wife ran off with your elder brother.

1016
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,640
Stop leading everyone astray.

1017
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,360
You'll confuse everyone soon.

1018
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,120
Little killer.

1019
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,240
You little killer...

1020
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,880
I won't call you "little killer" today.

1021
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,400
You're just a rookie.

1022
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,120
You're nothing but a rookie.

1023
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,400
Let's continue sharing evidence.

1024
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,200
There's also...

1025
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,840
The unsolved evidence.

1026
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,560
A six-digit combination lock.

1027
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,520
It probably represents...

1028
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,320
Each of us six solving one part.

1029
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,240
With each part being three digits.

1030
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,920
Let's assume the deceased...

1031
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,760
was someone we knew as kids.

1032
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,040
We interacted with this child.

1033
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,080
Since he cared so much for us six...

1034
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,400
The six passwords he set...

1035
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,240
must relate to us six.

1036
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
Three-digit passwords...

1037
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,880
related to people...

1038
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,640
what could they be?

1039
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
Birthdays.

1040
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,040
Dates, anniversaries...

1041
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,600
things like that.

1042
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,120
Now I'd like to ask all the suspects

1043
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,000
to share the evidence you've collected.

1044
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,000
Let's start with Sis Ba.

1045
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
I'll share first.

1046
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,680
This was on the table at Hekefu's house—

1047
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,160
titled *The Big Scoop of Tui Town*.

1048
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,280
Then there's his poster—

1049
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,800
"Tui Town's Boldest."

1050
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,600
"Father of Tui Town's Most Timid."

1051
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,240
What does this mean?

1052
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,320
Right.

1053
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,080
This "Tui Town's Boldest"—

1054
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,320
is my father.

1055
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,880
My father was...

1056
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,040
My dad, yes

1057
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,960
My dad

1058
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,880
My dad is an incredibly brave

1059
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,080
and responsible true man

1060
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,920
And then he had a son like me

1061
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,720
who's afraid of the dark

1062
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,080
afraid of climbing trees

1063
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,320
and not very physically strong

1064
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,480
Moreover, my dad

1065
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,680
is also an employee at our Tuimanghuo Trading Company

1066
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,520
(a staff member)

1067
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,200
His job is as a crew member on ships

1068
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,120
So I've always been working hard

1069
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,040
Actually, I've always wanted to follow

1070
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,920
in my dad's footsteps

1071
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,800
I want to become a true man like my father

1072
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,160
This has been my goal from the beginning

1073
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,600
and the reason I work so hard

1074
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Then there was this piece of clothing

1075
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,240
found on a hanger at Hekefu's house

1076
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,560
This is the same as what you saw

1077
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,480
in that little boy's drawing

1078
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,040
worn by the same person

1079
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,880
But it has the number 4444 written on the back

1080
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,120
So this should be a sailor's uniform

1081
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,600
There's quite a story behind this

1082
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,040
My father went out on the river last Sunday

1083
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,800
Then I went to the shore

1084
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,240
to look for my father

1085
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,080
but discovered

1086
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,680
that

1087
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,640
the navigation light was out

1088
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,800
you know

1089
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
the guiding lighthouse

1090
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,720
the one above the river

1091
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,600
I went to fix that light

1092
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,640
but accidentally

1093
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
fell into the river

1094
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,720
Wait

1095
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,280
What did you say?

1096
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,760
Your father went out on the river last Sunday?

1097
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,600
Yes, he never came back

1098
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,440
So I went looking for him

1099
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,080
I went to wait for him

1100
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,040
Then you went to wait for him

1101
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,000
But you didn't find him

1102
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,280
and noticed the light was out

1103
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:52,520
Right

1104
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,560
You went to fix the lighthouse

1105
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,520
Then you fell from the lighthouse

1106
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:55,960
Yes

1107
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Then how didn't you die?

1108
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,600
I mean

1109
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,800
How did you survive?

1110
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,000
I haven't finished the story

1111
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,440
Sorry

1112
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,640
Yes

1113
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,920
After I fell

1114
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,600
by sheer coincidence

1115
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,440
Wang Juanwang saved me

1116
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,240
And he was piloting boat number 4444

1117
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,360
What happened to my clothes?

1118
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,840
I was wearing this outfit when I went there.

1119
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,520
I was on the boat.

1120
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,640
I accidentally tripped and fell.

1121
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,800
Coincidentally, his paint wasn't dry yet.

1122
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,000
So it got on my clothes.

1123
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,040
Then I went back home.

1124
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:36,600
After returning,

1125
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,640
I never saw my father again.

1126
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,000
After I lit the lighthouse,

1127
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,600
I haven't seen my dad since then.

1128
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,960
That Exhibit Number Three

1129
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,800
Exhibit Three is a box

1130
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,520
found in the Ning family's wardrobe

1131
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,680
at the very bottom

1132
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,000
This box

1133
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,320
hasn't been opened

1134
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,080
You can try opening it

1135
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,040
This...

1136
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,640
You scared me!

1137
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,320
It just has some small toys inside.

1138
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,160
Specially for Iron Sand Palm training.

1139
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,320
There's also an eye mask and a rope.

1140
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,520
For courtyard bungee jumping.

1141
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,240
And there's another eye mask.

1142
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
The eye mask says "for use in darkness."

1143
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,400
Captain Ning.

1144
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
We found these in your house.

1145
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,320
What does this mean?

1146
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,880
It's a long story.

1147
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:40,760
Why do you say...

1148
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,080
I'm the most hardworking uncle here.

1149
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,840
Because I'm older than everyone here.

1150
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,600
In age.

1151
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,440
I'm 46 years old.

1152
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,800
Then you're younger than me.

1153
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,720
I'm 51.

1154
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Younger than you.

1155
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,560
Yes, brother.

1156
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,520
And you're trying to act like the boss?

1157
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,000
No.

1158
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,400
Just uncle things.

1159
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Then 35 years ago,

1160
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,320
due to family circumstances, my cousin

1161
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,560
came to live with us.

1162
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,120
Let's call him my second brother.

1163
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,640
30 years ago,

1164
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,680
my third brother

1165
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,800
was born.

1166
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,840
Third brother was born.

1167
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,640
Then as the eldest brother,

1168
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,320
with our parents gone,

1169
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,960
I, as the eldest,

1170
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,000
raised my second and third brothers alone.

1171
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,320
Elder cousin.

1172
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,320
Elder brother.

1173
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,200
Wait a moment

1174
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,200
26 years ago

1175
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
I had a son

1176
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,960
My son had one particular trait

1177
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,840
He was extremely timid

1178
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,760
Especially afraid of the dark

1179
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:50,920
No

1180
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,240
Call me father?

1181
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,400
Extremely timid

1182
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,080
This

1183
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,640
My father was too

1184
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,760
He lived with his younger brother and cousin

1185
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
They lived together

1186
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,960
That's right, it matches

1187
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,240
You're my nephew

1188
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,760
Continue

1189
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,080
Here's the thing

1190
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,760
Because I, how should I put it

1191
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,240
I've been exceptionally brave since childhood

1192
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,640
Born with courage

1193
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,680
Afraid of nothing

1194
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,080
My father said

1195
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,760
You're probably just like your grandfather

1196
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,480
Your grandfather was also

1197
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,520
fearless since childhood

1198
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,760
So

1199
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,120
I hope my son

1200
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,480
will be as brave as me

1201
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,560
That's why there's bungee jumping

1202
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,560
Skylight bungee ropes

1203
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,760
So he won't fear heights

1204
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,040
Giving him blindfolds

1205
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,320
So he won't fear darkness

1206
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:33,880
Right?

1207
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,200
Getting him iron palm training equipment

1208
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,080
So he can build strong physique

1209
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,200
Have an excellent body

1210
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,520
I am a ship captain

1211
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,920
On February 3rd, eight years ago

1212
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,920
That night

1213
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
I was sailing on the Wukenai River

1214
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,160
Navigating along this river

1215
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,840
But as luck would have it

1216
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
I encountered a storm

1217
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,320
At that moment I noticed

1218
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,560
There should have been a lighthouse on shore

1219
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,520
But the lighthouse lamp

1220
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,320
Wasn't lit at all

1221
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:56,920
So

1222
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,560
I couldn't find my way home

1223
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
Just as I was overwhelmed with emotions

1224
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,080
Suddenly the light came on

1225
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,440
I went and fixed that light

1226
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,760
At that moment I was so happy

1227
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,120
I followed the direction of that light

1228
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,480
And steered toward shore

1229
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,000
I made it home safely

1230
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,800
After arriving home, my younger brother told me

1231
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,040
Big brother

1232
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,480
Tonight

1233
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,080
The person who lit that lamp for you

1234
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,080
Was your son

1235
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,560
He feared you wouldn't make it home

1236
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,880
So he conquered his fear of heights

1237
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,720
Overcame his fear of darkness

1238
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,520
Conquered all his fears

1239
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,840
Climbed to the top of that tower

1240
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,280
And lit that lamp for me

1241
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,880
So I could return home safely

1242
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,480
So in my heart

1243
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,880
I think my son is truly

1244
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:35,960
Amazing

1245
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,560
The best

1246
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,040
My son has grown up.

1247
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,280
This has me at a loss.

1248
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,080
Everything is correct.

1249
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,720
Father and son should reunite.

1250
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,200
Right.

1251
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,920
Really.

1252
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,920
It's time.

1253
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,400
You need to make peace with the world.

1254
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,840
Nephew.

1255
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,840
No.

1256
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,000
You just mentioned a point.

1257
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,920
You said it was.

1258
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Light up this lamp.

1259
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,760
And this series of events.

1260
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,000
Was eight years ago.

1261
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,520
Yes, eight years ago.

1262
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,880
Then I lit this lamp.

1263
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,200
But I did it last Sunday.

1264
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,000
You said it was 8 years ago

1265
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,440
Your son

1266
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,440
Lit the guiding light for you

1267
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,000
But when I lit this light for my father

1268
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,760
It was last Sunday

1269
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,920
February 3rd

1270
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,200
Or was it the 7th?

1271
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,080
Right?

1272
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,920
It was the 7th, wasn't it?

1273
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,960
Our timelines are completely messed up

1274
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,720
All wrong

1275
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,680
His timeline is from 8 years ago

1276
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,080
What they're describing matches up

1277
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,920
It's from 8 years ago

1278
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,440
Calendar

1279
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,720
Eight years ago was 1980.

1280
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,520
February 1980

1281
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,080
The 3rd was a Sunday.

1282
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,240
February 3rd, 1988

1283
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,480
February 7th is a Sunday.

1284
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,320
But I went to light this lamp for my father.

1285
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,080
It was last Sunday.

1286
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,920
February 3rd

1287
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,320
So logically speaking,

1288
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:27,960
If you remember

1289
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,880
that it was February 3rd,

1290
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,160
then that was 8 years ago.

1291
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,320
Only in 1980 was Sunday

1292
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,000
February 3rd.

1293
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,920
Why would you remember

1294
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,320
last week being February 3rd?

1295
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,840
Last Sunday was clearly February 7th.

1296
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,480
You're from 1980.

1297
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,120
How old are you?

1298
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,280
I'm 18 years old.

1299
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,280
Now.

1300
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,720
Yes, I'm 18.

1301
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:50,880
Currently 18.

1302
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,480
Back then you were 10.

1303
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,840
In 1980, you were 10.

1304
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,520
No.

1305
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,000
He was 18 in 1980.

1306
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,800
He's now 18.

1307
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,960
No, I know.

1308
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,120
My current time

1309
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,640
is the same as yours.

1310
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,640
1988.

1311
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,520
But when I say last week,

1312
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,760
it was 1980, right?

1313
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,240
So I remember last week

1314
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,840
being 1980,

1315
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,280
which means my 8 years in between

1316
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,600
disappeared within this week.

1317
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,400
You don't exist for the 8 years you remember.

1318
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,360
Right, those 8 years don't exist.

1319
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,440
Why is that?

1320
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,040
I think it's time

1321
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,520
to call out.

1322
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,320
Is there anything else to say?

1323
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,760
This person is

1324
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,120
Dad

1325
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,120
Father

1326
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,400
Good son

1327
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,200
Finally meeting you

1328
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,440
My good boy

1329
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,920
So handsome

1330
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,800
As expected, you inherited my height

1331
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,000
Not bad, this

1332
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,720
Good, this nephew is good

1333
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,080
The nephew is quite fine

1334
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,600
I still remember to this day

1335
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,240
Your brave climb up that lighthouse

1336
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,600
That's how it is

1337
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,240
Today I feel

1338
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,720
there's a destined fate

1339
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,880
All three of us have white hair

1340
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,360
Right?

1341
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,040
It seems like people from the Ning family

1342
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,440
are supposed to have white hair

1343
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,000
You're real relatives

1344
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You turned this pale by age 18

1345
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,720
You're actual relatives

1346
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,720
Then you little murderer

1347
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,440
Deliberately dyed your hair black

1348
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,280
Little killer

1349
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,160
No

1350
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,080
He's one of our own

1351
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,160
Never mind, let him go for now

1352
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,640
Now he's my cousin

1353
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:43,600
I'm closely

1354
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,040
watching your every move today

1355
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,600
Little brother, watch yourself

1356
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,040
Nephew, you better watch yourself

1357
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,520
But there's a problem

1358
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,720
My father just left last Sunday

1359
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,400
He just disappeared

1360
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,880
You appeared before me

1361
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,960
I couldn't recognize you

1362
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,840
Because eight years have passed

1363
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,000
You've grown up

1364
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,320
He's grown up

1365
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:05,760
For me

1366
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,160
No eight years have passed

1367
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,160
I've aged eight years

1368
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,880
Right

1369
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,680
My father has grown old.

1370
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,760
Wait, I haven't finished yet.

1371
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:16,640
Yes.

1372
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,600
My story isn't finished yet.

1373
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,320
About the story between me and my son.

1374
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,040
My son climbed the lighthouse bravely.

1375
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,560
to guide me home.

1376
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,120
He became that beam of light.

1377
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,000
in the distant darkness.

1378
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,000
That brought me back.

1379
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
After I returned home,

1380
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,760
I learned it was you who lit the lamp for me.

1381
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,080
So I turned back to the dock to save you.

1382
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,360
But I found you had disappeared.

1383
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,520
On February 3rd, eight years ago,

1384
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,960
my son disappeared.

1385
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,680
Then someone told me.

1386
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,800
that my son was pushed into the river.

1387
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,520
So I was...

1388
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,640
extremely sad and heartbroken.

1389
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
For these eight years,

1390
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,680
I've been searching for my son.

1391
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,520
Who told you that?

1392
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,600
Just passersby who saw it.

1393
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,640
Bystanders said it.

1394
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,720
Those people down there said.

1395
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,600
"Your son seemed to have been pushed down."

1396
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,200
It was just hearsay.

1397
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,760
You haven't seen me in these eight years?

1398
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:11,920
Right.

1399
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,560
Which means...

1400
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
I haven't seen you for eight years.

1401
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,760
So you said your father went missing at that time

1402
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,760
It was on that same day

1403
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,520
After you returned

1404
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,480
he never came back

1405
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,440
Last Sunday, that's correct

1406
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,880
In his perception

1407
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,720
he only disappeared for 7 days

1408
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,720
But for us

1409
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,800
he's been gone for 8 years

1410
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,400
Where did you go?

1411
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,040
Let's ask our Wang Juanwang

1412
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,360
what's really wrong with this ship

1413
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,880
As we just mentioned

1414
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,080
I remember last Sunday

1415
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,320
was actually last Sunday in 1980

1416
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,680
The missing 8 years in between

1417
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,160
when did that time gap begin?

1418
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,360
It might have started when I boarded your ship

1419
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,760
We'll have to ask Old Wang about this

1420
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,160
So this story

1421
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,600
goes back eight years ago

1422
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,240
Eight years ago

1423
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,720
I had just returned home

1424
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,640
when my son went missing

1425
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,360
That very night

1426
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,280
I discovered

1427
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,040
my neighbor surnamed Wang

1428
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,160
had also disappeared

1429
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,840
He left behind two children

1430
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,440
Out of compassion

1431
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,200
I thought these two kids

1432
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,200
a 17-year-old girl

1433
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,920
and a 10-year-old boy

1434
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,160
would struggle

1435
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,440
to survive in this society

1436
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:23,960
So

1437
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,960
I took them in

1438
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,120
into my home

1439
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,080
My cousin,

1440
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,800
my younger brother,

1441
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,840
and I - the three of us

1442
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,640
now adults

1443
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,720
work to support

1444
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,160
this sister and brother

1445
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,680
We fund the sister's

1446
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,160
university education elsewhere

1447
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,480
She rarely comes home

1448
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,640
The younger brother

1449
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,840
stays home every day

1450
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,200
When he's home

1451
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,360
I sometimes

1452
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,960
quite like the boy

1453
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,360
Occasionally

1454
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,840
I buy him strawberries

1455
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,000
and feed them to him

1456
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,680
Sometimes he

1457
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,520
would draw scenes of me

1458
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,520
feeding him strawberries

1459
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,040
He drew them

1460
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,960
He enjoys drawing

1461
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,560
Yes, he loves to draw

1462
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,600
Alright, the fourth piece of evidence

1463
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,640
was also found on the Ning family's desk

1464
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,200
a copy of the Tuizhen Daily posted there

1465
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,680
The article stated

1466
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,960
Captain Ning set fire to

1467
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,760
the general manager's basement

1468
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,520
General Manager Bei Guo waived legal action

1469
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,680
Are there hidden circumstances behind the arson case?

1470
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,840
Someone had marked in red ink

1471
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,000
the words "General Manager Bei Guo"

1472
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,320
and written a note saying

1473
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,920
"To the ends of the earth, until death do us part"

1474
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,960
"To the ends of the earth, until death do us part"

1475
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,320
You have a grudge against Bei Guo

1476
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,680
There's bad blood between you

1477
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,040
Why do we say you have a grudge?

1478
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,320
On February 1st this year

1479
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,920
As I was the ship's captain

1480
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,960
I went down to the docks

1481
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,560
There I heard

1482
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,800
from the dockworkers

1483
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,520
rumors circulating that

1484
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,080
Bei Guo actually

1485
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,400
hates me intensely

1486
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,200
Because eight years ago,

1487
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,680
when I went out on the boat,

1488
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,800
his younger brother was on my boat

1489
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,720
and got accidentally injured.

1490
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,200
He nearly died.

1491
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,360
So,

1492
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,240
he's hated me since eight years ago.

1493
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,240
But it wasn't until eight years later

1494
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,600
that I realized he hated me.

1495
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,120
Then, the boat workers

1496
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,960
were chatting, and he mentioned

1497
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,280
that incident from eight years ago.

1498
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,600
He might have been the one who did it, right?

1499
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:29,800
Yes.

1500
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,920
And when I thought back,

1501
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,520
back then, he was supposed to be

1502
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,920
on that day,

1503
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,680
repairing boats on the shore.

1504
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,840
But someone spotted him

1505
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,800
acting suspiciously under the lighthouse.

1506
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,400
Bei Guo.

1507
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,720
Right.

1508
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,320
So I suspected it was him,

1509
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,600
seeking revenge for his brother,

1510
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,480
that he pushed my son

1511
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,360
off the lighthouse.

1512
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:52,840
I suspect it was him

1513
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
who killed my son.

1514
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,720
At that moment, I felt

1515
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,640
that after eight long years

1516
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,520
of desperately searching for my son,

1517
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,720
I finally had a lead.

1518
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,640
I needed to find the killer.

1519
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,880
So I went to Bei Guo's house

1520
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,000
and confronted him directly.

1521
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,920
I asked, "Was it you

1522
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,080
who pushed my son

1523
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,920
off the lighthouse back then?"

1524
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,280
At that moment he said

1525
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,840
"Come with me to the basement"

1526
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,000
"Follow me to the basement, I'll tell you there"

1527
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,960
But when we got to the basement, I discovered

1528
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,560
he immediately ran out through the back door

1529
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,880
I thought he was definitely suspicious

1530
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,080
I got really angry

1531
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,800
At that moment in the basement

1532
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,320
I was furious

1533
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,880
so I set the basement on fire

1534
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:23,800
then I left

1535
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,560
After leaving, I kept searching for him

1536
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,360
After the fire

1537
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,480
didn't the reporters find him?

1538
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,320
That news report earlier

1539
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,120
The reporters found him

1540
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,440
saying "Captain Ning burned your basement"

1541
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,560
But Brother Bai said

1542
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,440
"I don't need to hold you responsible"

1543
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,920
He said it had nothing to do with him

1544
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,280
He didn't need me to take responsibility

1545
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,240
So at that moment I concluded

1546
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,360
he must have been

1547
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,560
the one who killed my son years ago

1548
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,680
That's why he felt guilty

1549
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,000
That's why he didn't make me take responsibility

1550
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,360
This is my relationship with Brother Bai

1551
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,520
That's why I hate him so much

1552
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,840
Because I suspect he killed my son

1553
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,400
So I need to find him and get answers

1554
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,280
And there's a fifth piece of evidence

1555
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,280
Also found in the Ning family's drawer

1556
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,080
It's a boarding pass

1557
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,800
From the Tuimanghuo Foreign Trade Company

1558
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,560
Boarding pass

1559
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,160
Dated February 7th

1560
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,200
But no year was written

1561
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,560
There's a ship number here

1562
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,760
But it's crossed out

1563
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,920
And on the back there's this

1564
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,160
"It's all my fault"

1565
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,480
This appears to be handwritten

1566
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,800
What is this?

1567
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,960
On February 7th, I...

1568
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,480
How should I put this...

1569
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,160
Because I'd been searching for Bei Guo

1570
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,840
Last Sunday

1571
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,000
Which was February 7th

1572
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,080
Someone told me he would board a ship on the river

1573
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,280
Traveling on the Wukenai River

1574
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,040
He was going to board

1575
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,640
There were two ships at the time

1576
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,840
There were two ships then

1577
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,880
So I discussed with my younger brother

1578
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,600
I said

1579
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,680
Let's each board a different ship

1580
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,400
If Bei Guo is on this ship

1581
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,440
I'll catch him

1582
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,440
If he's on that ship

1583
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,440
You'll be responsible for catching him

1584
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,280
But then

1585
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,080
After we boarded separate ships

1586
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,520
A thunderstorm began

1587
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,600
The storm started swirling again

1588
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,880
I watched helplessly

1589
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,600
As my brother's ship

1590
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,680
Disappeared into the mist

1591
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,840
So I'm in great pain

1592
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,560
So what's written above

1593
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,080
is all because of my mistakes

1594
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,800
It's because

1595
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,320
If I hadn't been so obsessed

1596
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,480
with finding my son

1597
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,360
and seeking the truth

1598
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,760
my third brother wouldn't have died

1599
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,160
Your third brother?

1600
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Right, then how am I still here?

1601
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,440
This isn't the same timeline anymore

1602
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,640
It's no longer the same timeline

1603
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,600
There are actually two timelines

1604
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,400
Yes, 1980 and 1988

1605
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,640
Right, we're each in different

1606
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,920
these two timelines

1607
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,680
Brother, I have an unrelated question

1608
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,440
On your ship

1609
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,800
are you the only one?

1610
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,800
On my ship...

1611
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,160
Right, no one else?

1612
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,520
There is

1613
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,400
Is there anyone who

1614
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,880
left a deep impression on you?

1615
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:03,640
No

1616
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,800
Anyone you know?

1617
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,200
On this very ship of yours

1618
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,560
You're saying among you people

1619
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,400
no one knows each other?

1620
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:11,880
No

1621
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,800
What's your ship's number?

1622
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,760
You can't remember?

1623
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,480
I can't remember

1624
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,880
On your ship

1625
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,720
you don't know anyone?

1626
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:18,760
No

1627
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,320
Brother, oh brother

1628
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,360
I never expected you'd stubbornly deny it

1629
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,760
Then it's your turn, Bai Sect

1630
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:43,800
My turn now

1631
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,840
First item: boat ticket

1632
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,120
On Keridu's cabinet

1633
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,160
Also dated February 7th

1634
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,840
From Tuimanghuo Foreign Trade Company

1635
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,960
Ship number was blacked out

1636
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,080
Nothing else

1637
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,040
Correct

1638
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,280
February 7th

1639
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,480
Wasn't he just mentioning

1640
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,440
that boat ticket

1641
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,080
It's the ticket for boarding my ship

1642
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:02,880
Second item

1643
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,560
Inside Keridu's cabinet

1644
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,720
A letter was found

1645
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,000
Brother

1646
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,320
Don't worry

1647
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,480
The one who burned our basement

1648
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,760
Was my subordinate

1649
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,760
But I don't intend to hold him accountable

1650
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
At that time I told him

1651
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,200
To stay in the basement first

1652
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,520
Seeing he was emotionally agitated

1653
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,600
I wanted him to calm down

1654
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,680
All the senior staff know

1655
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,560
He tragically lost his son eight years ago

1656
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,840
He's been unable to move on all these years

1657
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,480
He's a pitiful soul

1658
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:40,920
Your brother

1659
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:41,920
Bei Guo

1660
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,240
This is

1661
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,120
When I was on that ship

1662
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,160
Brother Bai was on the same ship I boarded

1663
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,800
Then I met Brother Bai

1664
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,840
After meeting him, I asked him

1665
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,160
I asked what happened

1666
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,520
Did you kill my nephew back then?

1667
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,720
My elder brother's son

1668
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,440
He said why would I kill

1669
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,960
your elder brother's son

1670
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,320
I had no reason to kill him

1671
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,040
Moreover

1672
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:04,840
I would never be capable of

1673
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,600
such a thing

1674
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,320
Then he showed me this letter

1675
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,320
This letter was written by Brother Bai

1676
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,760
to his younger brother

1677
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,680
It essentially represents Brother Bai's perspective

1678
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,120
Brother Bai's viewpoint

1679
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,360
The letter stated that

1680
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,280
When he saw him coming

1681
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,320
he was too emotional

1682
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,480
and wanted him to calm down first

1683
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,360
before discussing the matter

1684
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,560
But he got impatient

1685
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,520
and set everything on fire

1686
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,280
What he told me on the ship was

1687
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,920
that

1688
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,360
this letter could prove

1689
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,920
his

1690
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,440
position

1691
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,280
that he wouldn't kill his son

1692
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,880
Because he deeply sympathized with

1693
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,320
and pitied my elder brother

1694
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,800
He knew that eight years ago

1695
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,160
he accidentally lost his son

1696
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,480
So even if he set

1697
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,320
the basement on fire

1698
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,000
he didn't blame him

1699
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,760
Then he told his younger brother

1700
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,000
not to worry about this matter

1701
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,280
So actually between him and Brother Bai

1702
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,560
there were some misunderstandings

1703
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,680
Then in Wang Juanwang's home bookcase

1704
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,120
there was a wooden box

1705
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,080
Inside this wooden box

1706
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,080
were several books

1707
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,760
"EQ and IQ Are Nothing Compared to Financial IQ"

1708
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,960
"Success Is a Profound Study"

1709
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,080
"How to Easily Reach the Top of the Pyramid"

1710
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,080
"How to Be Successful Like Me"

1711
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,400
"The Only Thing Between You and Genius Is This Book"

1712
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,520
and several calculators

1713
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,040
plus a counterfeit money detector pen

1714
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,000
These books were bought for my daughter

1715
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,600
Purchased for my daughter

1716
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,480
My daughter was extremely adorable

1717
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,200
Actually yesterday

1718
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,640
what I haven't told you is

1719
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,160
the missing family member was my daughter

1720
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,600
Last Sunday I was working overtime

1721
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,800
when one of my family members

1722
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,440
passed away

1723
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:57,680
So in my heart

1724
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,960
I'm actually deeply pained

1725
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,640
Because I

1726
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,760
am actually a finance professional

1727
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,320
I was transferred to our company as

1728
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,360
the Finance Manager

1729
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:06,720
Yes

1730
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,640
That's why I particularly hoped my daughter

1731
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,840
She could also follow in her father's footsteps

1732
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,480
She was able to start learning

1733
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,880
some financial knowledge from an early age

1734
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:17,440
So

1735
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,080
when she was just three years old

1736
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,720
I began giving her

1737
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,000
some financial education

1738
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,440
Later, my wife and I

1739
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,240
had our second child

1740
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,040
my son

1741
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,400
Not long after he was born

1742
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,960
my wife and I grew apart

1743
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,360
and we divorced

1744
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,800
So I began

1745
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,800
the life of being both father and mother

1746
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,040
That's why later

1747
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:39,800
I became so driven

1748
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,960
I worked so hard

1749
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,040
because I desperately wanted

1750
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,920
to give my children a good life

1751
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,720
How old is your daughter now?

1752
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,560
She's gone, isn't she?

1753
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,360
How old would she be if she were here?

1754
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,840
She would be 17

1755
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,920
She should be 17 this year

1756
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,160
Your last Sunday was

1757
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,160
What date was the day you lost your loved one?

1758
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,120
February 3rd

1759
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,360
Your last Sunday was also February 3rd

1760
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,880
February 3rd, yes

1761
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:09,880
Same as you

1762
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:10,960
Right

1763
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,880
If it was February 3, 1980

1764
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,320
Your daughter would be 17 years old

1765
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,120
On February 7, 1988

1766
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,440
Your daughter would be 25

1767
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,840
You probably aren't 17 this year

1768
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,280
Right?

1769
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,560
25

1770
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,960
So is it possible

1771
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,600
That this person

1772
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,560
Is actually your

1773
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,600
Father?

1774
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,440
Yes, so we're father and daughter

1775
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,560
At this moment,

1776
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,080
That's why I particularly hope my daughter

1777
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,280
could also follow in my footsteps

1778
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,920
and be exposed from an early age

1779
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,320
to financial knowledge

1780
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,760
That's why she aspired since childhood

1781
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,800
to become an accountant

1782
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,760
and build a successful career

1783
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,640
What about the younger brother?

1784
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,360
I was just asking you

1785
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,520
about your son's situation

1786
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,360
You said your son is still very young

1787
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,240
My son is 10 years old

1788
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
In my memory

1789
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,560
my son is 10 years old

1790
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,800
Just now you said he's at home

1791
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,200
Yes, my son is 10 years old

1792
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,240
You see

1793
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,560
In his memory

1794
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,120
his daughter is only 17

1795
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,040
so his son must be 10, right?

1796
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,840
Yes

1797
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,520
He was born in 1980

1798
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:42,760
So if

1799
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,280
the son grew up normally until now

1800
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,280
If it was 1988

1801
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,080
he should be 18 now

1802
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:48,920
18 years old

1803
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,560
Therefore

1804
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,320
this current

1805
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,720
little boy with the number 8 on his head

1806
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,600
could he be Wang Juanwang's son?

1807
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,440
Could he possibly be

1808
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,640
his son from 8 years ago?

1809
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,240
Because the timeline

1810
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,000
matches up

1811
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,080
Also

1812
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,880
in this photo

1813
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,400
the little boy on your back

1814
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,360
is he your son?

1815
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,240
My son loves to draw

1816
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,440
And he really did

1817
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,680
draw pictures of me and him

1818
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,000
being lifted up like this

1819
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,960
He drew these scenes before

1820
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,080
Then how could you not recognize your own son?

1821
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,080
When I asked you earlier, you said

1822
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,440
you said "with this 8, I..."

1823
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,040
Another thing is

1824
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,360
The coat hook at Wang Juan's house entrance

1825
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,600
There's a tag on it

1826
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,800
with the number 4444

1827
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,360
Key

1828
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:45,840
Boat key, right?

1829
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,520
Boat key

1830
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,880
So you're the captain of boat 4444

1831
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,120
I'm not the captain

1832
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,600
Here's what happened

1833
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,800
Last Sunday, February 3rd

1834
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,560
That day

1835
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,680
My son went to the city

1836
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,680
to participate in a competition

1837
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,320
Then my daughter said to me

1838
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,480
"Daddy, can you take me

1839
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,840
to the amusement park?"

1840
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,680
But that day happened to be

1841
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:09,880
when there was

1842
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,560
a very important financial case

1843
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,560
that I needed to handle

1844
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,400
Everything was arranged

1845
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,360
I had to go

1846
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,200
It was extremely important

1847
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,000
So I told my daughter

1848
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,960
"Daddy will definitely take you next time"

1849
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,520
And I even promised her

1850
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,680
I said, "Listen honey"

1851
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,320
"Daddy will finish work today

1852
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,200
and buy you a dress

1853
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,800
as compensation"

1854
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,320
After a busy day

1855
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,200
around 9 PM

1856
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,720
I was heading home

1857
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,040
As I was walking

1858
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,840
I suddenly remembered

1859
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,560
"Oh no"

1860
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,920
I promised my daughter a dress

1861
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,880
but I forgot to buy it

1862
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,800
Then my daughter exploded in anger

1863
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,720
She said

1864
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,760
"You never care about my feelings"

1865
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,080
"You only think about your work"

1866
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,080
"Do you really think my brother and I"

1867
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,320
"are that unimportant?"

1868
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,440
I immediately tried to explain

1869
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,760
I said "How could that be?"

1870
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,840
"I work so hard"

1871
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,000
"just to give you"

1872
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,120
"a better life"

1873
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,680
Then I said "How can you be like this?"

1874
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,680
"As a child"

1875
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,840
"you should understand your father"

1876
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,920
I said "Calm down"

1877
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,880
"Go back to your room"

1878
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,120
"and think about your behavior"

1879
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,960
My daughter had never before

1880
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,840
lost her temper like that in front of me

1881
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,360
Then she slammed the door and ran away

1882
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,720
I was also holding a grudge.

1883
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,840
When she ran away, I didn't chase after her.

1884
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,680
I just stayed at home.

1885
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,040
I wanted to use work

1886
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,800
to replace this agitated feeling of mine.

1887
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,160
Suddenly,

1888
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,920
there was thunder and lightning outside.

1889
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,360
The wind howled violently.

1890
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,360
I thought, "This won't do."

1891
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,360
Because she actually

1892
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,800
had this habit before.

1893
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,200
My daughter,

1894
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,840
whenever she was in a bad mood,

1895
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,840
she would go ride that boat.

1896
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,880
Seeing the thunder and lightning,

1897
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,280
I was afraid she might have boarded the boat.

1898
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,520
Or that something might happen.

1899
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,160
So I quickly

1900
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,920
chased after her to the Wukenai River.

1901
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,480
When I arrived at 9:40 PM,

1902
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,040
the boat had just left.

1903
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,640
I hurried back to the company

1904
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,360
and grabbed this key.

1905
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,640
I took

1906
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,440
the key to boat No. 4444.

1907
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,320
I drove the boat,

1908
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,360
wanting to catch up to my daughter.

1909
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,400
I wanted to find her.

1910
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,120
After about half an hour of driving,

1911
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,360
I reached the lighthouse.

1912
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,720
I saw someone

1913
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,840
fall from the lighthouse.

1914
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,560
They fell.

1915
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,000
I had to save them.

1916
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,320
So I steered the boat over.

1917
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,280
When I got there, I saw

1918
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,400
it was Xiao He from next door.

1919
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,040
Then I wanted to take Xiao He

1920
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,120
to continue searching for my daughter.

1921
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:30,880
But at that time,

1922
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,840
the river was raging with waves.

1923
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,440
There was simply no way

1924
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,440
to make it to the other shore.

1925
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,280
So we had no choice but to return.

1926
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,360
After my daughter went missing,

1927
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,800
I wanted to go look for her,

1928
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,640
but for this whole week,

1929
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,920
there have been thunderstorms every day.

1930
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,280
And the entire river

1931
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,080
has been closed to navigation.

1932
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,120
So I couldn't go.

1933
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,040
So every day,

1934
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:54,840
I've been waiting for her,

1935
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:55,880
not knowing when

1936
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,360
she might surprise me from behind,

1937
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,240
saying "Daddy, I'm home."

1938
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,560
I've been waiting for just that.

1939
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,360
Captain Ning

1940
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,640
You said it was your neighbor Lao Wang

1941
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,080
Yes

1942
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,400
After he went missing

1943
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,760
You took in his son and daughter

1944
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,160
and provided for them

1945
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,480
So his children were at home

1946
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,000
Right?

1947
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,240
At home

1948
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,520
Only Lao Wang went missing

1949
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:17,960
Correct

1950
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,400
His children

1951
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,440
In your timeline

1952
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,880
Where are they now?

1953
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,960
We didn't live together continuously after that

1954
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,240
No, I won't say more

1955
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:25,760
They're

1956
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,880
His daughter

1957
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,040
We supported her education

1958
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,920
Helped her become an accountant

1959
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,160
Right?

1960
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,560
Is she really my daughter?

1961
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,720
Now in my heart...

1962
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:45,760
No, it's like this

1963
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,960
I have a question

1964
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,680
If we go by

1965
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,800
the story everyone shared

1966
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,680
then

1967
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,440
these two people

1968
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,320
boarded Ship 4444

1969
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,760
and stayed in 1980

1970
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,920
If he doesn't board Ship 4444

1971
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,960
you'll be fine

1972
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,440
At worst, you'll just die

1973
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,320
At worst, you'll just die

1974
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,560
Just die at worst

1975
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,800
You really

1976
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,480
Death means no trouble

1977
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,000
Everything else matters

1978
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,600
No

1979
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,000
What I meant to say is

1980
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
He would still be in our world

1981
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,640
But because he accidentally

1982
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,280
fell onto Ship 4444

1983
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,800
The two of you

1984
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,040
ended up in another dimension

1985
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,160
So here's the question

1986
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,960
How did you two get back?

1987
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:34,840
Is it possible

1988
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,080
that we've also arrived?

1989
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,680
So our two timelines

1990
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,480
are actually overlapping

1991
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,600
overlapping

1992
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,920
Have you ever heard of this kind of

1993
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,480
something similar to

1994
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,280
there's this

1995
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,120
you know, those surreal stories

1996
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,120
like if our whole bus

1997
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,520
drove into a misty forest

1998
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,280
and then the passengers say

1999
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,120
"My family's been missing for 23 years"

2000
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:01,680
What?

2001
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,240
Yes, exactly!

2002
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,040
Then one day

2003
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:03,840
the bus suddenly emerges

2004
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,400
and returns

2005
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,760
After coming out

2006
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,640
they haven't aged

2007
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,640
Right, they haven't aged

2008
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,600
For them maybe an hour passed

2009
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,360
but outside, ten years went by

2010
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,560
A very long time

2011
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,200
Exactly

2012
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,080
Our ship might have entered

2013
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,480
that kind of spacetime

2014
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,680
a spatial black hole

2015
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,160
Right

2016
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,720
Perhaps it's the River of No Return

2017
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,800
It's just a black hole

2018
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:23,880
Because this incident

2019
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,040
happened at the River of No Return

2020
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,120
on Ship 4444

2021
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,720
I think the ship is quite crucial

2022
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,800
No

2023
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,840
I think the timing is more important

2024
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,480
Look, every time this happens

2025
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,640
during such events

2026
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,480
there's always a thunderstorm

2027
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,920
and it's always on a Sunday

2028
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,560
So it must be at

2029
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,240
some specific

2030
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,360
point in time

2031
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,840
that such a passage opens

2032
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:41,400
Wrong

2033
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,160
It must be related to the ship

2034
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,600
Those who boarded this ship

2035
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,360
No, the logic is this

2036
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:46,840
For example

2037
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,360
Let's say eight years ago and eight years later

2038
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,120
both involved time travel

2039
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,200
Let's use time travel as an example

2040
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,040
There's always one common point

2041
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:52,920
What is it?

2042
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,000
It's the thunderstorm

2043
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,320
Right

2044
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,080
That's the first point

2045
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,760
The second point is Ship 4444

2046
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,680
So it's likely that

2047
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,240
only when these two factors combine

2048
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,400
can this phenomenon occur

2049
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:00,560
Yes

2050
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:00,840
Right

2051
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,560
These are the conditions

2052
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,000
Definitely

2053
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,840
These are the conditions

2054
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,120
Right, not just the ship

2055
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,200
Next, what we're going to share is

2056
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,760
our big brother

2057
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,360
Captain Ning

2058
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,160
Big brother

2059
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,960
The first piece of evidence is

2060
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,240
on Sis Ba's table

2061
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,880
there's a poster

2062
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,840
High-end custom, one of a kind

2063
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,920
Trendy leather jacket, you deserve it

2064
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,880
A leather jacket is circled

2065
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,000
But what's written on it

2066
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,720
"To the ends of the earth, till death do us part"

2067
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,360
This phrase sounds so familiar

2068
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,440
I have the same thing on mine

2069
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,920
On the Ning family's desk

2070
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,440
there's a Tui Zhen Daily posted

2071
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,880
It says

2072
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,960
"To the ends of the earth, till death do us part"

2073
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,760
Actually, this is me

2074
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,240
I had an argument with my father

2075
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,280
On February 3rd, 1980

2076
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,840
I went to the Wukenai River

2077
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,680
Because when I was little

2078
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,960
my mother would often take me

2079
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:08,680
there

2080
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,480
She would listen to me

2081
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,560
talk with me

2082
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,720
and keep me company

2083
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,880
She would also take me on boats

2084
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,520
to cross the river

2085
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,720
We would go back and forth like this

2086
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:18,840
It was a way to relax

2087
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,640
But my father, comparatively

2088
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,280
spent much less time with me

2089
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,800
So whenever

2090
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,360
I felt upset about something

2091
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,040
I would always like

2092
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,560
to go to the Wukenai River

2093
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,160
That day I went to

2094
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,360
the Wukenai River

2095
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,320
Around 9:30

2096
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,680
I boarded a boat

2097
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,920
and crossed to the other side

2098
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,160
I wandered around there

2099
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,280
then came back

2100
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,240
and went home

2101
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,400
When I got home,

2102
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,600
I found my father wasn't home.

2103
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,400
I had just argued with him before going out.

2104
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,200
He wasn't home.

2105
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,920
I figured he was busy with work again,

2106
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,600
so I didn't think much of it.

2107
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,520
Then the next day,

2108
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,720
I received terrible news.

2109
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,040
They said my father

2110
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,840
had gone looking for me

2111
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,120
and took the company boat out on the river,

2112
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,680
then disappeared.

2113
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,720
So my father was gone,

2114
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,720
and it was because he was searching for me.

2115
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,160
Then I started remembering

2116
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,120
what had happened that day.

2117
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,280
In my memory,

2118
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,360
that company boat

2119
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:21,840
that day when I

2120
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,320
boarded the ship,

2121
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,520
I saw that boat

2122
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,880
docked by the shore.

2123
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,000
There was a man

2124
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,960
wearing a leather jacket -

2125
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,520
I remember that jacket clearly.

2126
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,800
He was bustling about,

2127
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,760
that man on the boat,

2128
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,520
doing who knows what.

2129
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,160
Then it occurred to me

2130
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,200
that maybe that man

2131
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,600
tampered with the boat,

2132
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,880
causing my father's disappearance.

2133
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,080
And this

2134
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:45,840
is something I later

2135
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,680
saw in an advertisement

2136
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,600
about this leather jacket

2137
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
No one else has it

2138
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,600
only this person owns

2139
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:51,880
It's

2140
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,520
custom-made

2141
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,760
A custom leather jacket

2142
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,600
one of a kind

2143
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,480
So I kept this picture

2144
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,680
The words on it

2145
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,680
express exactly what I feel

2146
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,520
I absolutely must

2147
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,280
find this person

2148
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,560
find the person wearing this leather jacket

2149
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,000
Right

2150
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,720
So what's the next piece of evidence?

2151
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,200
Here it is

2152
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,240
On your family's table

2153
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,240
was also a boat ticket

2154
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,080
The ship number was erased

2155
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,520
Boarding time was February 7th

2156
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,960
But four words were written afterward

2157
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,680
"Free from all attachments"

2158
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,280
What does it mean?

2159
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,520
My father previously

2160
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,800
entrusted me to our neighbors' care

2161
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,480
And then?

2162
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,880
They treated us extremely well

2163
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:34,480
Right

2164
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,040
After my father disappeared

2165
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,560
I grew up in their household

2166
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,480
And then?

2167
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,520
I'm very interested in my daughter's story

2168
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,840
Now I'm really interested

2169
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,120
I'm also very interested

2170
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,880
What's going on?

2171
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,360
How could this...

2172
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,400
It's a bit strange

2173
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,280
It's very complicated

2174
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,600
I'm also very interested

2175
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,760
I had just graduated from university

2176
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,600
Then I graduated from university

2177
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,280
I was with his cousin

2178
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,520
His girlfriend was originally...

2179
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,480
This beloved girl is

2180
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,680
I worked so hard

2181
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,520
just to buy her the three major items

2182
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,160
and properly marry her

2183
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,280
But suddenly my girl disappeared

2184
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,040
I searched everywhere but couldn't find her

2185
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,040
You fell in love with my second cousin

2186
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,360
No, we were in love with each other

2187
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,400
It wasn't just me loving him

2188
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,200
We were in love together

2189
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,440
We were together for three years

2190
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,800
Then he proposed to me many times

2191
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,200
But I felt

2192
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:48,800
You rejected him every time

2193
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:49,960
I wasn't rejecting him

2194
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,120
I told him to wait

2195
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,160
I wanted to wait first

2196
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,880
Until I found my father's murderer

2197
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,640
Otherwise in my heart

2198
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,200
There would always be this knot

2199
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,520
Those are just excuses

2200
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,840
You must think he's no good

2201
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,200
No, that's not it

2202
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,160
Listen to me

2203
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,320
I just felt that

2204
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,320
I had to find my father's killer first

2205
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,480
Then on February 7th

2206
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,760
At our company

2207
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,040
In the general manager's office

2208
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,120
He wasn't there at the time

2209
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,560
When I entered his office

2210
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,160
His wallet was on the floor

2211
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,080
And it was open

2212
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,440
Inside there was

2213
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,840
A photo of him wearing a leather jacket

2214
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,400
Then I found out

2215
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,120
he was boarding a ship today

2216
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:33,800
So I thought

2217
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,040
he's not here now

2218
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,080
would he still go to board?

2219
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,680
So I immediately bought a ticket

2220
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,520
At the same time

2221
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,840
I also told my boyfriend

2222
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,520
I said I was going to find Beiguo

2223
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:42,880
He knew my story

2224
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,360
He said he'd go with me

2225
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,040
Then the two of us

2226
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,680
went to the Wukenai River

2227
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,080
and saw two ships

2228
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,080
There were many people

2229
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,040
A huge crowd

2230
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,200
all boarding the ships

2231
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,440
We couldn't

2232
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,600
bet everything on one ship

2233
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,240
So we decided

2234
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:56,720
"You take that one"

2235
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,640
"I'll take this one"

2236
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,720
But his ship

2237
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,080
disappeared on February 7th

2238
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:01,600
Vanished

2239
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,160
Yes

2240
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,920
Just like what happened to them

2241
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,120
Same as with my third brother

2242
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:06,880
It's identical

2243
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,840
I boarded one

2244
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,000
He boarded another

2245
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,520
And I can prove

2246
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,680
what she's saying is true

2247
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,640
Because on February 7th

2248
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,880
the day we agreed to board

2249
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,280
I did see Baimai

2250
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,240
on the ship I boarded

2251
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:17,840
Your second brother

2252
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:18,880
I still don't know

2253
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,040
why he was there too

2254
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,560
Since this was between us

2255
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:24,800
Last week, right?

2256
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,240
February 7th

2257
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,480
It also happened

2258
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,640
The same situation we had 8 years ago

2259
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:32,560
This is so messy

2260
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,080
No

2261
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,680
This just happened to you last week

2262
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,560
This person

2263
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,280
Sitting next to you is

2264
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,640
You don’t know who he is

2265
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:56,960
It's my turn

2266
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,320
Wang Esq. still has evidence

2267
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,440
I also have evidence

2268
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,520
My first piece of evidence is

2269
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,200
Inside the bedside table Bai bought

2270
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,520
There's a ring

2271
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,320
So romantic

2272
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,880
And there was a note inside

2273
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,520
I will definitely help you find him

2274
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,800
Are you helping him look for me?

2275
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,520
That's right

2276
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,640
Bai Sect has been saving money

2277
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,280
Just to buy this bigger one

2278
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,920
This was a big deal back in 1988

2279
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,560
Is it my hand size?

2280
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,000
Let me try it on.

2281
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,680
It must be yours.

2282
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,560
But what if it's not?

2283
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,400
The way you're doing it...

2284
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,000
If it doesn't fit the ring finger...

2285
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,440
then it wasn't meant for this girl.

2286
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,040
Is it for the left or right hand?

2287
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,480
A bit big

2288
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,320
A bit large

2289
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,200
You

2290
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,040
Not mine

2291
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:08,960
Right

2292
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,120
Correct

2293
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,800
I bought it for my cousin

2294
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,480
What?

2295
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,240
He bought it for me

2296
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,520
This is too messy

2297
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,800
Stop talking nonsense

2298
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,880
Wasted purchase

2299
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,200
Behave yourself

2300
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,760
Exactly

2301
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,040
I grew up in my cousin's household

2302
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,880
How does your cousin treat you?

2303
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,240
My cousin treats me

2304
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,600
Like a father

2305
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,960
Then my cousin's child

2306
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,320
the matter of going to the lighthouse was dropped

2307
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,440
The next day we discovered the neighbor

2308
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,240
Brother Da Wang was also gone, disappeared

2309
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,240
So we adopted

2310
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,840
their family's girl and child

2311
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,240
Right

2312
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,120
Then

2313
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,400
I took a liking to their little girl

2314
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:15,880
No

2315
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,440
Because we spent so much time together

2316
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,480
After graduating from university

2317
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,480
we dated for three years

2318
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,120
I proposed

2319
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:20,960
She said no

2320
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,960
I need to find my father first

2321
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,520
I don't want to think about other things yet

2322
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,200
So I said okay

2323
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,160
Then I'll help you find your father

2324
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,520
That's the story

2325
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,640
I must find him.

2326
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,760
Right.

2327
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,200
Here, this is a boat ticket.

2328
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,560
Inside Bai's bedside drawer.

2329
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,160
The ship number was erased.

2330
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,960
Then on February 7th,

2331
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,960
there were no other words.

2332
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,080
My girlfriend came running to tell me

2333
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,760
she had discovered how her father

2334
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,880
had died.

2335
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,280
She found that someone

2336
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,920
had tampered with the ship.

2337
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,080
She said this person was Brother Bei.

2338
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,320
She asked me to go to the dock with her

2339
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,840
to confront this person.

2340
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,320
We went to the dock and saw Brother Bei,

2341
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,960
but didn't see which ship he boarded.

2342
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,960
Two ships.

2343
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,560
So we decided to split up and search.

2344
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:09,440
Yes.

2345
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,520
Then we boarded separate ships.

2346
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:12,920
And then?

2347
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,960
I boarded this ship and found Brother Bei.

2348
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,280
Found him.

2349
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,880
I asked him,

2350
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,400
"What's going on?"

2351
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,480
He said it had nothing to do with him.

2352
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,200
He said

2353
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,440
that day he was painting the ship,

2354
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:30,640
and after painting,

2355
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,480
he went drinking at the lighthouse

2356
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,040
with someone from another company.

2357
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,400
Drinking at the lighthouse.

2358
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,280
He said he had a witness,

2359
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,200
that other person.

2360
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,240
Then I said, "Alright,"

2361
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,240
"I believe you."

2362
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,440
I planned to disembark

2363
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,160
and tell my girlfriend,

2364
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,120
because she thought

2365
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:51,920
their actions

2366
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,960
were tampering with the ship.

2367
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,880
I wanted to say it was a misunderstanding.

2368
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,000
I was about to say it

2369
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,240
when suddenly,

2370
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,080
I saw lightning and thunder in the sky,

2371
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,360
and on the distant ship,

2372
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,760
my girlfriend and my elder brother...

2373
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,400
On the bow of the ship

2374
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,040
Playing that Titanic scene

2375
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,520
You know

2376
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,520
Just the two of them

2377
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,040
On February 14th,

2378
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,360
we eloped on Valentine's Day.

2379
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,240
Right?

2380
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:30,880
No.

2381
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,120
It wasn't February 14th.

2382
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,240
Today is February 14th.

2383
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,680
Later I realized my girlfriend

2384
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,480
didn't want to board the same boat with me

2385
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,600
because she saw my cousin

2386
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,720
on that boat.

2387
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,200
Stop making things up.

2388
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,200
Don't talk nonsense.

2389
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,400
Then I wanted to call out to them

2390
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,160
But their boat disappeared

2391
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,440
Our boat disappeared

2392
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,440
From your perspective, it was their boat that disappeared

2393
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,680
Right

2394
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:00,840
Did we disappear from each other?

2395
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,520
Yes

2396
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,480
Let me give an example

2397
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,560
Imagine there's a layer of fog between us

2398
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,240
When we look through the fog

2399
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:05,840
You see us disappear

2400
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,080
I see you disappear

2401
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,680
No, no

2402
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,760
It's you guys

2403
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,080
We eventually returned

2404
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,480
We came back too

2405
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,920
But now it seems we've all disappeared

2406
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,280
We're not on the same timeline anymore

2407
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,120
Those two

2408
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,920
The four of us are on the same timeline

2409
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,960
This is inevitable

2410
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,280
The four of us were originally in the same world

2411
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,840
After that incident

2412
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,840
We might not be anymore

2413
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,800
Right, then there are more than two worlds

2414
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,960
Do you understand?

2415
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:35,640
No, look why

2416
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:37,360
He can still see his wife now

2417
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,960
Didn't his wife already disappear?

2418
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:39,520
Yes

2419
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,560
So how can they

2420
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,760
still be sitting together now?

2421
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,640
You said his cousin also disappeared

2422
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,640
The cousin disappeared too

2423
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,320
Same thing

2424
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,240
The two of us were on one boat

2425
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,320
You two were on one boat

2426
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,440
So cousin, I want to ask you

2427
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,760
Where did you go at that time?

2428
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,400
You see

2429
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,360
Wherever you go, we'll follow.

2430
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,080
Tell me where you went.

2431
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,360
So the key point is

2432
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,600
which of our timelines

2433
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,960
is in the original timeline

2434
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:04,640
and whose timeline

2435
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,200
isn't in the original timeline?

2436
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:06,920
All four of us

2437
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,480
are in the original timeline.

2438
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,080
No.

2439
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,400
I'm telling you, yes.

2440
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,600
All four of us are the same.

2441
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,000
It's just that after we disappeared,

2442
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,520
we don't know what happened.

2443
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:15,840
But

2444
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,520
we all returned to 1988.

2445
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,480
That's the key.

2446
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:19,200
Wrong.

2447
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:19,800
In 1988,

2448
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,160
we didn't know each other anymore.

2449
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,280
I didn't know he was my boyfriend.

2450
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,880
He didn't know I was his girlfriend.

2451
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:24,440
He didn't know you were his father.

2452
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,320
Of course, I adopted you.

2453
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,160
I didn't know you were my adopted child.

2454
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,240
This is a questionable point.

2455
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,680
Now this is a questionable point.

2456
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,080
But

2457
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,040
we initially knew about

2458
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,880
our cousin relationship.

2459
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,480
Right.

2460
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,720
Why are we sitting here today

2461
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,280
discussing this relationship for so long?

2462
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,120
Why did you two

2463
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,720
only recognize each other now?

2464
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,960
We're not from

2465
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,200
the same timeline.

2466
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,760
I'd like to ask

2467
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,800
Captain Ning

2468
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,680
Captain Ning's son

2469
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,520
went missing in 1980, right?

2470
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:55,840
Yes

2471
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,960
But in 1988

2472
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,520
nothing happened, correct?

2473
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,880
I also went missing in 1988

2474
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,440
In 1988, I saw my third brother

2475
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,120
then he disappeared

2476
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,000
He vanished

2477
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,240
Right—back then, we were on the river

2478
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:06,880
with two boats

2479
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,160
At that time, you disappeared too

2480
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,680
Yes, that's what I mean

2481
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,160
He Yun's father in 1988

2482
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,360
was fine, right?

2483
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,040
On February 7, 1988, you

2484
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,040
didn't lose anyone

2485
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,720
My father disappeared

2486
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:23,600
His memories

2487
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:24,840
are from 1980

2488
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,120
They don't realize

2489
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,920
it's currently 1988

2490
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,920
Then your daughter

2491
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,960
disappeared on February 3, 1980

2492
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,760
But in my memory it was last Sunday

2493
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,760
Brother Bai had no issues in 1980

2494
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,560
Eight years ago my brother's child disappeared

2495
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,160
And Old Wang next door also disappeared

2496
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,160
Right

2497
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:48,760
In 1988

2498
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,880
you were at the same time

2499
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,640
when we boarded the ship together

2500
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,160
In 1988, did you two disappear?

2501
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,640
That's correct

2502
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,640
In 1988, we disappeared

2503
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,920
1988 was last week

2504
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,120
Yes

2505
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,520
When we boarded the ship

2506
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,800
when we were looking for the shell pot

2507
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,880
did you two disappear?

2508
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,680
That's how I remember it

2509
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,160
What about you?

2510
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:07,640
In 1980, who did you lose?

2511
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,720
In 1980, for me

2512
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,120
it was him who disappeared

2513
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:11,960
The eldest brother's son

2514
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,240
Right

2515
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,320
And Old Wang next door

2516
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,960
Who disappeared in 1988?

2517
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,400
In 1988, the eldest brother disappeared

2518
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,000
In 1988, the eldest brother disappeared

2519
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:24,480
They overlap

2520
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,520
That means 1980 is 1988

2521
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,240
1980 is 1988

2522
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,200
The same point in time

2523
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,000
I understand

2524
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,120
Look

2525
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,080
We started from scratch

2526
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:38,920
From ground zero

2527
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,280
This is World One

2528
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,440
At this time, the four of us

2529
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,760
were one loving family

2530
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,280
Ke, Ning, Bai, Ba

2531
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,560
We were family then

2532
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,960
Then we set out to find someone

2533
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:48,760
What was his name?

2534
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,200
We went to find Old Bei

2535
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,960
Then Brother Bai and I

2536
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:52,960
I told my second cousin

2537
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,920
we'd search for Old Bei on Ship One

2538
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:56,680
While sister-in-law told big brother

2539
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,400
she'd search on Ship Two

2540
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,800
At the same time

2541
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,320
as one loving family

2542
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,000
we boarded two different ships

2543
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,560
Then these two ships departed

2544
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,920
for two different destinations

2545
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,560
Right

2546
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,200
Brother Bai and I on Ship One

2547
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,080
saw Ship Two disappear

2548
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,840
There was fog between us

2549
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,600
Right?

2550
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,120
Then you on Ship Two

2551
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:14,840
saw us disappear

2552
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,920
Ship One vanished

2553
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,040
My point is

2554
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,280
at this branching point

2555
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,080
we had already

2556
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,080
entered different worlds

2557
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,800
Two timelines, yes

2558
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,880
So when we finally returned

2559
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,200
to Dongnao Hall today

2560
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,760
why didn't I recognize you at first?

2561
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,200
Why didn't I know she was my sister-in-law?

2562
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,880
Why didn't you initially know

2563
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,080
we were your brothers?

2564
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:32,840
Exactly

2565
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,200
Alright, just like you said.

2566
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,960
You two have a character relationship.

2567
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,640
I'm your big brother, right?

2568
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:41,040
Right.

2569
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,440
In your timeline,

2570
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,520
do I look like this?

2571
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,280
I want to know,

2572
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:45,080
if I go to

2573
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,120
another timeline

2574
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:46,840
and then come back,

2575
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,040
will I still look like this?

2576
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,480
Will I still be Captain Ning?

2577
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,760
Appearance actually can't be used as evidence.

2578
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,960
The most important thing is

2579
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,440
you both disappeared simultaneously,

2580
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,600
but after you returned,

2581
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,000
you didn't recognize each other.

2582
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,560
Is it possible you're pretending not to know each other?

2583
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,440
Fine, you're just pretending not to know each other.

2584
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,280
To avoid suspicion.

2585
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,560
You don't understand.

2586
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,160
Okay.

2587
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:06,880
Here's the thing.

2588
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,480
Does everyone remember yesterday,

2589
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,000
when we found in Thomas's office

2590
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,080
he said that every time he reincarnates,

2591
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,000
he has to clear everything

2592
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,960
and start over again.

2593
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:15,960
That's why he doesn't want to relive this weekend.

2594
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,800
Every cycle

2595
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,280
Everything gets reset

2596
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,640
I'm so tired of living this week

2597
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,280
This Saturday

2598
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,360
I have to organize the 8th anniversary again

2599
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,000
Once again

2600
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,320
Stuck in this 8th anniversary

2601
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,520
I never want to live through this week again

2602
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,280
I must find

2603
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,800
a way to break the cycle

2604
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,840
So it means each of us

2605
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,160
Why don't recognize each other

2606
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,560
Just like the poem says

2607
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,360
We've been wiped clean

2608
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,720
of each other's memories

2609
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,880
We two weren't reset

2610
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,320
I remember him too

2611
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,440
He's my neighbor's kid

2612
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,880
I remember that too

2613
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,440
So you two are in the same timeline

2614
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,480
We're in the same timeline

2615
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,400
Right

2616
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,600
Wait a minute, Brother Ning

2617
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,400
Do you remember being on that ship

2618
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,120
and seeing her?

2619
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,640
I don't remember.

2620
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,960
You don't remember this?

2621
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,240
Do you remember being on that ship

2622
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,480
and seeing Captain Ning?

2623
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,200
Don't remember that either.

2624
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,320
So you mean they weren't together?

2625
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,320
No

2626
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,120
The thing is

2627
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,600
they didn't meet on the ship

2628
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,040
They did meet

2629
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:08,560
No

2630
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,240
Think about it, they were on the Titanic

2631
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,000
on that ship

2632
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,800
how could they not remember?

2633
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,200
Did you make up the Titanic story

2634
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,040
or was it

2635
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,520
Is the Titanic story real or fake?

2636
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,880
Men in extreme situations

2637
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,480
tend to imagine many

2638
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,440
unbearable scenes

2639
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,760
Just thinking about it makes me furious

2640
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:23,960
That kind of thing

2641
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,160
Making up lies

2642
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,720
You're a little killer

2643
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,400
No

2644
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,200
I can vouch for him

2645
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,840
I did see Bai on the ship

2646
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,400
Right

2647
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,160
I saw Bai

2648
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,120
But did he see

2649
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,720
them together?

2650
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,040
That Titanic story

2651
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:36,800
I made it up

2652
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,000
How do I remember this?

2653
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,600
That means my memory is intact.

2654
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,520
Your memory exists,

2655
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:45,280
then how did you come to

2656
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,760
the same space as us?

2657
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,080
We're not in the same

2658
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:48,800
This is what we need to

2659
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,680
right here, right now

2660
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:49,880
Yes.

2661
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,920
The problem we need to solve now

2662
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,720
is exactly this.

2663
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,120
Why did several of us who don't know each other,

2664
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,000
this loving family,

2665
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,600
encounter today's situation?

2666
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,600
We must be from

2667
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,600
different timelines.

2668
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,480
Captain Ning,

2669
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,640
Hefu,

2670
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,080
Ke and Bai.

2671
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,640
But among us,

2672
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,440
not everyone

2673
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:04,800
is from six different timelines,

2674
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,720
because some are connected in pairs.

2675
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,360
Do you understand?

2676
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:07,720
No,

2677
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,280
what we can confirm now is

2678
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,880
you two know each other,

2679
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,440
and we two

2680
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,200
share a common past.

2681
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,160
What about them?

2682
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:17,760
So let me tell you

2683
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:18,840
What's the conclusion?

2684
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,720
The conclusion is there are three worlds

2685
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,440
Ke and Bai are in one world

2686
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:23,480
That's confirmed

2687
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,040
Right

2688
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:24,960
Ning

2689
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,920
Then Titanic is in one world

2690
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,880
Right?

2691
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,200
Then there's ship number 4444

2692
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,120
Which means

2693
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:31,880
Me

2694
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,000
Brother Wang and He, correct?

2695
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,760
Wang and He

2696
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,920
Three worlds

2697
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,640
That's how it is

2698
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,840
The three of us don't recognize each other now

2699
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,880
Because we came to this time-space

2700
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,240
divided into these groups

2701
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,280
The key point is people from our two worlds

2702
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,080
all know each other

2703
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:47,840
Those two

2704
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,120
Why don't they know each other?

2705
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,320
That's the crucial point

2706
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:58,280
Here, there's one more piece of evidence.

2707
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,400
Under the pillow Bai bought.

2708
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,560
Don't open it.

2709
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,120
Whatever you do, don't open it.

2710
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,680
Opening it would be like opening

2711
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,240
Pandora's box.

2712
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,560
Inside Pandora's bag there's a

2713
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,720
This is very strange

2714
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,720
When I was reading it earlier

2715
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,080
I thought it was quite odd

2716
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,200
Here, please read

2717
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,640
I, Ding Daka, hereby swear

2718
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,320
Everything said today is true

2719
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,400
If there's even half a lie

2720
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,520
I'll add another half

2721
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,200
To make a complete lie

2722
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:31,920
What nonsense is this

2723
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,360
Ah, just a little joke

2724
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,240
Have some sense of humor

2725
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,040
I always use the most humorous words

2726
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,840
To speak the truest things

2727
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:43,000
I, Ding Daka, never lie

2728
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,360
Or may lightning strike me dead

2729
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,280
February 7, 1988

2730
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,400
Ding Daka even pressed his fingerprint

2731
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:51,360
What does this mean

2732
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,720
After all that talk, nothing was actually said

2733
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,360
Actually, that day's storm

2734
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,840
Was because he lied

2735
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,400
The heavens tried to strike him down

2736
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,080
But ended up killing us instead

2737
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,760
Really?

2738
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,520
Ding Daka lied

2739
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:09,920
He...

2740
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,840
That ridiculous?

2741
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:11,200
I don't know

2742
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,440
I was just saying

2743
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,800
Listen to Brother Bai

2744
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,520
He knows what happened

2745
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,040
What happened?

2746
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:18,640
Tell us

2747
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,640
I boarded the ship to find Bei

2748
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,640
Bei told me

2749
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,520
Said there wasn't

2750
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,360
He was painting

2751
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,160
He was painting with Ding Daka

2752
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,520
After finishing, they both went back

2753
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,560
And drank together at the lighthouse

2754
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,440
Then he said he could testify

2755
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,800
So I went to see him alone again

2756
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:32,920
He was also on the ship

2757
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:33,800
He said no problem

2758
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,600
Said he could verify everything was correct

2759
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,280
So I had him write this affidavit

2760
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,960
Planning to take this down

2761
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,800
To tell my girlfriend

2762
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,080
Never expected her ship would leave

2763
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,280
Then the answer is clear

2764
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,840
Captain Ning believes

2765
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,120
that Brother Bai pushed his son overboard

2766
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,280
But when questioned, his son

2767
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,600
said he slipped by himself

2768
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,680
This means

2769
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,960
Brother Bai wasn't lying

2770
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,680
That's the first point

2771
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,200
Second

2772
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,640
He thought Brother Bai damaged his ship

2773
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,080
but his ship wasn't actually damaged

2774
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:01,680
So we can conclude

2775
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,400
Brother Bai is actually innocent

2776
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,120
Right

2777
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,800
His name is literally Brother Bai

2778
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,520
We still haven't figured out the motive for murder

2779
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,880
Which means every one of us

2780
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,560
has some connection to the deceased

2781
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,160
So who could be cruel enough

2782
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,280
to actually want to kill him?

2783
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,360
Because he (the deceased) wanted

2784
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,280
one of you four to disappear

2785
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,320
Why would he want someone

2786
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,240
so close from his childhood to disappear?

2787
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:37,760
Think about it

2788
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,360
His biological father

2789
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,720
His biological sister

2790
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,920
The adoptive family

2791
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,560
Why would he want

2792
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,040
one of you to disappear?

2793
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,200
What happened between you all

2794
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,160
is worth considering

2795
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,640
Surely when you adopted him

2796
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,840
you abused him

2797
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,800
Today it's just between the two of them

2798
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,400
Why are you pushing the blame onto us?

2799
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,200
Could I possibly kill my own son?

2800
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,120
Precisely because

2801
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:12,840
you've arrived in our time,

2802
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,640
you believe this person isn't your son.

2803
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,280
If you kill him,

2804
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,240
your real son will appear.

2805
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,280
That's a possibility.

2806
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,880
You don't believe you've time-traveled.

2807
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:28,720
Next,

2808
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:31,200
we will proceed to the confirmation phase.

2809
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,880
I'm going to put on my glasses.

2810
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,240
Little Killer,

2811
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,120
little ones,

2812
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,320
Go ahead

2813
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:54,960
Kelidu

2814
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:08,240
Today I might very well be X

2815
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,880
Today's murderer is a complete fool

2816
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,040
Not necessarily

2817
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:31,560
Don't play these games

2818
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,400
There's no need

2819
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,640
Look

2820
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,880
You said the same about me when you were X

2821
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,200
Now you're the murderer and still saying this about me

2822
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,040
You slander me every day

2823
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,600
Today, it's very likely him

2824
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,040
I can't take it anymore

2825
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:48,920
X

2826
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,280
Let me check your eyes

2827
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,000
A bit stiff

2828
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,360
Your smile is a bit forced

2829
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,400
He was the first to investigate

2830
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,120
First to X

2831
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,240
That's normal

2832
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:58,760
X

2833
01:41:58,760 --> 01:41:59,600
Alright, settled

2834
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,720
Very stiff

2835
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:02,560
One after another

2836
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,400
No matter what I do

2837
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,880
They all start framing me

2838
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:09,320
Let's go

2839
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:10,920
On-site investigation

2840
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,560
Let me get one for you

2841
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,640
I don’t want your help

2842
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,800
Fine

2843
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:15,600
I have to

2844
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,560
Come here, daughter, I’ll take care of it

2845
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,360
It’s fine

2846
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,360
Now that the relationships have changed

2847
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:19,120
You know me

2848
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,760
Just reunited with my daughter

2849
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,480
Suddenly two sons-in-law appear

2850
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,240
Might have three soon

2851
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,840
Has nothing to do with me

2852
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:34,920
Brother Dawang

2853
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,360
No idea what she sees in him

2854
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:37,600
Dating someone

2855
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,400
Been together for three years

2856
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,400
But won't take responsibility

2857
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,720
She refused my proposal

2858
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,840
She wants to leave with you

2859
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,280
Turns out she was the problem

2860
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:49,920
Come

2861
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:50,720
Come on

2862
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:51,280
Please come in

2863
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,920
Back to the starting point again

2864
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,920
Standing blankly in front of the mirror

2865
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,120
Clumsily tying

2866
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,600
The knot of a red tie

2867
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,040
Detective, what should we do now?

2868
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,400
We need to unlock this box

2869
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,560
and open it

2870
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,480
Right

2871
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,240
It should represent the six of us

2872
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,040
Each solving one

2873
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,240
And each is a 3-digit

2874
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:13,880
number

2875
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:16,600
Assuming the deceased

2876
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,440
was the child we knew

2877
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,720
when we were young

2878
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,760
Since he loved the six of us so much

2879
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,080
The six passwords he set

2880
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,920
must be related to us six

2881
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,440
We must open this box

2882
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,160
Come on, let's open the box first

2883
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,720
There's also a

2884
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,160
flashlight on the box, try it

2885
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:37,920
Here

2886
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,280
What does this mean?

2887
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:43,600
What's the meaning?

2888
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,440
Dad, sister

2889
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,080
Eldest brother, second brother

2890
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,040
Second brother, third brother

2891
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:53,720
Nephew

2892
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,200
Their real ages

2893
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,840
Isn't what's written here exactly

2894
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,880
matching our group?

2895
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,440
Let's go

2896
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,320
Our real ages

2897
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:06,960
First in order

2898
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:07,680
Starting with dad

2899
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,360
Dad, how old are you?

2900
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,240
I'm 51

2901
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,360
051, right?

2902
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:16,840
Did it open?

2903
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:17,960
No, it didn't

2904
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,400
051 isn't correct?

2905
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,120
501 isn't either

2906
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,680
But he used real ages

2907
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,240
It definitely isn't

2908
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,200
our current apparent ages

2909
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,560
You're short by 8 years.

2910
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,880
You should add 8 more years.

2911
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:44,840
We've lost

2912
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,080
8 years of our lives

2913
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,120
51, then I should be

2914
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,680
59, 059

2915
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,720
I'm 59 now

2916
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,080
Right

2917
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,440
This is terrifying

2918
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,120
My current timeline

2919
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:54,680
is the same as yours

2920
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:55,600
1988

2921
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,560
But when I say last week

2922
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,960
it was 1980, right?

2923
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,240
So the last week I remember

2924
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:00,760
was 1980

2925
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,440
Which means the 8 years in between

2926
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,600
disappeared within this one week

2927
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,560
It's these two people

2928
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,560
who boarded ship 4444

2929
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,760
Opened, 059 correct

2930
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:17,680
059

2931
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,400
The second one is

2932
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:20,760
25

2933
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:21,760
Sis, right?

2934
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,000
25

2935
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,880
You're 25

2936
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,760
Opened, 025

2937
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:29,960
Next one, big brother right?

2938
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,880
Big brother, I'm 46 this year

2939
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:37,080
Exactly 46

2940
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,760
Yes, 46

2941
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:39,520
Second brother

2942
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,080
Who's second brother?

2943
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:42,360
35

2944
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,240
Okay

2945
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,200
Come on, who's next?

2946
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,480
Third brother

2947
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,680
Third brother is 30

2948
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:50,320
30

2949
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,600
Then I'm 18 plus 8

2950
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,400
I'm 26

2951
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,880
26, 026

2952
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,000
This group photo

2953
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,200
is a photo of the six of us

2954
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,440
Ouch, stop messing around

2955
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:31,120
Ouch, quit it

2956
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,600
I...

2957
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,760
Sorry, teachers

2958
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:40,960
Someone's coming over here

2959
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,240
Come on, don't go

2960
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:45,160
Don't leave

2961
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,240
How about it?

2962
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,600
What's with your look?

2963
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:53,360
What look?

2964
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,160
And you still say there's nothing between you two

2965
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,840
He'll get depressed in a moment.

2966
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,720
My apologies, sister-in-law.

2967
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,240
Did someone just appear?

2968
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:17,840
I didn't see anything.

2969
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,560
I didn't see anyone.

2970
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,120
There's another compartment below.

2971
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,760
Is there anything else?

2972
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,560
There's quite a lot here.

2973
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:26,680
What does "matchstick" mean?

2974
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,880
Just plain matchsticks, right?

2975
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,040
Alright, let's look at this then.

2976
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,200
Helplessness beyond remedy.

2977
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:36,400
Chapter 1: The Secret of "Town Push"

2978
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,040
The River of No Return is a

2979
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,560
mysterious zone with extremely unique magnetic fields

2980
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:43,880
If someone important to you

2981
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:45,360
disappears in the River of No Return

2982
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,160
unfortunately

2983
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,120
it's highly likely

2984
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,760
they cannot return to Tui Town

2985
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,240
But you in Tui Town

2986
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,920
can still reunite with them once

2987
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,040
in "Zhen Tui"

2988
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:56,880
Just once

2989
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,480
Only once, I repeat, just once

2990
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,240
How heartbreaking

2991
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,640
"Zhen Tui" is a parallel world

2992
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:05,360
almost identical to Tui Town

2993
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,640
Parallel world means

2994
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:10,120
Chapter 2: How to reunite in "Zhen Tui"

2995
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:12,320
You must go to the River of No Return

2996
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,680
on a starry moonlit night

2997
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:14,760
Arrange five candles

2998
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,560
according to the five elements

2999
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,360
and light them

3000
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:17,800
As the candlelight flickers

3001
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,560
you must voice your "obsession"

3002
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,680
for that important person

3003
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,520
to possibly open "Zhen Tui"

3004
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:24,560
Warning:

3005
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,920
Only those with deepest obsession

3006
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,040
can possibly open it

3007
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,000
Note: Though "Zhen Tui" and Tui Town

3008
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,680
are parallel worlds

3009
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,320
their magnetic fields are unstable

3010
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,560
If someone sings a nursery rhyme

3011
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:38,880
of "Zhen Tui" by the river

3012
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,360
a "frequency crossover" may occur

3013
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:42,560
You might hear

3014
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,360
sounds from the other world

3015
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,200
or even see visions

3016
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:49,200
As long as someone is here

3017
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,720
by the "Helpless River"

3018
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,840
and sings that

3019
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:53,200
nursery rhyme

3020
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,040
then

3021
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:54,600
a frequency crossover phenomenon occurs

3022
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,840
The magnetic field becomes unstable

3023
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,400
You might hear

3024
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,400
voices from parallel worlds

3025
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:58,520
or even see images

3026
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,200
Like when we heard that

3027
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,720
"Big Baldy"

3028
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:02,040
Right

3029
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:03,480
"Little waves, big eyes"

3030
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,640
or "Big waves, small eyes"

3031
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,600
and things like that

3032
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,000
Those were images we saw

3033
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,880
through frequency crossover

3034
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:08,560
Exactly

3035
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:19,440
Chapter Three

3036
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,560
The Obsessed - the one who initiates the ritual

3037
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:26,040
When the Obsessed enters "Zhen Tui"

3038
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,240
They will appear

3039
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,360
By the "Helpless River" in "Zhen Tui"

3040
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:31,200
Note:

3041
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,920
While the five candles are being lit

3042
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:37,920
Anyone within fifty meters of the ritual

3043
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,760
Will enter "Zhen Tui"

3044
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,240
In other words,

3045
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:41,760
Fifty meters—

3046
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,760
If I perform this ritual,

3047
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:44,240
everyone within fifty meters of me

3048
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:45,440
will come in with me.

3049
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,240
The Missing—

3050
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:50,920
those who have vanished—

3051
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:53,880
After the Obsessed starts the ritual,

3052
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:55,960
all who disappeared

3053
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:58,480
accidentally by the Helpless River

3054
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,960
will enter "Zhen Tui."

3055
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,120
Right now, we're here because—

3056
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,480
We too—

3057
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,680
Actually, we're all the Missing.

3058
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,120
Someone

3059
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:09,680
gathered us all here.

3060
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:15,680
That girl of mine and my cousin

3061
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:16,480
suddenly disappeared

3062
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:16,960
My father

3063
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:19,720
went missing last Sunday

3064
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:21,240
My son vanished

3065
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,040
The missing family member

3066
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,120
is my daughter

3067
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,600
Someone performed a ritual

3068
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:32,920
A ritual was performed

3069
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:33,440
Right

3070
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,360
So whose world are we in now?

3071
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,760
That means we're in the killer's world, correct?

3072
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:39,320
Whoever performed this ritual

3073
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:40,360
We're in their world

3074
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:48,760
Chapter 4: How to Leave "Zhen Tui"

3075
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,920
The overlapping space between "Zhen Tui" and Tui Zhen

3076
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,600
The skating rink

3077
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:55,720
is the only

3078
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,120
space where "Zhen Tui" and Tui Zhen overlap

3079
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,920
If you want to leave "Zhen Tui"

3080
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,320
you must initiate the switching ritual

3081
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,760
After activation, the overlapping space

3082
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,920
will switch from "Zhen Tui's" skating rink

3083
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:09,560
to Tui Zhen's skating rink

3084
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,560
When exiting through the skating rink's gate in Tui Town,

3085
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,720
step outside,

3086
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,320
you can return to Tui Town.

3087
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,880
Note: Only people can be switched,

3088
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:20,320
so

3089
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,440
the skating rinks in both parallel worlds

3090
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:24,720
must maintain identical layouts

3091
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,800
to prevent accidents during spatial transitions.

3092
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,040
Identical layouts.

3093
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:31,920
We two

3094
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:32,800
just dismantled them.

3095
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,040
You all took yours apart too?

3096
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,240
No problem, we can reassemble them. No problem.

3097
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,000
Just taken apart

3098
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,560
No problem, can be reassembled

3099
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:58,080
Can be restored

3100
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,200
Yes

3101
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,880
Can be put back together

3102
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:06,600
The obsessed and the missing

3103
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,120
Can all enter "Zhen Tui" skating rink and

3104
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:11,520
Tui Zhen skating rink

3105
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,960
But only the obsessed

3106
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,520
Can walk out of Tui Zhen skating rink

3107
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:23,400
For example

3108
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:24,560
Right now we're in "Town Push"

3109
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,680
We can all return to Push Town

3110
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:26,400
Right

3111
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:26,960
That's the first point

3112
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,240
But only the determined one

3113
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,840
The one performing the ritual

3114
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,200
Can walk out through this door

3115
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,880
If someone was accidentally brought in

3116
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,520
Then we follow the same rule

3117
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,880
Only the caster can walk out

3118
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,320
Overlapping Space Transition Ritual

3119
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,200
Please proceed to Push Nice Skating Rink

3120
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,560
Search carefully on the pillars

3121
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,320
The ritual's detailed steps

3122
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,120
On the pillars

3123
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,680
Before performing the ritual

3124
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:58,720
Participants must prepare in advance

3125
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,120
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

3126
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:02,880
Items representing the five elements

3127
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:03,760
That bag

3128
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:04,960
Tony's bag

3129
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:05,520
Yes

3130
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,320
There's someone underneath this.

3131
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:14,640
Why did you ask me to meet in the overlapping space?

3132
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,800
Why did you ask me to go?

3133
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,400
The warehouse in the overlapping space.

3134
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:19,240
Right there. He died there.

3135
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:20,880
He was invited there, right?

3136
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:26,880
Chapter Five

3137
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:29,680
The Backlash and Harm of "Zhen Tui"

3138
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,640
First: Eternal Cycle

3139
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,240
After "Zhen Tui" is activated

3140
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,320
in the "River of No Return"

3141
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:38,000
all missing persons will be summoned to

3142
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,680
live on within "Zhen Tui"

3143
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,680
If an obsessed person enters "Zhen Tui"

3144
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:46,120
then from the day they enter

3145
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,520
they will be trapped in a

3146
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,520
seven-day time loop

3147
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:54,200
All people in "Zhen Tui" will endlessly repeat

3148
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,200
these seven days

3149
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,320
It's this obsessed person

3150
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:56,960
Right

3151
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:57,800
Actually, that person yesterday

3152
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:58,840
Thomas said that obsessed person

3153
01:53:58,840 --> 01:53:59,520
The obsessed one

3154
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:00,320
is this person

3155
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,280
This person, yes

3156
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,640
Look at this paper that fell from him

3157
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:05,240
This means the paper

3158
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,000
was dropped by the first

3159
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,400
person wearing a plague doctor mask

3160
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:08,160
who came here

3161
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:11,800
Find the Obsessed One

3162
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,560
Eliminate him

3163
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,680
Only then can the cycle end

3164
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:21,040
Second - Reduced to ashes

3165
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:24,000
Those obsessed with "Town Push" who entered from Push Town

3166
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,120
Must leave within 28 days

3167
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:29,120
Before the end of the fourth cycle

3168
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,600
The fourth cycle

3169
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,040
Is actually today

3170
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,640
It's the weekend

3171
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:34,800
Because someone said last time

3172
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,800
The fourth time

3173
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:36,480
This is already my fourth time

3174
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:36,920
Experiencing this

3175
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:37,800
Right

3176
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,400
Four times seven is twenty-eight

3177
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:40,560
Correct

3178
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:42,440
When I saw

3179
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:43,880
That symbol just now

3180
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,920
It was like flipping a switch

3181
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,440
All memories came flooding in

3182
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,120
I suddenly realized

3183
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:51,160
All my experiences have been cycling

3184
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:53,240
This is already my fourth

3185
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,880
Fourth cycle

3186
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,000
Otherwise,

3187
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,600
you will never be able to leave.

3188
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:06,280
After 49 days,

3189
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,800
when the seventh cycle ends,

3190
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,040
you will vanish into dust.

3191
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:12,920
This is equivalent to permanent death in Tui Town.

3192
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,800
If you die within Tui Town,

3193
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,040
you will disappear forever,

3194
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,920
and won't be revived in the next cycle.

3195
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:24,400
This means the person

3196
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,480
must leave within 28 days.

3197
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,280
If they don't,

3198
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,120
this person with lingering attachments

3199
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:29,720
The one with attachments

3200
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,240
must leave today.

3201
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:31,800
They must go.

3202
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,000
If they don't leave today,

3203
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,120
they won't be able to leave later.

3204
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:36,440
In 48 days, they're doomed.

3205
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:37,600
They'll be erased from this world

3206
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,000
Alternatively, the attached person can choose

3207
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:39,800
to stay here,

3208
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:40,440
of course.

3209
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:41,000
Right?

3210
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,160
and die with everyone else.

3211
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,640
But after 49 days,

3212
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,000
they'll turn to ashes.

3213
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:50,640
So why kill them?

3214
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,120
They'll have to leave eventually.

3215
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,600
Then this deceased person

3216
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,600
If he's here

3217
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:03,800
Either he's an obsessive soul

3218
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,160
Or he's on the River of No Return

3219
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:05,720
A missing person

3220
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:06,160
Summoned back

3221
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,280
Only these two possibilities

3222
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,120
Right

3223
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:08,800
Is it possible

3224
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,000
That in his world

3225
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,120
Each of us

3226
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:11,720
Our stories

3227
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:13,160
Have all happened to him

3228
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:14,400
With no family left by his side

3229
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,400
You do have a point.

3230
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,480
We're all connected to him.

3231
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:21,040
That's why that painting exists.

3232
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,280
But in his world,

3233
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,480
we've already disappeared.

3234
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:24,440
Yes, all gone.

3235
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,640
That's why that ritual was performed.

3236
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:27,920
Wait a minute.

3237
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,000
Look at this.

3238
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,600
There's a date on this photo.

3239
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:31,240
Right.

3240
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,880
January 1980.

3241
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:33,560
In January.

3242
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,440
By February, we'd all disappeared.

3243
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:36,000
Yes.

3244
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,600
In 1980,

3245
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:39,800
he experienced our...

3246
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,240
Possibly.

3247
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:40,800
Disappearance.

3248
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:41,280
Yes.

3249
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,120
Then in 1988,

3250
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,640
he experienced your disappearance.

3251
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,280
Correct.

3252
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:47,360
So three ships, three timelines.

3253
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,400
He's the most normal timeline.

3254
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:50,920
To put it bluntly,

3255
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:53,400
pieced together to form

3256
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:53,800
formed

3257
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,120
our current world.

3258
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:55,800
Right.

3259
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,240
But the matchstick remains unresolved.

3260
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,600
The matchstick is for lighting that candle.

3261
01:56:58,600 --> 01:56:59,600
He wants to

3262
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:00,920
perform a summoning ritual.

3263
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:02,400
He needs to light this candle

3264
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,000
Correct.

3265
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,160
So we need to figure out

3266
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:05,360
why he killed the victim.

3267
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,240
That murderer

3268
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,360
Logically speaking,

3269
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:08,400
based on the logic of killing Xiao Ba,

3270
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:08,920
if he's

3271
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:10,080
summoned us here,

3272
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,280
some of us should have memories

3273
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:14,600
of not wanting to leave this town.

3274
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,480
Wanting to maintain the current state.

3275
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:15,800
Right.

3276
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:16,560
Yes.

3277
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,400
Maintaining this current

3278
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:17,920
Right.

3279
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:18,720
No.

3280
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,040
The main point is maintaining the status quo

3281
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,720
is bad for everyone.

3282
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,160
Why?

3283
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:22,840
Because none of us

3284
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:23,960
belong here.

3285
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:24,600
No.

3286
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,600
Why is it bad?

3287
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,920
For me, my son has returned.

3288
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,600
For him,

3289
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,600
his girlfriend and his eldest brother have returned.

3290
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,320
Right.

3291
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:35,120
For you, your brother has returned.

3292
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:37,120
Your second brother has also returned.

3293
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,040
For me,

3294
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,120
my daughter has returned.

3295
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:39,920
Me and my daughter.

3296
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,120
Yes, your obsession is your daughter.

3297
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:43,280
Your daughter has returned.

3298
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:47,280
But we need to figure out

3299
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:48,840
why the killer wanted to murder him

3300
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,040
This is crucial

3301
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,800
We're tracking down his murderer

3302
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,680
People from 1988

3303
01:57:58,680 --> 01:57:59,720
You two are from 1980

3304
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:00,800
Then it's fine

3305
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:02,160
Right

3306
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:02,800
Isn't that so?

3307
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,800
Then those from 1988

3308
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:05,840
That's me, Bai Sect

3309
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,600
The four of us

3310
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:07,800
Our family

3311
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,960
And the deceased

3312
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,120
I think it's a bit far-fetched

3313
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,120
This 1988 and 1980 thing

3314
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:14,120
Not far-fetched

3315
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:14,680
Why?

3316
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:16,120
What the hell are you trying to say?

3317
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,600
Outside info, misleading everyone

3318
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,040
What exactly do you find far-fetched?

3319
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,280
What I mean is

3320
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:24,480
We came from 1980

3321
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,960
We might also think

3322
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,280
The world in 1988 is better

3323
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,560
People around us suddenly reappeared

3324
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:30,600
And want to stay here

3325
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:31,280
That's possible too

3326
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,240
Why not?

3327
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,680
You're the same as in 1988

3328
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:35,480
It's about making up for regrets

3329
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:36,080
Actually what I just said

3330
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:36,800
follows the same logic

3331
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,040
I wasn't favoring him

3332
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:39,480
What I said earlier follows this logic too

3333
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,480
Everyone here today

3334
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,160
has found who they were looking for

3335
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:43,960
First of all, the four of us

3336
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:45,280
are all from 1988

3337
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:45,800
Right?

3338
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:47,120
Why were those two excluded?

3339
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:49,120
If I were the one who cast the spell in 1980

3340
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:50,680
what would happen is

3341
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:51,120
I would summon

3342
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:52,440
people from 1980

3343
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,080
But he must be

3344
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,040
the one who cast the spell in 1988

3345
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,800
And those two came from the Wukenai River

3346
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:56,800
but not from

3347
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:57,920
this parallel dimension

3348
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:58,680
The parallel dimension's

3349
01:58:58,680 --> 01:58:59,600
You understand?

3350
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,280
So they should be excluded

3351
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,280
from suspicion

3352
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:03,920
Because they were

3353
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,720
brought here from the river

3354
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,560
They came from the river

3355
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:07,120
You... you... all of us

3356
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:08,800
could have been brought from within 50 meters

3357
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,400
around here

3358
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:10,840
But they came from the river

3359
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:12,680
I understand now.

3360
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:13,560
Basically,

3361
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,320
If we cast the spell in 1980,

3362
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:16,960
you four wouldn't have disappeared yet.

3363
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,120
If we cast the spell,

3364
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:19,720
and you hadn't disappeared,

3365
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:20,920
you wouldn't have been dragged into this.

3366
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:22,720
But if in 1988,

3367
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:24,280
whoever casts the spell in 1988

3368
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:26,200
could bring back the two of us from 1980

3369
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,440
who disappeared on that ship.

3370
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:27,920
and bring us back.

3371
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,600
Exactly.

3372
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:30,200
So it depends on who

3373
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,960
was the last to disappear in 1988.

3374
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,160
Actually, this could also be

3375
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:36,960
No, let's sort this out

3376
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,960
The more recent disappearances

3377
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,480
The more likely they are spellcasters

3378
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:49,600
Another point is the killer's modus operandi.

3379
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:53,520
At the moment of switching,

3380
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:57,840
he crosses dimensions to kill you.

3381
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:58,480
Right.

3382
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,240
He came from another dimension

3383
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:01,520
to kill someone in this dimension.

3384
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,240
That's so cool.

3385
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,320
That's terrifying.

3386
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:07,760
This imagination is really...

3387
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:10,400
Enter, kill, then leave.

3388
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,400
Yes, you see,

3389
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,440
his words are crucial.

3390
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,680
Why invite me to

3391
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,600
the warehouse in overlapping space?

3392
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:19,800
Because that was exactly when the spaces overlapped.

3393
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:20,600
He was invited precisely during

3394
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:21,600
the transition period.

3395
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,680
Because only during transition

3396
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,800
do the spaces overlap.

3397
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,600
So is it possible the victim

3398
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:30,600
didn't die here either?

3399
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,240
Since there's no murder weapon,

3400
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:33,040
it's possible.

3401
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:33,840
After dying over there,

3402
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:34,600
he was transferred here.

3403
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,120
Right.

3404
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:36,320
You mean

3405
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,480
the victim was killed in

3406
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:38,400
Tui Town,

3407
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,600
then transferred to Zhen Tui?

3408
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:47,080
If we can find

3409
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:48,880
the warehouse in Tui Town

3410
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,080
then we might be able to see

3411
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:51,960
the overlapping

3412
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:52,720
murder weapons

3413
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:53,920
So we need to turn

3414
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,400
Therefore we must begin the ritual

3415
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,640
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

3416
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:00,680
That bag with the five elements charms

3417
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,720
has gone missing

3418
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:03,440
Now let's search our own homes

3419
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:03,920
to look for

3420
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,600
if we have Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

3421
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:06,280
That makes sense

3422
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:07,440
Alright, let's go

3423
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,800
Metal, Wood, Water

3424
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,800
Fire, Earth

3425
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,560
Water's easy to find, but Earth...

3426
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:15,800
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

3427
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:17,040
How do we find Earth?

3428
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:19,800
Let's go to Bai Kan's place first

3429
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:21,920
Bai Kan

3430
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,680
Bai Mai

3431
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,360
Just tear it apart

3432
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:24,720
Brothers

3433
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:25,560
Show no mercy

3434
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,160
This is your house, right?

3435
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:30,800
Yes

3436
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,840
This is your house, correct?

3437
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:35,400
What a headache

3438
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,480
Then how did you find it so quickly?

3439
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:44,920
Then how did you kill someone?

3440
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:45,240
You have nothing.

3441
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:46,560
This is my axe.

3442
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:48,840
It's just wood.

3443
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,480
Wood.

3444
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:54,360
Come, this is our home.

3445
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,440
Your place has pretty advanced stuff.

3446
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,800
Isn't this water?

3447
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:08,320
Right.

3448
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,160
This water—I'll take this.

3449
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:11,000
Soil.

3450
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,360
Bring our flowerpot.

3451
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:15,440
Now then,

3452
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,560
we've arrived at Sis Ba's place.

3453
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,040
Look

3454
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:33,880
Look at Xiao Ba

3455
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:38,040
You even have such wild photos

3456
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,160
I don't know my daughter that well either

3457
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:41,800
Everyone has their wild phase

3458
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:42,360
Right?

3459
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,080
Fiery red lips, isn't it?

3460
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,360
Come on, let's find hers

3461
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,440
We still need to find

3462
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:52,200
what kind of evidence it would be

3463
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:53,000
Daughter

3464
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,200
Are you sure this is your dress?

3465
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:56,480
That should be mine

3466
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,080
I don't know either

3467
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:02,960
Anyway, it's in my cabinet

3468
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:03,480
Why does it feel like

3469
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:05,120
someone else is living here with you

3470
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:13,720
This is another story altogether

3471
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:16,640
There's another person

3472
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,200
Could it be Third Brother?

3473
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:19,120
Third Brother

3474
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,680
Golden Abacus

3475
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,880
All gathered

3476
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,520
All collected

3477
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,600
Then just now you said

3478
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:44,480
There's that thing on the wall, right?

3479
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,800
Find that method

3480
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:55,920
Invisible to the naked eye

3481
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,120
We definitely need to scan it

3482
02:03:58,520 --> 02:03:59,600
It's written above

3483
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,000
Wait a moment

3484
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:11,680
I don't know what you're looking for.

3485
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:13,120
Isn't there an envelope here?

3486
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,240
What are you searching for?

3487
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:23,480
I'm really speechless

3488
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,320
These eyes are impressive

3489
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:26,360
I give up

3490
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,480
You should've stepped in earlier

3491
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,600
I couldn't bear to watch anymore

3492
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:32,480
Switching ritual

3493
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:36,600
After following the sequence

3494
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:38,680
Can shift the overlapping space

3495
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:39,800
Skating rink area

3496
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:42,880
From "Tui Town" to "Town Tui"

3497
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,880
Or from "Town Tui" to "Tui Town"

3498
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:52,880
All ritual participants

3499
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:53,920
must place items representing

3500
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,040
the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth

3501
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:57,120
into the designated

3502
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,880
five corresponding compartments

3503
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:00,600
at the skating rink

3504
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:01,800
These compartments

3505
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:02,680
right here.

3506
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:05,680
Then use prepared ropes

3507
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:07,880
to connect the five points

3508
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:09,800
forming a specific pattern.

3509
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,800
That's water

3510
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:15,360
That's earth

3511
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,320
That's metal

3512
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:16,880
This is wood

3513
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:18,000
That's fire

3514
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:26,920
It's lit

3515
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,800
The lights are on

3516
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:34,800
Did you light the fire?

3517
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,760
Does it need to be lit or...?

3518
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:37,120
Don't light it.

3519
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:37,920
Put the match on first.

3520
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,000
See if it lights up.

3521
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,240
Just use the match.

3522
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:41,600
It's lit, the match works.

3523
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:42,600
It's lit, that's correct.

3524
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:46,560
Like a five-pointed star.

3525
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,560
Then connect the four sides like this.

3526
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:49,800
We need to use rope.

3527
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,560
Where would we find such a long rope?

3528
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,560
Let's take this apart.

3529
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,320
What is this?

3530
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,800
He makes a good point.

3531
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:03,960
This ribbon.

3532
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:10,720
That's already secured in place.

3533
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:14,920
This one will work.

3534
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,280
This one will work too.

3535
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:20,000
This.

3536
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,800
Yarn.

3537
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:25,880
There's so much yarn here.

3538
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,800
Let's use the yarn.

3539
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:30,240
Find a nice-looking one.

3540
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,200
Let's pick a red one.

3541
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:33,480
All five of us stand ready.

3542
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:35,200
Let Brother start from whichever end.

3543
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:35,560
Right.

3544
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:36,160
Come on.

3545
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:39,080
You direct me first.

3546
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:40,320
Water, you stand over there first.

3547
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:41,440
Here.

3548
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:45,800
Old Bai, you stand at a corner.

3549
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:46,480
Tell me where to stand.

3550
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:47,840
Then come to the wooden cabinet first.

3551
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,240
Move.

3552
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:56,440
Come on, starting from this point.

3553
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:57,640
Okay, I'll start here.

3554
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:07,360
Come

3555
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:09,200
You hold

3556
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:09,880
Okay

3557
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:22,400
People will come out from these doors soon.

3558
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,760
Yes, I think so too.

3559
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:25,680
So I blocked the doors.

3560
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:27,760
So I'm leaning here.

3561
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,160
Really? That makes me more scared.

3562
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,840
Here, hold this.

3563
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,160
Water, right.

3564
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:39,840
Here's your earth.

3565
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:40,480
Come on.

3566
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:42,680
Hold on.

3567
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:45,360
This goes to fire.

3568
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:51,040
That's right.

3569
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:25,040
Here we go again, everyone.

3570
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,200
Who's touching me?

3571
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,200
Don't scare me.

3572
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:28,880
Who?

3573
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,080
Someone's grabbing me.

3574
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:31,000
Someone came out.

3575
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,840
Who came out?

3576
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,840
Where did someone come out?

3577
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:33,800
I don't know.

3578
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:36,560
Now the space is shifting.

3579
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:37,720
Be careful.

3580
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:39,720
Quick!

3581
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,120
Put out the incense candles.

3582
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:42,000
We're back in town.

3583
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,640
The ominous ship No. 4444.

3584
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,400
Missing case investigation notice.

3585
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,000
This is our...

3586
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:48,720
Family tree.

3587
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,000
Now we're all connected.

3588
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,920
Because we're family.

3589
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,160
I can't let him interfere with my plans.

3590
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:01,800
I must resort to extreme measures.

3591
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:02,480
Kill him.

3592
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,320
So your obsession is...

3593
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:05,080
Never fading.

3594
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:05,880
Then he came here...

3595
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:06,920
To find someone.

3596
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:07,720
This person...

3597
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:09,680
Is connected to something that happened 8 years ago.

3598
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:10,120
Related to it.

3599
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:11,160
For the deceased...

3600
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:12,320
The most important person was you.

3601
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,480
Or maybe his sister.

3602
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:14,240
But I'm telling you...

3603
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,120
Everyone present here...

3604
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:16,280
Was important to him.

3605
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:17,960
Then it depends on who wants to stay here more.
