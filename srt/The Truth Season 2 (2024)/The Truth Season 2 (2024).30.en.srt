1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:05,720
Huh?

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,920
What?

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,840
What does this mean?

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,040
What?

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,200
This is way too difficult

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,280
Why is this...

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,520
much harder than last time?

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,920
I just remember...

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,000
I need to stop you

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,920
You want to chase after...

11
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,440
that Sister Jin

12
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:16,960
Jin Jing

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,200
Then I stop you

14
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,120
We're clearly both idols

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,160
Why are we doing comedy?

16
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,960
Then I grab your leg

17
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
You have to do this, like this

18
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,800
Stand on one leg

19
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,440
What the hell?

20
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,720
Wrong way

21
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,280
Opposite

22
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,120
Like your whole face says "unhappy"

23
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,920
Melancholic man

24
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,400
We all have to start more melancholic

25
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,360
Right, good at being melancholic

26
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,120
Okay okay okay

27
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,560
What about your kneeling?

28
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,640
Right, weren't you proposing?

29
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,080
Teacher Jin, come open the door

30
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,360
You need to recite a "spell"

31
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,320
Make me pretty, make me pretty

32
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,520
Make me prettier than Ba Zimei

33
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,360
I haven't done my expression control yet

34
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,040
and you just gave me the light

35
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,680
Once more

36
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,480
One more time

37
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,880
Give me a melancholic one

38
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,040
First, take a look at the evidence

39
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,840
You have evidence too

40
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,640
You need to look too

41
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,240
Little murderer

42
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,080
I'm not

43
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,480
Anyone can doubt me

44
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,400
But not you

45
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
So are you two still together?

46
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,440
Finally some plot development

47
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,960
Love watching this, so dramatic

48
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Your fans should be called morning glories

49
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,720
Why call him an ox?

50
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,080
He sings like an ox

51
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,680
Sings like a mooing cow

52
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,400
Where were you? Took so long

53
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Went to film the crime process, didn't you?

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,920
Now you show up

55
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,760
You know the routine well

56
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,400
Not a killer

57
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,480
Why would I know killer procedures?

58
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Enough talking

59
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,120
Oops, talked too much

60
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh dear oh dear

61
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,640
Don't you dare be sad

62
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,360
I'll chase your loneliness away

63
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,480
The weight of dreams

64
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
What's this

65
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,720
What does this mean

66
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Leave it all to me

67
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Hold my hand and follow me

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,960
No matter how strong the wind blows

69
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,200
Now that you have me

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,880
You'll never lose your way again

71
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,560
I'll watch the meteor shower with you

72
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,400
Falling upon this earth

73
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Let your tears fall on my shoulder

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,880
Believe my love dares only for you

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
Why

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,520
You'll see where happiness lies

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:07,840
You'll see where happiness lies

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,240
This is way too hard

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,040
So difficult

80
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,960
This is too extreme

81
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,440
Why is this

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,280
Much harder than last time

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,400
Yeah

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
And also

85
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,960
What is this

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What kind of thing is this

87
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,760
Laugh and I'll sing praises

88
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,800
A single frown breaks my heart

89
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,360
I've no time for myself

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Only feeling what you feel

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,400
Wherever you go

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Take my soul with you

93
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,920
It's bewitched by you

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,280
What use is keeping it?

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,600
You're the electricity

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,880
You're the light

97
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,480
You're the only legend

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,280
I only love you

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,720
You are my super star

100
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,040
You dominate

101
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,280
I worship

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,160
No better way

103
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,640
But to love you

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
You are my super star

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,400
You are my

106
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,080
Super star boy

107
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,440
Look at these moves

108
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,960
How can we remember them?

109
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,600
I remember you have a kneeling part

110
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,400
Don't forget

111
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
This is what I forgot

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,880
I remember everything else

113
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
You're a singer-dancer

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Don't forget

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,760
Let's try it out

116
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,280
No problem

117
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,880
Let's give it a try

118
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Improvise freely

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Come on

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
Free improvisation

121
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Be more free

122
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
The gentle starry sky

123
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,560
Should move you

124
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,080
I just remember I need to stop you

125
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,480
You're going after Sister Jin

126
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,080
Jin Jing

127
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,320
Then I'll stop you

128
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,480
It's fine

129
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,200
No need to be so strict

130
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,840
There's a sky banner behind

131
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
Don't block my position

132
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
Little killer

133
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,440
I already know who the killer is

134
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,880
Who is it?

135
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,120
Not telling you

136
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,560
And then we'll begin with

137
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,160
your own confidence

138
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,280
Okay, let's play the music first

139
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,880
Let's give it a try

140
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,640
It's okay

141
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,720
Confident

142
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,920
Let confidence shine

143
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,280
See? I told you I'm here

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,920
You didn't believe me

145
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,520
The gentle starry sky

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,680
Should move your heart

147
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,080
I'm right behind you

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,440
Creating a sky just for you

149
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,080
I won't let you be sad

150
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,480
I'll chase away your loneliness

151
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,360
The weight of dreams

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
No one interacts with me like this

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
Leave it all to me

154
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,560
Hold my hand and follow me

155
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,600
No matter how strong the wind blows

156
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,680
You have me now

157
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,080
Even when the wind howls

158
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,040
You'll never lose your way again

159
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,960
I'll watch the meteor shower with you

160
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,080
Falling upon this earth

161
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,680
Let your tears fall on my shoulder

162
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,440
Fall on my shoulder

163
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,520
Right there on my shoulder

164
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Believe my love is brave only for you

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,400
You'll find where happiness resides

166
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Holding a fan

167
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I'll watch the meteor shower with you

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,560
Falling upon this earth

169
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,920
Let your tears fall on my shoulder

170
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,320
Believe my love is brave only for you

171
00:06:43,320 --> 00:07:02,080
You'll find where happiness resides

172
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
We completely forgot the process

173
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,880
Then I was holding your leg

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,560
You want to, like this

175
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
You standing on one leg

176
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,680
What the hell

177
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,760
Rebellion

178
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,200
Upside down

179
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
Okay

180
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,280
Alright, that's enough

181
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,160
When you smile, I sing praises

182
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,120
When you frown, my heart aches

183
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,680
It's about the heart, this heart thing

184
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,720
I don't have time for myself

185
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,800
Only feeling what you feel

186
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Where are you going

187
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,080
Take my soul with you too

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,000
It's obsessed with you

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,640
What's the use of keeping it

190
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,720
You're the electricity

191
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
You're the light

192
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,600
You're the only legend

193
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,240
You're the one I love

194
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,400
you are my super star

195
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
You dominate

196
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
I worship

197
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,120
There's no better way

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,760
Can only love you

199
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,200
you are my super star

200
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,680
You're the electricity

201
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
You're the light

202
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,560
You're the only legend

203
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,200
You're the one I love

204
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,400
you are my super star

205
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,120
You dominate

206
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,440
I worship

207
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
There's no better way

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,640
Can only love you

209
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,520
you are my super star

210
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,280
you are my

211
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,960
super star boy

212
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,760
Why so rushed

213
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
You seem to be ahead of me

214
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
What about that kneeling

215
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,760
Right

216
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,840
Zhang Linghe kneeling

217
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,400
Aren't you proposing

218
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,920
In "Meteor Shower"

219
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,760
Yes

220
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,080
He deleted that himself

221
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,680
Which line should remind him

222
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,960
This is the key to this scene

223
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,440
Fine, I'll just keep kneeling then

224
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,280
Here's a hint on where to kneel

225
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,080
The gentle starry sky

226
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Should move you deeply

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,280
Kneel down

228
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
Where's the final pose?

229
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,520
You're going that way

230
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,920
Just like this

231
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,240
Yes

232
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,680
To the right

233
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,320
Correct

234
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,080
Like this?

235
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,680
That's right

236
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,320
This move of mine

237
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,920
This way

238
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,240
My old back can't take it

239
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,480
Back isn't holding up

240
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,640
Let me stretch

241
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,760
Let's do it again

242
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Let's begin officially

243
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,240
We're clearly all idols

244
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,320
Why go for comedy?

245
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,160
You should rush to love her

246
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
I'll stop you

247
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Don't really want to love her

248
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,560
What are you?

249
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,320
The sky, right?

250
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
Actually your hardest line is

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,360
Mine is too hard to sing

252
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,960
Which line?

253
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,640
Mine's the first chorus line

254
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,480
The meteor shower one

255
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,280
I'll watch the meteor shower with you

256
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Falling on this earth

257
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me start you at a lower pitch

258
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
When do I kneel?

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
There's a chorus part

260
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
Believe in my love

261
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,880
Then you walk over

262
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
And kneel down

263
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
After they come up

264
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,160
Yes

265
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
Alright, we'll do what you're most excited for

266
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,360
What?

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,800
The kneeling!

268
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,480
Right

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't forget

270
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
Forget and we start over

271
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,240
I'll keep recording until you get it right

272
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,240
It's about our banner

273
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,640
This banner represents the first line

274
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,600
You know how it's supposed to fill the sky

275
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,360
We just need to unfurl this banner

276
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,720
This is for when the teacher first sings

277
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,360
What do you mean?

278
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Like the gentle starry sky

279
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,360
We'll both hold it up

280
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,840
Right

281
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
No, it's "arranging a sky for you"

282
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
No, like this

283
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,920
Let's start with a pose first

284
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,080
At the beginning, I'll be here

285
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,640
Then when you enter

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,120
I'll walk over

287
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,760
You walk over

288
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,480
Then we'll come and do this for you

289
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,160
No problem

290
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,080
Then when it rises up like this

291
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,560
That works

292
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
We should have an opening pose

293
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,320
Professional

294
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,680
Okay?

295
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,320
Okay

296
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
Let's make it more melancholic, alright?

297
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,600
That's good

298
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
Like you're coming on with a headache

299
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,720
Your face should show unhappiness

300
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,680
That melancholic man vibe

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
You're good at that

302
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,440
So at the beginning

303
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,280
We should both be more melancholic

304
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,600
You're good at the melancholic type

305
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
Good

306
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,040
Wait, let's do the pose first, okay?

307
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,720
Like this

308
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
Just different poses

309
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,120
You get it

310
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,800
Why do you look like you're posing

311
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I look like I'm squatting to poop

312
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
How about you strike a freeze pose?

313
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,320
I'll do one like this.

314
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,600
I can do this kind too.

315
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,160
Either way.

316
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,640
Whatever works.

317
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
You're here to take a dump, right?

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,400
Yeah, I'm here to take a dump.

319
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
Quick, squat in a cooler way.

320
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Please.

321
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,840
Let's both carry it together.

322
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,440
Or maybe...

323
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,880
Then you carry it like this.

324
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,920
When you're carrying it, just turn around.

325
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Then suddenly walk over singing.

326
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,120
Wouldn't that be cooler?

327
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,880
Alright.

328
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,040
I'll squat like this first.

329
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,160
Then when we get up together, I'll leave.

330
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,600
Okay.

331
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
We've got this kind.

332
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,000
You look like a thief, stop it.

333
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,880
You really look like a thief.

334
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,680
Pose, strike a pose.

335
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,760
Pose? What pose?

336
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,280
You two do a combined freeze pose.

337
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,600
Or maybe you come up.

338
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,560
First put your hand on his shoulder.

339
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,280
I think...

340
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,280
Right.

341
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,520
Then at the beginning...

342
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,480
Shouldn't we hold up a banner for him?

343
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,880
Right away.

344
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,040
We'll leave after he sings.

345
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,520
Good.

346
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,160
Haven't you noticed...

347
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,280
I've gotten much taller today.

348
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,520
You're wearing lifts.

349
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,760
Because I'm wearing height-increasing insoles.

350
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,400
How many centimeters did you add?

351
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,520
How many centimeters?

352
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,120
I don't know.

353
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,360
These shoes are already tall.

354
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Do you like it?

355
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Are you happy?

356
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,840
Pretty happy.

357
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,160
Every time this part feels like...

358
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,880
Old Bai, after we finish this...

359
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,840
You take this and throw it in the back.

360
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,440
Okay, got it.

361
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
I'll watch the meteor shower with you

362
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,840
Falling upon this earth

363
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,600
Let your tears fall upon my shoulder

364
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,560
I want you to believe my love is brave only for you

365
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:28,800
You'll see where happiness resides

366
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:40,600
You'll see where happiness resides

367
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
What should we do next?

368
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,480
Oh, and there's also a guitar.

369
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,600
Praise your smile

370
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,680
Your frown breaks my heart

371
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,640
Pushing away

372
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
I've no time for myself

373
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,280
No more lyrics left

374
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,080
Only feeling what you feel

375
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Where are you going

376
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,560
Take my soul with you

377
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,520
It's bewitched by you

378
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,000
What's the use in keeping it

379
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,280
You're the electricity

380
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,600
You're the light

381
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,080
You're the only legend

382
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,760
You're the one I love

383
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
you are my super star

384
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
You dominate

385
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,840
I worship

386
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,600
No better way

387
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
But to love you

388
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,160
you are my super star

389
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,080
You're the electricity

390
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,360
You're the light

391
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,960
You're the only legend

392
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,560
You're the one I love

393
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,280
You're my superstar

394
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,480
You dominate

395
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,800
I worship

396
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,640
No better way

397
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,040
But to love you

398
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,960
you are my super star

399
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
you are my

400
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,000
super star boy

401
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Why are you panting

402
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,960
That's how girl groups do it

403
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,520
Quick, my back can't take it anymore.

404
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,760
Okay, sure.

405
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
Pretty good, right?

406
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,240
Which part should I stop you at?

407
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,400
It's fine, watch her move forward.

408
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,320
Just stop me when I reach out.

409
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,440
Not important, doesn't matter.

410
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
How did you do that?

411
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Like you're sitting on something.

412
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,800
You're amazing.

413
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,560
Asian squat.

414
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,160
Can't all Asians do this?

415
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,240
Yeah, don't all Asians do this?

416
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,120
No, but...

417
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,640
You can do it too.

418
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,280
Be careful.

419
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,160
You're wearing a skirt.

420
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,240
Maybe you should...

421
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,600
Yeah, maybe just forget it.

422
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,080
But it's because my shoes have heels.

423
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,160
But how do you feel now?

424
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,800
You seem to be sitting on something.

425
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,840
I'm just sitting on my legs.

426
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,480
Don't squat like that.

427
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,640
Can you really do this as a girl?

428
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,880
You are my

429
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,320
super star boy

430
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,280
Brother, you've got a strong Northeast accent

431
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,000
boy

432
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,360
You are my

433
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
super star boy

434
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
You can rap in the background

435
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,280
Sure

436
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,360
You're the electricity, you're the light

437
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,480
You're the electricity

438
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,280
You're the light

439
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,960
You're the only legend

440
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
This is the Northeast style

441
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,640
Purple Music Band

442
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,960
Purple Cough Syrup

443
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,080
Starring in "Crazy Stone Thief"

444
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,520
You know the taste of the sea

445
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,120
Three-time Best Actor

446
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,200
I am the Best Actor

447
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,360
Now I'm Xiao Le

448
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,240
Master Le

449
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,840
Master Le

450
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
You know Master Le's grandson, right?

451
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,240
Tuo Le's son

452
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
Called Le Sun

453
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
Next time I'll become Le Trash

454
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,560
Le Trash

455
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,800
You are my leading lady

456
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,320
Big White Goose

457
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,800
Big White Goose

458
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,160
Right

459
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
White Swan

460
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,120
What big white goose?

461
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,880
Big White Goose

462
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,640
I am the Big White Goose

463
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,240
Right

464
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,000
I am the White Swan

465
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,080
What big white goose?

466
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,520
I am the Big White Goose

467
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,040
Do you catch geese?

468
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
What catching geese?

469
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,200
Catching big geese, right?

470
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
I've caught some

471
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,720
Zhang Linghe

472
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,040
Can you catch them?

473
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,960
I can't catch them

474
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
Why can't you?

475
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,520
It's very simple

476
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,920
Super easy

477
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
Just shake and you'll catch it

478
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,280
Have you played catching big geese?

479
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,720
What thing?

480
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
Catching big geese

481
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Don't know

482
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,800
There's a mini-game in WeChat Mini Programs

483
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,880
Haven't played it

484
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,000
You should try it

485
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's very fun

486
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,040
Come on

487
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,880
Soon it will be our final

488
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,600
most dazzling highlight

489
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
Please introduce yourselves

490
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
Hello everyone

491
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,840
We are from Tui Zhen Art Academy

492
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,280
the new girl group Gen1es

493
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,400
They look so natural, you know

494
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,520
Ours just now was so unnatural

495
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Look at them

496
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,440
Yeah, I said ours was so unnatural

497
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,280
But theirs is natural

498
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,000
So youthful

499
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,360
What kind of Gen1es are you?

500
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm a bit of an old Gen1es

501
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,040
Here

502
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
Come

503
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,360
Who's opening today?

504
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,160
The qigong master isn't coming today.

505
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,680
Right

506
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,400
Our... uh...

507
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,240
That...

508
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,200
Slacker King

509
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
Then Goldfish can open it today.

510
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,320
I'm called Canary.

511
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,800
Go ahead

512
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,160
I don't dare

513
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
You just need to recite a "spell"

514
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,920
Whatever's in your heart

515
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,520
Just say it out loud

516
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,280
What do you miss most?

517
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,000
Which one to use?

518
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,160
No need to touch

519
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,480
Just recite directly, right?

520
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,000
Nothing else needed

521
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Just speak will do

522
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,240
Sincerity makes it effective

523
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,760
Yes

524
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,000
Make me pretty, make me pretty

525
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,440
Make me prettier than Ba Zimei

526
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,240
It works

527
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,840
It works

528
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,960
Later "bang" the cabinet will fall

529
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,000
Said something you shouldn't have

530
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,600
Big production

531
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,280
Exactly

532
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,120
Big budget

533
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Fruit platter

534
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,960
Yes, fruit platter

535
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Later we'll get some foot baths too

536
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Chat while soaking feet

537
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,200
Really nice

538
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,800
You little murderers

539
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,400
How could you say that about me

540
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,640
Let me tell you

541
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,880
Four suspects today

542
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,040
Can eliminate one

543
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Scared me "to death"

544
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,520
I haven't prepared my facial expressions yet

545
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,280
and you already gave me the light

546
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,600
Can we do it again?

547
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
One more time

548
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
Once again

549
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
Give me a melancholic one

550
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,480
Get ready

551
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,400
Strike a pose

552
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,520
There's no real pose

553
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,640
Yours is the most proper pose

554
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,760
Mine...

555
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,600
Alright, fine

556
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,000
Then I'll switch it up

557
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,520
Here we go

558
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,680
What are you doing?

559
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,640
Aren't we supposed to dance?

560
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,760
Otherwise why would I come out?

561
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
Let's look at the evidence first.

562
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,920
You have evidence too.

563
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,760
You need to see it too.

564
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,120
We all searched for it.

565
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,600
Little murderer.

566
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm not.

567
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,040
Anyone can doubt me.

568
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,720
But not you.

569
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,800
Or I'll cry.

570
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,960
Are you two still together?

571
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,560
Yes.

572
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,720
You two are terrible.

573
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,560
Finally some drama.

574
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,440
I love watching this.

575
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,160
So melodramatic.

576
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,560
Don't you have your own drama?

577
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,360
What do I have?

578
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,160
I don't even know myself.

579
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,440
I just ran off with him.

580
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,520
When I was with him...

581
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,240
What is this?

582
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,320
It's different from yours.

583
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,640
Such innocent love.

584
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,640
Dilililililili Reba.

585
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,040
Dilililililili Reba.

586
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,360
You've lost so much weight.

587
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
How did you lose weight?

588
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,640
Can you share your secret?

589
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Eat less.

590
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,760
Move more.

591
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,000
Maybe I have a cow's stomach.

592
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,400
Cow stomach

593
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,080
Still chewing the cud

594
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,480
Now you're really into this cow thing

595
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,960
You've grown quite fond of it, haven't you?

596
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,400
It feels completely natural

597
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,480
Your fans should be called morning glories

598
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,240
Stop rubbing

599
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,560
Still rubbing

600
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,120
Why a cow?

601
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,960
Why call him a cow?

602
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,280
Sings like a cow mooing

603
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,000
Not bad

604
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,080
I don't think it's that similar

605
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
Is there a video online or something?

606
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,040
There is a video

607
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,160
You accidentally leaked it, didn't you?

608
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,720
Yes

609
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,200
Does this count as blackmail material?

610
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,680
How is this blackmail material?

611
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,960
It's just bad singing.

612
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,440
But those videos you posted before...

613
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,520
Do they count as blackmail material?

614
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,280
No, they don't.

615
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,640
Like "A Lonely Night"...

616
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,600
"A lonely night..."

617
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,960
"My heart..."

618
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,120
"Where should it belong?"

619
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
"After the embrace..."

620
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
"My thoughts..."

621
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,360
"Where should they belong?"

622
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
Where have you been all this time?

623
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,520
Let's analyze the killer's logic.

624
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,320
I went to film the crime scene.

625
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,080
The time was too short.

626
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,760
There wasn't enough time.

627
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,440
Okay.

628
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,080
You're very familiar with the process here.

629
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,480
Of course.

630
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm a loyal viewer.

631
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
It hasn't aired yet, sis.

632
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560
Season one hasn't aired.

633
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,720
Which season is this now?

634
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Season one and two are completely different.

635
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,040
If you're not the killer, how would you know the killer's process?

636
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,960
Let's not talk about it.

637
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,040
Oops, I said too much.

638
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,920
Oh no no no...

639
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,320
Alright.

640
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,360
Because last time Brother Xun came...

641
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,640
He also played the killer for one episode and left.

642
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,320
You're probably following the same pattern.

643
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,640
It can't be me.

644
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,400
It's so obvious.

645
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,360
How could it be me?

646
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,040
Is it you, boyfriend?

647
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,560
Or is it you, spectator?

648
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,840
Your motive is the strongest.

649
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,880
I have a boyfriend.

650
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,600
Why would I risk going to jail?

651
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,880
Don't be so resistant, Zhang Linghe

652
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
Really, don't resist so much

653
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,240
Seriously, don't resist

654
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
You need to get into character

655
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
Who am I resisting?

656
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,560
I'm resisting her

657
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,360
Right

658
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,320
This has become a habit

659
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
They've acted together before

660
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,240
What was that about bloodline suppression?

661
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,320
Yes, she's my sister.

662
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,520
I don't want to be your sister anymore.

663
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
I want us to be closer.

664
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
Don't just be a sister.

665
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,040
Go find a notebook then.

666
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,240
There really isn't one.

667
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,360
Bring it to me.

668
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,080
Xiao X

669
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,320
You weren't like this before.

670
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,280
I'm very relaxed today.

671
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,720
Today, I'm messing with your heads too.

672
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,760
No one gets off easy.

673
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,800
Xiao X

674
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,760
Who?

675
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,080
You.

676
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,160
That's right, it's me.

677
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm double.

678
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm X plus the killer.

679
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,320
You're too good.

680
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,800
Actually, there's a high chance you're the killer.

681
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,800
Why?

682
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,440
Any reason?

683
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,040
It's your turn anyway.

684
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,880
The problem is,

685
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
if you falsely accuse me,

686
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,400
then I'll be watching you closely.

687
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,840
I think between the two of us,

688
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,560
one definitely has a role.

689
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,640
You're right about that.

690
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,800
I also believe

691
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,720
it's you.

692
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,080
Just admit it.

693
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,880
No, you know it in your heart.

694
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,960
You know it too well

695
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,720
Today Jin Jing came to deal with you

696
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,120
I'll deal with you together with her

697
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,480
Alright

698
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,800
Little X

699
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,760
If you're the murderer

700
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,000
You know exactly who it is

701
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,880
Yes, of course I know

702
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,680
Right

703
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,040
That's why I said it's you

704
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,080
I just sent you a message

705
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,760
Did you get it?

706
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,560
Now everyone's playing openly

707
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,080
Showing their cards

708
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,400
Playing with everything revealed

709
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,320
Fine, fine

710
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,400
Add more drama for yourself

711
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,440
Or I'll have no part to play

712
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,880
Need to add more drama

713
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,840
Unless she gives me some here

714
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,720
Okay?

715
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,480
Give me some

716
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,680
You're so nice

717
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,080
Be careful

718
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,960
So good

719
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,240
Take it all

720
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Give this to Brother Bai Yu

721
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,320
Okay

722
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
Computer, you take the computer

723
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,320
Stop pretending over there

724
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
The fierce wind blows

725
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,240
Let time stand still

726
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,240
Steal a different future

727
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,640
Start everything over

728
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,200
Make the unexpected expected

729
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,520
Return to the original

730
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,600
Originally

731
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,520
Did you suddenly sing this song?

732
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,320
You don’t know what it means

733
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,760
No idea

734
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,840
Because it’s from a show he starred in

735
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,800
I sang the OST for him

736
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,640
And later he sang it
