00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,280
That's right.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,160

00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,640
It has more than 680 arcade buildings.

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,080
It's a sightseeing tour.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
And vacation.

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,680
That's right.

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,680

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,800

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,320

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, then welcome all Push Town residents

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
would you like to greet

57
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,040
the new residents here?

58
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,720
Let's start with Zhou Keyu.

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,600
Hello everyone, I'm Zhou Keyu.

60
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm Zhou Keyu, a resident of Push Town.

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,560
Alright.

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Hello, everyone. I'm Push Town resident Liu Yuning.

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
Thank you all.

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
Okay. Welcome, Ning.

65
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,680
Come on, our Dilreba

66
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,840
hello, everyone. I'm Tui resident Dilraba.

67
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,760
This is my first time to participate in a mystery show.

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
Thank you for being here today.

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,760
And I hope that when you watch the show

70
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,200
we have different experiences.

71
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
It also gives you a different experience.

72
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,920
Thank you.

73
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Welcome Dilreba!

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,160
Hello, everyone. I'm Push Town resident Bai Yu.

75
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,440
We are so happy.

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,720
We had more fun.

77
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,760
Please look forward to it.

78
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,200
Okay, welcome Brother Yu.

79
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,400
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Linghe, a new resident of Push Town.

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,280
This is my first time in a variety show.

81
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,240
Having a good time with everyone.

82
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,200
Is it the same as what Bai Yu said just now?

83
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,480
He had a good time.

84
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,920
And then I was having a good time.

85
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,240
I hope everyone had a good time.

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,200
Looking forward to Zhang Linghe.

87
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,400
Okay. Thank you, everyone.

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,120
Next is pushing the residents' portraits.

89
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,440
It gives us a better understanding of everyone.

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,720
And test our familiarity with each other.

91
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
You can see that

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,920
there are some labels around me

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,520
you need to pick and choose

94
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,200
the other four.

95
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
In the second season of Start Reasoning,

96
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,800
of Reasoning.

97
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,080
That is to say, everyone who gets four labels

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,320
oK.

99
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,080
Now, let's welcome the residents,

100
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,880
please choose the labels.

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,080
One first.

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,360
Everyone

103
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,080
any of them.

104
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,640
One by one?

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,520
Choose for others not for yourself.

106
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,280
Only four for one person.

107
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,880
Right.

108
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,040
They took mine.

109
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,200
This is for Bai Yu.

110
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
It's OK. They are all yours.

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,320
Don't worry.

112
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,200
All right.

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,480
Think about it.

114
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,520
What are you doing? Open your eyes?

115
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,080
I asked you to choose first.

116
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,400
Stick it on the back first.

117
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,640
OK, stick it on the back first.

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,920
It's not.

119
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,560
That's enough.

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
Okay, since we're all glued to the back,

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,760
let's have the five of you turn around

122
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,520
and see what labels we have behind us?

123
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,240
It's true that Yu stands out.

124
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,960
OK, five of you, turn around.

125
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,880
Let's start with Zhou Keyu.

126
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,640
Let me see what's coming after him.

127
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,680
He has an inspiration contributor.

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,880
Who pasted this?

129
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,600
I pasted it.

130
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Yes, because he's always witty

131
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,400
and make some correct suggestions.

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,040
And he can react quickly.

133
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,760
His quick brain

134
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,520
yes, his reasoning ability is strong.

135
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,960
Yes.

136
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,480
So this "younger brother in the family"

137
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,640
I put it on.

138
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,880
Because he's the youngest.

139
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,480
Then who is he?

140
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,680
I pasted it.

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,320
His reasoning ability is really good.

142
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,840
Thank you.

143
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Is it after two seasons of training

144
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,760
that's right.

145
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,040
They are old gamers after all.

146
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,800
Zhou Keyu hasn't posted one yet.

147
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,240
Choose one.

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,000
Choose one for him.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
Okay, I'll choose one for him.

150
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,120
Let him choose one.

151
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,240
This Pushover is...

152
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
You're not taking it?

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Maybe I am, but...

154
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,480
What is "Browser Personality"?

155
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,200
I think Browser Personality

156
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
he has a photographic memory.

157
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,440
It seems that my brain works well.

158
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
I don't know if that's true.

159
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,880
It seems that in his heart,

160
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,040
are clever to use.

161
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,120
Right.

162
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,040
OK. Let's see what we have

163
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,960
the rest?

164
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,080
What?

165
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,000
The obvious one is Hero Standing in Light.

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Who put up this?

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,280
Come on, Liu Yuning, let's turn around.

168
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,760
Who gave me the "kid brother"?

169
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,440
It's me.

170
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,120
This Hero Standing in Light is

171
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,040
I posted it.

172
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,600
Well, Brother Yu, tell us.

173
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,440
He's a light in the dark.

174
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,920
Right.

175
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
Who said that a hero stands in the light, right?

176
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,200
And this "Kid"?

177
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
I posted the "Kid."

178
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,760
Why?

179
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,640
Brother Kid is like this.

180
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,080
Brother Kid means a great gamer.

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Really?

182
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,720
But kids

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,400
It's not limited to age.

184
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,120
It doesn't have to be a child.

185
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,000
It just means he's a very advanced player.

186
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,440
I thought Liu Yuning

187
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,440
was on the way.

188
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
Some helpless sides.

189
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
Like children.

190
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,480
Yes. His meaning

191
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,840
I'm as bold as a kid.

192
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,760
That's the point.

193
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,400
It's possible.

194
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Let's watch it on the air.

195
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,400
Alright.

196
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
You dropped your friend.

197
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,160
Okay, who posted this "conspicuous package"?

198
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,960
I pasted it.

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,400
What's up

200
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,200
that I embarrassed myself.

201
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Come on.

202
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,400
This is good.

203
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,920
It's...

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,600
What?

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
Because...

206
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
I almost revealed the secret.

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,200
Was the last character he appeared

208
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,560
In a variety show.

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,120
And do the cleaning

210
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
and even did the cleaning.

211
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Right.

212
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
High-visibility bag.

213
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
So he's a plain bag.

214
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,680
Got it.

215
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,200
So, this Lone Ranger

216
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
this is me.

217
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,760
Right, bro?

218
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,200
Ning, are you calm?

219
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,040
I can't believe you saw through my inner strength.

220
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,960
Right.

221
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,200
I put this on

222
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,360
It's Ning who always leads us

223
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,280
every time.

224
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,960
I didn't expect that this is the secret of Kid Brother

225
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
It is Lone Giant Tank.

226
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
Yes.

227
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Okay, let's see what's behind Dilreba.

228
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,760
"Brother and Sister Trap" and "Human Capibara."

229
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Who posted the Human Capibara?

230
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,280
It's me.

231
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,680
What does that mean?

232
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,240
"Human Capibara" is actually very simple.

233
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
It means she's cute.

234
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,040
Right.

235
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,520
Why didn't you just call her cute?

236
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
Because it wasn't on the label.

237
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Got it.

238
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,920
What is the hard-control logic?

239
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,840
I put it on.

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,760
Right.

241
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,440
Sis Ba is really

242
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
her logic is

243
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,760
how to put it?

244
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
She's awesome.

245
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,680
Make them win.

246
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Is a very thoughtful way of thinking.

247
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,320
Right.

248
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,840
Nothing.

249
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,280
After that, I got all wrong!

250
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,320
There was a reversal!

251
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,080
Right.

252
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,720
Got it.

253
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,600
And then there's the Reasoning Cabbage.

254
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,160
I put it up.

255
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,120
Because it sounds cute.

256
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
That's why I posted the video.

257
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,320
My understanding is that

258
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,280
she can turn inside out.

259
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,720
Involution, right.

260
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,240
Right.

261
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes.

262
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Right.

263
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,800
Because we have

264
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,600
she has been

265
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,120
no.

266
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,040
She'd go back every round to find the evidence.

267
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
We both gave up. She's going back for another round.

268
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
She was serious.

269
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,800
Even immersed in the character.

270
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,880
Got it. I understand.

271
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,160
Because our Dilraba is like

272
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
first time participating in a mystery show

273
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,120
I'd better do my best.

274
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,760
Right.

275
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,200
There must be some pressure.

276
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,480
No pressure.

277
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,320
There was no pressure to play games.

278
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,400
We just made mistakes meticulously.

279
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,320
Right.

280
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,440
And then we have another one

281
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,640
brother and Sister Trap.

282
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,600
Yes, I put this up.

283
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,360
We Tuizhen residents, old and young,

284
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,160
no matter male or female, young or old, all like Dilraba very much.

285
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,280
Exactly.

286
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,600
Then why did Brother Yu

287
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,840
why do you have six labels?

288
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,920
You put the labels on yourself.

289
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,840
You created a character image

290
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,240
I can't stand you.

291
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,200
Come on, let's help Yu

292
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,240
on the front.

293
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,040
Let's see what these are.

294
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,880
I see a

295
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,120
(Gu Zi Killer) the sunflower seeds killer.

296
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,040
Who pasted this?

297
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
I pasted them.

298
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,520
The reason?

299
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,960
Because he often nips melon seeds.

300
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,440
He was cracking melon seeds all the time.

301
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,360
He was cracking melon seeds whenever I saw him.

302
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,480
I was wondering why there are fewer and fewer

303
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
more and more melon seeds?

304
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah, he's the one who finished

305
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,520
I was thinking,

306
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,400
when I ate melon seeds,

307
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
another one is named "Prop Killer."

308
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,960
Who put this on?

309
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
I pasted it. It should be

310
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,240
right.

311
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
He doesn't only crack melon seeds, he does other things as well.

312
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,920
Actually this is the case

313
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,400
he's used to reasoning

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
have some possible logic

315
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,880
move faster

316
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,640
to move your mouth.

317
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,560
I don't know whether you

318
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
I don't know if you've watched

319
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,240
the First Season?

320
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,760
In fact, Brother Bai in the first season was already very good.

321
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,680
In this season, Bai is totally 2.0.

322
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,000
Very accurate.

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
I was so good in Season 1?

324
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,880
I was great.

325
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,920
Alright.

326
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,960
Who posted the "master practical joke"?

327
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,920
It seems to be me.

328
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,280
Does Brother Yu always scare you guys?

329
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,000
But he's not as scary as the last one.

330
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,440
Right.

331
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
Last season, most of

332
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,680
80% of our show's horror

333
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,160
of our show's horrible plots came from him.

334
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,960
But he didn't contribute much this season.

335
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
It's a little simple.

336
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,680
It was supposed to be a terrifying season.

337
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,480
It was scary, right?

338
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,480
And we have enough expectations.

339
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,160
One more thing.

340
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,440
Human-shaped Hakimi.

341
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,520
You posted that yourself, right?

342
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
No, I did that.

343
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,120
Is what?

344
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,840
Because I think brother Bai is cute too.

345
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Everything is cute in your eyes.

346
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,240
So I put this on him.

347
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,960
Got it.

348
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,640
There is another one on brother Bai.

349
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,520
The Pushy Beauty is...

350
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,400
Who put this?

351
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,680
I did that.

352
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,800
It's just that you're beautiful,

353
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,800
yes, you're beautiful.

354
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,600
That's beautiful

355
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
you're the beauty of our Mystery Team

356
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,280
Is you.

357
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Not only handsome,

358
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,200
and the Discovery Commando

359
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
Is a brave label.

360
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,480
I put this on.

361
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
I have nothing to stick on.

362
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,960
I see brother Bai as my "enemy."

363
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
You know?

364
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
It's your "enemy."

365
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Yes, so I didn't find a good one.

366
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,480
So I posted a "Special Investigator."

367
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,200
In this show,

368
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,680
he was "pua" by our teacher Bai.

369
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,400
Yeah, I was fooled by him.

370
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
I told him not to

371
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,200
on the kids.

372
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
Don't record variety shows anymore.

373
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,120
What's wrong with me?

374
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,920
No.

375
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Isn't that fun?

376
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,240
Come on then.

377
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,760
Zhang Linghe, turn around and take a look.

378
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
What are the labels?

379
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm the one who put "Sometimes Crazy."

380
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,560
But why?

381
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Because the nickname he has

382
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,360
from this variety show to

383
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,040
I always say

384
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,840
become a clown.

385
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,480
Is the character she acts.

386
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,800
I usually shoot "Loopy."

387
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,040
I see

388
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,440
the Pushing Skylark is...

389
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,960
Why is his singing good?

390
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,080
Yeah, just describe him as good at singing.

391
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,920
These two are the same thing?

392
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,400
I thought you were the one who made

393
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,360
with the camera.

394
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,680
No.

395
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
I think it's because of my singing voice.

396
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
Because my singing is outstanding.

397
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:58,960
That's right.

398
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,480
So, everybody,

399
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,040
listen to the timbre. Yes.

400
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,800
That's right.

401
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Very beautiful.

402
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
It's profound.

403
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm sure this "mobile KTV"

404
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm the one who posted it.

405
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Yeah, I can always hear it.

406
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
He sings well beside me.

407
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,800
Yes. Show your voice anytime, anywhere.

408
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,320
That's right.

409
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,400
It's Yuning's certification.

410
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Yes. That's awesome.

411
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,040
The decibel level machine

412
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
I think it has something to do with screaming.

413
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,000
Because I didn't know

414
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,080
I don't know how your guts looked like.

415
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,840
And this season,

416
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,360
It's probably a little bit more creepy than the last one.

417
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,280
So sometimes,

418
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,080
I could hear the screams.

419
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,720
Including

420
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,920
Is mine.

421
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,400
It's mine.

422
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,080
You did scream as often as you wanted.

423
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,720
Yes, I am.

424
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
Okay, you're right.

425
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,160
But I bet this one looks cute on you too.

426
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,120
Cute?

427
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,920
Through

428
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
wonderful description and sharing,

429
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
and full of expectation.

430
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
And watch our show.

431
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,480
Well, in addition to these tags,

432
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,400
I got a special label

433
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,040
on my hand.

434
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,760
To be special?

435
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,240
This one.

436
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,040
"Heli Moyu"

437
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
I heard that this is

438
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,600
the second season of Start Reasoning.

439
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,320
Your new group name, right?

440
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,960
I'd like to ask Liu Yuning to give us a brief introduction

441
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,880
the reason of the name

442
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,080
and the little story behind it

443
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
It's really twisted and strange, really.

444
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,440
Actually, this name is

445
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,560
the two of them

446
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
they are our first group name

447
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,840
let's have a group name.

448
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,880
And they're the ones who made

449
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,240
so one called Zhang Linghe

450
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,560
the other is called Dilraba.

451
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,440
So it's Heli.

452
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,800
Moyu is the three of us.

453
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,680
Bai Yu, Liu Yu and Zhou Keyu,

454
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,560
they touched us all the time.

455
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,080
Hugging our thighs.

456
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,600
But actually

457
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,000
because I don't know how to play.

458
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,080
Yeah, it has a homophonic sound

459
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,760
we're supposed to

460
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,040
okay. Thank you for your sharing.

461
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,240
So besides the residents here,

462
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,360
there is also a new resident coming of Push Town!

463
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,680
Please welcome our flying player!

464
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
Jing Jin!

465
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,080
Thank you, residents.

466
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,480
I'm Jin Jing, a migrant from Pushdown.

467
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,160
Alright, let's welcome our mentor Jing Jin.

468
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,040
Welcome.

469
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,800
Mr. Jin Jing also saw it.

470
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
Every Tuizhen resident has

471
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
has a different label.

472
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,600
So, please help me

473
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,360
of the upcoming second season

474
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
of Reasoning.

475
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,360
You're creating a new

476
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,240
for yourself.

477
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,040
Okay, the labels are all taken.

478
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,160
No, you can take the ones on us.

479
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,680
Pick which one you like.

480
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,920
My "Pushing Beauty" has been removed.

481
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,800
I'd better take it from here.

482
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,840
Give it to the Pushover.

483
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,240
This one.

484
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,400
"They're all equipped with Bluetooth."

485
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,440
My reasoning belongs to the Talk Nonsense Branch.

486
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,720
Got it.

487
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,880
But there's order in chaos.

488
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,760
Right.

489
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,800
You must talk to Dilreba then.

490
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
And the wrong person.

491
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,480
I was unfortunately missed in the previous recordings.

492
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,240
But my little brother Zhang Linghe

493
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
asked me every day if I would come.

494
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,920
He asked me many times a month if I would come.

495
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,120
Until yesterday, I confirmed my coming.

496
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,880
And he said, "Where are you? What time is your flight?"

497
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,600
Did he get on the bus?

498
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,960
Since I got married.

499
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,360
Is he so sticky?

500
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,760
But so sticky.

501
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,760
I asked her every day because...

502
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm really suffering in this show

503
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,080
I wish she could come to save me.

504
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,000
If she comes, I may not be at the bottom.

505
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,080
Just call it in.

506
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,480
Call someone.

507
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,520
Call your friends.

508
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
Call them to support the scene.

509
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,920
To support everyone.

510
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,560
Or he's asking you to provide support.

511
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
We'll see.

512
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,480
Alright. A very warm welcome

513
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,680
welcome Jin Jing to Push Town.

514
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,560
From the games they played,

515
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
I believe all the residents here

516
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,040
you are curious about

517
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,760
about your performances on the show.

518
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,000
I can't wait for the first time

519
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,760
why don't we start the

520
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,800
for residents to ask questions?

521
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,920
To ask questions.

522
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,160
And communicate with the Mystery Team on the stage.

523
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Please raise your hands.

524
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:01,960
Is there anyone?

525
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,960
OK.

526
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,320
Zebra.

527
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:05,880
Hello.

528
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,960
Let me ask you something.

529
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,680
Hello.

530
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,160
Miss Bai Yu.

531
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,840
I heard that you like to crack melon seeds on the spot.

532
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,360
No.

533
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,520
Was this a particular kind of inspiration for you?

534
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,360
Or is it

535
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,680
yes, you're right.

536
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,760
When I ate the prop,

537
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,680
I was thinking,

538
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
It helps me use my brain.

539
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,640
Right.

540
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,240
Here's a melon seed pillow.

541
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,720
And wish you win in this show

542
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,000
alright, thank you.

543
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,720
I really like it.

544
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,160
Alright

545
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,320
can you do this, Brother Yu?

546
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,760
Do it slowly.

547
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Slow.

548
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
Alright.

549
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,400
Thank you for the question raised by our resident.

550
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
Any other residents would like to ask questions?

551
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,480
Okay. The girl in white.

552
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,800
I want to give Zhou Keyu a blanket.

553
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,200
I hope Tietan

554
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
I can take care of all the older brothers and sisters

555
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
to take care of you

556
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,840
protect you.

557
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,520
Can I have it?

558
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Here's the blanket.

559
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,320
Thanks.

560
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,960
He has been mediocre this season.

561
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,400
This season

562
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,560
It's a little too scary, because

563
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
I hope you can bring a blanket

564
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,680
and protect you.

565
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,520
Alright.

566
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,760
I know you've been bold.

567
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,480
So, in this season's experience,

568
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,080
have you ever been scared?

569
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,520
Very few.

570
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,520
Not much.

571
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,840
Why are you sweating?

572
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,920
Very little.

573
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Against my will.

574
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,520
No.

575
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,760
It's a little more creepy than the last season.

576
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,440
But it's not that bad.

577
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,800
Right.

578
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,560
Men always need to

579
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,120
I need to save face outside.

580
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,760
Okay. Thank you.

581
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,120
Thank you.

582
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,840
Any other residents who would like to ask

583
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,560
I saw everyone giving gifts.

584
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,040
So I prepared a present

585
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,600
for Liu Yuning.

586
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,320
When we saw the first season of Start Reasoning,

587
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,280
every day,

588
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,520
keep one thing in his hand every day.

589
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,160
What is it?

590
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,800
Torch.

591
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,160
That's right.

592
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,560
And this season I gave you

593
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,200
an oversized flashlight to you.

594
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,160
Thank you so much.

595
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,000
Great.

596
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,600
This should be good for a long distance, right?

597
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
Yes, this is the kind of camera that

598
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,680
when you walk along the street in the dark.

599
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
OK. Thank you.

600
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,040
Thank you.

601
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
I just want to ask

602
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
when Mr. Liu Yuning

603
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,320
said in a live stream

604
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,040
the second season of Start Speculation is not scary this time

605
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,600
It's mediocre.

606
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,080
So after the real experience of Season 2 this time,

607
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,120
how is it?

608
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,200
This season was more terrifying than the last.

609
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,320
This is an unforgettable experience.

610
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,440
An unforgettable experience?

611
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,240
What do you think of the terrifying setting

612
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,760
for this season?

613
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,280
The idea is to try not to be so scary.

614
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,960
Right.

615
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,440
It's good to be relaxed.

616
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,200
Right.

617
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
OK, thank you.

618
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,520
Any other residents who would like to have questions?

619
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,160
Come on, sister in blue.

620
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,080
I want to give a gift to Ms. Jin Jing.

621
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,000
Thank you.

622
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Mentors, guess what it can do.

623
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,720
It reminds everyone who is sleeping to wake up.

624
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,120
This is to shake it

625
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,840
you can shake it

626
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,200
and ask everyone to help.

627
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,840
Or if you find a new clue,

628
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
ask everyone

629
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,040
oK. I think the second use is better.

630
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,760
Because I'm afraid no one will come to help me.

631
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,280
Because I heard that people were busy with their own concerns

632
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,360
mentor, who would you like to team up with?

633
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,880
I want to team up with Ke.

634
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,760
He looks calm and calm.

635
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,880
What do you mean?

636
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,200
You lied about what you said, right?

637
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,400
It's your first time that you're so scared

638
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,400
to comment on others' comments.

639
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,120
Alright.

640
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,400
Alright.

641
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,360
I hope Jin Jing can get this bell

642
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,400
and bring the bell to you.

643
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,240
Alright.

644
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
Anyone else would like to

645
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,240
alright.

646
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,760
I prepared a music box

647
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,120
rotating Niuniu music box.

648
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,440
Spin the Niu Ox

649
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,240
thank you.

650
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,440
I hope he can do Reasoning later

651
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,680
when you're in trouble,

652
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,640
to turn the tide.

653
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,320
Alright.

654
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,200
I usually saw that you've shared

655
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,520
during the recording,

656
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,880
I totally fell apart

657
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,680
from breakdown to enjoyment.

658
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
To share with us

659
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,240
why there was such a transition

660
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,080
when I first came to this show,

661
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,480
I thought I would do the investigation like a fish in water.

662
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,920
But now I meet people like Mr. Bai Yu

663
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,400
who played me.

664
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,880
Then I collapsed.

665
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,200
And then I found it was still very interesting.

666
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,720
Because everyone was using their heads. = Tutoring section =

667
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,800
Because everyone's thinking.

668
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,960
I was so excited the whole night.

669
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,840
I hope you like it.

670
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,720
OK.

671
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,600
Thank you.

672
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,160
OK. Thank you.

673
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,320
Come on, we have

674
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,040
please.

675
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,520
To Dilreba. Hello.

676
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,400
From the show.

677
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
Even at night,

678
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,280
you can run in heels.

679
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,040
You look beautiful and steady.

680
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,240
That's why I want to give you a pair of crystal heels.

681
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
I hope that in the future

682
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,480
walk along the path with a beautiful face.

683
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,040
Thank you.

684
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,880
And I have another small question.

685
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,080
When the shoe

686
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,440
will these heels affect your

687
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,080
when the lights were off?

688
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,520
It doesn't seem that way

689
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
because without high heels,

690
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
they might walk more slowly.

691
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:19,880
All right.

692
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,600
We also hope you can keep playing

693
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
and win all the time.

694
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,680
Thanks.

695
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,280
If Liu Yuning shines the light on the crystal shoes,

696
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,600
will it give out that brilliant light?

697
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,040
It's like opening a password.

698
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,520
It's so bright.

699
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,640
Alright.

700
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Let's thank the new residents for their questions

701
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,080
for your questions and your sharing.

702
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,880
We look forward to seeing the film.

703
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,320
That's all for the interaction between the new residents.

704
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,760
Let's welcome the flying players first.

705
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,720
Thank you.

706
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,240
Thanks.

707
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
So Dilraba and Zhang Linghe

708
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,680
as white players,

709
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,880
this is my first time participating in a mystery show.

710
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,560
Is there anything you'd like to say?

711
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,600
Before I joined the game,

712
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,160
I'd never played such a game before.

713
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,480
So I thought that my brain was not enough.

714
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,640
But because of the company of three old players

715
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,520
and inspired us.

716
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,680
So we're quickly able to learn

717
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,080
how to have fun

718
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,360
how to have fun

719
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,720
or how to

720
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,520
on the stage.

721
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,840
Right.

722
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
We had a good time.

723
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,920
We had a good time.

724
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,200
Okay, thank you, Dilreba.

725
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,360
What about Zhang Linghe?

726
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,760
He blamed himself for being too young.

727
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
And was hit by the reality.

728
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,040
By Mr. Bai Yu and Mr. Liu Yuning,

729
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,720
by Mr. Zhou Keyu and hit me hard.

730
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,640
We have to be more mature.

731
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
You have to learn from them.

732
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
I treat you well.

733
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,360
Are there any stories

734
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
that's our behind the scenes story

735
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,680
to share with you.

736
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,320
By the way, I would like to introduce

737
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,480
the second season of Speculation

738
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,000
actually, Zhang Linghe and Reba

739
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,240
they are new players,

740
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,880
but the two of them are actually very good at this.

741
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,240
You will know when it's aired.

742
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,280
Your intuition and logic

743
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
they would get the accuracy a lot of times.

744
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,840
The kind of rapid progress

745
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,120
yeah. Anyway, you're basically good.

746
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,320
I look forward to it.

747
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
Is there anything Liu Yuning would like to share?

748
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,920
Zhang Linghe and Dilraba are new players.

749
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,840
But I've always felt this.

750
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,560
They've got much clearer

751
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,200
than in the first season.

752
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,080
And their very cute faces.

753
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,160
And I hope you can look forward to them.

754
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
And watch our show.

755
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,040
I think we'll see more interesting scenes

756
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,160
you'll see more interesting scenes.

757
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,760
Thanks.

758
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,040
I think everyone is having a good time.

759
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,320
So I think it works well.

760
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,440
And everyone expects

761
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,960
It was hard

762
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
but everyone was having a good time.

763
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,120
And having a good time.

764
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
Then you can go to the official film to see

765
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,240
although the five of us

766
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
standing here,

767
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,720
but it's different in variety shows.

768
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,960
Isn't there a group soul?

769
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,760
We do.

770
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,280
But this group soul is built

771
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,920
got it.

772
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
There's no making without breaking

773
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,520
that's right.

774
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Thank you for your sharing.

775
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,440
Due to time constraints,

776
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
the Mystery Team has to go to Tuizhen

777
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
for a mission.

778
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,280
We have to say goodbye to you now.

779
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,360
Let's prepare to carry out our task.

780
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,560
