1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,000
There are so many handsome guys and beautiful girls here.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
Hit follow so you won't get lost.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,080
This streamer will take you on the fast track.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,920
Those two green gems of yours.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,880
Look like what my grandma wore.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,480
What green gems?

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,160
Watch your words, I'm telling you.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,440
How come your clothes can glow?

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,240
This won't run out of power in a day, will it?

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
Because I

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,040
am the real detective.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,440
Then you don't need to play.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,240
What's left to play then?

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,360
No need to play anymore, we've won.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,160
Today's X

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,720
is most likely among the civilians.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,920
He wants to change this world.

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,640
Even wants to change

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,680
the rules of our show's game.

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,760
Everything exists only in his illusion.

21
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,800
The killer.

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,920
Couldn't possibly be me now.

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
I said it wasn't me, yet he kept voting for me.

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,840
Carried over to this season.

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,320
He still holds a grudge against me.

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,840
Always thinks I'm suspicious.

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,880
Why do you have this thing?

28
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,640
I want to eat one.

29
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,560
Can you give me one?

30
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
I found it.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,320
Okay

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,120
I am a great artist

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,560
The dolls I create are priceless

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,160
Getting into character

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Face it head-on and step out

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,720
Okay

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,760
Okay

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,880
Still have to drive it myself

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,400
Where did it go?

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,320
Let me see if this fits.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
It doesn't fit well.

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
Doesn't fit.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,200
No.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,160
I don't want to hold it either.

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I'll take this loose cake.

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,120
Keep it in.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,160
Do you have pockets?

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,840
Thank you.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,200
I have pants pockets.

51
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
No problem, I do.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
I heard you guys yesterday...

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
Some people did something.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,240
Some people yesterday...

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,440
Already booked the entire tenth season.

56
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,640
There are so many handsome guys and pretty girls here.

57
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,200
How are you filming a vlog here?

58
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,120
My profession is online streaming.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
Scan this QR code later.

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,720
Hit follow.

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,360
Follow me and you won't get lost.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
This streamer will take you on the fast lane.

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,600
This is my QR code.

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,360
Scan it.

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,800
What does this scan show?

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,360
We don't know each other.

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
I just saw you...

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
I didn't say I know you.

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,560
It's me.

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
I feel like this episode of ours...

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,040
Will be quite scary.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,920
What do you mean?

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,560
Scary? You mean ghosts?

74
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,480
Your persona.

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,040
Is there anything different about it?

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,920
Yes.

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Right, I do too.

78
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,680
I just think it's quite scary.

79
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,200
But this is okay, right?

80
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,800
Is it?

81
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
As long as it's not the scary kind...

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Then it's fine.

83
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,600
It is the scary kind.

84
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,080
But we won't scare each other.

85
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,160
What, can you turn into a ghost or something?

86
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
How do you know I can't?

87
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
You can't.

88
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,080
You, Zhang Jiawei...

89
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
Zhang Jiawei can turn into ghosts too.

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Edward Scissorhands

91
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,200
Show me

92
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,160
Open your hand

93
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,520
I'll stab you to death with this today

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,360
Little killer

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,880
Today, you're the only one I know

96
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,400
Thank you

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,120
Thank you

98
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,480
How come your clothes can still glow?

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,160
It won't run out of power today, will it?

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,080
Because I am the real detective.

101
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
Let me take a look at that doll.

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,960
What is all this?

103
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,120
The doll will pop out any moment now.

104
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,960
That's the one

105
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,680
Then I'll check its introduction later, right?

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,640
This is the butler doll

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,200
This is the assistant doll

108
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,040
This is the security guard doll

109
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
That's all

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,480
There's more below, right?

111
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,240
This is the beauty doll

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,160
Today our personas don't know each other

113
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,800
Right?

114
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,040
No

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,960
Not really

116
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,600
No, I know

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
I don't actually know you

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,480
But I know you

119
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,920
Of course, I'm so famous

120
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,080
You must know me

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm a celebrity

122
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,000
You should recognize me

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Alright, alright

124
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Little murderer

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,320
Right off the bat,

126
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,560
you keep calling everyone "little murderer," huh?

127
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
When have I ever not done this?

128
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,560
You're the murderer

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,040
Exactly

130
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
So my stuff is more complicated

131
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
What's with your neck today?

132
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,160
What do you mean?

133
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,720
Why is your neck so stiff?

134
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,720
Your neck is still stiff today

135
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Because I don't dare move

136
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,880
Otherwise it might fall off

137
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,080
Those two emeralds of yours

138
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,000
Look like something my grandma would wear

139
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,640
What emeralds?

140
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,400
The two dangling from your ears

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,840
These are...

142
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,920
You...

143
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Zhang Jiawei, I've noticed you're too...

144
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,440
Today I'm calling you Zhang Jiawei

145
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,200
I don't care anymore

146
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,640
So annoying

147
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,000
Little Wei

148
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,960
What are you laughing at?

149
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Watch yourself

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,760
Let me tell you

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,200
Can't this light up?

152
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,960
This should be able to light up

153
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,120
Why isn't it lighting up?

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,640
Can this light up?

155
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,720
I didn't know this could light up

156
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,280
This fiber optic...

157
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,120
glowing fiber strips

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
This definitely can light up

159
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
Hurry up and make it glow

160
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
Quick, make it light up

161
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,680
Let me check the back

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,320
Is there a switch for this?

163
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
There must be a switch

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,760
I'll ask them later

165
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,640
I'll ask in a moment

166
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,080
I don't know

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,160
I thought this was how it's supposed to be

168
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,360
So you stay up late every night

169
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
playing this game?

170
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,320
Yes

171
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,680
Seriously?

172
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Yeah

173
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
What do you think?

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
You're so boring

175
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,880
What the heck

176
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,000
He stays up every night just playing this game

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,040
The construction type, right?

178
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,520
The grass-cutting kind

179
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,480
And he doesn't even spend money on it

180
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,760
Just watches ads to revive, basically

181
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,520
This is called wasting a minute of your lifespan

182
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,160
Just to get a double reward

183
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,240
So, who's the main suspect today?

184
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Can't tell right now

185
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,120
No idea

186
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
Really can't tell at the moment

187
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,760
We're playing at a higher level today

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Not happening

189
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,840
Nope, no skill at all

190
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,880
Tough opponents, each gets an X

191
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,920
Not an X, but a deduction

192
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,640
Let me tell you how it is today

193
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
I predict

194
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Two killers plus an X

195
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,560
3 vs 2 battle

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,240
Okay

197
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,440
Two killers plus an X

198
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,080
Then there's no point playing

199
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,840
What's left to play then?

200
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
No need to play, we've already won

201
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
Not necessarily

202
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Then the killers can only lose by tie vote

203
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,520
Because there are three votes

204
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,840
Then how do we play?

205
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,200
Isn't that just like our previous round?

206
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,960
And we all have to vote correctly

207
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,600
If there are two killers

208
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,400
How would you know

209
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
That new players won't join midway?

210
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
Bro, are you joking?

211
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,840
How would new players even join?

212
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Meaning NPCs play with us

213
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,800
Right after you returned to your room yesterday

214
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,000
You contacted new people, right?

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes

216
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,240
Impressive

217
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,600
This game is so boring.

218
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,360
This game...

219
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,160
Is this the kind...

220
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
...of WeChat mini-program game?

221
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
Yes.

222
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,480
It's a battle game, right?

223
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,040
You recruit troops...

224
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,960
...then battle against them.

225
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,920
He recruits troops and battles them.

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,800
There used to be...

227
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,480
I played one before...

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
...called "Caveman Evolution."

229
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
Dilraba...

230
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,880
Seems like I'm the only one missing.

231
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,600
Today you're Babe.

232
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
Babe.

233
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,560
Babe.

234
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,520
Okay, later then.

235
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,960
Okay.

236
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,520
Alrighty.

237
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,760
What is this thing?

238
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
None of your business

239
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
You know exactly what's going on

240
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,360
What the hell

241
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,920
Of course

242
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,600
I’ve known for ages

243
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,280
No one knows better than you what this is

244
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,080
Dog spine

245
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,240
What? Dog what?

246
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,920
Dog spine

247
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,440
Dog spine? What even is that?

248
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,760
Dog spine

249
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,000
Solomon’s seal, bezoar, garlic

250
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,880
What’s up?

251
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,200
What’s so funny?

252
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
Just looking at you makes me laugh

253
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,320
You remind me of Shen Teng

254
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,040
The summer of passionate love

255
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,800
In the evening breeze, I finally met you

256
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,120
Only then did I understand love is—

257
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,440
Oh my god

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,960
Your clothes are dragging on the floor

259
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,080
Then who can wear it?

260
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,880
It’s supposed to drag like this

261
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
It’s this long?

262
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,760
Come in

263
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Handsome guy, you need to work out.

264
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,280
Come on.

265
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,040
Open sesame.

266
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,840
I'm always the last one to close up every time.

267
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Do you know

268
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,120
Here we go

269
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,680
Come on, brothers

270
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,640
Cheer up

271
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
Stay alert

272
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,840
Stay extra vigilant

273
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,440
Open up

274
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
Sit next to me today.

275
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,920
What are you trying to do? You keep...

276
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,320
Today's X

277
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Most likely among the civilians.

278
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,920
X is among the civilians.

279
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
I just said—today, there are two culprits.

280
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,320
Has this ever happened before?

281
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
Among the civilians.

282
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,680
He's talking nonsense! He's just—

283
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,080
A civilian can actually be X?

284
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,880
He wants to change the world.

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,560
Even wants to alter...

286
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,080
the rules of this show's game.

287
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Already...

288
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,640
Everything exists only in his illusion.

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,480
Right, he's delusional, he's...

290
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,080
You forgot

291
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,000
Delusional disorder

292
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,440
Prone to delusions, wishful thinking

293
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,360
Killer

294
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,040
Me

295
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,200
It could never be me

296
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Not necessarily

297
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,840
Alright alright

298
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,480
If it's Reba, that'd be too obvious

299
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,400
If it's who?

300
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
Reba

301
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,880
If it's her, wouldn't that be too obvious?

302
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,680
It's definitely her.

303
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,320
It can't be that straightforward.

304
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,800
If it's too obvious, all the audience would guess it.

305
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,320
I think there's logic behind this.

306
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,320
Think about it, if it were her

307
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,400
then

308
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,240
it would make perfect sense, wouldn't it?

309
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm not X today.

310
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I know you're not.

311
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,080
Just let you focus on finding the killer.

312
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,800
Right, so don't worry.

313
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,880
I'll definitely track him down.

314
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,040
It's just that we might...

315
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,360
Anyway, you make the final call.

316
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,640
We'll vote for whoever you vote for.

317
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,360
Alright.

318
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
Last season you all

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,920
Just last season

320
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,000
What gameplay did Keyu mention?

321
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,280
What kind of gameplay was that?

322
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,160
Last season's so-called killer

323
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,440
Didn't even know they were the killer

324
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,720
That person

325
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Zhou Shen

326
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
He didn't know he was the killer

327
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,320
Have you been suffering today?

328
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm about to die!

329
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
Since when did you know?

330
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,040
The day before yesterday

331
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
That's why he's acting so strange today

332
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm not acting strange

333
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,080
I'm just afraid of the dark

334
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,360
And I can't figure it out

335
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
It's just that we've been

336
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,120
There's a mysterious person

337
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,520
Who is this mysterious person?

338
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,120
Indeed

339
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,880
If we told him from the start

340
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,040
He'd feel pressured, I'm telling you

341
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,360
He couldn't handle it

342
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,120
He wouldn't be able to play

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,720
Then we wouldn't need to record these 10 episodes

344
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
And last season he voted for me

345
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
In the end

346
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,640
Right

347
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,600
Only the two of them voted wrong

348
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,160
Everyone else voted correctly

349
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,880
I said it wasn't me

350
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,920
Yet he kept voting for me

351
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,840
Continuing into this season

352
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
He still holds a grudge against me

353
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,880
Always thinks I'm suspicious

354
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,640
Just keeps voting relentlessly

355
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,320
As long as he's not the detective, vote for him

356
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,960
There's no such thing as a detective

357
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,640
We were all detectives back then

358
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,840
Now I'm the detective

359
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,960
Still vote me as X

360
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,960
Gotta cast that vote

361
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,600
Your whole hand will get warm if you put it on

362
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,200
You mean this?

363
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,160
It gets warm after touching for a while

364
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,320
It won't get hot

365
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,520
But it can detect your bones

366
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes, that's the contact surface

367
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,960
I know

368
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,480
When I was little, I bought this for classmates

369
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
As a birthday gift

370
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,080
It makes sounds

371
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,000
See, it makes that sizzling sound

372
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,640
Who's stepping on me?

373
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,520
Let's all wait here for a moment

374
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,320
It'll be ready soon

375
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,840
Come try it quickly

376
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,040
Might need to adjust the seasoning

377
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,040
Not bad

378
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
Delicious

379
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,280
This is really tasty

380
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,040
I can finally stop using my brain

381
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,680
Seems like

382
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Makes it sound like I'm always using my brain

383
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,560
I haven't been using my brain constantly either

384
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,480
I need to take off my clothes

385
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,000
Tastes a little sweet

386
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,920
Too sweet

387
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,200
It's supposed to be a sugar-free protein bar

388
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,600
For working out

389
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,200
It is sugar-free, a protein bar

390
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,560
That's better then

391
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,120
Even putting your hand like this gives a shock

392
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,760
Right

393
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,600
No way

394
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Seriously, I got shocked

395
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,600
You guys won't

396
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,480
It won't

397
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:34,880
No

398
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,320
Rub your hair on it

399
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,760
Then the current on your hand

400
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,000
Will get stronger

401
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,440
Makes your hair stand up

402
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,560
You just washed your hair yesterday

403
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,840
Dandruff is falling

404
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,800
Seems like it won't

405
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,000
Like wearing a head covering

406
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,800
Why do you have this?

407
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,600
I want one too

408
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Can you give me one?

409
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,480
I found it

410
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,920
Where did you find it?

411
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,280
Help me find one

412
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,080
By the elevator just now

413
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm starving

414
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,360
No need, it's not that bad

415
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,600
Okay, I'll stand here

416
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,640
Come on players, let's start deducing.

417
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,120
Unlock each level.

418
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,480
Face the dialogue with courage.

419
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,720
Is Bai Yu here?

420
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
Four door guardians, right?

421
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,400
The four great door guardians.

422
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,680
Can't we sit?

423
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
No, everyone stands.

424
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,840
Stand here.

425
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,320
I'll stand here.

426
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,440
Yes, move closer to Teacher Zhang Linghe.

427
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,760
A little further back, good.

428
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,440
Right.

429
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,240
Good.

430
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,240
Where do I stand?

431
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,160
Here.

432
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,560
Why are you pushing me?

433
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,640
Lean on me.

434
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,560
What do you mean?

435
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
Still playing this game?

436
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,040
Face the dialogue with courage.

437
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,320
Then Teacher Bai Yu...

438
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,200
Turn your body slightly toward Reba.

439
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,240
Yes, good.

440
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,640
He's still mad at me.

441
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,760
I'm not mad at you.

442
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,960
I'm mad at him.

443
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,480
What did I do?

444
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,120
Come on, everyone.

445
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,800
Look at me.

446
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,760
Three, two, one.

447
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,560
Teacher Bai Yu...

448
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
You can also move slightly forward.

449
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,880
Yes, face this way.

450
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,080
Teacher Zhou Keyu.

451
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,960
So this is how you two are

452
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,280
Okay, good, come on

453
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,600
Everyone, look at me, come on

454
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,080
Teacher Bai Yu, spread your feet a bit wider

455
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,120
Last one

456
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
Yes, feet toward me, stretch your feet toward me

457
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,760
Stretch toward you

458
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,920
Yes, good, that's fine

459
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,680
Good

460
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,840
Ready, three two one, go

461
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
What?

462
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,400
Good work everyone, thank you teachers

463
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Thank you

464
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I was originally thinking

465
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,280
I could tiptoe with my feet back here

466
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,040
Right

467
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,720
Then you told me to spread my feet

468
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
And stretch them forward

469
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
I could only do this

470
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,720
I'm already shorter now

471
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,960
Do we have to go back to that prison?

472
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,640
You woke up, right? Continuing from yesterday.

473
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you remember the end of season one?

474
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,160
Just call it "Goose."

475
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,000
What do you mean?

476
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,920
Zhou Shen is called "Goose."

477
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,680
Hello

478
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
This friend

479
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,480
Little Goose

480
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,680
Wasn't it that person

481
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,600
Zhu Xudan said

482
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,760
The goose said something

483
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,520
Remember?

484
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:22,920
Got it

485
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,520
When he mentioned "goose," I remembered that goose

486
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,840
Ke Goose

487
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,680
Goose

488
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,440
Shell

489
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,240
Anyway, our job is to rescue the goose

490
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
Our mission is to save the goose

491
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,400
This round is about catching the big goose

492
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,480
Big goose, catch the big goose

493
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
Catch the goose—have you played it?

494
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,400
Played it

495
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,720
Catch the goose

496
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,680
Have you ever won?

497
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Never won

498
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,760
Shaking every day

499
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,520
Have you won?

500
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,280
Win what?

501
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,320
He must have

502
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,720
I’ve won, caught it

503
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,400
Ever caught it?

504
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,160
Win every time

505
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Let’s go

506
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,720
Go, do it

507
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
Face it with courage

508
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,800
I’m really out of battery

509
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,040
I’m really out of battery

510
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,920
Let’s go

511
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,080
Bye-bye

512
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,760
This place

513
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,880
Keep recording

514
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,000
It's fine

515
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,520
You're the slowest

516
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,760
I'm coming, just wait

517
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,880
How am I slow?

518
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
This is exhausting

519
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,920
Come on players, let's start deducing

520
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,840
Come on players, let's start deducing.

521
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,240
You're lying down, right?

522
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,120
No, I'm not.

523
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,160
You are lying down.

524
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,680
Who's lying down? I'm not lying down.

525
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,440
Who said I'm lying down?

526
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,360
You are lying down.

527
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,760
No.

528
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,600
Come on.

529
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,000
Let's do it.

530
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,800
Do it.

531
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,760
Wait, what about my black mass?

532
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,160
That...

533
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,040
No need.

534
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,240
Then just...

535
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,760
Then just directly...

536
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,680
Sit.

537
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,120
Wait, we still have people joining.

538
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,200
Brother Ning still needs to come in.

539
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,160
Help!

540
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,320
Given your and Brother Ning's performance

541
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,200
we've decided that when the time comes

542
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,480
we can

543
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:53,960
right?

544
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,000
We can

545
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,640
What?

546
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,800
What's up?

547
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,000
Nothing

548
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,920
punish you

549
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,640
Someone took advantage while we were asleep

550
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,560
and changed our clothes

551
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,560
Someone changed your clothes for you

552
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,600
Yes

553
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,880
and gave you a new hairstyle

554
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,720
Got my hair permed

555
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
And turned on the light for you

556
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,120
And turned on the light for me

557
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,040
Who was lying on the floor yesterday?

558
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,320
You were lying on the floor

559
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,920
You were on the floor

560
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,760
I thought there would be something to cushion it

561
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
You're really overthinking it

562
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,480
I don't want to share a room with you

563
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,400
I don't want to be with you

564
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Then resist it

565
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,080
Get out

566
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,720
Why can they be locked in one room?

567
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,600
Women's prison

568
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
You've come to the boys' dorm

569
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,000
The four of us

570
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,800
Pretend to hug

571
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,320
Pretend-hugged

572
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,440
Can I pretend-hug here?

573
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,200
You sit

574
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,800
Sit there

575
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,840
You sit here

576
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,040
Pretend to hug, hug

577
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,480
Hug a little

578
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,400
I'll lie down for a bit

579
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
Wait a moment

580
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,080
Give a hug

581
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,960
You hug while lying down?

582
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,760
Whose foot is this?

583
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
Mine, and yours?

584
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,200
Yours is too long

585
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Caterpillar

586
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,160
This isn't a caterpillar

587
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,680
This is an earthworm

588
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,760
Centipede

589
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,640
What centipede? It has legs, bro

590
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
Come on, friends

591
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,080
What earthworm has legs? My dear brother

592
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,720
Here, let me help. I'll cushion it for you.

593
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll cushion it for you.

594
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,960
Get out of the way.

595
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,400
Biting the shoe, huh?

596
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,280
Don't touch me.

597
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,720
Biting the shoe.

598
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,160
You'll ruin the shoe.

599
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,760
Brother Ning, you've broken my heart.

600
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,200
Not my fault, really.

601
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,880
So the next part...

602
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,400
Decision time.

603
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,600
Now it's your turf.

604
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,560
Now we're in your domain, right?

605
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,680
Time to punish you.

606
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,280
I can't, no!

607
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,680
You two are getting punished.

608
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,280
No!

609
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,520
Complete chaos.

610
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,880
Total mess.

611
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,640
What are you doing?

612
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,200
How did it get so messy?

613
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,040
You're wriggling like a maggot.

614
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,360
And so damn long too.

615
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,040
And ridiculously long.

616
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
How did it get this bad?

617
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,960
Lights out, quick.
