00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,000
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Game Rules

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Six players per episode

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,680
Divided into four suspects

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,440
And two investigators solving the case

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,160
The real culprit hides among the suspects

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,120
The culprit's mission

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,800
Is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,640
Without being discovered by others

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,240
Only the real culprit can lie

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,960
Notably

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
This season introduces new gameplay

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,560
The player as the culprit

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,480
If passing a certain test

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
Can choose between the two investigators

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,920
To corrupt one into becoming X

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,040
X's mission is

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
During subsequent investigations

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,800
To actively help the culprit escape

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,840
Victory conditions

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,360
After investigation concludes

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Players vote for the culprit

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,720
If the culprit receives

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,360
Fewer votes than other suspects

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,200
Then culprit and X get golden keys

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,400
Otherwise correct voters

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,760
Receive golden keys

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,720
Hello classmates, I'm Ba Zimei.

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,840
From June 3rd to June 5th,

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
will be our Tuizhen Art Academy's

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
anniversary celebration period.

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
On the first day of the celebration,

32
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,600
our outstanding graduate representatives,

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,040
senior TYP and student Zidaole were murdered.

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,080
Student Ai Changge committed suicide by jumping off a building.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,240
We witnessed Ai Changge jump to her death.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,240
On the second day of the celebration,

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,480
the director of "Pushing Goose Lake",

38
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,920
Hello director,

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,600
who was also my roommate Ruisibai, was killed.

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,080
In just two short days,

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,920
four people have died consecutively.

42
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,160
This has inevitably caused unease.

43
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,400
Not only that,

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,480
strange occurrences keep happening at school.

45
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,160
Piano music,

46
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,200
He Dinghong and I saw a piano playing by itself

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,120
in an empty music room,

48
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,800
eerily performing "The Deadly Melody".

49
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,880
"The Deadly Melody"

50
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,920
What's going on?

51
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,240
In Bai Yangzuo's memory,

52
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,120
their class only had thirty students.

53
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,600
Thirty-one.

54
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,240
Our class has thirty people total,

55
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
but there's one extra person.

56
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,920
Who is this extra person Xiaodong?

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,600
And Xiaowei who stutters when talking to Bai Yangzuo

58
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
Bai Yangzuo

59
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,080
Xiaorou stutters when she sees me

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,040
But Xiaowei doesn't stutter when she sees me

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,440
Bai Yangzuo clearly said

62
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,760
Xiaowei used to roll her eyes whenever she saw him

63
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,000
Moreover, Xiaowei is the founder of Tweet Empire

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Do you remember

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,920
Xiaowei was the one who created that secret room

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,000
Tweet Empire

67
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,320
Why did she claim to know nothing about computers?

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,600
But I know nothing about computers

69
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,480
Maybe you should study it instead

70
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
The canary was cursed

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
I seemed to be possessed

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
I teleported

73
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,120
And loved eating dragon beard candy

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
Turned into the monster behind the white screen

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,040
Lost control of my body

76
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,960
Killed Ruisibai in a rage

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,040
But we still haven't found out who exactly

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,800
Cursed everyone

79
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,640
How do you know it was Ruisibai who cursed us?

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,880
Did you see it with your own eyes?

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
Someone hacked Sisi's QQ account.

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,600
They contacted us privately.

83
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,160
It's possible.

84
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,280
Because the Tweet Empire has this QQ account.

85
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,920
And who provided the Canary Murder Plan?

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,160
I heard you insulting Sisi.

87
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,200
I can provide you with a murder plan.

88
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,960
He's not one of our six.

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,560
And in the abandoned space behind the study room...

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,880
There are monsters hiding.

91
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,400
The abandoned restroom is full of monsters.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,520
So terrifying.

93
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
What's going on?

94
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,640
June 5th.

95
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,920
It's the last day of the school festival.

96
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,520
Up until now...

97
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,720
"Tweet Art Mysteries" still has...

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
Two final prophecies unfulfilled.

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
What secrets lie behind...

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,960
these mysteries?

101
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,520
I hope no more accidents happen.

102
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,400
Today is the last day of the school anniversary celebration.

103
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,200
The 2004 Tuiyi Basketball Friendship Match

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,680
is about to begin.

105
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
This year's basketball tournament

106
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,720
will feature half-court 2v2 matches

107
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,280
Now we'll use my favorite game

108
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,080
to determine the competing teams

109
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,840
Come with me

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
What game?

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,480
How do we play?

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,320
See this whistle?

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Then place this cup here

114
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,280
Flick it like this with your hand

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,520
Stay steady

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,840
Get it to your side

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,440
You can stand however you want

118
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,920
Right

119
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,600
Move it here to win

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
Take turns or go simultaneously?

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,360
Simultaneously

122
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,520
Then what?

123
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Then you win

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
And get to pick teammates

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,120
Okay

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,400
Let's begin

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,760
Start!

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,120
Why can't we get it right even once?

129
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,720
It's over.

130
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,920
We could keep playing like this all morning.

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,240
It's over

132
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Come on

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,080
Hand it over

134
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,120
Is it that intense?

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,960
Brother Bai, all you have over there is noise

136
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,960
Come on, you choose.

137
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,160
You pick your teammates.

138
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,200
I'll team up with Bai Yang.

139
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
The remaining two will form another team.

140
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Let's pick team names.

141
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
Let's be "The Blockers," okay?

142
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,360
Blockers? Then we'll be "The Dunkers."

143
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Let's crush them!

144
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,080
Bring it on.

145
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,040
Before we begin,

146
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,120
I'll give you a special bonus.

147
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,440
We'll draw lots randomly

148
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
to select one lucky person

149
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,720
who will wear our

150
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,440
Huawei smartwatch.

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,920
If this person burns

152
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
over 100 kcal,

153
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
their team will get

154
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
an extra point.

155
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,720
Who's the lucky one?

156
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,720
Who could it be?

157
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,080
It's our very own Ke Daole!

158
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,040
Wow!

159
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,320
Put it on.

160
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,400
That handsome watch suits you well.

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,680
We'll play to 20 points -

162
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
first to 20 wins.

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,400
Game on!

164
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,560
I'll serve first.

165
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,320
Alright, let's go.

166
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,080
Then let the game begin.

167
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,400
Begin

168
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,840
Where are you going?

169
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,040
Nice shot

170
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,440
Nice shot

171
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,160
Brother is already tired

172
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Too tired... can't go on

173
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,840
The intensity is a bit too much

174
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,960
Continue

175
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,520
Brother Spider, let's defend together

176
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,360
Where is everyone?

177
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,080
Don't hug me, that's a foul

178
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,000
Referee!

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,320
There's no foul here

180
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,200
Throw

181
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,400
How many points does scoring like this count for?

182
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Right here

183
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,320
Count it as five points for you

184
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,040
The kind without defense

185
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,000
I won't defend

186
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,200
It's here, right?

187
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,720
This mark

188
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,440
Right, count it as five points

189
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,920
Right, count it as five points

190
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,440
We can't trust their words anymore

191
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,120
He deceived us

192
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Deceived us

193
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,080
Tactics and strategy

194
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,240
Nice shot

195
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
This match is very intense

196
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,320
They're catching up

197
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,200
Slam dunk

198
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,640
Rebound King Part 1

199
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,200
Charge

200
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,120
Attacking the referee

201
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
Whose? Who hit you?

202
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
That... Bai...

203
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
I passed it to him and he hit it.

204
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,040
It's theirs, you're out of bounds.

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,440
Yeah, you're out of bounds, what are you doing?

206
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,560
Get past him.

207
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,840
That's a three-pointer.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
Three-pointer

209
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,880
Nice shot

210
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,120
Awesome

211
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,440
That counts as a three-pointer, right?

212
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,640
Go

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,320
Great shot

214
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,080
Come on

215
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,960
Perfect shot

216
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,880
Beautiful

217
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,120
I'll keep those two occupied for you.

218
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,680
It's over

219
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,920
Let's take a look

220
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,120
at Ke Daole's watch

221
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,920
to see how many calories were burned

222
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,560
141

223
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,840
Congratulations, you've earned one point

224
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,400
And the final winner is

225
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Block Team

226
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,640
Let's welcome our Ba Zimei

227
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,600
to present the awards to everyone

228
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,600
What are you so excited about?

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,520
Ba Zimei

230
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,360
Someone go call Ba Zimei

231
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,840
Go check on Ba Zimei

232
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,680
Oh no

233
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,960
This is bad

234
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,520
This is...

235
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,600
Something's wrong, this is terrible

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,280
This isn't Xiao Wei

237
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
What's wrong?

238
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,800
Classmates,

239
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,520
Something bad happened!

240
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,400
Xiao Ba is in trouble!

241
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,320
What?

242
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,920
At the library exhibition hall!

243
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,480
Come with me quickly!

244
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,040
The library...

245
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,560
Let's go! To the library!

246
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,640
Hurry!

247
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,320
Move quickly!

248
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,320
Dilraba

249
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,360
Dilraba

250
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,880
Old Ba

251
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,440
Dilraba

252
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,560
Where are you?

253
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,200
Dilraba

254
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,280
Where's Dilraba, Xiao Wei?

255
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,640
Come, help me.

256
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,360
This is the exhibition hall inside.

257
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,280
Go in, you go first.

258
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,760
No.

259
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,360
Where's Iron Tan? Hurry up.

260
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,240
I've run out of energy today.

261
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,520
Iron Tan's butt needs to

262
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,160
recharge on the chair every 10 minutes.

263
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,040
Don't move. No sudden movements.

264
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm warning you.

265
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,800
Do you even have the strength to warn us?

266
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,720
What's wrong?

267
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,360
Go ahead.

268
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,520
Xiao Ba is in trouble

269
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,840
She's not here

270
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,320
How could that be?

271
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,200
She was just here a moment ago.

272
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,600
Was she in the box just now?

273
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,240
I came here at 11:20 AM

274
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,800
to clean the place

275
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,720
and found her inside the cabinet

276
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,600
She was bleeding heavily

277
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,880
There's a knife in the stomach.

278
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
This is the knife.

279
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,520
It says "Exhibition Hall A" on it.

280
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,600
A.

281
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,080
After seeing Ba Zimei, I went to call you.

282
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
Before I ran out,

283
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,360
I had locked the library door.

284
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,760
Where is she?

285
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,720
I don't know. She disappeared.

286
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,200
This library is too strange.

287
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,480
There must be something wrong.

288
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,560
There's really something wrong.

289
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,760
They were always first before.

290
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
Suddenly dropped to last place.

291
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,960
Then last year's first place,

292
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,360
became last place again this year.

293
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,920
Hu Jie was last place.

294
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
But Hu Jie is missing.

295
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,040
So who's first place this year?

296
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,880
Me.

297
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,680
She's gone.

298
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,840
There's really something wrong

299
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,200
Then let's leave this place together

300
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,280
Hurry, go!

301
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,800
Where are you going?

302
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,040
Bai Yangzuo

303
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,720
Bai Yangzuo, you...

304
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,000
Be careful

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,400
You must investigate this thoroughly

306
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,680
Why did you warn him?

307
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,960
Why are your personalities and Xiaorou's...

308
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,640
Bai Yangzuo

309
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Xiaowei usually rolls her eyes at me

310
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,080
Xiaorou stutters when she sees me

311
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,480
But today, Xiaowei was...

312
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,320
stuttering instead

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,600
It feels like their personalities switched

314
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,080
"Let's Start Deduction" Season 2

315
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,040
Case Seven

316
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
"Deduction Art Chronicles: The Deadly Art Exhibition"

317
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,240
Officially begins

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
The date is June 5, 2004

319
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,400
The victim in this case is Ba Zimei

320
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,440
was found murdered in the library

321
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,840
inside the exhibition room cabinet

322
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,000
However, at the time of the crime

323
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,520
Ba Zimei had mysteriously disappeared

324
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,960
After preliminary investigation

325
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,400
the perpetrator has been narrowed down to

326
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,080
Ning Hao

327
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,160
Canary

328
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,760
Bai Yangzuo

329
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,320
Ke Daole

330
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,760
among these four suspects

331
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,120
He Dinghong is currently not a suspect

332
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,480
and thus becomes this case's deduction investigator

333
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,560
Do you need my help?

334
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,520
After all, I am your girlfriend.

335
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Get out.

336
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,080
Right now.

337
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,520
Please keep the investigators at the crime scene.

338
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
To conduct preliminary evidence collection.

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
There's a hat inside.

340
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,400
I'll do it.

341
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,200
Canary.

342
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,000
Dagger

343
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,000
This door will automatically unlock

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,800
after the exhibition experience ends

345
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,760
and allow free passage

346
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,560
Except for this door

347
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,080
all other doors in the exhibition hall

348
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,600
are one-way only

349
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,920
Visitors from the previous exhibition room

350
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,400
must press the access control button on the door

351
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
to push it open and return

352
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,560
Button usage log

353
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760

2023 exhibition reservation list

356

Tuiyi Mysterious Art Exhibition

357
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,040
Except for two reserved visitors

358
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,720
Visitors ranked third to sixth

359
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,440
will participate in a lottery

360
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,880
The drawn number determines

361
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,680
which exhibition hall you'll enter

362
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,200
In the school library's recommended reading list

363
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,160
there are two books with a special connection

364
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,560
One book was published in recent years

365
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,240
while the other is relatively older

366
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,280
This year, the number of years since the first book's publication

367
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,200
happens to match

368
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,800
the last two digits of its publication year

369
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,760
Interestingly enough

370
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,160
the same coincidence applies to the older book

371
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,640
This can be calculated

372
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,680
This year is 2004

373
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,520
Set 20x

374
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,760
That is

375
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,520
2004 minus 20x

376
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,000
4 minus X equals X

377
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,520
x equals 2

378
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,840
the year 2002

379
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,320
So the first one is 2002

380
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,560
Going further back would be the 1900s

381
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,640
Assuming

382
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,680
the previous book's publication year was

383
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,640
19X

384
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,280
That would be

385
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,040
2004 minus

386
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
19X

387
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,200
equals X

388
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,040
104 minus X

389
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,760
2X equals 104

390
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,360
x equals 52

391
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,640
Is there a possibility of the 1800s?

392
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,840
18X

393
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,360
That would be 204 minus X

394
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,480
equals X

395
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,160
2X (equals 204)

396
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,400
X equals 102

397
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Impossible

398
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,400
The password is the combination of two books'

399
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,360
publication years

400
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,240
2002 and 1952

401
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,160
What the heck is this thing

402
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,560
The preliminary search of the crime scene is complete.

403
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,360
Detective, please escort the suspect

404
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
to the Interrogation Hall.

405
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Prepare for questioning.

406
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,760
Let's go.

407
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,600
Move.

408
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,080
Come on.

409
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,680
While investigating the crime scene,

410
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,960
members of the Brainstorming Hall

411
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,480
have also collected

412
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,680
evidence related to the four suspects

413
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
in this case.

414
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,240
Players, please examine the evidence.

415
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Dear little assassins,

416
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,760
Alright, everyone check your evidence.

417
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,680
Later,

418
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,640
we'll take turns sharing evidence.

419
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Wow.

420
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,080
Share the same fate.

421
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,680
The one who cast the curse

422
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,560
shall suffer its consequences.

423
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,280
We can't keep doing this.

424
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,560
You got dust in your nose, didn't you?

425
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,080
Finished reading.

426
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,160
Little Killer

427
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,800
It's me

428
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
Where did you put Ba Zimei's body?

429
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,200
Show me the evidence, and I'll tell you

430
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,280
No wonder you couldn't play basketball

431
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,960
Because you moved the body first

432
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,880
Exactly

433
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,520
Fine

434
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,600
Let me share first

435
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,560
The evidence I found at the crime scene

436
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,560
Today's victim is Ba Zimei

437
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,880
But there was no

438
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,760
body at the scene

439
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,000
Ba Zimei is in trouble

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
She's not here.

441
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,880
The body disappeared.

442
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,240
It most likely happened during

443
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,200
the time between Xiao Wei informing us

444
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,920
and our arrival at the exhibition hall.

445
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
That's the timeframe

446
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,400
when it vanished.

447
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,360
So we can't call it a deceased person,

448
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
only a victim.

449
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,760
You mean to say

450
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,960
she's still alive

451
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,240
Who knows

452
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,320
Did you see the body?

453
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,800
No, just blood

454
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,560
So we don't know

455
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
whether she's actually dead or not

456
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,440
Right

457
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,360
Very thorough

458
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,640
Then

459
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,320
In her Exhibition Hall A

460
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,680
there were two pools of blood in the cabinet

461
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,320
and a knife from Exhibition Hall A

462
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
It's possible that

463
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,920
My initial speculation was that she

464
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,440
after being stabbed in the abdomen

465
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,960
since the stab wound was in the abdomen

466
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,400
her blood flowed from

467
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,600
both sides of the abdomen

468
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,800
She might have been sitting in the cabinet

469
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,280
in that position

470
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,320
So when she was killed

471
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,920
she was already in the cabinet

472
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,680
Or she was killed

473
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,040
and then placed in the cabinet

474
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,720
Both scenarios are possible

475
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,040
Then at the crime scene

476
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,800
I saw a computer in the hallway by the entrance

477
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,760
The Mystical Art Exhibition work computer

478
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,640
It had a floor plan inside

479
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,320
Let me draw it for everyone's convenience

480
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,080
Okay

481
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,880
Various exhibition halls

482
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,480
And the doors of each exhibition hall

483
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,240
B

484
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,440
A

485
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,840
C

486
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,080
D

487
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,320
E

488
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,480
F

489
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,880
This is when we're heading to A

490
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,320
A corridor we pass through

491
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,200
This is Exhibition Hall A

492
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
Then there's a door inside Hall B

493
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,640
From Hall A you can enter B through this door

494
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,000
From B you can reach C

495
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,840
From C you can reach D

496
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,760
From D you can reach E

497
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,720
From E you can reach F

498
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,880
Meanwhile, this computer contains

499
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,920
a ritual procedure

500
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,800
And there's an audio guide

501
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,320
Let's listen to it

502
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,040
Okay

503
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Welcome everyone

504
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,000
To the Mystical Art Exhibition

505
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,200
The first two students who booked

506
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,320
Are assigned to visit Halls A and B

507
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,480
Students ranked third to sixth

508
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Will need to draw lots according to booking order

509
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,920
How terrifying

510
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
All members present

511
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,000
All exhibition hall doors are now locked

512
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Until students in the previous room unlock the door

513
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,280
You cannot go back

514
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,000
Please observe your current exhibition hall

515
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,280
At the center of each hall

516
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,960
Lies a magic circle

517
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,520
Formed around a central display cabinet

518
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,200
Everyone please begin circling

519
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,480
counterclockwise around the circle

520
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,320
Then

521
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,720
Visualize the doll at the cabinet's center

522
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,680
as your deepest fear

523
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,840
Pick up the knife in your hall

524
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,040
and stab it

525
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
Attention everyone

526
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,240
From this moment onward

527
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,880
You must remain in place

528
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,800
Do not move

529
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,560
Until the candle is lit

530
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,200
Please blow out the candles in front of you

531
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,840
Remove the knife from the doll

532
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,280
The exhibition experience ends here

533
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,520
Hall A

534
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,120
Hall B

535
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,760
Hall C

536
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
Hall D

537
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,720
Students in Hall E

538
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,080
Press the access control button on the connecting door

539
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,000
Students in Hall A

540
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,440
Please exit the hall

541
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,640
Students in Hall B, please exit the hall

542
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,240
Students in Hall C, please exit the hall

543
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,480
Students in Hall D, please exit the hall

544
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Students in Hall E, please exit the hall

545
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,280
Students in Hall F, please exit the hall

546
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,480
Move forward

547
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,400
Don't look back

548
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,680
Then I

549
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,840
Found myself in the corridor outside Hall A

550
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,520
Discovered the reservation form

551
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,400
The first two students who booked the exhibition

552
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,360
were assigned to visit

553
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,720
Exhibition Hall A and Hall B

554
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,840
Only Xiao Ba and I

555
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,080
were assigned to Rooms A and B

556
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,280
Right

557
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,560
The rest of you were assigned

558
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,480
randomly by lottery

559
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
So the lottery order might have been

560
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,240
rigged by someone

561
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,960
manipulated

562
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,480
Exactly

563
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,000
During my investigation

564
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I discovered a hidden room

565
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,560
The location of this small secret room

566
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,640
is inside the lottery box

567
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,960
The staff's operating space

568
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,760
This is a cheating room

569
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
can manipulate

570
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,320
Dual killers

571
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,520
Dual killers again?

572
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,240
Yes, they can control what's inside the lottery box

573
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,000
the name tags

574
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,480
But they couldn't have hidden inside

575
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,840
Weren't we all drawing outside?

576
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,360
Who was inside?

577
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,080
And we don't know how they controlled it

578
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,560
There's an accomplice

579
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,200
Exactly

580
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,640
Then the reservation list

581
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,880
shows that

582
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,120
this event started in

583
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,360
2003

584
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,560
which was last year

585
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,760
Last year was the first session

586
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,080
This is our second session

587
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,640
Who were last year's visitors?

588
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,400
Zhi Daole, Xiao Dong, Xiao Xi, Xiao Nan

589
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Xiao Wei and Xiao Gang

590
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,960
And this year (2004) it's

591
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,600
the six of us

592
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,640
Zhi Daole attended last session

593
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,720
We don't know the others, right?

594
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,400
Of course we know them

595
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Last year's attendees

596
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,760
were all from that Tweet Empire

597
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,840
Wait, doesn't Xiao Dong seem familiar?

598
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,800
Xiao Dong

599
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,720
Xiao Dong, right

600
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,320
The guy on the far left in the photo

601
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,720
I know

602
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,360
Group photo of Tweet Empire's founders

603
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,240
The guy on the far left is Xiao Dong

604
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,240
Xiaoxi, Xiaonan, Xiaowei, Xiaodong

605
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,920
So he's one of the founders of Tweet Empire

606
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,360
Including Xiaoxi as well

607
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,200
Xiaodong and Xiaoxi

608
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,760
must be the founders of Tweet Empire

609
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,320
Only Brother Bai was his classmate

610
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,440
Xiaodong, Xiaoxi, Xiaowei

611
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,840
And especially this Xiaodong, with you...

612
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,680
what's your relationship?

613
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,920
Do you have any evidence before questioning me?

614
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,800
No, I'm just asking

615
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,560
He's right

616
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,400
I refuse to answer

617
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,600
It's my right

618
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,120
Refuse to answer, no comment

619
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,960
Fine

620
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
How pathetic of you

621
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,640
Alright

622
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,440
Let's sort this out first.

623
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
During the official exhibition period,

624
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
all of us

625
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,600
after entering that exhibition hall,

626
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,840
the doors were completely closed.

627
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,680
Therefore,

628
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,360
from midnight to 12:30 AM today,

629
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,320
during that event,

630
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,160
in that time frame,

631
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,680
only we few people were inside.

632
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,400
Okay.

633
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,040
It essentially formed a locked room.

634
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,480
Was it still a locked room after it ended?

635
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,240
After it ended,

636
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,120
it wasn't a locked room anymore.

637
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,680
Not sure.

638
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,080
Didn't we all leave after it ended?

639
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
What about Ba Zimei?

640
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,120
Ba Zimei left too.

641
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,880
Because she was the first to leave.

642
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,760
Of course she left.

643
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,680
If she didn't leave, the inner door couldn't open.

644
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,440
No, consider this:

645
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,040
That is,

646
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,560
we left one by one.

647
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,440
Ba Zimei was A, she left first.

648
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:18,760
Right.

649
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,200
So when any of us left,

650
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,360
we didn't know if A had left.

651
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,400
We had to pass by A.

652
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,080
Exactly.

653
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,720
She was lying in the cabinet.

654
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,200
You make a good point

655
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,960
How would we know

656
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,640
if there was someone in the cabinet

657
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,440
But we were all in the back

658
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,840
How could we have gone inside to kill her?

659
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,640
If it happened during the event

660
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,240
no one could have entered her room

661
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
Then how did she die?

662
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,840
But what's another possibility?

663
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,400
That is...

664
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,120
There might be...

665
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,000
a secret passage.

666
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,440
Do you remember in our audio guide...

667
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,840
there was a period when...

668
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,880
After you stab the doll with the knife...

669
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,680
and wait for the candle to light...

670
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,560
"Take the knife from your exhibition hall...

671
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,640
and stab it."

672
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,760
"You must stay in place...

673
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,480
until the candle is lit."

674
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,320
This period was a complete vacuum of time...

675
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,560
and completely dark.

676
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,080
The killer could have been in their own room...

677
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,400
used the secret passage to enter A...

678
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,920
then...

679
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,280
stabbed Ba Zimei...

680
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,840
and returned to their own room...

681
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,960
all within enough time to commit murder.

682
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,400
Right.

683
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
I just thought of something.

684
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,360
What is it?

685
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,000
Do you think it's possible...

686
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,760
that these spaces can be swapped?

687
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,080
Swapped?

688
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
Like a magic square.

689
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,360
We've encountered this before.

690
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,560
I think...

691
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,720
this wall with the door can rotate.

692
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,840
Let's try pushing this.

693
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,560
One.

694
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,320
Two.

695
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,040
Three.

696
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,360
It moves!

697
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
It's actually individual squares.

698
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,120
The spaces are interchangeable.

699
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
Exactly, it keeps shifting back and forth.

700
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,160
But people inside wouldn't realize it.

701
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,400
What was there before remains the same now.

702
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,400
Then you'll need to investigate.

703
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,520
Time of the crime, location of the crime.

704
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Anything else?

705
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,920
Time, location.

706
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,320
And the reason.

707
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,160
The motive.

708
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,600
Does anyone have any connection with Ba Zimei?

709
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,400
No.

710
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,560
Good friends.

711
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,680
Best friends.

712
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,680
Is this how you talk to everyone?

713
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,400
Of course.

714
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240
Your jealousy is written all over your face.

715
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,240
Let's take turns sharing the evidence we've found.

716
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,240
Okay.

717
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,040
The order is...

718
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,920
What order?

719
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
I'm number one.

720
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,760
You're number one?

721
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,600
I knew it.

722
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,240
This is your personal ranking, isn't it?

723
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,640
The person I searched was Bai Yangzuo.

724
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Today it's finally my turn to search you.

725
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,120
Let's take a look.

726
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,080
Inside the gramophone horn in his recording studio,

727
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,400
I found a note.

728
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,840
When opened, it turned out to be a musical score.

729
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Both lyrics and music were by Bai Yangzuo.

730
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,240
The song was titled "A Butterfly".

731
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,960
It goes like this:

732
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,600
Good little brother,

733
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,160
Fly slowly now,

734
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,080
You're big brother's favorite butterfly.

735
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,400
Who's your brother?

736
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,000
Is that any of your business?

737
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,440
The evidence is irrefutable.

738
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,840
Still won't confess?

739
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,120
Can't I write a song for my brother?

740
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,880
This "brother" isn't so simple.

741
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,720
Because let's look at evidence number two.

742
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,680
This time you can't brush us off.

743
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,160
This is called "The Box of Memories".

744
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,200
It contains a memory deeply etched in his heart.

745
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Inside a suitcase in the recording studio,

746
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,880
let's take a look.

747
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,200
So this is him and his "good little brother".

748
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,960
Right.

749
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,600
Nothing special, right?

750
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,280
Right.

751
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,000
The second photo shows a child holding a certificate.

752
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,960
It reads:

753
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,400
To Little Butterfly,

754
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
for outstanding performance in the annual talent show,

755
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,320
awarded first prize.

756
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
But in this photo,

757
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,120
someone has drawn pigtails on this little boy.

758
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,680
Written with a pen:

759
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,760
Little Butterfly

760
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,040
Floral dress

761
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,160
Dancing gracefully while singing

762
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,320
So she was the flower girl

763
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,720
This isn't his brother

764
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,200
It should be his sister, right?

765
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,520
Is it a cousin brother or sister?

766
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,920
Then let's continue reading

767
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,560
There's another paper inside

768
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,800
I thought leaving Butterfly's hellish past behind

769
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,760
would welcome Hu Jie to a kinder new world

770
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,120
But now I've still become

771
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,440
someone isolated by the whole school

772
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,360
This year Hu Jie ranked last

773
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,480
Our school's tradition is that

774
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,200
everyone ignores the last-ranked student

775
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,000
School bullying

776
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,960
Perhaps this is fate

777
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,040
Nothing has really changed

778
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,320
No matter how I change my name

779
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,680
I'll always be that same Butterfly

780
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,160
I'll always be that same butterfly

781
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,960
Since that's the case

782
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,480
let the river of helplessness

783
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,840
wash away the dust on me

784
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,760
Jumped into the river

785
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,960
This is Hu Jie's... what does it mean?

786
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,000
Yes, and when Hu Jie was young,

787
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,560
he was someone's "Hu Die" (Butterfly).

788
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,840
Hu Jie is your cousin, right?

789
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,280
A certificate:

790
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,160
This certifies that student Hu Die from Class 1, Grade 8,

791
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,920
due to long-term misunderstanding of her name by classmates,

792
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,920
has officially changed her registered name to Hu Jie.

793
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,320
This serves as official documentation.

794
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,400
So she changed her name.

795
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,520
He was a boy named Butterfly,

796
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,640
and got bullied for it.

797
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,720
Later he went through great effort

798
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,760
to change his name.

799
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,280
Even as Hu Jie, he still got bullied.

800
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,960
Right.

801
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,640
And then he committed suicide.

802
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,920
Yes, and there's also this

803
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,560
"Instant Laughter" Heart Pills

804
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,680
For treating unhappiness, sadness,

805
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,560
depression and other mental conditions.

806
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,400
Tell us about your relationship with Hu Jie.

807
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,320
Isn't it obvious?

808
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,280
He was my cousin.

809
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,400
Yangyang, his cousin.

810
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,680
We were very close.

811
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,880
Even now, I still regret it.

812
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,400
In middle school,

813
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,600
because of his name,

814
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,280
he was bullied by his classmates

815
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,680
mocked and bullied, yes.

816
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,280
No one would play with him.

817
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
And all that...

818
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,720
Look at those photos -

819
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,120
they all drew him as a little girl.

820
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,880
Actually, he came to see me once

821
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,240
and told me about this matter

822
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,400
Since I wasn't that mature myself

823
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,080
and my mentality wasn't that developed

824
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,360
I just thought we were all kids

825
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,280
playing and fooling around together

826
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,200
That seemed normal

827
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,760
But to encourage him

828
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
I wrote him a song

829
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,800
When he saw the song, he didn't say anything

830
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,760
Gradually he stopped talking to me

831
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,520
For a long time after that

832
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,000
we had no contact

833
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,080
Ah, right

834
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,000
These are his medicines

835
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,440
Why do you have them?

836
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,520
Did you go see him?

837
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,960
I didn't go to him

838
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,720
This box appeared last night

839
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,560
Oh

840
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,640
Last night

841
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,040
After we finished last night

842
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,080
I went to eat noodles

843
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,960
At the noodle shop

844
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,840
I saw another pair of brothers eating

845
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,800
That made me think of my cousin

846
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,160
So I thought

847
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,200
I should go back and revise that song

848
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,320
When I got back, I found

849
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,720
this box here

850
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,320
That's when I realized

851
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,920
Hu Jie was actually my cousin Hudie

852
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,680
What time did you go to the noodle shop?

853
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,600
From 8:40 pm

854
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
to 10 pm at the noodle shop

855
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,760
And when did you return?

856
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,520
From 10:40 pm

857
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,080
until midnight

858
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,080
Then you started questioning me

859
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,320
No, you were talking too

860
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,400
We asked and you answered

861
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,640
Right, then I came back

862
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,200
and found this thing

863
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,440
Okay

864
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,040
I never imagined all these years

865
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,040
he's had such a hard life

866
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,160
And he's been taking those medicines

867
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,840
The side effect made him gain weight

868
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,880
Let me tell you something

869
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,320
I'll deal with both of you sooner or later

870
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,800
Because you both bullied my cousin

871
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,560
One of you gave him a nickname

872
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,960
I told this Sisi

873
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,280
I said you should change the protagonist's name

874
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,960
to "Piggy"

875
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,640
How about that?

876
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,080
Because it rhymes with "pig head"

877
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,120
Since he snores a lot

878
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,280
The other stole his first place

879
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,000
It was Xiao Ba who took his first place

880
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,240
Yes, Xiao Ba again

881
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,200
Xiao Ba stole his top position

882
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,240
Xiao Ba got first while he ranked 600th

883
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,400
The reason he was 600th

884
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,880
was because of who?

885
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,800
Sisi

886
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,240
Right

887
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,480
During freshman year's

888
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,960
Talent Star competition

889
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,640
Through Sisi's vote manipulation

890
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Xiao Ai ended up last

891
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,400
This time Hu Jie was last

892
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,640
Yes

893
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,280
600th place Hu Jie

894
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,440
There's a logic here

895
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,080
Go ahead

896
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,240
Speak your mind

897
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,560
Is it possible that Ba Zimei

898
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,320
is actually the one manipulating the votes?

899
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,680
What makes you say that?

900
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,720
Because Rui Sibai said to tell the truth

901
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,560
I think this Ba Zimei

902
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,720
was the one who yesterday

903
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,800
taught you the method

904
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,160
She's also the one who cast the spell on us

905
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
That's possible

906
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,840
This is yesterday's code box

907
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,520
In her

908
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,360
secret space of Ruisi Bai

909
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,440
It's password-protected, comrades

910
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,080
The box from Ruisi Bai's secret space

911
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,720
How did it end up with you?

912
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,600
Bai Yangzuo

913
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,760
This box is just like that other one

914
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,960
After I returned to my room

915
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,120
both boxes were placed there together

916
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,040
Someone is trying to tell me about these things

917
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,880
So is this password for opening or...

918
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,480
Both boxes are already open.

919
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,520
Completely opened.

920
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,800
I doubt you could guess that password.

921
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,520
Inside there's a pink notebook.

922
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,840
With a small sticker on it.

923
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,640
The general meaning was...

924
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,520
That I suffered bullying as a child.

925
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,840
And you just stood by indifferently.

926
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,920
Now I'm going to make you become...

927
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,880
The one who bullies others.

928
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,000
Make others despise you.

929
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,800
Because this is what you owe me.

930
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,920
If you refuse me...

931
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,520
I'll find even crueler people to torment others.

932
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,280
They'll suffer even worse then.

933
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,400
You wouldn't want to see that happen, would you?

934
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,720
The choice is yours.

935
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,640
Post

936
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,160
Yes, it was pasted on there

937
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,040
Meaning this person received a note

938
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,600
She was threatened with bullying

939
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,120
"You must go bully"

940
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,240
Right, I think this is Ba Zimei

941
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,360
"You made me suffer bullying as a child"

942
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,720
Because she said she was looking at that person

943
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,160
She was staring at Ruisibai

944
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,680
And just stood by indifferently, right?

945
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,760
So she turned Ruisibai

946
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,000
into someone who bullies others

947
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,480
Right

948
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,640
"From now on, I'll decide who you bully"

949
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,200
"And you'll bully them"

950
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,760
Actually, the mastermind behind everything

951
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,640
is actually Ba Zimei

952
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,120
Yes

953
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,120
But there's no evidence currently showing it's Ba Zimei

954
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,440
It's just your speculation, right?

955
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,560
This only proves that

956
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,760
Ruisibai bullied others under coercion

957
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,120
Correct

958
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,080
And below should be

959
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,720
a comment from Ruisibai

960
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,760
"I was naive"

961
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,960
"Wishfully thinking"

962
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,320
"you'd let go of childhood grudges"

963
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,400
Ba Zimei

964
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,760
Ruisibai received this note again

965
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,360
Then she

966
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,200
She said

967
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,320
"I hope you'll grow tired soon"

968
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,960
"of this cruel bullying game"

969
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,480
"Then I can go confess"

970
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,720
"to every classmate we bullied"

971
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,720
"Even if it means atoning with my death"

972
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,040
Ruisibai deeply regrets it

973
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,400
She never wanted to bully others

974
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,120
Then she received again

975
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,560
the note ordering her to bully others

976
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,960
"Ai's singing voice and skills are too good"

977
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,800
"I can't allow anyone to be better than me"

978
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,480
"In the future you'll have bigger stages"

979
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,960
"to sing freely on"

980
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,240
So Ruisibai was actually good

981
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,640
I killed the wrong person

982
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,120
Don't stand here

983
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,120
Being hypocritical

984
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,000
Then she was threatened again.

985
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,760
Grandpa said,

986
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,920
just starring as the female lead in "Carmen".

987
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,600
How could I be satisfied with that?

988
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,240
How could I possibly lose to Hu Jie,

989
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,520
the top-ranked contestant,

990
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,320
in something as important as the Star Pushing competition?

991
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,120
Grandpa adopted me

992
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,280
because his own son,

993
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,680
Guo Ba, was unreliable

994
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
and had no ambition for this.

995
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,120
The "Ba" character eyebrows.

996
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,680
Exactly.

997
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,560
We can confirm through these clues

998
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,680
that the person who wrote this note and ordered Rui Sisi

999
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,840
to bully others is none other than

1000
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,600
Ba

1001
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,160
Zi

1002
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,680
Mei.

1003
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,920
Rui Sibu wrote again

1004
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,800
Ai Sing and Hu Jie are both dead

1005
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,360
All of this was Ba Zimei

1006
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,240
It's true

1007
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,080
You're so smart

1008
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,880
I must come up with

1009
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,000
a way to shock the whole school

1010
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,960
to expose Ba Zimei's crimes

1011
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,280
This morning will be

1012
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,600
the performance of "Swan Lake"

1013
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,000
Let's use this opportunity

1014
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,400
to stop hidden bullying

1015
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,320
I'll revise the script quickly

1016
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,560
then convince Ba Zimei to play the Black Swan

1017
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,080
During the performance when

1018
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,760
the most dramatic twist comes

1019
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,680
I'll stand up and expose Ba Zimei

1020
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,280
So actually her note yesterday

1021
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,880
There's a note here

1022
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,400
I decided to wait until dawn

1023
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,520
to find an opportunity

1024
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,720
to tell the truth

1025
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,480
Saying I must wait until dawn

1026
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,240
to reveal the truth

1027
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,400
Is this what she meant to say?

1028
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,240
Yes

1029
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,560
But Ba Zimei couldn't let her

1030
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,440
say these things

1031
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,760
So she instructed you in advance

1032
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,440
to kill Rui Sibu

1033
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,760
You were just a tool

1034
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,200
You were merely a tool

1035
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,160
I was a tool

1036
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,600
But there's another note inside

1037
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,920
It's our torn script

1038
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,920
Act Four

1039
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,440
Right

1040
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,920
What was on the torn last page?

1041
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,160
You saw the script's last page was torn

1042
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,800
Did you modify this?

1043
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,560
There are some hidden plot points

1044
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,880
I'll tell you during the performance

1045
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,440
You're lying.

1046
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
What lie are you saying I told?

1047
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,200
This was opened by him last night.

1048
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,480
Right.

1049
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,280
Which proves he had a motive to kill Ba Zimei.

1050
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,920
Yes.

1051
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,160
Exactly, it's very clear.

1052
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,880
So you're suspicious.

1053
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,840
You had a motive to kill.

1054
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,200
His motive to kill was very strong.

1055
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,280
Because after learning the whole truth about him,

1056
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,920
he planned to play the game with us at midnight,

1057
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,280
during the ritual,

1058
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,360
to kill that person.

1059
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,640
Plus, he's a third-year student,

1060
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
so he must know this school

1061
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,080
better than we do.

1062
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,040
Right.

1063
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,120
Something's wrong.

1064
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:49,920
Next

1065
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,440
Suspect

1066
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,680
Present your evidence

1067
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,440
Ning Hao

1068
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,200
Gotta admit, Ning Hao's hairstyle is pretty cool

1069
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,840
That moment just now was really impressive

1070
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,840
When lying here

1071
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,320
I'm your brother, you should praise me.

1072
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,160
Alright, let's open the first one first.

1073
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,280
The canary's evidence.

1074
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:23,880
It's a notebook

1075
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,280
On the desk in Canary's dorm room

1076
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,760
There's a chat log

1077
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,480
And this chat log

1078
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,600
was sent to her by Ba Zimei

1079
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,000
Ba Zimei

1080
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,560
at 8 PM yesterday

1081
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,720
sent Canary a message saying

1082
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,320
Little Canary

1083
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,000
I was already asleep in the dorm at 11 PM last night

1084
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,240
Why did you report me absent

1085
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,320
during room check?

1086
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,560
My sister said that's impossible

1087
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,160
I did the room check with the dorm supervisor

1088
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,840
She also saw with her own eyes you weren't there

1089
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,120
Then Ba Zimei said

1090
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,240
You're giving me goosebumps

1091
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,080
Am I having some kind of problem too?

1092
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,360
My sister said

1093
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,760
Since you're scared too, sis

1094
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,200
why don't you come sleep in my room tonight?

1095
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,800
Ba Zimei said okay

1096
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,200
I'll come after my shower

1097
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,400
Remember that thing?

1098
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,720
What?

1099
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,360
Don't stay alone in the dorm

1100
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,200
Be careful of someone lying back-to-back with you

1101
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,360
Stop it

1102
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,240
Don't forget to lock the dorm door

1103
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,400
Be careful of someone lying back-to-back with you in bed

1104
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,840
Let me explain first

1105
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,720
This was after yesterday's incident

1106
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,560
Wasn't it 8 PM?

1107
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,480
I remembered that campus horror story and got scared

1108
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,880
Then Ba Zimei sent me this message

1109
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,080
The more I thought about it, the more scared I got

1110
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,240
So I asked her to come over

1111
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,720
Then I waited for her in my room

1112
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Because I had to attend that mysterious exhibition at midnight

1113
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,800
I wanted to get some sleep first

1114
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,640
So I lay in bed

1115
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,120
I was so tired

1116
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,480
I fell asleep

1117
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,280
while waiting for her

1118
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,320
Then I felt a chill on my back

1119
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,440
What time?

1120
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,840
Between 8 PM and 9:30 PM

1121
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,080
Then I said

1122
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,280
Ba Zimei, you're here

1123
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,440
Then I turned around and no one was there.

1124
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,000
The one that appears back-to-back?

1125
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,080
Didn't appear.

1126
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,680
So I got scared and fainted.

1127
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,400
Fainted.

1128
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,200
You fainted?

1129
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,240
Passed out.

1130
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,480
What does that prove?

1131
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
I didn't see Ba Zimei last night.

1132
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
You didn't see Ba Zimei?

1133
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:21,840
No.

1134
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,480
She told me she was in the dorm at 1 AM yesterday.

1135
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,680
But I didn't see her.

1136
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,840
Neither the dorm supervisor nor I saw her.

1137
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,640
It was my turn to accompany the supervisor.

1138
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,560
For dorm checks.

1139
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,400
So at 1 AM,

1140
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,880
I checked the dorms with the supervisor.

1141
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,880
But no one was there.

1142
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,760
None of you present -

1143
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,600
including Hu Jie -

1144
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
was in their own dorm.

1145
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,240
The supervisor and I were furious.

1146
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,760
So she was lying then.

1147
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,000
But why would she lie to me?

1148
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I really don't know.

1149
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,760
Why would she lie to you?

1150
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,880
The only reason she'd lie to me

1151
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,880
is to get me to open the dorm door for her.

1152
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,560
But when I turned around, no one was there.

1153
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:59,120
Though I did feel a chill down my spine.

1154
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,680
There's another piece of evidence.

1155
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,880
Oh?

1156
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,400
This is the canary's catchphrase -

1157
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,480
calling older girls "sister"

1158
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,680
and boys "brother."

1159
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,840
The canary's gesture: gratitude.

1160
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,000
Favorite thing:

1161
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,520
"How to Conquer Beautiful Girls."

1162
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,000
The canary's most hated food:

1163
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,920
Dragon beard candy.

1164
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,000
So there's a logic

1165
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,360
Perhaps she isn't a canary

1166
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,680
When I perform this part seriously, it's going to scare you all.

1167
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,480
So you're not a canary

1168
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Who am I

1169
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,000
Then I'll tell you

1170
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,680
That day I jumped down from the building

1171
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,680
I thought what awaited me

1172
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,280
would be endless darkness

1173
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,520
Never expected I'd wake up

1174
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,320
I've been revived again

1175
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,680
I, Xiao Ai Singing, have returned to life

1176
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,000
What's wrong?

1177
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,040
What's wrong with you now?

1178
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
I just saw in the dormitory courtyard

1179
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,240
Xiao Ai singing before jumping to her death.

1180
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,280
I looked in the mirror

1181
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,200
Wait a minute

1182
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,160
This stunning face doesn’t look like my own

1183
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,040
But like my roommate, Canary

1184
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,880
I possessed someone

1185
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,840
I possessed her body

1186
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,600
But then I felt

1187
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,840
a strange power within this body

1188
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,840
It seems to be a canary

1189
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,560
fighting me for control of this body

1190
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,440
I fought... and I won

1191
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,320
You won

1192
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,200
So you're Ai Chang

1193
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,320
Ge

1194
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,800
Then that means yesterday

1195
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,160
you killed two people

1196
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:21,800
No

1197
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,200
Be careful

1198
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,920
Why did you warn him?

1199
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,320
So Xiao Rou is Xiao Wei

1200
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,080
I don't know about others

1201
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,800
but this is definitely how it is for me

1202
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,400
I am Ai Changge

1203
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,240
So there's no escape for you

1204
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,560
No escape at all

1205
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,160
Your Ai Changge has appeared

1206
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,960
You have both your old flame and new love

1207
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,480
I can't accept this

1208
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,440
I think you're too fortunate, young man

1209
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,000
You have everything

1210
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,720
Surprise

1211
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,280
Hold me, kiss me

1212
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,280
Kiss me, love me

1213
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,640
Too terrifying

1214
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,040
No no, I can't accept this

1215
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,080
So are you Ai Singing now or—

1216
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,840
It's Ai Singing

1217
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm Ai Singing now

1218
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,520
Then the one who killed yesterday—

1219
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,320
Was Canary

1220
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,400
I watched her do it

1221
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,160
There was also a voice recorder

1222
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,520
Then there's a 23-second recording.

1223
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,200
Listen to it.

1224
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,520
Last year I already did as you said.

1225
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
Made sure no one could vote for Ai Sing.

1226
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,520
You successfully became

1227
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,520
the female lead in "Carmen Inside".

1228
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,800
Isn't that enough?

1229
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,920
Now you want me to block Hu Jie's votes too?

1230
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,840
How much more dirty work must I do for you?

1231
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,320
You're quite amusing.

1232
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,440
I suggest you think carefully.

1233
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
I understand. I'll do it.

1234
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,680
She stole your role in "Carmen Inside".

1235
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,560
Let's hear it.

1236
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,080
Then Ba Zimei's connections become clear, don't they?

1237
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
Where did these recordings come from?

1238
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,800
At 9:30 in the evening,

1239
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,920
Canary fainted from fright.

1240
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,280
That's when I came online.

1241
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,680
Then I thought,

1242
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,680
If I, Ai Sing, was being manipulated by Rui Sibai

1243
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,960
to get last place in Talent Star,

1244
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,760
what would Rui Sibai gain from it?

1245
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,080
Who benefits from this situation?

1246
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,680
Exactly.

1247
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,280
Could Rui Sibai really be that person?

1248
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,680
I actually think it's more likely Ba Zimei.

1249
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,800
Because back then I was about to become

1250
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,120
the female lead in "Carmen Inside".

1251
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,720
I ended up last,

1252
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,000
and Ba Zimei got the role.

1253
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,560
I think she's very suspicious.

1254
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,680
So I searched their dorm room

1255
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,360
and found this.

1256
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,000
This is definitely it.

1257
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,840
This Ba Zimei...

1258
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,440
Such a beautiful face,

1259
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,640
such an ugly heart.

1260
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,320
I have a question.

1261
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,080
Go ahead.

1262
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,640
Are your two personalities' memories

1263
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,880
interconnected?

1264
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,120
I know Canary's, but Canary doesn't know mine.

1265
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,160
And now there is no Canary anymore.

1266
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,800
Only Ai Sing can see from Canary's perspective.

1267
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,560
After Canary went inside,

1268
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,640
she couldn't see from Ai Sing's perspective.

1269
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,040
Right.

1270
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
So that means whoever you bullied

1271
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,400
could potentially retaliate against you,

1272
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,800
taking over your body.

1273
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,040
I think so.

1274
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,160
Because I once controlled Xiao Ai to sing.

1275
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,960
So now Xiao Ai is controlling.

1276
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,600
But anyway, this point proves.

1277
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,560
The motive for murder.

1278
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,440
Yes, the motive for murder.

1279
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,360
There's also some information on the forum

1280
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,800
An anonymous user on the first floor

1281
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,400
posted a prediction thread

1282
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,000
predicting Ba Zimei would come in first

1283
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,040
and Xiao Ai Singing would be last

1284
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,000
Then these people started saying

1285
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,360
"Why compare the beauty with Xiao Ai Singing"

1286
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,600
"together like this?"

1287
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,720
"It makes me sick for the beauty"

1288
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,040
This is why I tried to jump off the building that day

1289
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,320
Just because I saw this

1290
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,680
Yes, because I've been bullied for a year

1291
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,120
This prediction says I'll still be last this year

1292
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,760
I really can't take it anymore

1293
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,240
So I might as well just die

1294
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,280
You're just like my younger brother

1295
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,000
This is Ning's evidence

1296
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:53,920
My turn

1297
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,080
Let's take a look first

1298
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,560
The browser on his computer

1299
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,160
Okay

1300
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,320
His browsing history contains

1301
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,360
The Weird Tales section of Tweet Empire

1302
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,080
Clicking into this campus weird tale on Tweet Empire

1303
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,960
The image says

1304
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,520
The Secret of Weird Tales

1305
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,000
Chapter 1: Casting Curses

1306
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,680
Weird Tales originated from ancient curses

1307
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,040
All students who mutated into monsters on campus

1308
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,640
Were cursed using the same method

1309
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,440
The curse method is as follows

1310
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,560
In the night study room

1311
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,760
There's a secret shrine with special magnetic properties

1312
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,000
On the secret shrine

1313
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,480
Place a personal belonging of someone

1314
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,320
And attach a curse to the item

1315
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,640
The curse will take effect

1316
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,440
This is what we saw yesterday, right?

1317
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:41,800
Right

1318
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,640
But there's a Chapter 2: Curse Removal below

1319
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,440
But the removal part wasn't photographed

1320
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,800
So who did you curse?

1321
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,480
You cursed us

1322
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,360
There are two stickers on this picture.

1323
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,600
One has "Ba Zimei" written on the back of a school uniform.

1324
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,520
The other is an upside-down "Director Exclusive."

1325
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,240
Director, Rui Sipai, right?

1326
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:17,880
Exactly.

1327
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,320
So when Ba Zimei's school uniform and "Director Exclusive"

1328
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,000
appear in the same place at the same time,

1329
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,880
it means

1330
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,960
it was taken in their dorm.

1331
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,840
What's there to explain?

1332
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,200
Here's the thing

1333
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,200
After we finished at 8 o'clock yesterday

1334
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,960
I went back to my room

1335
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,480
I thought since Ruisi Bai is already dead

1336
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,080
what should I do about this curse?

1337
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,880
I keep bleeding randomly

1338
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,160
I don’t want to live like this forever

1339
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,320
It’s extremely painful

1340
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,680
So I thought

1341
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,240
I’d check the Tweet Empire

1342
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,120
to see if there were

1343
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,760
any clues or something

1344
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,520
But after logging in

1345
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,040
I found someone had posted this thread

1346
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,440
Based on the clues in the picture

1347
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,480
there was half of Ba Zimei’s back

1348
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,320
and something about "director’s exclusive"

1349
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,880
So I

1350
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,520
went to her room

1351
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,280
to look for her

1352
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,680
but she wasn’t there

1353
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,760
What time was it?

1354
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,400
When I went to find her, it was around 10:10

1355
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,480
So at 10:10

1356
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,320
Ba Zimei still wasn’t in the dorm

1357
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,600
I went at 9:30 too, and she wasn’t there

1358
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,600
The next piece of evidence

1359
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,480
points to our QQ user

1360
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,480
On this QQ account

1361
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,440
is Sisi's QQ number

1362
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,360
but it's logged in on your computer

1363
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,000
You've been impersonating Sisi

1364
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,360
You cursed us

1365
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,600
So you already knew

1366
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,360
Rui Siba's QQ account

1367
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,600
That's how it is

1368
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,760
I went to find Ba Zimei

1369
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,120
I wanted to clarify

1370
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,760
how to lift the curse

1371
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,640
When I got there, she wasn't around

1372
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,200
So I searched the room

1373
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,520
to see if that paper was there

1374
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,680
The curse-breaking paper I mentioned

1375
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,480
Right

1376
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,640
After searching, I found a sticky note

1377
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,840
with QQ account credentials written on it

1378
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,320
But at the top of the note it said

1379
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,440
"Ba Corporation Official Sticky Note"

1380
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,200
Our previous curse

1381
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,800
was Ba Zimei logging into her QQ

1382
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,320
Possibly

1383
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,440
So I went back

1384
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,800
and opened the computer

1385
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,560
After logging in, I discovered

1386
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,560
this QQ actually belonged to Rui Siba

1387
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,520
So I guessed

1388
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,560
there's about a 99% chance

1389
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,120
that actually yesterday

1390
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,280
the person who asked for our personal items was Ba Zimei

1391
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,200
On June 3rd

1392
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,840
at 11:30 PM

1393
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,800
Rui Siba told me

1394
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,040
She asked me to give her

1395
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,240
a personal item of mine

1396
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,000
She needed it urgently

1397
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,920
So the person who cursed us

1398
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
was also Ba Zimei

1399
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,400
You found that paper, right?

1400
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,720
That paper was found

1401
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,680
Didn't you try to lift it immediately?

1402
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,840
What's the method to break the curse?

1403
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,320
You have to kill the person who cast the curse

1404
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,200
Only then will the curse be lifted

1405
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,360
Motive for murder

1406
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,880
Okay

1407
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,480
When he was speaking just now

1408
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,080
he seemed very unnatural

1409
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,080
Quite different from his usual self

1410
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,000
Yes

1411
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,080
Normally when you see me acting unnatural

1412
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,920
you wouldn't point it out

1413
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,040
Today you deliberately pointed out my unnatural behavior

1414
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,720
showing how unnatural you are

1415
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,400
Speechless

1416
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,720
Ke Daole

1417
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,960
Evidence One

1418
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,920
You also have this note

1419
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,040
It's the exact note he mentioned

1420
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,080
So you could also log into her QQ account

1421
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,640
So what?

1422
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,920
Therefore

1423
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,240
Confess yourself

1424
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,560
So

1425
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,440
So you must have been to their dorm room

1426
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,240
Yes, exactly as he said

1427
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,720
That's right

1428
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,080
Why did you go there?

1429
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:35,640
Speak

1430
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,000
This is what happened

1431
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,960
Last night we finished at 8 o'clock

1432
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,240
After that murder case of yours

1433
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,280
I returned to my dorm

1434
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,600
I couldn't figure it out

1435
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,080
I was thinking about how to lift

1436
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,760
this pig-headed curse on me

1437
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,160
So I did the same thing as Ning Hao

1438
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,680
I kept searching online

1439
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,040
for ways to break the curse

1440
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,200
Then at 10:20 pm

1441
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,840
I logged onto the Tweet Empire website

1442
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,120
and entered the Urban Legends section

1443
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,800
I saw the same post

1444
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,440
that was on Ning Hao's laptop earlier

1445
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,960
I found the director's exclusive

1446
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,200
and also this Bazi Mei school uniform

1447
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,520
So I decided to go to her dorm room

1448
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,200
to investigate

1449
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,520
So I went there

1450
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,240
And her door was like this at the time

1451
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,200
So I knocked on her door

1452
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,840
As soon as I knocked, her door moved

1453
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,320
Then her door opened

1454
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,720
But no one answered inside

1455
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,560
So I entered her dorm room myself

1456
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,800
And then I saw that

1457
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,400
piece of paper

1458
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,120
It had "casting spells" and "breaking spells" written on it

1459
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,000
Then I suspected it was Ba Zimei

1460
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,800
who cast the spell on me

1461
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,960
So I searched through

1462
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,840
Ba Zimei's drawer next to Rui Sibai's

1463
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,880
Inside the drawer I found a sticky note

1464
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,040
With Rui Sibai's QQ number on it

1465
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,880
This story is the same as his, right?

1466
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,880
Pretty much

1467
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,600
Okay

1468
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,160
Ba Zimei

1469
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,120
I believe Ba Zimei wanted to borrow

1470
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,240
personal items from each of us

1471
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,520
And cast spells on all of us

1472
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,840
So I thought the only way to break the spell

1473
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,840
Since it required killing Ba Zimei

1474
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,680
Then I had to kill Ba Zimei

1475
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,640
At 10:25 you developed the motive to kill

1476
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,680
But I think one of you two

1477
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,800
can get close to that library loophole

1478
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,560
because they thoroughly browsed

1479
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,160
every forum on that dark web

1480
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,400
That forum might have specific

1481
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,240
details about the library's analysis or something, right

1482
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,480
Didn't we just talk about this?

1483
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,280
If there's a secret passage,

1484
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,520
then someone must have entered beforehand

1485
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,040
and learned its internal layout.

1486
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,920
Right.

1487
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,960
Is it possible that

1488
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,960
they saw the entire layout on a website?

1489
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,280
These two are the most suspicious.

1490
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,360
But another possibility was just raised -

1491
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,360
that during the first event last year,

1492
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,440
those people might have some connections.

1493
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,720
In that case, he's the most suspicious.

1494
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,040
Right.

1495
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,880
Bai Yangzuo.

1496
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,360
So then you're no longer a suspect?

1497
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,520
Exactly.

1498
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,440
Maybe Ba Zimei had already...

1499
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,840
I'm also a suspect

1500
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,800
Because Ba Zimei said she was coming to my dorm

1501
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,240
Maybe something happened between us, right?

1502
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,920
There's one more point

1503
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,160
About that secret room we just mentioned

1504
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,000
Who exactly was drawing lots inside

1505
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,120
And by what method

1506
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,920
were the lots given to the murderer

1507
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,240
We still haven't figured this out

1508
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,920
Hmm

1509
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,640
It's simple

1510
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,200
Let's search the crime scene

1511
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,520
Then we'll see

1512
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,160
whether this case

1513
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,560
could be done by one person alone

1514
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,200
If it couldn't be done alone

1515
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,480
then someone must have helped

1516
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,320
Right

1517
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,360
That's another issue

1518
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,800
It must be someone among us

1519
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,200
a key figure

1520
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,760
Someone among us helped him

1521
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,360
Now proceeding with X confirmation process

1522
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,000
X

1523
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,800
How to manage facial expressions?

1524
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,800
There's only one - it must be you

1525
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,240
This round is two versus three

1526
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,960
Actually not two versus three, but three versus one

1527
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,720
Because we won't listen to anything he says anymore

1528
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,400
You didn't give me an identity

1529
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,520
This is a bit unusual, right?

1530
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,880
This is really strange

1531
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,520
This isn't just a little unusual

1532
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,280
No, now I'm asking you

1533
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,640
Look into my eyes

1534
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,600
Okay, I'm looking at your eyes

1535
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,520
Did you just draw X?

1536
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,400
That's rough

1537
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:01,760
I drew it

1538
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,840
You're X

1539
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:06,960
Yes

1540
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,240
Okay, let's play this openly

1541
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,040
Okay

1542
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,280
If that's the case

1543
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,240
If he's lying to us

1544
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,520
Then he's not a competent investigator

1545
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,840
We need to hurry and check out that secret room, you know?

1546
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,160
Let's go inspect the evidence site.

1547
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,200
Hello

1548
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,360
Hello Wei

1549
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,400
Hello

1550
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,600
Hi Wei

1551
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,840
Hi

1552
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Have you found Dilraba?

1553
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,880
No

1554
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,120
You're going to investigate

1555
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,160
Then I won’t disturb you

1556
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,200
Okay, Wei

1557
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,160
Good luck

1558
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:10,920
Brothers

1559
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,560
Since we've arrived at this library

1560
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,360
let's first take a look at the crime scene

1561
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,160
Alright

1562
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,200
Lottery bucket

1563
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,480
Is this the secret room?

1564
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,400
Leave him waiting outside

1565
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:39,960
None of us will acknowledge him

1566
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,760
We'll just control him

1567
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,600
We control him

1568
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,720
Right, don't give it to him.

1569
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,680
Don't pay any attention to that, right.

1570
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,800
He'll come in by himself in a moment.

1571
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,560
Look, why are you coming in?

1572
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,080
This door is quite flexible.

1573
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:51,840
You stay outside.

1574
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,240
Let me try this door.

1575
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,120
This is the first one.

1576
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,680
It's the lottery bucket, right?

1577
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,560
Lottery bucket.

1578
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,320
Exhibition hall access control.

1579
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,080
During the exhibition.

1580
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,680
Button usage log.

1581
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,920
Exhibition Hall B door access was used once.

1582
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,880
C door used once.

1583
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,560
D door used once.

1584
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,160
E door used once.

1585
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,120
F door used once.

1586
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,880
This shows that each door.

1587
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,920
was only used once.

1588
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,120
Only that.

1589
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,960
was used once during the event.

1590
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,640
A opens B

1591
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,560
B opens C

1592
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,600
Exactly

1593
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,240
At this exact time yesterday

1594
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,360
They were pressed simultaneously, right?

1595
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,320
Correct

1596
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,440
So what's inside here?

1597
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,360
What does this mean?

1598
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:25,960
It's connected

1599
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:26,520
This is me

1600
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,800
The password to open this door

1601
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,080
Password, got it

1602
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,200
Quick, go in and check

1603
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,320
Hurry, go in

1604
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,720
This is an independent space, right?

1605
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,480
Yes, and it connects here

1606
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,320
There's a hole inside

1607
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,360
You can come out through it

1608
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,360
If that's the case

1609
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,760
It means the draw was manipulated

1610
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,480
Right

1611
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,440
The killer had to get to

1612
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,480
the room he wanted

1613
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:44,880
Exactly

1614
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,440
He had to get that number

1615
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,200
That room was where he could commit the crime

1616
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,320
But he couldn't

1617
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,960
be inside and also

1618
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,720
So he had someone hide inside

1619
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,880
To arrange our order

1620
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,920
That's possible

1621
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,760
An accomplice, another accomplice

1622
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,920
An unrelated person was the accomplice

1623
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,720
Most likely Wei helped someone

1624
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,640
Wei isn't that kind of person

1625
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,320
But you are that kind of person

1626
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,480
What did you just say at the door?

1627
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,240
You scared me

1628
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,120
Brother, today you're the killer

1629
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,520
I won't vote for you either

1630
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,800
I'm your Y

1631
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,240
But you are that kind of person

1632
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,320
What did you just say at the door?

1633
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,200
You scared me

1634
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,800
Come on

1635
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,520
This is A, right?

1636
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,080
Okay

1637
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,360
Isn't this blood pattern a bit strange?

1638
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,520
This shape, isn't it...

1639
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,080
I told you

1640
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,480
She might have been in this position

1641
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,200
Blood flowed down from both sides

1642
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,880
She just curled up inside

1643
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,200
In a crouching position inside

1644
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,680
You've already searched here

1645
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,760
Right?

1646
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,520
Already searched

1647
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,760
Then let's go to B

1648
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,440
Whose is B?

1649
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:52,880
B is me

1650
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,720
Your knife is over there.

1651
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,720
It's fine, this is B.

1652
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,480
It's labeled B on top.

1653
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,600
There's nothing here.

1654
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,040
But this thing...

1655
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,280
Could it hide someone?

1656
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,200
Of course.

1657
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,920
Come on, let's check C.

1658
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,320
We've finished checking this room.

1659
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,920
I don't think there's anything here.

1660
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,120
Push forward and go first.

1661
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,160
What's going on? Let me see.

1662
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,040
This is that signed ball

1663
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,760
Signed ball

1664
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,560
That's right

1665
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,480
This is the one I touched

1666
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,120
Okay

1667
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,160
Who is C?

1668
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:37,680
It's me

1669
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,040
There's no signed ball in B

1670
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:40,920
That's your room

1671
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,760
What are you talking about?

1672
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,640
I have a very serious question now

1673
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,240
to ask you

1674
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,400
I have a very serious question now

1675
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:44,960
to ask you

1676
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,000
Why is it that only your room has

1677
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,920
air conditioning

1678
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,360
has air conditioning

1679
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,120
Because

1680
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,600
the director said he was afraid I'd get hot

1681
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,360
No problem

1682
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,880
Why does my room have a carpet

1683
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,240
while yours don't?

1684
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:02,840
My room

1685
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,800
The strangest thing is this carpet

1686
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,320
And none of you

1687
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,480
suspected there was something wrong with it

1688
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,320
Take a look

1689
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,240
You're all really strange people

1690
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,360
You really know how to manipulate people

1691
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,480
The moment you mentioned the carpet

1692
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,240
everyone went to look

1693
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,040
It's cooler inside here

1694
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,360
Whose room is D?

1695
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,360
This is my room

1696
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,480
Did you notice

1697
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,480
Did you notice this carpet

1698
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,680
is circular

1699
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,120
Only these four back rooms have it

1700
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,480
The two front rooms don't

1701
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,960
This suggests that this room might

1702
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,000
be rotatable.

1703
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:39,520
Except for A,

1704
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,200
we were rotating there ourselves.

1705
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,080
Then I have a question:

1706
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:44,560
If we say

1707
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,280
this room is rotatable,

1708
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,760
how could we not have noticed?

1709
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,400
Because at that time

1710
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,320
it was a vacuum of time.

1711
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,480
A vacuum of time, understand?

1712
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:53,800
Everyone,

1713
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,160
please note that from now on

1714
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,360
you must stay where you are

1715
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,160
and don't move

1716
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,160
until the candle is lit.

1717
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,720
Okay, no problem.

1718
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,200
This is E, right? Okay.

1719
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,480
This one is mine.

1720
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,080
My room has a pillar.

1721
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,600
Your room doesn't have a cabinet.

1722
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,680
E means no one can hide here.

1723
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,800
Then welcome everyone

1724
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,120
to my room.

1725
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,000
As you can see,

1726
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,040
my room also doesn't have

1727
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:26,920
a cabinet.

1728
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:33,640
Yes

1729
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:34,720
Yes

1730
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,520
The only painting that can be lifted

1731
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,280
Really?

1732
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,240
Access control system

1733
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,960
One-touch fingerprint scanner unlock

1734
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,320
Fingerprint recognition is here

1735
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,960
Place your finger

1736
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,960
All registered

1737
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:48,840
library fingerprint users

1738
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,080
have access privileges

1739
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:50,480
Understood

1740
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,320
After touching the fingerprint scanner

1741
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,160
All exhibition hall doors will unlock

1742
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,560
Doors for Halls A through F

1743
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,640
will become bidirectional passages

1744
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,280
All doors can open/close freely six times total

1745
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,400
Each opening must close within three seconds

1746
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:06,920
Warning

1747
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,200
After six total door operations

1748
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,480
All one-way doors will lock

1749
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,080
Only accessible via door access buttons

1750
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,160
During the exhibition of this device

1751
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,640
Only exhibition staff are permitted to know

1752
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,320
So we need to find this painting?

1753
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:24,600
Of course

1754
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:24,920
Find it

1755
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,080
Check whose room it's in

1756
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,160
Not this painting

1757
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,080
They all seem to be horizontal

1758
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,280
This is the one

1759
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,480
It's in F's room

1760
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,840
Right in your room

1761
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,480
So it's in this

1762
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,400
The person in this room can

1763
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,520
Everyone can

1764
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,520
But must enter

1765
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,520
Only he can enter this room

1766
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,840
Because for each of our rooms

1767
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,160
Others must enter once

1768
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,400
Only this room is

1769
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,400
Actually, logically speaking

1770
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,480
Meaning it must be in

1771
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,720
Room A where the crime occurred

1772
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:53,920
Right?

1773
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,200
Correct

1774
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,280
So if you want to go to Room A

1775
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,120
The person in Room A must

1776
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,320
Open the door for you

1777
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:58,640
Yes

1778
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
But after using this

1779
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,280
You won't need her to open it

1780
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,640
But bro, there's one thing

1781
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,400
Look what's written here

1782
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,080
After I activate this function

1783
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,960
After all doors open/close six times total

1784
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,400
All one-way doors will lock

1785
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,280
Only accessible via

1786
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,200
The door access button

1787
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,280
Meaning this function

1788
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,960
Becomes useless after six uses

1789
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,400
Right

1790
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,400
Then based on this

1791
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,680
Calculate his route

1792
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:17,960
Watch carefully

1793
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,280
For example, these six times

1794
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,160
I use this door once

1795
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,080
I'm currently F

1796
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,640
I need to get to A

1797
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,200
Right?

1798
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,600
If I want to go to A

1799
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,440
Okay, this

1800
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,200
So now I've used three times to get here.

1801
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,480
Where is this? It's at C.

1802
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,720
Arrived at C.

1803
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,040
After arriving at C,

1804
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,320
I reached B.

1805
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,320
Four doors, five doors.

1806
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,320
Already used four.

1807
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,120
Five doors.

1808
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,200
This is the fifth one, right?

1809
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:43,720
Right.

1810
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,480
Five.

1811
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:44,960
Okay.

1812
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,720
Then I arrived here.

1813
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,840
You don't need five.

1814
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,000
Because if you use five,

1815
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,800
you can't go back anymore.

1816
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,320
After arriving here, use the access control again.

1817
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,680
The access control will return by itself.

1818
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,600
Can't open the access control.

1819
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,800
The door access control has usage limits.

1820
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,120
Exhibition hall access control.

1821
01:15:59,120 --> 01:15:59,880
During the exhibition,

1822
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,480
Button usage records.

1823
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,720
Exhibition hall B door access control used once, marked.

1824
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,680
C door used once, marked.

1825
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,360
D door used once, marked.

1826
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:05,960
E door used once, marked.

1827
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,920
F door used once, marked.

1828
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,680
This shows that each door

1829
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,720
was only used once.

1830
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,920
Only that

1831
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,760
was used once during the event.

1832
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,520
Only once, right?

1833
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,120
Right.

1834
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,000
The access control has been confirmed.

1835
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,360
We only pressed the access control once.

1836
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,440
Which means you

1837
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,400
in this current situation

1838
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,640
couldn't have committed the crime.

1839
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,040
I couldn't go back after killing someone.

1840
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,600
Right, so among those within six times,

1841
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,240
only B, C, and D.

1842
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,520
All the people

1843
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,600
because of this access control system

1844
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,000
only exists in Room F

1845
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,400
So if the killer wants to commit the crime

1846
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,760
no matter which room they're in

1847
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,760
they must first go to F

1848
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,880
and find this painting

1849
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,360
So it's simple

1850
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,880
When the lights go out

1851
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:17,880
say I'm currently in C

1852
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,520
I wait for darkness

1853
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,000
then go to F to activate this

1854
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,480
then I go to kill

1855
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,600
That's how it works

1856
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,160
But the problem is

1857
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,120
if I'm in C

1858
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:26,640
when the lights go out

1859
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,880
how do I get there?

1860
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,120
Since these are one-way doors

1861
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,080
At that time

1862
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:30,880
there couldn't be

1863
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,000
a round-trip route

1864
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,400
The number of uses isn't enough

1865
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,840
Secret passage

1866
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,000
Look for secret passages or rotating mechanisms

1867
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,560
Like this

1868
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,160
Let's start from one

1869
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:51,680
room by room

1870
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,840
and search carefully, okay?

1871
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,720
Okay

1872
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,240
Right

1873
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:54,920
From C then

1874
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,720
It must be A

1875
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,320
When we went to A

1876
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,600
we saw an elevator door there

1877
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,840
No matter where we start

1878
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,840
we have to go to A

1879
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,320
Right

1880
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,000
It's fine, you stay here

1881
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:01,920
See you next time

1882
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,520
Let's go

1883
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,080
Ironclad, brothers

1884
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:06,920
I'll do it

1885
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,320
We don't need him

1886
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,560
This is the elevator

1887
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,400
There's a problem

1888
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,600
Under maintenance, can't go up

1889
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,880
Can't go up

1890
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,560
Right, you're going to investigate.

1891
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,760
Then I won't disturb you.

1892
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:41,720
Okay, Xiaowei.

1893
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,280
Bye-bye.

1894
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,040
I just saw the message board.

1895
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,760
Here.

1896
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,560
Here.

1897
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,800
Go to the message board.

1898
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,160
Right.

1899
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,440
There's writing at the bottom of the message board.

1900
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,360
The message book says:

1901
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,000
May I ask how to go upstairs

1902
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,280
in our library?

1903
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,920
Seems you really never come to the library.

1904
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:07,480
You don't even know this.

1905
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,040
The teacher managing the second-floor reading room

1906
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,040
only likes smart students.

1907
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,160
She tells a story every day.

1908
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,680
If you can guess the truth of the story,

1909
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,600
a door to the second floor will open.

1910
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,720
Stand under the deer head,

1911
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,720
and the librarian teacher will

1912
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,040
contact you via broadcast.

1913
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,160
Under the deer head.

1914
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,640
Go to Deer Head

1915
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,120
Please speak

1916
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,520
Go ahead

1917
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,360
Are you smart enough?

1918
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,240
I want to know

1919
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,240
That makes sense

1920
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,280
Stand below

1921
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,280
Stand

1922
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:38,920
He's smart

1923
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,440
Welcome everyone to the library

1924
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,840
If you can tell

1925
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,000
the truth behind the story

1926
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,120
you may go upstairs

1927
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,200
During your process of deducing

1928
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,560
the story's truth

1929
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,280
I will only answer

1930
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,040
Yes

1931
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:56,960
No

1932
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,160
Irrelevant

1933
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,480
Incomplete

1934
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,640
Correct

1935
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,040
Lateral thinking puzzle

1936
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:02,640
Right

1937
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,120
Lateral thinking puzzle

1938
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,320
The story begins

1939
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,680
There was a boy named Xiao Shuai

1940
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,760
After saying goodbye to his classmate Xiao Mei

1941
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,120
On his way to club activities

1942
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,800
he heard the campus broadcast suddenly cut off

1943
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,120
After pausing, it resumed

1944
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:23,280
Xiao Shuai became terrified upon hearing this

1945
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,520
Then rushed out of campus

1946
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,800
and jumped into the Helpless River

1947
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,880
committing suicide

1948
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,680
The news Xiaoshuai heard

1949
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,280
Is it the key to his death?

1950
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,880
The information Xiaoshuai heard was

1951
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,840
Xiaomei's?

1952
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,760
Or was it his own?

1953
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,320
This story is about

1954
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,400
how it happened.

1955
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,400
Xiaoshuai bid farewell to Xiaomei,

1956
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,200
then went

1957
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,360
to handle some business.

1958
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,760
While leaving the school,

1959
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,880
he heard a broadcast.

1960
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,600
The broadcast got interrupted,

1961
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,520
then resumed after a while.

1962
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,480
Xiaoshuai then jumped into the river and committed suicide.

1963
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,480
His death

1964
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,600
was it related to the broadcast interruption?

1965
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,440
Was the sudden broadcast interruption

1966
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,880
man-made?

1967
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,720
Did the broadcast interruption

1968
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,040
make Xiaoshuai remember

1969
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,840
a past mistake he made?

1970
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,760
Was this mistake related to Xiaomei?

1971
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,560
Did Ma Shuai kill Xiao Mei?

1972
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,400
Yes.

1973
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,800
So he killed Xiao Mei.

1974
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,480
He killed Xiao Mei.

1975
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,400
After saying goodbye to her,

1976
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,440
he suddenly heard

1977
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,640
the broadcast cut off.

1978
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,960
Then it came back on.

1979
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,600
Then he jumped into the river.

1980
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,480
Was it a suicide pact?

1981
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,000
So that means

1982
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,160
after Ma Shuai killed Xiao Mei,

1983
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,880
he stuffed Xiao Mei into

1984
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,400
the broadcast speaker.

1985
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,680
The interruption means

1986
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,040
Xiao Mei was rescued.

1987
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,280
No.

1988
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,040
That's not it.

1989
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,200
When the broadcast resumed,

1990
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,120
was it Xiao Mei's voice?

1991
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,520
No.

1992
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,720
It was probably Ma Shuai.

1993
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,080
After killing Xiao Mei,

1994
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,160
when he was about to flee,

1995
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,200
something happened.

1996
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:18,920
Right, so actually

1997
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,160
the missing piece we have now

1998
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,080
is the content of that broadcast

1999
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,160
or the message.

2000
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,600
It's about what happened before and after the interruption.

2001
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,920
Did Ma Shuai

2002
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,600
after killing Xiao Mei,

2003
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,720
dump her in the broadcast room?

2004
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,280
But when the broadcast stopped,

2005
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,400
someone went to the broadcast room.

2006
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:38,720
No

2007
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,080
What she meant was

2008
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,960
Once the broadcast cuts off

2009
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:42,800
the whole school will know

2010
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,880
that this person is the killer

2011
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,080
But the broadcast interruption wasn't man-made

2012
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,400
That's too far-fetched

2013
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,880
Xiaoshuai's death is related to the broadcast interruption

2014
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,200
But regarding hearing

2015
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,160
how the interruption happened is what everyone can know

2016
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,000
Does the broadcast interruption

2017
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,400
mean there's a power outage?

2018
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,560
Why are your questions always so

2019
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,280
Yes

2020
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,520
Oh my god

2021
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,360
The power's out

2022
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,920
What does the power outage have to do with it?

2023
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,920
A power outage would make others discover

2024
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,520
Was Xiaomei murdered by him?

2025
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,600
So what he actually wanted to create

2026
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,920
was an alibi.

2027
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:21,680
This alibi of his

2028
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,760
involved Xiaoshuai using his own voice

2029
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,760
to make a broadcast.

2030
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,040
No, bro,

2031
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:24,840
I don't think it could be

2032
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,600
his own voice.

2033
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,160
Because he himself

2034
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,480
went to attend club activities.

2035
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,160
Was the broadcast room playing Xiaoshuai's voice?

2036
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,080
On his way to the club activities,

2037
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,160
he heard the campus broadcast suddenly cut out.

2038
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,920
After pausing for a while, it started again.

2039
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,520
Xiaoshuai became extremely panicked

2040
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,760
and committed suicide.

2041
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,760
Right, that's the logic then.

2042
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,080
So he must have intended to use that recording

2043
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,200
as his alibi,

2044
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,720
but after the power outage

2045
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,120
when the power came back,

2046
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,960
the proof was gone.

2047
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,000
That created a flaw.

2048
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,160
For example, if I record one...

2049
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:58,960
Stop

2050
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,520
After five minutes

2051
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,400
Meaning he didn't say it

2052
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,720
There was a power outage just now

2053
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,200
Not sure if the classmates

2054
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:08,840
It was obviously a recording

2055
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:09,480
Clearly

2056
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,120
They realized it was a recording

2057
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,040
The broadcast stopped

2058
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,760
but the sound didn't stop

2059
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,400
He happened to skip a section

2060
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,640
For example, he said

2061
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,760
he recited the 26 letters

2062
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:29,720
ABC

2063
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,320
but it was still playing DEFG in between

2064
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,080
When it played again

2065
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,720
he had reached XYZ

2066
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,400
Right

2067
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,400
Is that it?

2068
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,720
Correct answer

2069
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,560
That's exactly it

2070
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,000
Congratulations everyone

2071
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,720
You've uncovered the truth of this story

2072
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,560
That was tough

2073
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:00,960
I'm sorry

2074
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,640
Let me hold on for a while

2075
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,240
Open sesame

2076
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,080
This is a recording of your laughter being played

2077
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,200
Surprise

2078
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,800
This is a recording of your laughter playing

2079
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,200
Move forward

2080
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,320
Let's go upstairs

2081
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,800
Go quickly

2082
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,000
Pull the corner

2083
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,600
You take the rear.

2084
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,800
Come.

2085
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,280
Come on.

2086
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,200
Take it slow.

2087
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,480
Xiao Ba, where are you?

2088
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,280
It's fine, someone's ahead.

2089
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,560
There's nobody, don't worry.

2090
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,000
It's just a little dark, that's all.

2091
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
What kind of place is this?

2092
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,240
There's another elevator here.

2093
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,160
Don't use the elevator casually.

2094
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,480
Be careful not to go to non-existent floors.

2095
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:36,840
Don't take the library elevator.

2096
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:41,120
Be careful not to walk to non-existent floors.

2097
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,440
Use it quickly.

2098
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,200
I'm trying.

2099
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,280
It won't open.

2100
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,440
Open sesame.

2101
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,800
Notice.

2102
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,840
Recently, elevators in school public areas...

2103
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,120
have frequently shown unexplained overloads.

2104
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,560
To ensure the safety...

2105
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,160
of all students and staff when using elevators...

2106
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,160
elevators will be out of service for three days for inspection.

2107
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,440
Not only can no one see me...

2108
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,720
they don't even remember me, Xiao Dong.

2109
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:08,560
Xiao Dong.

2110
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,520
Even my best friends...

2111
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,160
Xiao Xi, Xiao Nan, and Xiao Wei don't remember.

2112
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,120
I founded Tweet Empire with them.

2113
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,520
It seems Dilraba is like me too.

2114
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,840
No one can see me.

2115
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,880
No one can see Dilraba.

2116
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:26,880
Warning.

2117
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,560
Six people detected in elevator.

2118
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,280
This elevator's maximum capacity...

2119
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,360
is only five people maximum.

2120
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,560
This elevator's maximum capacity...

2121
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,240
is only five people maximum.

2122
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,000
Warning.

2123
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,680
Six people detected in elevator.

2124
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:44,920
Besides us in the elevator...

2125
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:45,840
there's one more person.

2126
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,440
Above us.

2127
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:47,840
Where?

2128
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,600
On the ceiling panel.

2129
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,000
Who?

2130
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,520
A corpse.

2131
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,280
Not sure.

2132
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,720
Maybe it's Dilraba's.

2133
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:55,440
What should we do then?

2134
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,760
Should we get out first?

2135
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:57,400
Get out first.

2136
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,760
What are you doing?

2137
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,560
How can I investigate like this?

2138
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,840
You need to learn to be independent.

2139
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,120
No way.

2140
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,000
Here, let me check first.

2141
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,560
This is the second floor, right?

2142
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,160
Let's go check the third floor.

2143
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:12,840
Check the third floor.

2144
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,680
Come on.

2145
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,280
You go in.

2146
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:16,880
Go inside.

2147
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,400
Come on, Sis.

2148
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:18,960
Come on, it's fine.

2149
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,280
You're surrounded, but it's fine.

2150
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,520
Elevator capacity is normal.

2151
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,960
About to move.

2152
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,000
Gone.

2153
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,440
Which button do we press?

2154
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,320
It always takes us to a non-existent floor.

2155
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,280
No matter which button we press, it takes us...

2156
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,480
Ba Zimei, where are you?

2157
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,080
Don't touch anything.

2158
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,080
It's okay, bro, it's fine.

2159
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,400
Please don't touch anything, okay?

2160
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:48,880
It's alright.

2161
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,120
It's moving.

2162
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:55,720
It's rotating.

2163
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,840
Three, two, one, two...

2164
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,640
Look at that number.

2165
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:00,840
It's moving.

2166
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,400
Where is it going?

2167
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,600
Why do I feel like we're shaking?

2168
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,040
It's moving

2169
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:12,880
Where is it going?

2170
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:14,480
Why do I feel like we're shaking?

2171
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,040
Where have we arrived?

2172
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,840
Be careful we don't end up on a non-existent floor

2173
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,080
Give my body back to me!

2174
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,840
Brothers, save me!

2175
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,960
Classmates...

2176
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,400
Do you still remember me?

2177
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,480
I'm Ba Zimei.

2178
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,720
Where is that voice coming from?

2179
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,600
Those who spread malicious rumors,

2180
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,680
those who manipulate others with connections,

2181
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,440
those who isolate others...

2182
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,160
My dying wish has become a curse.

2183
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,360
The bullying won't stop, the curse won't lift.

2184
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,840
We're not really going to...

2185
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:53,720
demolish the library, are we?

2186
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,560
I can only kill with a borrowed knife,

2187
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,480
so I need someone to help me.

2188
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,720
Has the truth already come out?

2189
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,680
Then I definitely know it's not me.

2190
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,320
So it must be one of you two.

2191
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,720
Why me?

2192
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,120
Who are you trying to help escape?

2193
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,880
I'm not helping anyone escape!

2194
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,400
He's disrupting things.

2195
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,000
He's been agreeing all along.

2196
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,240
You've truly lost today.

2197
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,040
Between the two of us...

2198
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,040
one must be the wolf.

2199
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,120
Impressive.

2200
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,320
So who do you think it is now?
