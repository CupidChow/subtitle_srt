1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:05,880
Come on

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,280
After-school gambling

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,960
Don't panic

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,200
There's no questioning in this game

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,360
No questioning - you have a big advantage

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,440
Hopefully it's that one

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,640
It's that one

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,640
One

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,840
I told you both of them would be small

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,560
You can't slaughter pigs this way

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
Prescription Tracking

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,440
Get ready, everyone

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,920
Three

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,520
Two

15
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:28,880
One

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,400
First time feeling this kind of

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,960
sensation of a man running toward me

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,080
We need to set up defenses along this line

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,040
What should we do?

20
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,800
What to do?

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,760
No no no

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,480
Why not?

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,600
We absolutely can't place this

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,040
If this comes over, they'll take it

25
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,160
We've been spotted

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Now we can only

27
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,120
cut off one path

28
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,040
This is the move

29
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,280
I knew they would make this move

30
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,080
Kai

31
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,480
Just won't let me go

32
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
Brother Kai shows no mercy at all

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,760
Welcome to

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,400
"Let's Start Brainstorming"

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
This is the renowned

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,840
century-old pharmacy

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,640
Brainstorm Hall

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm the assistant director of Brainstorm Hall

39
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,280
Cui Shaoyang

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,440
It's still the familiar year 2004

41
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,800
with our familiar physicians

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,880
and the same assessment rules

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,840
Does anyone have any

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
value-added services they'd like to receive?

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,920
Ice Bucket Challenge

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,520
Ice Bucket Challenge

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,320
It's too hot

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,960
Already did the challenge

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,240
It's really hot

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,040
I'm already sweating

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,000
That's a reward service

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
A reward for the Sect Leader

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
Makes sense

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
So this time's

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,400
What is the mental enhancement service?

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,640
They are the refreshing

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,080
Smooth summer skincare enhancement

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
And

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,640
The seamless spicy calorie boost

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,320
Without further ado

61
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
We'll soon begin our grouping

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
Let's proceed in order from this side.

63
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,960
Okay, okay, okay.

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,240
Fine, it's all random selection anyway.

65
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,600
Seven.

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,200
Six.

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Seven.

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,080
So we can only be chosen?

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
Who's number one?

70
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,280
Me.

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,480
So proud.

72
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,200
Let's go.

73
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,160
Now, the other seven contestants besides number one,

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,360
please stand in the seven designated areas in order.

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Make your own choice.

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,880
Whatever, let's just...

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
Then I'll take this spot.

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
Here, this one's for you first.

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,240
Happiness again, Hou

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Making you choose again, Hou

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
This is very

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,840
very trendy

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,520
Let me help you put it on

84
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,000
My apologies

85
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,520
Okay, cool

86
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
Alright

87
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,080
Come on, Zhuocheng

88
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,520
Elephant trunk ready

89
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,800
Three, two, one, action!

90
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,280
Shake shake

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,960
Five, four

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,240
Zhuocheng, you...

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,760
Are you sure he...

94
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
Zongyu is there?

95
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,640
Or are you just...

96
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,200
Because honestly...

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,840
Before I came here...

98
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,200
I actually talked to Zongyu

99
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,280
I really wanted to team up with him

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,440
Okay

101
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,720
Let's congratulate Yang Zongyu and Hou Zhuocheng

102
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,640
For forming the first consultation room

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
This looks pretty cool

104
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,080
Wow, this is so stylish

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,160
For this episode I'll...

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
I'll just go with this for now

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
Come on, ready?

108
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Elephant trunk

109
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,800
Three, two, one, start

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,960
Quiet

111
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,520
Why are you pushing yourself so hard?

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,440
I'm not.

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,280
Three, two, one - let's try again.

114
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,200
We instantly had the best chemistry.

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,480
We mastered it right away.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,360
Minghao, did you expect this?

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,680
Actually, I...

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,600
Didn't really...

119
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,280
Just went with the flow.

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
But I'm really happy.

121
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's congratulate Hu Minghao and Ren Yinpeng.

122
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,960
For successfully becoming.

123
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,680
Our second consulting room.

124
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,560
Blow first, blow blow blow.

125
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,560
Blow blow blow first.

126
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,840
Like a flower.

127
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
So cool, so cool.

128
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,160
Alright, elephant trunk ready.

129
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,720
Three two one.

130
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Begin.

131
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,800
This doesn't feel right

132
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Isn't that how it is?

133
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,320
Like a gun

134
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Wild West style, right?

135
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
Aiming, who are you aiming at?

136
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,760
Haven't you spun enough?

137
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,240
Praying to Buddha

138
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,960
Let me do it

139
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,640
You two don't object, do you?

140
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,520
No objection

141
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,200
Is that okay?

142
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,720
Okay

143
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,280
Are you satisfied?

144
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,160
Satisfied

145
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,280
Zifan takes the initiative

146
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,520
Ask why Zifan is like this

147
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,640
Because

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,480
Right, we'll just

149
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,840
I actually wanted to be in his group

150
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,960
And I saw he was working hard

151
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,000
Swinging many times over here

152
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,520
Haoyang, have you thought about it?

153
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,560
Meaning wanting to choose Zifan like this

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,320
Yes, because we haven't partnered before

155
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,560
So we wanted

156
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,960
To try partnering with him

157
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,720
Good

158
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Then our Haoyang

159
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,480
And our Zifan

160
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,040
Will successfully form the third clinic

161
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,920
Our Xiaolong

162
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,720
And our Huang Kai

163
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,760
Will automatically become the fourth clinic

164
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,840
We'll immediately begin this session's first assessment

165
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,760
Still need to flip a medicine card

166
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,680
What should we flip?

167
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,320
That rainbow one

168
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
A Little Rainbow

169
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,400
Flip A Little Rainbow

170
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
What is it?

171
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
After-class gambling game

172
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,560
This will actually be quick

173
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,080
Don't panic

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,120
This game has no challenges

175
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,880
No challenges

176
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,480
You have a big advantage

177
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Come on

178
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,040
Come on, the community card is twelve

179
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
Twelve

180
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Show me what cards you'll give me

181
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,120
Come on, take a look at ours

182
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,840
It's fine

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,400
Actually, we can swap the community cards

184
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,760
Because we're first

185
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,040
We don’t need to swap the community cards

186
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,880
We’ll swap our hand cards

187
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,480
Just to bluff

188
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,920
I think bluffing a bit

189
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
Let’s try it

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,680
We’ll see later

191
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,160
Don’t make it too obvious

192
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,760
We’ll bet directly without swapping community cards

193
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
If we swap the community cards

194
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,480
They won’t play against us

195
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,760
Let’s see what they’re thinking first

196
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
I think they might swap

197
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Then we’ll definitely swap

198
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Draw cards

199
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
No loss anyway

200
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,360
Discard four

201
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,240
This infuriates me

202
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,640
We want it too

203
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,920
We need to see one hand card

204
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Let me think

205
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
Three-four, and one-two

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,960
Do you think they have one-two?

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,080
They changed their cards

208
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
Or maybe they have fifteen

209
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,400
Then we might as well take a gamble

210
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,080
We'll take fourteen

211
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,760
We have to gamble, otherwise we'll just...

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,480
Mathematically speaking

213
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,280
Keeping fourteen is better

214
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,400
Better, right?

215
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,960
That's it

216
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,000
Alright, we'll

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Discard one

218
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Discard three

219
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,000
We go first—we'll swap the community cards

220
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,920
Even if we don't win, they won't either

221
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,080
Sounds good?

222
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,880
Swap one community card

223
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,440
The community cards are

224
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,920
Eight

225
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,480
They did what we wanted to do

226
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Your turn

227
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,080
They want to take the smallest one

228
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,800
Right

229
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,360
So what I mean is

230
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,720
He might have one, two, three

231
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,960
Then discard the four

232
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,200
Change hands

233
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,760
Then let's discard any card

234
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,400
Why randomly?

235
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
Mess with them, we're not betting anyway

236
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,400
But this way

237
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,200
We definitely can't win

238
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
We couldn't win from the start

239
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,560
Neither of these two cards can win

240
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,880
Might as well discard a two

241
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,680
Let those with ones go all out

242
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,360
Discarded a two

243
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,120
Okay

244
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,960
From our clinic one

245
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,360
Decide whether to bet

246
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,920
Not betting

247
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,240
I'll bet one

248
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,720
So everyone can eat earlier

249
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,520
Bet one

250
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,120
We'll bet one too

251
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,960
One

252
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Just one?

253
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,280
What about you?

254
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,200
Pass

255
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
Okay, both sides show your cards

256
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Fourteen

257
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,440
Fifteen

258
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
I thought we had lost

259
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,600
Community card: Nine

260
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
We need to change our hand tiles

261
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,240
Hopefully it's that kind of tile

262
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,480
That

263
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,000
Pretty much like that

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,120
It really is like that

265
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,520
Which one is it like?

266
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
Let's just go with this

267
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,800
We

268
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,440
Discarded a twelve

269
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,920
We also need to change our hand tiles

270
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Change hand tiles

271
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,400
They discarded a three.

272
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,840
He discarded a three.

273
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,040
I think he's going for small cards.

274
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,960
Because a three has a high probability

275
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,920
of forming the strongest hand.

276
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,040
So it's twelve.

277
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,160
He should have more than twelve.

278
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
So both of them now have more than twelve.

279
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,320
Switching hands.

280
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,920
Throw this away

281
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,560
Okay

282
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,040
Discard this

283
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,400
Alright

284
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,960
Check the field situation and then

285
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,320
Discard a ten

286
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,560
Keep the high cards

287
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,880
Right?

288
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,040
Hold onto the big cards

289
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,480
Then ours must be the smallest

290
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,560
Then let's do the opposite

291
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
Ours is indeed the smallest

292
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
Let's swap the community cards

293
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,640
Community Card Fifteen

294
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,480
Alright, it's your turn to decide whether to place a bet.

295
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,320
We...

296
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
Let's go next.

297
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
Next one, are you in?

298
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,960
We have no reason...

299
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,840
...not to follow.

300
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,680
Let's follow.

301
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,200
In.

302
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,320
What about you?

303
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,120
Then let's play one round.

304
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,880
One round.

305
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,360
I'll follow.

306
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,400
Come on, all three reveal your cards.

307
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,960
One.

308
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,120
Five.

309
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,200
Eight.

310
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,080
Once again, our Clinic 2 has won this round.

311
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,520
Just got lucky, I'd say.

312
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:38,960
Drawing a one.

313
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Flipping a fifteen.

314
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
That's basically unbeatable.

315
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:40,960
Right.

316
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,600
Absolutely unbeatable for sure.

317
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,160
If I were you, I'd go all in with three.

318
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,000
Three would scare everyone away.

319
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,760
They'd all run off.

320
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,880
You can't do that.

321
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,360
You don't slaughter pigs that way.

322
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,520
Gotta take it slow.

323
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,440
The community card this round is an eight.

324
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Eating popsicles again.

325
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,360
Again.

326
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,520
This is rough.

327
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,680
Change the community card.

328
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,280
Actually not too bad.

329
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,600
I think someone will still want to change the community card.

330
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Think about it.

331
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
What if we draw a one or two?

332
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,680
We're checking if there's anything smaller.

333
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,560
I think we should skip this round.

334
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,200
Why?

335
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,080
Because I think they're...

336
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
About to reach their limit.

337
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,000
Once they can't hold on, they'll start betting.

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,360
Once there's a significant point gap from betting...

339
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,360
You know what I mean.

340
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,760
We'll end up in third place.

341
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,280
And secondly...

342
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,760
I think someone will swap the eight.

343
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
What are they thinking about?

344
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,800
Right.

345
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,680
Nothing's happening right now, you...

346
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,440
It's us.

347
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,920
I know.

348
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,960
Let's analyze again.

349
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
So let's draw a card first.

350
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,440
See if we draw higher than ten.

351
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,240
Okay.

352
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,720
Let's draw a card.

353
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,000
Discard it.

354
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,720
Discarded a ten.

355
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,920
Dropped a ten.

356
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,560
We...

357
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,120
Draw a card.

358
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,880
Draw a card, right.

359
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,520
This seems good.

360
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,320
I think so too.

361
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,840
Discard a six.

362
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
We'll

363
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,320
change the community cards.

364
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,800
Change the community cards.

365
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,040
The community card is a seven.

366
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,680
What was it before?

367
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,520
Eight.

368
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,480
Eight changed to seven.

369
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,960
Change another one.

370
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,800
Change another community card - fourteen.

371
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,200
Actually, we could go all in

372
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,640
Dragon can place the bet now

373
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,120
Wait a second

374
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,960
Anyway, they're changing the community cards

375
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
Hold on, let me think this through

376
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,880
An eight definitely isn't

377
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,920
a strong community card

378
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,400
Him wanting to swap means he has a weak hand

379
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,480
He's trying to chase something better

380
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,720
If his hand were strong

381
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,520
an eight wouldn't threaten him

382
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,120
Because one and two plus eight isn't much

383
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,520
Right?

384
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,240
It's no threat to them

385
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,200
So they must have weak hands

386
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,040
That's the first point

387
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,200
If we assume weak hands

388
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,120
then none of us can beat one and two

389
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,960
Agreed?

390
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,560
None of us can top one and two

391
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,440
Okay

392
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,040
For example, the player before us had a four

393
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,760
And the community card before that was eight

394
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Do you think he

395
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,640
Should he switch to another one at this point?

396
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,800
Let's play then, let's play

397
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,560
Let's try

398
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,360
How many?

399
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,200
Two

400
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,840
Three

401
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,120
One

402
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,680
Your call

403
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,360
One

404
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,000
One

405
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,120
Next one, follow?

406
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,960
Not following

407
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,360
You guys

408
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,520
Let's do one

409
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,720
One

410
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,240
Let's follow with one

411
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,800
They're following with one

412
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
What's your decision?

413
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
We'll do two

414
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,440
Follow with two

415
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,160
Do you want to make it two?

416
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,520
Might as well

417
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,600
Are you making it two?

418
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,360
Let's add one

419
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,680
Alright, let's reveal everyone

420
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,720
One

421
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,200
Two

422
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,320
I told you

423
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,920
Those two definitely have small ones

424
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,040
They're the only ones with two

425
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,640
Smaller than yours

426
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,000
They got all the small ones

427
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,120
But they definitely won't follow now

428
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,200
We'll bet three to make those two follow

429
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,040
He definitely won't follow

430
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,080
We should be more cautious later

431
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,960
We have the advantage now

432
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,600
Okay

433
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,240
Our final community card is

434
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,880
Six

435
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,240
Hard to say

436
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,160
It's actually quite good

437
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,760
Swap cards

438
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,080
Thank you

439
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Keep this one, discard that

440
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,920
They discarded a five

441
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,400
We draw cards

442
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,920
Draw

443
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
Keep it

444
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,680
(Throws) This one

445
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,960
Okay, right

446
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,680
No, keep this one

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,960
Why?

448
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,080
This definitely isn't the smallest

449
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,920
I think

450
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,200
They might have smaller ones in their hands

451
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Wait, why do you want to keep this one?

452
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,320
Keep this one

453
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,720
It's just in your hand

454
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,680
A middle-range card

455
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,400
Yes

456
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,320
This is the most...

457
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,000
This card plus that one

458
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,080
If this is the smallest

459
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,640
This definitely isn't the smallest

460
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,080
Not necessarily

461
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,880
Why not?

462
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,880
You need to confirm

463
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,320
The combined total of their three

464
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,640
No

465
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,680
I mean

466
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,560
What if someone doesn't play

467
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,560
Or it becomes one-on-one

468
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,240
In a one-on-one situation

469
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,160
I don't think it'll work

470
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,960
If it's the number fourteen card,

471
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,800
they need to draw an eight.

472
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,120
Without changing the community cards,

473
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,360
they must draw

474
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,240
an eight to succeed.

475
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,720
Right?

476
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,720
Drawing above eight

477
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,440
Yes.

478
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,320
So I think this

479
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
has better odds.

480
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,720
There's some gambling involved,

481
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,920
but statistically this one's better.

482
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,400
But they might also draw this.

483
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Let's try it.

484
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,760
Anyway,

485
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,640
if it fails we won't commit.

486
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,120
Because fifteen must be

487
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,800
in their hand, I think.

488
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,880
Not necessarily.

489
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,680
How can you be sure?

490
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,520
We're second.

491
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,640
How do you know fifteen will appear?

492
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
I think this card has better chances.

493
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,560
Discard it.

494
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,520
Discarded an eleven.

495
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,600
That card has better odds.

496
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,200
Let's check our hand.

497
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,560
Just use the original

498
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,200
Right, the original one was lost

499
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,920
Then worst case, we just quit playing

500
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,160
We'll discard this one

501
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,120
Discard the four

502
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,880
Losing this four won't matter much

503
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,480
Your turn now

504
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,920
Then let's swap hands

505
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,080
Draw from the public pile or look directly?

506
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,920
Keeping this card is pointless

507
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,320
Then let's swap hands

508
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
Almost the same, you choose.

509
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,520
They're all the same.

510
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,600
Then whatever, whatever.

511
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,160
Okay.

512
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,160
Then discard this one.

513
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,760
Okay, nine.

514
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,560
Never mind, let's not continue.

515
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,240
Discarding is too...

516
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,360
If we continue, we'll lose too badly.

517
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,080
If you don't continue,

518
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
then we're already losing first, right?

519
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
So if I don't continue now,

520
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,680
what if someone bets three,

521
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,640
and ends up with less than us?

522
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,200
Is that possible?

523
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,720
It's possible.

524
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,600
But if we keep one or two,

525
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:08,960
a few cards,

526
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
we'll still be last.

527
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,440
No, I mean,

528
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,680
if someone bets three,

529
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,360
what then?

530
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,800
They might end up with less than us.

531
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,880
You know?

532
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,240
There's still this slim chance.

533
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,680
Do you understand now?

534
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,280
Got it.

535
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,400
We're betting they'll participate (bet) last.

536
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,760
Right.

537
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
We won't participate.

538
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,200
We'll go next.

539
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,320
Following?

540
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,880
Not playing.

541
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,240
Not playing.

542
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,560
Then we won't play either.

543
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,120
Not playing.

544
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,440
Even the winners aren't playing—game's over.

545
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,400
Alright.

546
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,960
Let's announce the results.

547
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,920
Thirteen.

548
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,000
Fourteen.

549
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,960
Seven.

550
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,960
Three.

551
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,000
Now we'll proceed with

552
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,200
tallying everyone's game tokens.

553
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,000
Clinic Four.

554
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,320
Seven.

555
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,720
Seven.

556
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:46,920
Yours.

557
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,440
Thirteen.

558
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,920
Thirteen.

559
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,240
Yours.

560
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,440
Eleven.

561
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,680
Nine.

562
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
Does anyone have any thoughts?

563
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
We actually think this game

564
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,200
is quite straightforward.

565
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,680
Because you just

566
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,840
calculate and—

567
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,400
You can completely know that

568
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,200
whether you can win

569
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,320
So in the end

570
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,080
the numbers everyone comes up with

571
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,320
are extremely close

572
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,560
or even in extreme cases

573
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,880
like one or fifteen

574
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,800
Then

575
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,960
Right, I think people only in these

576
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,840
extreme situations would

577
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
play their cards

578
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,880
to participate in this game

579
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,800
So

580
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,680
And with fifteen cards

581
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,080
you can actually calculate it

582
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,880
Right

583
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,320
So it's

584
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,520
less of a gambling game

585
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,320
and more of a

586
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,640
calculation game

587
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,680
a mathematical game

588
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,560
There's still some gamble

589
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,600
What if the remaining card is

590
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,040
The gamble is in that card draw

591
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,760
It either is or isn't

592
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
You only

593
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,800
when influencing enough factors

594
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
can approach the probability

595
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,120
Okay

596
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,840
Then let's begin immediately

597
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,040
our second round of assessment

598
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,680
We'll explore Chuan Qiong

599
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,560
Tracking the Prescription

600
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,480
This is the traditional Chinese medicine prescription.

601
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,840
This is the Western medicine one.

602
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
Let's go.

603
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,080
You run, I'll watch.

604
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
Now let's present our first question.

605
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,560
What are you doing?

606
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,840
Sorry about that.

607
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,920
My bad, my bad.

608
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,960
Here we go.

609
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,320
Three.

610
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,280
Two.

611
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,200
One.

612
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,120
Dragon.

613
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:58,960
Begin.

614
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,400
This is the piece.

615
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,440
I think this is the right piece too.

616
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,800
Then try fitting that part.

617
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,160
Move this downward.

618
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,880
Yes, pull this out a bit.

619
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
Then move this up slightly.

620
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,560
Like this.

621
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,200
This is too much

622
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,560
No no no

623
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,960
They won't find it

624
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,200
Time's up

625
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,840
Stop

626
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,000
That's not right.

627
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,040
Correct answer.

628
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,960
Correct answer.

629
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,120
Good, let's move to the next question.

630
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,080
It's that prescription, right?

631
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
One.

632
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,880
Two.

633
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,960
Three.

634
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,600
No rush

635
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,720
Time's on

636
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,640
No, there's a blue one

637
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,520
Here, here

638
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,800
That's correct, right?

639
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,640
But we need to locate the knot

640
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,040
Not that one

641
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,280
Time's up. Are you sure?

642
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,600
Good, correct answer

643
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,080
Alright, get ready everyone

644
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,840
Next question first

645
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
Three, two, one

646
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
This is the first time I've felt this kind of

647
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,800
sensation of a man running towards me

648
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,600
Timer starts now

649
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Yes, here, let's try here

650
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,880
Why are there white ones too?

651
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,400
I don't think it's this one

652
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,080
Time's up

653
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
20

654
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,280
Alright, both of you please return

655
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,280
Are you looking for a rectangular blue one?

656
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,600
There are only two rectangular blue ones below

657
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,560
Because these are the rectangular blue ones

658
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,520
Only those two below

659
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,400
And there's no red next to the rectangular blue ones

660
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,720
So it's not that

661
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,280
Not the square one on the left

662
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,960
It must be the one on the right

663
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,120
Ready, three

664
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,480
two

665
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,480
one

666
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,360
Begin

667
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,480
Dark blue in one corner

668
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
Light blue on top

669
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
Like this

670
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,840
Yellow, red like this

671
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,680
It's fine, keep looking

672
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,760
I'll help you

673
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,720
I'll do the hard work for you

674
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,800
They'll definitely find it

675
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,680
Time's up, are you sure?

676
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Correct

677
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,520
Confirmed

678
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,560
Correct answer

679
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,240
Confirmed, correct

680
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,560
Alright, let's look at the next question first

681
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,880
Take a look at this one

682
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Grab it, grab it!

683
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,200
Should we grab it?

684
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,400
I think we should

685
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,480
I see it

686
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,560
Three, two, one

687
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,360
Okay

688
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Zhuocheng

689
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,200
Alright, timer starts now

690
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,040
Be more precise with this one

691
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,760
We missed a spot there

692
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,920
Yes, missed a little bit

693
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,640
Extremely precise

694
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,080
Time's up

695
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Correct answer

696
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,080
And now for our final question

697
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,840
Everyone, look at the question

698
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,240
You can grab it now, I know where it is

699
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,400
Three

700
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,160
Two

701
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,280
One

702
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,480
Dragon

703
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,320
Dragon card position

704
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,560
Alright, 20 seconds starting now

705
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,720
Adjust it a bit

706
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,440
Take a look

707
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,400
Don't miss the blue, upper left corner

708
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,920
Move left, move left

709
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,320
Like this

710
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,680
Move left a bit, then back a little

711
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,600
Yes, don't miss the blue

712
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,480
Okay, got it right?

713
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,920
Correct

714
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,520
Are you sure?

715
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:40,800
Confirmed

716
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,120
Below

717
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,680
Nothing missed below

718
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,640
I'm checking

719
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,560
Good

720
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,040
Congratulations, your answer is correct

721
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,840
So our top-performing clinic this round

722
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,400
is Clinic Number Four

723
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,640
Alright everyone

724
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
We'll now begin our third round of assessment

725
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,200
What should we draw for the third round?

726
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,000
This round we'll draw Qingpi

727
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,320
Good

728
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,360
Medical ring within medical ring

729
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,680
That would be the medicine ring, right?

730
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,160
Now it will be up to my wheel

731
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,720
to determine the first round

732
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,160
of competing clinics

733
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,240
I'll leave it to fate

734
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,800
Alright, Clinic Three will go first.

735
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,680
That's us.

736
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,040
Us.

737
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,320
Right.

738
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,400
Come on, you choose a colored medical rope first.

739
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,320
Let's take green.

740
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,160
Green it is.

741
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,320
So who will face Clinic Three?

742
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,160
Hopefully Clinic One.

743
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,840
Your words have power.

744
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,440
Clinic One versus Clinic Three it is.

745
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,880
Let's go.

746
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,720
Since currently we...

747
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,640
Clinic One and Clinic Three...

748
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,320
Both...

749
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,360
Have 25% mental energy.

750
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,520
So both sides need to...

751
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,240
Play rock-paper-scissors to decide who goes first.

752
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

753
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
Okay, priority is placing five rings.

754
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,440
Spread them out a bit.

755
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Here.

756
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,760
Then we can place one in the middle.

757
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,680
Okay.

758
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,400
Like this?

759
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,200
Yes.

760
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,280
Go ahead, you place yours.

761
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,160
Put it next to theirs.

762
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,960
This would be better.

763
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,760
Here.

764
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes, that works.

765
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,640
This can block.

766
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
Diamond cut diamond.

767
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
Good.

768
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,080
Then we in Clinic Three will go first.

769
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,320
Here, then move to the center.

770
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,840
This isn't really necessary.

771
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,600
I think...

772
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,160
No problem, let's secure this position first.

773
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,960
This is good anyway.

774
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,800
Take this position.

775
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,200
I think either way is fine, up to you.

776
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Let's take this position first.

777
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,600
Okay, no problem.

778
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Actually, this...

779
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Both these locations will work.

780
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
Then let's first...

781
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
First, let's take this...

782
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,920
Let's move this over first.

783
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,400
Either way works.

784
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,600
Very decisive, guys.

785
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,360
Good start.

786
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,240
A good beginning.

787
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,080
The start is usually straightforward.

788
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,520
Place this here.

789
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,120
Yes, that works.

790
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,240
I think...

791
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,320
We need to secure this path.

792
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,000
What do you think?

793
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,240
Sure, that works.

794
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,040
Let's come over here, I think.

795
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,760
What I mean is...

796
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,720
This path of ours...

797
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,240
This route...

798
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,640
If they attack this route, we need to...

799
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,520
Let's come here first.

800
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,000
No problem.

801
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,040
We can still pass through here.

802
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Alright, good.

803
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,680
Right?

804
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,480
This one jumps here

805
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,360
Then this one can also come over

806
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,120
No problem

807
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,040
We can flip one over, right?

808
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Right

809
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,040
Then we can move this first

810
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,120
Moving this first is also fine

811
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,880
Right

812
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,400
To here?

813
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Can only go this far

814
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,280
Only up to here

815
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,720
One of the queen's moves

816
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,000
Here, place it here

817
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
Brilliant

818
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,440
Okay

819
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,440
They actually have been

820
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,120
working on it.

821
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,320
We're working on it here.

822
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,120
Then let's move the green one here.

823
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,040
Okay.

824
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,480
This works, no problem.

825
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,600
No worries.

826
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,840
Don't move, leave this one.

827
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,880
No rush, don't move it.

828
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,920
What impresses me most

829
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,120
about this game is

830
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,720
how you can form a pattern

831
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,120
but it can easily be ruined by others.

832
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,520
Right.

833
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,760
Because one flip can overturn your whole section.

834
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,880
And it's all interconnected.

835
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,200
Exactly.

836
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,800
You know how I feel?

837
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,760
I don't know how to play,

838
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,640
but then

839
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,680
a voice just tells me

840
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,880
what move to make.

841
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,000
I won't accept it.

842
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,720
Alright.

843
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,680
"Kai refuses to concede."

844
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,440
Kai Kai came here specifically

845
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,160
to challenge the "Chess Saint."

846
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,640
You two play.

847
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,880
Wei Xiaolong and I will watch from the side.

848
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
This... right.

849
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,960
Right.

850
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,920
Okay.

851
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,960
Then come over here.

852
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,280
Coming here works.

853
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,360
Their three pieces here are still blocking.

854
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,200
Then let's go.

855
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,400
I'll just

856
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,160
place this one.

857
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I think this should work

858
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,520
Place this here, move this

859
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,080
Then we can directly

860
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,840
Yes

861
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,240
We need to set up defenses along this line

862
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,800
We can also attack

863
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,160
How should we attack?

864
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,000
Our attack comes to this position

865
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
Just come over here

866
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,840
You come here

867
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,120
But how do we make the next move?

868
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,000
All your pieces are stuck here

869
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,280
All the rings are stuck here

870
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,960
What should we do?

871
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,320
But winning one ring first

872
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,440
Isn't really a significant advantage

873
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,280
We can come down here first

874
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,960
Come here

875
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,000
Certain

876
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
No problem

877
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,840
Good, block one end

878
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,800
They'll definitely move this next

879
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,200
Let's move this down

880
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,520
This ring won't be able to move

881
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,640
Right

882
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,280
This is

883
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,120
Logically this is defense

884
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,840
This move of theirs is defensive

885
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,720
Let this one come out first

886
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,840
This one can come out now

887
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,800
I think this move can indeed come out

888
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,400
Okay

889
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
If this comes here

890
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,840
These are all red

891
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Right?

892
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,600
Then we can actually take one

893
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,520
Yes, we can

894
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,320
Then this is our only option.

895
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,480
No need.

896
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,720
Place this one.

897
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,800
If we place this, both rows will be cut off.

898
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,240
Okay, that works.

899
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Now they must defend

900
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,280
All his rings are stuck here

901
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,960
Stuck rings

902
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,200
Tactics

903
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,120
Then I can move this

904
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,600
Right

905
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Okay

906
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,520
Wait a moment

907
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,040
This absolutely cannot be placed

908
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,360
Why?

909
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,480
It's 100% not allowed

910
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,680
If you place this here

911
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,440
They'll take it immediately

912
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
We've been discovered.

913
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,440
Then let's move this one.

914
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:52,800
Right?

915
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,720
It seems we have no choice but to take that path.

916
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,480
Okay, agreed.

917
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,720
Trust me.

918
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,360
One two three four five

919
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,680
After that three comes down, right?

920
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,000
Right

921
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,880
Then it comes down again

922
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,840
We can just take it directly

923
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,560
Then those five will connect

924
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,080
We can try it first

925
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,400
From here, place it here

926
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,680
Yeah, I think so too

927
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
How about we go down here?

928
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,640
Then move this over here.

929
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Let's block this path first.

930
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,440
That should work.

931
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,000
Block three this way.

932
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,680
Agreed.

933
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,240
Very smart. Genius.

934
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,440
This

935
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,280
Put this here

936
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,640
Try it

937
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,400
Can we move this?

938
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,560
This one can move first.

939
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,440
Good move.

940
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,560
Okay.

941
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,240
They'll definitely defend.

942
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,240
Go up

943
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,040
Right

944
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,320
This is the only way

945
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,520
We found it after all

946
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
This is the only thing it can move

947
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Otherwise it can't be blocked

948
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,960
Come down this way

949
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,920
That works

950
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,360
Anyway, I'm all for it

951
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,000
Five moves to decide the outcome

952
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,600
Currently, the advantage on the field is yours

953
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,760
You have more pieces

954
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,840
Where will they move next?

955
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
They can only move here

956
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,440
If they just move from here to here

957
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,840
They'll have five in a row

958
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,600
Right

959
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,640
Or place it here

960
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
So our move should be...

961
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,560
After this piece moves here

962
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,120
He's coming over

963
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,520
We can still go straight up

964
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,680
And break their formation

965
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,160
Then this would make five in a row

966
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,440
Our own connections don't count (for them)

967
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,560
Let's make the move

968
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,800
Later

969
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,760
Let me see

970
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,440
You've moved

971
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
You've already moved

972
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,080
Okay

973
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,040
Alright, trust

974
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,400
Let's move from here to here

975
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,600
If that piece can't move then

976
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,440
Then what?

977
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,360
So

978
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,200
We're not moving now, right?

979
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,800
He's definitely going to flip this piece

980
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,280
And then?

981
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,920
So we'll

982
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,640
They flip this one

983
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,200
Moving this is also possible

984
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Feel like we could let them take it

985
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,200
Otherwise we'll lose pieces

986
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,880
They have more pieces

987
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,120
Then they'll win

988
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,800
This loud scheming

989
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,680
Isn't it a bit too loud?

990
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,480
Then we don't necessarily have to take

991
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,640
Even if left open, I won't take it

992
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,760
I just want to bet with you

993
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,080
Who has more pieces

994
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,080
If there's a loop, will you take?

995
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,560
Let's see, see what move they make

996
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,840
But I think

997
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,320
It depends on how we move

998
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,440
Closest to victory

999
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,480
I don't think it's about

1000
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,200
Having to use that method

1001
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
I think if we can use this method

1002
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,720
To quickly achieve victory

1003
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,200
I think

1004
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,320
It would be very good for us

1005
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,480
Then let's go

1006
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,160
We don't have

1007
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,680
Then let's go

1008
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,320
Move here?

1009
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,360
No problem

1010
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,240
Okay, your turn, final move

1011
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,160
Okay

1012
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,040
Right

1013
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,800
Exactly, that's correct

1014
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,200
Two, four, six, fifteen

1015
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,080
Good, no need to count that side

1016
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,960
There were originally thirty

1017
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,360
It's a tie

1018
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
All used up

1019
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,240
Damn it

1020
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,840
For the first time in eighty years

1021
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,400
A tie in the medical ring cycle

1022
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,200
A respectable opponent

1023
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,360
An evenly matched opponent

1024
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,280
Yes, an evenly matched opponent

1025
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,400
Let our Clinic 4 go first

1026
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,200
Now these two have it trapped.

1027
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,600
These two have trapped it.

1028
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,880
This seems to be the situation.

1029
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,720
It appears...

1030
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,040
Alright, first move.

1031
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,160
Go ahead.

1032
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,880
I know what to play, wait.

1033
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,360
Let's place it here.

1034
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,520
You place first.

1035
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,040
Confirmed.

1036
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,520
Okay.

1037
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,080
Confirmed.

1038
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
Move the red one up.

1039
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,520
That would block our path.

1040
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,760
If that's the logic...

1041
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,200
Should we move this green ring...

1042
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,280
to that edge?

1043
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,600
Actually, if this one...

1044
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,360
Would work, right?

1045
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:09,920
Yes.

1046
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,960
I think it would work.

1047
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,920
I want to move that piece to the far left.

1048
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,320
Then connect that green one...

1049
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,080
like this downward.

1050
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,920
Agreed, let's go.

1051
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Here, red's move.

1052
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,560
I think we can approach his red one.

1053
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,080
We can change his red one.

1054
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,400
Then block his two red rings.

1055
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,360
Agreed.

1056
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,240
Okay.

1057
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,880
Should we move the bottom one up instead?

1058
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,160
This one in the lower right corner?

1059
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,840
Yes.

1060
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,160
What if I take my two

1061
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,520
flip it over

1062
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,480
then change that one back

1063
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,600
Okay

1064
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,760
Right

1065
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,360
Let's go

1066
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,120
Take a look

1067
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,080
The green one closest to them

1068
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,000
Right, the green one ahead on this side

1069
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,680
Jump here

1070
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,360
Jump to the left

1071
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,000
Block them

1072
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,880
That one jumps over and flips it

1073
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,000
So you only jump

1074
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,920
Just one step, right?

1075
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,200
Yes

1076
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,360
Just one jump will block it

1077
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,640
Right, then over here you do this

1078
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,520
Then

1079
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,920
Okay

1080
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,880
Place it here

1081
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,600
He changed our three

1082
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,440
But we can directly

1083
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,640
Our green one can jump first

1084
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,560
The second green one

1085
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Directly change it back

1086
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
Then our own

1087
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,560
These three are back

1088
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,560
So we effectively have this row

1089
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,440
Four five

1090
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,760
Four currently

1091
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,360
Yes, I think this move works

1092
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,080
That's it

1093
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,600
That green loop we just passed

1094
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,160
Right?

1095
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,080
I want to place one over there

1096
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,280
Place one and then move upward

1097
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,160
Then we'll connect four

1098
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,600
Connect four

1099
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
It definitely won't change us now

1100
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,960
But we could also

1101
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,240
Change that one

1102
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,360
I think it's possible

1103
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,120
Let's try

1104
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,960
Yes, I think it'll work

1105
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,800
Now we can only

1106
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,080
Cut off one path

1107
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,480
Or they'll take it

1108
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,040
Or just cut that one directly

1109
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,160
You mean that one, right?

1110
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,040
Can be cut

1111
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,040
He's just one step away now.

1112
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
One more step and it's done, right?

1113
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,840
If we don't handle this,

1114
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,440
we must deal with it.

1115
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,680
I think we should block it.

1116
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,120
Don't let

1117
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,040
Let's do it this way first.

1118
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,920
You need to come over.

1119
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,680
Move.

1120
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Right.

1121
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,080
Then let's follow the quick capture strategy

1122
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,000
using the chess capture approach

1123
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,840
We'll proceed according to the correct situation

1124
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
to change his position

1125
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,120
We can try it, right?

1126
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,280
Right? Also secure one side

1127
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,880
Then change his position again

1128
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,360
Yes, that works

1129
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,440
Correct

1130
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,200
We have ten now, they have nine

1131
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,280
They want to (close the loop)

1132
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,520
Because we added two

1133
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,600
They lost one

1134
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,920
Effectively we've regained three

1135
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,200
Right, let's observe first

1136
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,400
I think

1137
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,120
there's no immediate threat to us now

1138
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,560
We should focus on our own moves

1139
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Then let's take that one down

1140
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,280
Agreed

1141
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,400
Next move

1142
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,960
This is the move

1143
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,240
I knew they would make this move

1144
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,720
Move

1145
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,520
It's just

1146
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,040
We just have one more than them

1147
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,720
Go ahead

1148
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,520
This guy...

1149
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,000
He can overturn so many of our pieces in one move.

1150
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,840
Did you notice?

1151
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,000
He can in one move...

1152
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,040
He directly succeeded...

1153
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,520
So now I must block the center first.

1154
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,360
Then transform three pieces.

1155
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,640
Yes, right.

1156
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,480
Must block it, right? Just like this.

1157
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,120
He made a really good move here.

1158
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,840
That ring of his

1159
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,760
There are already four red ones here

1160
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,040
So

1161
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,640
He currently has two (lines) four

1162
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:11,880
Right

1163
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,320
So we must break this line

1164
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:13,960
Okay

1165
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,160
I understand

1166
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,360
Let's go

1167
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:36,920
Wait a moment

1168
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,960
That's already five right away

1169
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,480
Get off here, then jump over.

1170
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,880
This is the place.

1171
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,840
Yes, it's changed now.

1172
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,360
Yes.

1173
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,240
Right.

1174
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,560
They've collected the rings.

1175
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,840
We need to choose which rings to collect.

1176
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,360
Think about it.

1177
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,960
The one at the very edge.

1178
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,160
I think so, right?

1179
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,640
Right.

1180
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,280
Let's collect them.

1181
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,600
Okay, you guys.

1182
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,360
Done collecting.

1183
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,720
I want to be here, then jump to this spot.

1184
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,200
Kai just won't let me go.

1185
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,640
I think the green formation is really good.

1186
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,520
Exactly.

1187
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,800
But red still has a chance.

1188
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,000
He can't move anymore.

1189
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,320
Move.

1190
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,840
This time it's directly five, right?

1191
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,920
Brother Kai didn't show any mercy at all.

1192
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,920
Of course, he wouldn't.

1193
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,320
Ended it outright.

1194
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,440
That was an instant victory.

1195
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,840
So you just noticed it, right?

1196
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,080
I didn’t see it either.

1197
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,720
Let’s go.

1198
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,320
For Clinic Four, let’s first discuss

1199
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,480
our strategy

1200
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,960
and some thoughts, alright?

1201
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,200
The "Chess King" said,

1202
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,720
"I think

1203
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,680
from the start, we should focus on encircling

1204
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,760
rather than competing with them

1205
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,960
over the number of pieces.

1206
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,080
Then, during the game,

1207
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,880
we should observe

1208
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,680
and try to form as many lines as possible."

1209
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,320
I want to be here, then jump to this spot.

1210
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,840
This is our third assessment

1211
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,240
The second round of matches has concluded

1212
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,880
This round was won by Clinic Four

1213
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,120
Successfully accumulated

1214
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,240
20% of mental energy

1215
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,480
So today's acting hall leader

1216
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,160
is Huang Kai from Clinic Four

1217
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,960
and Wei Xiaolong

1218
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,000
After being separated from the hall leader position for so long

1219
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,480
today we've finally obtained it

1220
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,240
Do you have anything to say?

1221
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,800
You go first

1222
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,960
Well, I just came in first

1223
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,800
When we lost the first round, I was anxious

1224
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Extremely anxious

1225
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,920
What? Anxious or angry?

1226
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,560
Both anxious and angry

1227
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,200
Both anxious and angry

1228
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,200
The anxiety and anger overwhelmed me

1229
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,160
Yes, to be honest at that time

1230
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,480
I just felt

1231
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,200
that we should have played more steadily

1232
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,160
I really think Brother Kai was

1233
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,120
being praised a bit too much

1234
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,880
Do you have anything to say to Brother Kai?

1235
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,360
Show your appreciation

1236
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,760
Thank you, Brother Kai

1237
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,000
I want to say it's mainly because we

1238
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I want to say

1239
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,880
"Kai's Dictatorship"

1240
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,800
No, our three rounds

1241
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,520
Because the second round was crucial too

1242
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,720
We did lose the first round

1243
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,920
My mindset at the time was

1244
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,400
It really didn't matter

1245
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,440
At worst we'd accept the extra service

1246
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,240
But until the very end

1247
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,600
who knew what the outcome would be?

1248
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,160
So we just gave it our all

1249
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,080
Indeed we took first place today

1250
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,960
Both of us contributed greatly

1251
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,640
Good

1252
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,440
Now comes this episode's

1253
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,520
most ceremonious segment

1254
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,040
Our acting hall leader

1255
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,960
inauguration ceremony

1256
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,560
Come, bring the gourd

1257
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,800
Okay

1258
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,360
Take the gourd that represents

1259
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,120
our acting hall leader

1260
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,240
Whenever a new acting hall master takes office,

1261
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:37,840
they will receive

1262
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,440
a thoughtful mental enhancement service.

1263
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,400
Now since this time

1264
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,920
we only have one fourth-place finisher,

1265
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,880
which means

1266
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,560
only our Clinic Two

1267
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,480
needs to receive

1268
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,480
the enhancement service.

1269
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,120
Since we have two enhancement services,

1270
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,920
you two will each

1271
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,000
receive one service.

1272
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,360
Agreed?

1273
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,160
Agreed.

1274
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,200
What are these two services?

1275
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,080
Do you remember?

1276
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Skin care.

1277
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,120
Skin care? Wishful thinking.

1278
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,880
In the scorching heat, there seems to be

1279
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,040
These two services are:

1280
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,280
A refreshing,

1281
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,320
smooth summer skin treatment,

1282
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,120
and a seamless

1283
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,040
spicy calorie boost.

1284
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,080
Come on, you two choose.

1285
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,400
Let the hall master decide.

1286
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,360
We don't have that authority.

1287
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,320
No, my logic is:

1288
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,240
just pick the first one.

1289
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,120
When in doubt,

1290
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,200
I always choose the first option.

1291
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,280
The first one.

1292
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:27,560
Right.

1293
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,560
I'm your first.

1294
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,760
Good, then we'll do

1295
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,520
the skin treatment first.

1296
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,480
Bring out the props.

1297
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,320
What is it?

1298
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,480
I don't even know.

1299
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,240
Is this leg waxing?

1300
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,760
Actual leg waxing.

1301
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,200
This was prepared for two people,

1302
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,160
but since there's only one,

1303
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,280
you'll need to do both legs.

1304
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,520
Show me your leg

1305
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,680
Stretch out your leg

1306
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,200
Roll up both of them

1307
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,600
Just lay it sideways

1308
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Sideways is good

1309
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,760
It's on

1310
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,920
Are you ready?

1311
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,400
Better a short pain than a long one

1312
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,240
Lift

1313
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,800
It's okay.

1314
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,240
Peng, I wanted to ask how it feels.

1315
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,240
It's kind of like...

1316
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,080
that prickling sensation.

1317
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,760
Not too painful, though.

1318
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,000
And it doesn't hurt now.

1319
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,320
Right now...

1320
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,040
It was just a brief moment of pain.

1321
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,960
Now there's no feeling at all.

1322
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,560
It's just that now...

1323
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,440
its shape is kind of...

1324
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,240
Alright.

1325
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,760
Let's apply our...

1326
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,200
Spicy Heat Boost.

1327
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,760
Heat Boost.

1328
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,200
Late-night snack?

1329
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,920
Wasabi and chili.

1330
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,920
And goggles.

1331
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,040
You really can handle spicy food.

1332
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,160
Let me explain.

1333
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,640
About this premium service's

1334
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,080
specific implementation method.

1335
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,960
Put on the blindfold.

1336
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,760
Feed Minghao this.

1337
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,560
It should be spicy chicken noodles.

1338
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,440
Yes, spicy chicken noodles.

1339
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,680
Then Minghao needs to wear these

1340
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,520
windproof goggles.

1341
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,600
Right, because I'll use this air blower

1342
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,520
to help the noodles enter his mouth better.

1343
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,400
Blow them in, right?

1344
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,800
Do you know my surname?

1345
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,400
I know.

1346
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,440
"Blow" Shaoyang.

1347
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,480
Sorry, that was a terrible pun.

1348
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,080
Today I

1349
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,120
Come on.

1350
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,760
You need to wear this, you have to

1351
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,240
Right.

1352
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,920
Okay, let's go.

1353
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,880
Ready?

1354
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,240
Ready.

1355
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,120
If you're ready, let's begin.

1356
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,800
Go.

1357
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,840
Three, two, one.

1358
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,800
Start.

1359
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,800
Cui Shaoyang is helping him blow on the noodles

1360
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,640
so he can eat less

1361
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,120
I feel like I'm about to eat some too

1362
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,080
One more bite

1363
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,680
Okay

1364
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,520
Wipe your mouth

1365
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,120
Let him wipe his mouth

1366
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,800
I feel like I've received

1367
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,240
multiple brain-boosting services at once

1368
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,800
Is it spicy? Let me ask

1369
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,200
A little

1370
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,240
It's slightly beyond

1371
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,520
my spice tolerance

1372
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:23,920
But it's okay

1373
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,360
Do you think my style

1374
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,240
has provided you with some emotional value

1375
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,320
You've certainly made us emotional

1376
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,600
Good

1377
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,480
Hope today's excitement and spiciness

1378
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,640
have let everyone exercise their brains

1379
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,880
while also having fun

1380
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,120
So this episode of "Let's Start Thinking"

1381
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,240
is coming to an end

1382
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,960
Finally

1383
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,360
let's shout our slogan again

1384
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,200
Let's start thinking

1385
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,160
Unlock your brainpower

1386
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,440
We'll see you

1387
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,160
next time

1388
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,040
Let's discuss how to divide this

1389
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,160
Who's discussing with you?

1390
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,440
We'll take it ourselves

1391
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,640
This is the only way

1392
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,720
Become his stepping stone

1393
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,760
Why would you say that?

1394
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,560
Not letting me play, huh?

1395
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,520
Red card

1396
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,920
Genius

1397
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,440
I feel like we're being blocked by three sides

1398
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,280
Let's push one

1399
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,000
Go ahead, I'll start.

1400
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,520
Here.

1401
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,120
Gone.

1402
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,640
Two blacks.

1403
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,720
This is so counterintuitive.

1404
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,680
I don't think this is possible.

1405
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,280
This is crazy.

1406
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,760
If you come here, he'll take it.

1407
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,480
It's over.

1408
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,240
Is the pressure this intense?

1409
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,680
Fine, you win.

1410
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,880
Do the first two have a 2?

1411
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,720
No.

1412
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,640
Actually, yes.

1413
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:32,880
Very close.

1414
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,920
Both sides are close.

1415
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,320
Okay, it's clear now.

1416
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,800
Why is it always missing?

1417
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Our one-in-three guesses...

1418
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,240
...seem to never be right.

1419
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,560
Prediction failed.

1420
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,960
It's a fifty-fifty chance, right?

1421
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,680
But not necessarily.

1422
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,560
What if you guess correctly this time?

1423
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,960
Leave it to fate.
