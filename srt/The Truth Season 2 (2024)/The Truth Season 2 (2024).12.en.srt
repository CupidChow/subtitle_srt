1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome everyone back to

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,400
the show sponsored by

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,840
all you bulldozer fans

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,120
"Let's Push It! X"

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm still your old friend

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,800
Cui Shaoyang

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,400
After the tragedy in 1924

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,640
at the Push Joy Gate

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,360
our Push Mystery

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,440
also mysteriously died in the clock's interlayer

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,720
Through Helimo Yu Wang's relentless efforts

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,880
we not only uncovered the true culprit Ke Musan

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,040
we not only uncovered the true culprit Ke Musan

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,120
and Young Marshal X Ning

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,480
but also discovered

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
a time tunnel to the future

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,600
exposing Push Mystery's ugly truth

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,920
Now then

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,760
how did Ke Musan

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,480
pass X's test

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,520
and how did these two

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,120
deceive everyone in plain sight?

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,720
Let's all find out together in

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,600
"Let's Push It! X"

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,560
Character riddle

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
Joy on the brows

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,080
What does it mean?

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,200
Let me see this X challenge

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,160
Can this assassin pass it?

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,960
Character riddle

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,640
What's the meaning?

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,440
Guess one character from both sides of "bank"

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,600
Character riddle

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,920
Take initiative

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,600
Meeting from a thousand miles

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
Character riddle

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,240
I fear character riddles most

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
What's this guessing about?

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,240
Character riddle

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
Half wrong guess

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,600
Enter factory at eleven

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,040
What does "enter factory at eleven" mean?

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,240
Both sides of the bank

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,840
Dismantle

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,480
Character decomposition

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,840
The metal radical comes over here

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,520
The right half of this character

48
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Is this a character?

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,600
If we're decomposing characters

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,720
Then there's also this

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,680
Guessed correctly

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,000
Really?

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,680
"Shi" (scholar)

54
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,920
What character is "shi" plus "mu"?

55
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,920
Hence "joy above the brows"

56
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,440
Meaning the top part of "xi" which is this "shi"

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,200
Placed on top of the "brow" character

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,280
So we remove this

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,240
And add a "shi" on top

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,040
Which becomes the character for "sound"

61
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,760
The first two characters stacked together

62
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,320
A thousand li meeting

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,040
Double

64
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,200
Half wrong guess

65
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Same, using half

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,560
It's the character "hunt"

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Hunter's "hunt"

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,760
"Master" can move a bit

69
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,320
Then when "master" moves, it becomes "jade"

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,520
Why?

71
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,920
Because it moved just a little

72
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,400
Only moved a tiny bit

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
Then move this dot

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,840
Oh no, now we'll have an X again

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,720
Because this is too easy

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
Then X is either me or him

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,320
Probably not him

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
Then it must be me

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,360
If someone asks me to be X

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
Can I refuse?

81
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,760
Because I figured it out too

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,320
No, can't refuse

83
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,400
Can't refuse?

84
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Then can I not cooperate?

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,040
Can we really play like this?

86
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,760
I don't know

87
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,840
There are no rules about this

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,000
If chosen, you must be the murderer's accomplice

89
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,200
I don't want to help the accomplice

90
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,720
I lose

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,560
I don't want to help either

92
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
I don't want to help the "killer"

93
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm an upright person

94
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,000
Forget that I'm X

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
Go find the real culprit

96
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,600
Pressure

97
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,400
The "ya" from "pressure"

98
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,520
Yes, yes, that's right

99
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,320
Congratulations on passing X's test

100
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,240
If you had to choose an X, who would you pick?

101
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
I would choose

102
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Young Master Ning

103
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,280
Actually, Young Master Ning

104
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,600
is very sharp about

105
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,440
evidentiary details

106
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,040
and makes connections quickly

107
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,160
So I think

108
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,560
if he spots even

109
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,280
a small piece of evidence

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,760
related to me

111
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,880
he could quickly lead

112
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,600
everyone to focus on me

113
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,760
This was my experience before amnesia

114
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,680
Do you remember before amnesia?

115
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,480
Later my parents helped me remember

116
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,720
My brother can vouch for me

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,760
What if they're lying to you?

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,680
How do you prove they're really your parents?

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
If I knock him out tonight

120
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,280
and tell him I'm his brother tomorrow

121
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,240
he'd believe it

122
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,880
So couldn't this brother be fake too?

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,360
I'm really afraid of this situation happening

124
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,840
So I think

125
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,120
To protect (myself)

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,280
At least ensure safety in this aspect

127
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
I still hope

128
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
To bring him into my team

129
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
It's like "selection over prohibition" I think

130
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,960
And another thing is

131
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,600
Ning Shaoshuai just acted as X once

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,960
So actually people's initial suspicion of him

133
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Might naturally be higher

134
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,600
But if we think about it the other way

135
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,040
Since he's already been X once

136
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,440
Couldn't that mean he can't be X this time?

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,760
Why are you laughing?

138
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,960
Just you wait

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Just you wait

140
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,960
Today, you'll see what I'll do

141
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,520
When he comes out, he'll definitely say he's X

142
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
Hello, X

143
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,680
See that?

144
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,000
The real X

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
They only opened the door this much

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
Look

147
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,800
You're X

148
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,440
I can't say

149
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,520
That means this place is called Tui Lao Hui.

150
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,040
Like this.

151
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,440
Let's search this place first, okay?

152
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,720
There's a journal here.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,720
I decided to become his muse.

154
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,120
And encouraged him to start a brand.

155
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,800
Who wrote this?

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,680
This was written by a man.

157
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,480
Right, who is that man?

158
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,320
Do you know who this man is?

159
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,960
I don't know.

160
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,520
Is it you?

161
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
How could you not know?

162
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
Why should he know?

163
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,640
How could you not know?

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,240
Bro, I can't cover for you on this.

165
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,520
How could you not know?

166
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,920
It's you.

167
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,360
Here's the current issue we're facing

168
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,840
Look

169
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,800
February 5th

170
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,840
I met a fairy at Tui Jiankang

171
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,560
She was wearing a qipao

172
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Sitting quietly in a retro-style room

173
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,760
What kind of person

174
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,640
would describe this room as retro?

175
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,440
Modern people

176
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,640
Exactly

177
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,040
would think that way

178
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,000
And this is...

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Is this you?

180
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,320
Who else could it be?

181
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,440
Could it not be me?

182
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
This is the present-day you, right?

183
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,440
I don't remember

184
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
He might be Jiawei

185
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,880
He might indeed be Jiawei

186
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,080
He's not from this era

187
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,840
Right

188
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,080
So his memories are confused

189
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,800
Correct

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Alright

191
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
Is our deduction complete now?

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Is there anything else you need to confess?

193
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm not Jiawei

194
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,480
Then who are you?

195
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm Commander He

196
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,280
You're lying

197
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,120
You've already regained your memories

198
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,000
What else can you say?

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,360
Is it time for torture now?

200
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,840
Bring it on

201
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,600
Tie him up

202
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,080
Come on, hurry, tie him to the bed

203
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,520
Bind him

204
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,280
Little brother

205
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,520
Nobody touches him

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,640
Let's search for more information.

207
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,440
Okay?

208
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
There should be a lot of information here.

209
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,240
"The Big Scoop of Tui Town"

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,000
Featuring the Centennial Figure—Young Marshal He

211
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,240
1904 to 1997

212
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,360
Many outstanding actors emerged among his descendants.

213
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,880
Young actor He Jiawei has received widespread acclaim.

214
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240
A unique mole on his nose

215
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,080
has also become

216
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
the latest trend among beauty bloggers.

217
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,000
So you must be He Jiawei.

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,560
This mole can't be faked.

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
He Jiawei

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
It's you.

221
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,000
No need to deny it.

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Young Marshal He didn’t have this mole.

223
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,400
He Jiawei

224
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,040
The entire Sanjia Alley

225
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,640
Only the Tuile Gate has a mechanical clock

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,640
This clock has a specially designed hidden compartment

227
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,000
By touching a specific mechanism at the center of the clock face

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,800
You can open the hidden compartment

229
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
There's one logical conclusion:

230
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,280
I think it's a modern person

231
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,400
Who saw this in modern times

232
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,480
Then traveled back to ancient times

233
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,040
Exactly

234
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,640
Right?

235
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,440
Exactly

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,280
Now the modern people we know about

237
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,520
One is him

238
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
And the other is Ba Duanjin, right?

239
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,120
Correct

240
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,680
So the killer is obvious

241
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,200
Yes

242
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,680
Help me, help me

243
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Please begin your performance

244
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,960
Jiawei, stop pretending, Jiawei

245
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,240
But it was brilliant

246
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,000
As your Mr. X, this pains me

247
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
Were you exposed this quickly?

248
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Why can't it be you?

249
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,440
Ke Musan

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
Ke Musan in this world

251
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
Where is there

252
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
We saw traces of him being here today

253
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,160
It's possible

254
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,960
Brother Bai

255
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,520
Who do you think it is?

256
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,080
I think he's highly suspicious.

257
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,880
Me?

258
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
What?

259
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Why me?

260
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
What are you laughing at?

261
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,880
No reason.

262
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
I just...

263
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
feel that...

264
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,680
Right.

265
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,520
So who do you think it is?

266
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
I think it's like this...

267
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
My logic is the same as last round.

268
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,520
I believe they must be...

269
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,440
This must be...

270
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,680
There's one person who's completely innocent.

271
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,760
Judging from the timeline...

272
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,880
What is she?

273
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,440
Regarding the sunflower incident...

274
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,080
She said the sunflower woman saved her.

275
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
This mystery remains unsolved.

276
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,560
It's very obvious that...

277
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,400
He didn't clarify the amnesia part.

278
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
Ke Shaoshuai might...

279
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,760
He's from modern times.

280
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,520
Right?

281
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,440
That means...

282
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,680
He has equal murder motive too.

283
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,760
Yes.

284
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,000
So each of them...

285
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,880
has some degree of...

286
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,120
things we haven't fully figured out.

287
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,920
Therefore...

288
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,480
Ultimately I think it depends on personal judgment.

289
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,560
Okay.

290
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,720
My vote for the murderer goes to Commander He

291
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,960
Voting for Commander He

292
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,720
Thank you all, of course

293
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,400
I'm honored to be this episode's X again

294
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,360
First of all

295
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
I want to thank all my brothers for trusting me

296
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,800
Why do you always choose me as X when I'm the detective?

297
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,360
I just feel that

298
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,840
This gives me quite a headache

299
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,920
Because it's also a kind of sweet burden

300
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,080
I also hope next time

301
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,760
you won't vote me as X anymore, okay?

302
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,000
Let me have some sense of participation

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,040
Every time I end up helping

304
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,800
the murderer make excuses

305
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,160
Never getting a chance to identify the murderer

306
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,120
Thank you all, of course

307
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,920
Thank you everyone

308
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,160
My real suspect is Kemusan

309
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
Kemusan

310
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,200
Commander Ke

311
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,960
Voting for Kemusan

312
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,520
Congratulations everyone for guessing correctly

313
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,720
And the real X

314
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,040
Please Commander Ke, step forward to him

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520
We failed, brothers

316
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,320
It must be him.

317
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
I knew it.

318
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,520
Twice

319
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,320
So please share

320
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,720
How do you always guess it's me?

321
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Because I'm not

322
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,920
Because whenever it's

323
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,560
Once that (is X)

324
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,920
I try not to show my preference

325
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,960
Who I support or oppose

326
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,160
I say I support or oppose everyone

327
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
That's his approach

328
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,960
Really

329
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
What you said is correct

330
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,040
In the future, we really won't be able to identify the killer

331
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,720
We can use X to identify the killer

332
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,640
Yes

333
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,920
Yes

334
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Next time if you're (the killer) again

335
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,080
Don't trust me so much

336
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,040
Don't trust me so much

337
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
Because I feel a lot of pressure

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
It's a kind of burden

339
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,840
There's pressure

340
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,720
But it's a sweet kind of pressure

341
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
A sweet burden

342
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,840
Then next time I hope you'll keep it sweet

343
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,840
That's not impossible

344
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,160
Okay

345
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,320
Now we come to

346
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,240
The golden key awarding segment

347
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,000
Who hasn't gotten the golden key twice in a row?

348
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,920
Who hasn't gotten it twice in a row?

349
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,240
?

350
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,720
No one, right?

351
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
You

352
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,640
There really is

353
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,880
Brother Ning

354
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,920
Brother Ning

355
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,320
It's you

356
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,040
Although both of you failed

357
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,760
And though Young Marshal Ning didn't get the golden key again

358
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,880
The process itself was still quite thrilling

359
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,640
So, what is the truth behind this story?

360
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,120
Everyone, take a look

361
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,160
I am Kemusan.

362
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
I've always admired

363
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,600
a colleague from my company

364
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,200
Dr. Ba Duanjin who mentored me during my internship.

365
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
After February 7th last year,

366
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,160
Ba Duanjin suddenly disappeared from the company.

367
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,680
The company then announced Ba Duanjin was fired for misconduct.

368
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,720
I found the situation suspicious,

369
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
so I investigated within the company for nearly a year.

370
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
I discovered our boss Tui Shenmi has issues.

371
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,720
Not only did he

372
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,560
build a mysterious Zone B in the company,

373
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,760
but also kept

374
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,440
an unconscious woman in his office.

375
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,480
The unconscious woman was clutching

376
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,400
a letter

377
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,080
pleading for help addressed to someone named Wang Chuanshuo.

378
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,960
I couldn't take the woman with me yet,

379
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,560
so I only took the letter.

380
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,960
Then I secretly infiltrated Zone B,

381
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,720
discovered its full scope,

382
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,080
and groped through a strange passageway.

383
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,560
At the end was an unfamiliar world

384
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,400
that looked

385
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,720
like a retro cabaret.

386
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
The cabaret was called Tuilemen.

387
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,160
Newspapers here stated

388
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,520
the year was 1924,

389
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,440
and there was a singer here

390
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
named Wang Chuanshuo.

391
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,880
I casually placed the unconscious woman's letter

392
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,040
in this Wang Chuanshuo's room.

393
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,560
At that time I didn't quite understand

394
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
what exactly had happened

395
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,080
But I saw six people here

396
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,240
investigating something

397
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,720
There's a murder motive, right?

398
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,080
There should indeed be a murder motive

399
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,320
He thought Brother Le had killed Fenghuang

400
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,120
Among these six people

401
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,640
one was that legendary Wang

402
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,160
and another looked exactly like me

403
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,400
This person was called Ke Shaoshuai

404
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,200
who was actually my great-grandfather

405
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,640
Moreover

406
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,080
there was a woman who looked like Ba Duanjin

407
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
I secretly followed and listened for a while

408
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,960
I heard them mention Tui Shenmi

409
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,600
and talk about pop star deals

410
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,960
And I realized

411
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,880
that woman's speech and behavior

412
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,520
were different from Ba Duanjin's

413
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,000
She definitely wasn't Ba Duanjin

414
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,720
From their conversation

415
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,200
they seemed to mention

416
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,600
a girl wearing sunflower accessories

417
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,320
had been killed

418
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,880
Could it possibly be Brother Le?

419
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400
He killed this girl

420
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,600
Though I'd never seen her

421
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,120
Isn't this exactly Ba Duanjin?

422
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,600
He was really framed and killed by Tui Shenmi

423
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,320
I must avenge her

424
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,640
While following and observing these six people

425
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,520
I was thinking about how to kill Tui Shenmi

426
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,960
After the six solved the case

427
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,040
my great-grandfather also left

428
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,480
Tui Shenmi searched Tui Lemen's room

429
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,920
After coming out

430
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,800
he actually said he would kill Tui Shenmi too

431
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,000
But I was worried Grandpa would alert the enemy

432
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,240
so I could only follow him

433
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,560
until these six people went to Dongnao Hall

434
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,080
to treat a man named Commander He for amnesia

435
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,800
Grandpa found an opportunity

436
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,520
to leave Dongnao Hall alone

437
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,840
A plan occurred to me

438
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,400
I could assume Grandpa's identity at this moment

439
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,720
find Tui Shenmi

440
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
Using magazines from the company rack

441
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,800
that I'd seen before

442
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,960
the clock with a special compartment at Tuile Gate

443
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,160
kill Tui Shenmi

444
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,200
and hide the body in the clock's compartment

445
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,520
As long as Tui Shenmi's body isn't discovered

446
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,120
no one would suspect me

447
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,240
I knocked Grandpa unconscious

448
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
and hid him in the abandoned boat

449
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,960
behind the shop opposite Tuile Gate

450
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,760
Then I returned to Tuile Gate

451
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,840
I saw light in Tui Shenmi's room

452
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,240
so I quickly wrote a letter

453
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,520
and slipped it under Tui Shenmi's door

454
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,920
Arrange to meet him in the passage behind the giant clock

455
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,280
Then guide him to feel the clock face

456
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,600
to unlock the passage

457
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,520
This way, I can slip through

458
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,280
the gaps in the clock face to kill him

459
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,800
After stuffing this letter

460
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,640
I immediately ran downstairs

461
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,440
grabbed

462
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,000
a dinner knife from the lobby of the Tui Le Gate

463
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
and hid inside the clock's hidden compartment

464
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,600
Soon after,

465
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
Tui Shenmi indeed came downstairs as promised.

466
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,040
He tried to feel around the giant clock,

467
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,400
searching for the passageway button.

468
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,480
Seizing the opportunity, I struck

469
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,760
through the clock's crevice and pierced his heart.

470
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,200
He slowly collapsed,

471
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,360
losing his life.

472
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,280
No longer moving.

473
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,880
To seal the clock's hidden compartment,

474
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
I tore off the microphone wires

475
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,880
from the Tui Le Men stage.

476
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,160
Then I bound Tui Shenmi in a spread-eagle position

477
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
and secured him inside the compartment.

478
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,440
Later, I found a key on his body.

479
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,920
While trying to figure out what this key was for,

480
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,120
during my investigation,

481
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
I opened Tui Shenmi's

482
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,440
cabinet in the Tui Le Men room

483
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,800
and discovered Tui Shenmi's real secret

484
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,320
There was a space-time rift stabilizer hidden here

485
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,240
I finally confirmed

486
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,160
he was using this device

487
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,600
to transport people from this timeline to that one

488
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,200
for his so-called business

489
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,480
And Ba Duanjin

490
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,720
must have been fired and killed by Tui Shenmi

491
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,160
after discovering this passageway

492
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,600
I immediately decided

493
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
to destroy this evil passage

494
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
Not just for Ba Duanjin's sake

495
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
but for countless other lives

496
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
I smashed the machine

497
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,680
and planned to use the final 24 hours

498
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,240
before the passage completely closed

499
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,800
to find Ba Duanjin's belongings

500
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,960
and bring them back to modern times

501
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
So I continued to substitute for Taiye

502
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,320
and went to Dong Nao Tang

503
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,240
to treat Young Marshal He

504
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,480
Thank you for watching this week's

505
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,080
"Let's Deduce! X"

506
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,360
To know what happens next

507
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,280
please tune in next time

508
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,080
when Shaoyang continues the explanation
