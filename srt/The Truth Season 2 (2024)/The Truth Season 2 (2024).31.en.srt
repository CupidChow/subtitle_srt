1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,440
A Bag of Sect Leaders

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,680
Everyone can pair up

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,440
and give it a try inside

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,200
Start

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Correct answer

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,760
I haven't clearly seen those words yet

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,360
Everyone, please leave

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,720
Go back

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,160
Please leave

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
We don't need to play anymore

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,240
Strike backward

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,880
Charge forward—behind you, behind!

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,640
Go straight, go straight

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,680
Behind

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,360
Yes

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,360
My hammer

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,120
Backwards, charge charge charge

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,840
Broken again

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Which way exactly?

20
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm so tired

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
I think I'm a failed commander

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
We accept brain enhancement

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,040
Alright everyone

24
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,640
Let's begin

25
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,600
Let's go with this one

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,840
Go ahead

27
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,280
Eat it, the red one

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,880
What if it's black?

29
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,040
Is this black?

30
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,400
Yes

31
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,120
Then let it eat it

32
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,160
Just eat it directly

33
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,920
Black

34
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,040
Then you win

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,640
Let me think

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,760
I'll start figuring it out now

37
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,960
Eat one

38
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
You only lose after eating four

39
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
We don't seem to have a choice now

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Come on

41
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,040
Welcome to

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,480
"Let's Start Using Our Brains"

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,080
This is the renowned

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
century-old pharmacy

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,960
Brainstorm Hall

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm the assistant to the head of Brainstorm Hall

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,800
Cui Shaoyang

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,600
From 1924 to 2004

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,680
our Brainstorm Hall

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,160
has thrived for 80 years

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,800
Of course

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,720
this wouldn't be possible without every

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,240
acting head's relentless efforts

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
Now then

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
let me remind everyone

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,600
about the rules

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Starting this episode

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,160
the assessment rules have been upgraded

59
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Four clinics will compete through three rounds

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,120
to achieve victory

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
First, we need to announce

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,160
the most highly anticipated

63
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,440
and most eagerly awaited

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,800
two mental enhancement services of this edition

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,040
They are:

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,360
Fearless

67
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,440
The Courage Enhancement Service for aspiring lone warriors

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,200
Courage Enhancement Service

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,120
Too weak

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
I can't do it

71
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,040
And the service that makes the weak stronger

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,160
and the strong even tougher

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Endurance Enhancement Service

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
I think Hou Zhuocheng wants

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,720
Hou Zhuocheng wants to obtain it, but I don't.

76
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
Suddenly, I no longer want it.

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,800
First, we still need to

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
divide our clinics.

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,880
This time, we'll group by selecting

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,000
the physicians' self-portraits.

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,720
So you draw well

82
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
If you want to be chosen

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,600
you need to have some of your own

84
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:50,920
right?

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,880
distinctive features

86
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,280
Yes

87
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,880
Some little shared understandings

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
Draw a dragon

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,240
Draw a dragon

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Draw a dragon

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,240
Come on, everyone

92
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,160
Let's start drawing from Yu Haoyang's side

93
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,480
Come on, take turns to pick one

94
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,120
At the bottom

95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,600
Draw?

96
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,080
Okay

97
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
Two minutes, starting now

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,120
You all

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,360
You four, regarding the other four

100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,080
Is there anyone you'd say

101
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,560
you prefer as teammates?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Well, think about it

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
Think about it

104
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
I want to team up with Dong Zifan

105
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
I want to work hard together with him

106
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,960
Okay

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,840
Let's see who can draw a dragon

108
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,560
Ten seconds left, everyone

109
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,320
Five

110
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,480
Four

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,920
Three

112
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,440
Two

113
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,160
One

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,000
Alright

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,440
Now all four drawings are complete

116
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Let's welcome our first contestant

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Wei Xiaolong is here

118
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,400
Come on up

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,760
This is a robot

120
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
This is a robot

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
They don't look quite right

122
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,640
And what's this?

123
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,000
Everyone is truly impressive

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
Extremely abstract

125
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
Yes, go ahead and pick one

126
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,360
Then I'll choose one

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,680
I think this one

128
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,840
This abstract one

129
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,920
Feels more like me

130
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,160
Quite abstract indeed

131
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,560
Wei Xiaolong and Hou Zhuocheng

132
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
Have successfully formed the first consultation team

133
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,760
Let's begin then

134
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,160
Our second contestant

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,120
This is drawn so well

136
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,440
It feels like it was drawn by Dong Zifan

137
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,880
Drawn by Dong Zifan

138
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
This feeling

139
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,640
Drawn by Yu Haoyang

140
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,040
This is telling the story from his previous episodes

141
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,680
Right?

142
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,800
Okay, you've chosen abstract.

143
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
This is quite abstract too.

144
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,520
Abstract.

145
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,800
Congratulations to Huang Kai and Yu Haoyang.

146
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,640
for becoming the second consultation room.

147
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,640
Next, our third and fourth candidates.

148
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
You can come together.

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,120
He's narrating here.

150
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,600
Right.

151
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,440
You can pick the one with least hair.

152
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,320
Because he has no hair.

153
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,720
Less hair means higher IQ.

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,480
The less hair, the higher the IQ.

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
You're praising yourself there.

156
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,320
As for this painting on the left

157
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,520
He is particularly artistically talented

158
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,800
The painting on the right

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,880
I think it has a particularly artistic

160
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
talent on another level

161
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,520
Just no talent

162
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,520
I really like storytellers

163
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,160
I want to choose the one on the right

164
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
Alright, let’s congratulate our Ren Yinpeng

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,160
and our Dong Zifan

166
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,360
for becoming the third consultation room

167
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,480
Then our Hu Minghao

168
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,440
and our Yang Zongyu

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,600
will automatically join the fourth consultation room

170
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,480
Okay

171
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,800
Everyone has received their group's painting

172
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,480
You can briefly describe

173
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,080
this painting

174
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,480
Holding it like that doesn't seem appropriate

175
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,120
Raising it like this seems a bit inauspicious

176
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Actually, it does look somewhat similar

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
Similar to what?

178
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,760
Physique

179
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,520
Expression

180
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
Why does it have to be double doors?

181
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,160
What do you mean?

182
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,160
I dreamed of becoming double doors.

183
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,800
But in that photo,

184
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
the head-to-shoulder ratio is average.

185
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,360
Let's ask our "Abstract Yang" then.

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,440
Because initially I just wanted

187
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,120
to draw a cartoon character.

188
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,240
Then I realized I really

189
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,280
have no talent for it.

190
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,840
After drawing the first circle,

191
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,720
I could tell this drawing

192
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520
would turn out very abstract.

193
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,040
Because the circle looked like a scallion.

194
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
I really have no talent.

195
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Well then,

196
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,680
this person has nothing to say.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
It's just like

198
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
this one here is

199
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,920
a true self-portrait.

200
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,720
It really looks like

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,400
Why did Huang Kai initially think

202
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,320
that this was

203
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
drawn by Dong Zifan?

204
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,840
He has avant-garde artistry

205
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,720
Do you think Yang Zongyu himself lacks artistry?

206
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,640
Yang Zongyu himself has even more avant-garde artistry

207
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,480
Even more avant-garde artistry

208
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,920
Let's start balancing things

209
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
Let me explain to everyone

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,320
You can all see that I have

211
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,240
emotional changes here

212
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,960
One, two, three

213
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
And then

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,840
The first one represents me over there

215
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,080
I'm waiting for that crown

216
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,520
Because it's somewhat like

217
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,400
Yes, but with a hook

218
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
I want to win the championship

219
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
Not like Jiang Taigong fishing

220
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,920
At first I was very unhappy

221
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,600
Later because I never caught anything

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Finally we come to 80 years later

223
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
This foretells that today

224
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,120
80 years later I will

225
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,480
obtain this crown

226
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,840
After obtaining this crown

227
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,080
the other six people

228
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,560
will submit beneath our feet

229
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,800
Submit beneath our feet

230
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,000
Very ambitious

231
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,520
Alright everyone

232
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,720
We're about to begin

233
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,440
this week's assessment

234
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,800
Now as per the usual rules

235
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,120
I'll choose first

236
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
Let's flip through the medicine cabinet signs

237
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,680
Does anyone have any thoughts?

238
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,200
Qianshi then

239
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,680
Qianshi

240
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,200
Okay

241
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
As you wish

242
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,800
As you wish

243
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,760
Qianshi

244
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
A bag of grandmasters

245
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,480
Come on, everyone can see the sacks now.

246
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,800
You can pair up in twos.

247
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Go inside and give it a try.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,760
Alright, go in.

249
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Alright, let's get ready

250
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
Our first question

251
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,400
Three

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,880
Two

253
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,720
One

254
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,040
Go

255
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,280
Jump

256
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,040
What is this?

257
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,320
Jump

258
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,800
One

259
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,280
Two

260
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,520
What is this

261
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,800
Please answer.

262
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,640
Lure the enemy away.

263
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,600
Correct answer.

264
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,200
I haven't seen it yet.

265
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,640
I haven't clearly seen those words yet.

266
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,440
Turn around.

267
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,000
I understand now.

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,160
I'll definitely play next round.

269
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,320
Begin.

270
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,520
Please answer.

271
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Healing the world with medicine.

272
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,440
Correct answer.

273
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,680
Begin.

274
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,560
Beating around the bush.

275
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,640
Correct answer.

276
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
How does he know again?

277
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,640
We don't need to play anymore.

278
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,800
It's too hot here.

279
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
Let them take the 25 brain points.

280
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,520
Oh my

281
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,040
Give up

282
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,720
Begin

283
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,880
Be careful

284
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,560
I've already figured it out

285
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,240
Come back now

286
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,480
I can tell you the answer

287
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,640
Tell you the answer

288
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,480
Come at me

289
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,320
Alright

290
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,720
Without batting an eye

291
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,560
Impressive

292
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,480
Correct answer

293
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,280
Okay okay okay

294
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,160
Let's go

295
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,600
Fine fine fine

296
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,880
Come on, everyone please return.

297
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,760
Jump.

298
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,440
Go back.

299
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,000
Please return.

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
Everyone, please return.

301
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,360
Come on.

302
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,280
Three.

303
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,040
Two.

304
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,520
One.

305
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,280
Begin.

306
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,200
Jump.

307
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,400
This is my empire.

308
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,120
My empire is magnificent.

309
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,440
Commanding the land.

310
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,760
Please return

311
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,480
Okay

312
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,320
Better than jumping for nothing

313
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Scenery like a painting

314
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,360
Wrong answer

315
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,560
What?

316
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,600
Please return

317
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,000
I know

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,440
Hurry hurry hurry

319
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,360
Quick, let's go back again

320
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,920
Come back again

321
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's go

322
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,440
Hurry

323
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,160
What is it?

324
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,120
The land is picturesque

325
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,000
Correct answer

326
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,920
The land is picturesque

327
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,280
No

328
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,160
Why are you taking advantage of our oversight?

329
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
Do you need something?

330
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,160
Since you're already here

331
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,960
Now that you've come

332
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,000
Otherwise we'd have to keep jumping

333
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,560
That would be tiring

334
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,320
No martial virtue

335
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,440
This might be my only chance

336
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
Now, the other three clinics

337
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,560
Who will ultimately share third place?

338
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,760
Who will take second place?

339
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,240
Three

340
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,400
Two

341
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,800
Begin

342
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,160
What kind of chickens gather in flocks

343
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,280
Keep beating

344
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,320
What is that

345
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,360
I'll

346
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,720
say

347
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,400
Many a little makes a mickle

348
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,000
Correct answer

349
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,120
Orange

350
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,440
Alright

351
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
Now, the first round

352
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,080
The Sect Leader's assessment has concluded.

353
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,800
As for our current

354
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,680
Yang Zongyu, who contributed the most idioms,

355
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,160
please share your experience in detail.

356
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
Actually, it's mainly about the first question

357
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,080
It gave me an understanding of

358
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,720
the overall framework

359
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,920
and general control

360
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,120
of what the question style would be like

361
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Yes, this round feels like

362
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,520
Yang Zongyu's performance really

363
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,440
didn't give you all much

364
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,400
opportunity to showcase yourselves

365
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,440
But in the end,

366
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,760
our Yu Haoyang

367
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,960
still managed to secure one question.

368
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,160
It just came to mind instantly—

369
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,640
the one about chickens and oranges.

370
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,960
It just clicked immediately

371
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,200
because when I partnered with Yang Zongyu,

372
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,080
I noticed he was especially good at these types of questions.

373
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,640
So when I heard the rules,

374
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,320
I thought it would be his moment to shine.

375
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
But I never expected him

376
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,840
to dominate so completely.

377
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,160
Now, we’ll begin the second round of assessments.

378
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,680
Let me take a look—

379
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,400
see if there’s any we haven’t picked yet.

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,240
I think Guizhi is a good choice.

381
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,280
Guizhi is—

382
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,440
"the cure that works instantly."

383
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,840
The first clinic to enter the battle

384
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,080
Who could it be?

385
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,360
One

386
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,560
Enter the arena

387
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,520
Any volunteers for the challenge?

388
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,640
Then we...

389
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,480
We'll do it

390
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,840
Alright

391
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
Then Clinic Four will take the initiative to challenge

392
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,520
Ready everyone?

393
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,320
Okay.

394
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Our Clinic One will go first.

395
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,160
Because the mental energy level is currently low.

396
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,880
Let's begin.

397
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,360
Come on.

398
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,880
Go.

399
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,560
This

400
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:01,960
Okay

401
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,160
I think it's pretty much the same

402
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Let's go with this

403
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,240
It's fine

404
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,600
Come on

405
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,200
No problem

406
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,200
Already

407
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,000
There's no way now

408
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,800
It's starting over there

409
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,720
I've found the pattern.

410
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,600
If the chessboard moves to either side,

411
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,280
it's red.

412
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,560
If it moves forward, it's black.

413
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,520
We can play in reverse.

414
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,880
We can mislead them.

415
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,920
I think we should move it sideways.

416
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,320
Where to place?

417
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,120
Right there.

418
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,040
What do you think?

419
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,520
Go ahead.

420
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,480
You're quite fast today.

421
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,440
Want some?

422
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,480
Let's send one to scout them out.

423
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,880
One doesn't matter anyway.

424
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,240
Little virus.

425
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,960
I'll move the red one forward.

426
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,520
Okay, that works.

427
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,320
Come on, Wei Xiaolong.

428
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,000
Maybe we should move forward first.

429
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
We can take it slow anyway.

430
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
There are still so many left to move.

431
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,760
No.

432
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,600
I want to move this one.

433
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
Where should this one go?

434
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,480
Either take it...

435
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,760
or...

436
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,880
Think about it.

437
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:33,800
Okay.

438
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,120
That one, yes.

439
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,720
There are two viruses now, right?

440
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,880
Either this one or that one anyway

441
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,840
Just these two

442
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,080
I think

443
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,960
Still this one, what do you think?

444
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,440
Let's go with this one

445
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,960
The previous one

446
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,600
Let's choose the previous one

447
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,080
This one

448
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,760
Okay

449
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,640
Maybe we shouldn't move this one

450
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
This one goes right, or left?

451
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,520
Like this

452
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,000
That works

453
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,480
I think it should move forward

454
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,680
Then it can take the card in front

455
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,520
That wouldn't be a loss, right?

456
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,680
Right, isn't it?

457
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Isn't that so?

458
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,640
We've already placed it

459
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,480
Really?

460
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
What do you think?

461
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,520
If we eat it, we might...

462
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,000
What if it's poisoned...

463
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,280
Feels like we're being cornered.

464
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,720
Doesn't matter.

465
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,640
As long as we don't eat it later.

466
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,240
Right?

467
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,520
Let's eat.

468
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,680
Damn

469
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,240
Ready to win

470
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,320
Minor issue

471
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,200
Let's go all in

472
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,120
Agreed

473
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,440
Agreed

474
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,200
These two must stay here

475
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,960
Once we advance

476
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,280
We can take it

477
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,080
I think we can move forward

478
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,240
What about this move?

479
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,480
Right, I think this one should go out

480
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,640
This

481
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,640
Just charge ahead

482
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,800
Dare to eat it?

483
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,080
I won't eat it.

484
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Move this over here.

485
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,280
Then push it a bit further that way.

486
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,920
Okay.

487
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,040
Go ahead and eat it.

488
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,840
I think it's fine.

489
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
We have too few pieces now.

490
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,800
I agree.

491
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,280
Alright.

492
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,920
Here, eat it.

493
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,560
Right?

494
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,440
Block it, maybe?

495
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,880
Eat again.

496
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,160
No no no.

497
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,120
This piece probably isn't (the red pill).

498
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,040
Don't eat it.

499
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,560
I think we should move this upward.

500
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,560
Go with this one.

501
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,000
This one.

502
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,400
Yes.

503
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,200
Go

504
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I think

505
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,000
Let me think

506
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,320
Wait a second

507
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,040
Let's discuss

508
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,680
What I mean is

509
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,240
The one in front of the red card has a higher probability

510
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,680
Red

511
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,640
His is red

512
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,160
This is first

513
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,640
Right?

514
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,200
And second is

515
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
I'll move my red forward

516
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,080
It gives me an advantage

517
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,160
Because red can occupy the medicine box

518
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,440
Go

519
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,600
Go

520
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Come on, take it

521
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,200
Charge forward!

522
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,080
Go for this one!

523
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,920
Go!

524
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,600
Right!

525
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,240
It's definitely red.

526
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,080
So this is most likely...

527
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,120
...red.

528
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,040
Judging by his expression...

529
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,680
...absolutely not.

530
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,320
What?

531
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,880
I was just thinking about our own tactics.

532
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,200
Is this one red?

533
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,960
Yes.

534
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,840
I think our current strategy

535
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,520
is either to push this red one forward

536
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,120
and eliminate it

537
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,200
or move the black one left

538
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,600
then remove that question mark at the bottom left

539
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,600
I agree

540
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,320
These are our two options

541
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,800
We just need to choose one now

542
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,240
This one

543
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,000
No problem

544
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,040
We've moved forward a bit

545
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,040
Let's move this one up, or...

546
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,200
What do you think?

547
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,560
Up

548
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
Those two standing there are red

549
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
Those two are red

550
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,240
Right

551
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,000
Then it ate a red one

552
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,680
So this one should be red

553
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,160
This is red

554
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
This is black

555
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,480
Then let's move this one

556
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,800
Okay

557
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,440
Move it here

558
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,440
Upwards

559
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,680
Go straight

560
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,720
I suggest moving it here

561
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,840
Okay, set

562
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,800
They definitely won't dare to eat

563
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,560
Our red one

564
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,160
Let's do this

565
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,800
Like this

566
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,480
Okay

567
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,960
Let me think

568
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,560
Wait a moment

569
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,160
Is this black?

570
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,720
Yes

571
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,520
Then let it eat

572
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,480
I think

573
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,240
Then just let it eat directly

574
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,480
Directly eat its black one

575
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,520
Anyway, it doesn't matter

576
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,120
We

577
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,520
We know how many cards he has

578
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,920
What's the advantage of eating?

579
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,720
Then this one

580
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,000
His will die then

581
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,880
His red one will die

582
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
No matter how his red one moves

583
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
We're one step ahead

584
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Then we can go this way

585
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,280
Okay

586
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,640
Eat it

587
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,360
Eat directly

588
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,000
Black one

589
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,920
We can only let him take ours

590
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,520
Lure him into taking this one of ours

591
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,480
I think this one is black

592
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,800
If you think that one is black

593
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,440
What we can actually do is

594
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,280
take all their red pieces

595
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,200
Take one of theirs for every one they take

596
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,640
Take one for every one they move

597
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,360
Then we can only make this move

598
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,480
No no no

599
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,400
I was just demonstrating

600
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,040
I didn't mean to place it

601
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Do they always play chess like this?

602
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,640
When he demonstrates next time

603
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,600
I'll block it

604
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
Come here

605
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,200
First, that piece there

606
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
must be red

607
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,760
The one to the front right must be red

608
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,400
I'll move my black piece forward

609
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,440
It can either go left or right

610
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,240
If left, I'll take it with red

611
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,640
Right?

612
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,560
If right

613
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,440
I'll use black

614
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,080
I'll pressure it with black

615
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,120
If it dares enter the medicine box

616
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,920
I'll force it with black

617
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,080
Yes yes yes

618
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,920
Like this

619
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,000
This actually doesn't matter

620
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,440
No

621
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,520
If it takes our piece

622
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,080
Then moves in again

623
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,280
We can't block it

624
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
So we have to move this one

625
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Okay, let's move this

626
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,720
Dare to take it?

627
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,440
Take it, the red one

628
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,280
Took it

629
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Just take it

630
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,520
What if it's black?

631
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,560
It is black

632
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,120
If it's black

633
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,720
By the game rules, you lose

634
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,200
By the game rules, you lose

635
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,000
No, I know

636
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,720
Is that what I asked?

637
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,160
We can only move this

638
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,240
Otherwise, it'll take ours

639
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
And we can't block it

640
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,080
So we have to take it

641
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,760
Go ahead

642
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,320
Right?

643
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,160
Okay

644
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,840
Eat

645
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,320
Eat

646
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,560
Just like this

647
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,400
Exactly like this

648
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,000
Good

649
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Congratulations to Clinic One

650
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,000
Clinic One

651
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
has successfully won this round

652
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,680
Should we first ask

653
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,400
what Wei Xiaolong's winning

654
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,320
basic strategy was?

655
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,280
First, we were quite clear

656
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,680
about identifying where their red pieces were

657
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,760
Because actually I think

658
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,480
it follows similar

659
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,040
logic to ours

660
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,720
This game

661
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
actually goes against human intuition

662
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,400
Normally you'd expect

663
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
black pieces to be pawns

664
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,360
pushing forward

665
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,280
and red pieces to retreat

666
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,120
while protecting these two pieces

667
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,640
After discovering this one was red

668
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,400
it became clearer those two were red

669
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,000
So at this point it became

670
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,120
an open game, I think

671
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,040
So congratulations to our Clinic One

672
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,560
for successfully gaining 20% brain power

673
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,720
Alright then

674
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,880
Our Clinic Two and Clinic Three

675
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,720
Come on, your Clinic One and Clinic Four

676
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,520
can come

677
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,240
take a look around

678
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,360
Yes, take a good look

679
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,000
Have you considered random placement?

680
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
We did random placement

681
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,600
What are you talking about?

682
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,400
Alright then

683
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,960
Then we'll have the clinic with lower brain power

684
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,640
Clinic Three go first

685
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,680
Okay

686
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,880
Let me think

687
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
First move right

688
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
or enter the medicine storage first

689
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,040
But I think this

690
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,800
we can go this way

691
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,360
since we have to move forward anyway

692
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,000
Right

693
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,240
They took a step

694
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,800
"Ocean's Resolve"

695
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,040
Go right

696
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,960
We'll go right too

697
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,880
This

698
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,920
Okay, this

699
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,000
I've noticed

700
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,800
Our team grouping this time is quite interesting

701
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,280
They put four relatively thoughtful people

702
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,040
with four who don't really like

703
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,120
don't really like using their brains

704
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,600
Yes, grouped together

705
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
It's not like before where

706
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,440
everyone would think

707
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
and keep hesitating

708
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,080
or just make random moves

709
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,720
those random, thoughtless moves

710
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,880
Who are you saying makes random moves?

711
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Who's making random moves?

712
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,560
No, no one's making random moves

713
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,080
You misspoke, host

714
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,440
You've angered everyone

715
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,920
This one?

716
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,360
For this one?

717
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,320
Your turn now

718
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,440
You move

719
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,440
You can move this one first

720
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,400
Crucial

721
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,200
I think this move

722
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,120
is too aggressive

723
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,000
too aggressive

724
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,560
too deep

725
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,680
How dare you make this move

726
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,720
Wait a moment

727
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
Choose one of these two

728
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,360
Or just this one

729
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,880
Any of these three will do

730
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
They don’t have any now

731
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Rashly taking any piece

732
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,640
First, open up the formation

733
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,960
But actually, I think taking

734
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,200
It’s also a strategy

735
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,680
Yes

736
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,200
Right, what if we take all the red ones

737
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
Should we take it or not

738
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,040
We can hold off for now

739
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,400
Move this one forward

740
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,760
This way

741
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,360
A clash of titans

742
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,440
Take it down

743
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,840
Charge at this one

744
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,880
You move it

745
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,640
Not taking it, hold back

746
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,360
This one goes here

747
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,040
They didn't eat a single one.

748
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,440
Have one.

749
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,800
Only lost after eating four.

750
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,560
Only lost after eating four.

751
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,800
Do you dare eat that?

752
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,440
Eat that one first

753
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,160
Because if we eat that one first, we...

754
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,560
If we eat that first, no one can get us

755
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,520
Right, this is safe for us

756
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,280
Okay, eat that one first

757
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,280
Alright, got it

758
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
Let's ignore the left side for now

759
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,000
We just need to surround them

760
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Let's eat first

761
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,520
It's fine

762
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,120
I think we should eat first

763
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,400
Should we move this over?

764
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,920
Don't move it yet

765
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,720
Let's eat first

766
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,360
Eat one first then decide

767
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
This one?

768
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,680
I really think it's a virus

769
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,960
Even if it's a virus, it's fine

770
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,640
Are you sure?

771
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,160
Yes

772
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,080
We've only eaten two

773
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
No problem

774
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,000
Then we...

775
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,120
Decided

776
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,280
But no problem

777
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,480
We just need to lean forward a bit more

778
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:38,920
Take another

779
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,440
It's fine

780
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,800
If we push straight through here

781
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
They'll have to move all their pieces over

782
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,720
What I mean is

783
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,280
We might as well take it

784
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,720
We haven't taken any yet anyway

785
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,120
Right

786
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,440
Take it

787
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,080
Okay

788
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,840
Take

789
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,280
Flipped

790
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,320
Looks like you want to flip it back, right?

791
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,040
Don't like it

792
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,760
Undo

793
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,880
Change it

794
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,440
Use this for support

795
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,400
Right?

796
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,920
Okay

797
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,280
Move this forward

798
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,800
Then let's move this first

799
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,000
Moved

800
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,240
Moved

801
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,640
Moved

802
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,920
How about we keep moving forward?

803
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,920
Okay

804
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,760
Matched

805
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,040
Matched

806
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,760
Matched

807
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,960
Wait

808
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,120
Hold on

809
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,680
Let's put this here

810
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,920
He has fewer pieces on the right

811
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,480
Our three pieces on the left can charge forward

812
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,760
Take one

813
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,800
Took another one

814
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,640
The current situation is evenly matched

815
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,280
Let's not take the initiative to capture yet

816
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,720
Don't capture actively

817
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,840
No active capturing

818
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,600
Let's move forward first

819
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,840
It's a stalemate now

820
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,400
This was a very deep move by him

821
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,400
Move this forward

822
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,320
Agreed

823
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,920
Continue pushing deeper

824
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,360
Actually I think

825
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,320
If we just capture one of his

826
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
Our position will become very clear

827
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,360
And I think we should take this one

828
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,680
Capture this

829
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,560
After capturing

830
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,040
He can't do anything to us here

831
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,360
But if he retreats

832
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,880
We'll lose our red pieces here

833
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,760
Then let's move this way

834
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
First we need to shift one, right

835
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,760
How about moving this right?

836
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,480
That could work

837
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,680
First move forward

838
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,520
Alright, your turn.

839
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,080
Wait a moment.

840
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,000
Let's think more about this move.

841
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,840
Think carefully.

842
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
I think they might be doing the same as us.

843
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,960
Racing for speed.

844
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,200
I mean our red piece on the right.

845
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,120
Could take the one in front.

846
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,800
Right.

847
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,840
But the one they've left...

848
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,960
Must be a black one.

849
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,240
Then we can't take it.

850
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,080
This red piece in the second column could charge in.

851
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,160
But if they take ours,

852
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,760
we'd be in a passive position.

853
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,560
But I think on the right side,

854
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,360
we definitely have the advantage.

855
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,720
We're certainly faster than them.

856
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,880
I think it's very likely that...

857
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,320
What if it's also black?

858
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,880
Our third red piece from the right should move forward.

859
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,640
I'll just go ahead.

860
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,040
Going first.

861
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,480
Let's go then.

862
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,200
Let's move forward.

863
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,120
Let's take this one.

864
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:04,800
Agreed.

865
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,480
Decision made.

866
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,400
What I mean is

867
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,320
The second one on our right

868
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,360
Let's move straight forward

869
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,200
They'll definitely take it

870
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,880
Bet on whether they dare to take it

871
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,320
Right

872
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,240
Want to make a bet?

873
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,840
Sure

874
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,280
Correct

875
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,360
If they don't take it, we will

876
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,240
Then we're out

877
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,880
Decided

878
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,800
Alright, let's go

879
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,440
Just take it directly

880
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,040
His piece still needs two more moves to get here

881
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,840
Still early

882
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Wait, let me think

883
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,600
I'm sorting it out now

884
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
One

885
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,520
No

886
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,600
If his is red

887
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
If we don't take it

888
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,280
It will take ours

889
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,840
Then it can exit and win

890
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,400
So we have to take his now

891
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,080
Yes, I know I have to take it

892
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,400
But I need to calculate our

893
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,080
Other positions, right?

894
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,000
But we seem to have no choice now

895
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Let's do it

896
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,520
Go for it

897
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:54,760
Attack

898
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,080
No other way

899
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,520
Take it first

900
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,360
Okay, taken

901
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,080
Red

902
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,240
Couldn't suppress my smile just now

903
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
We've already taken two of his black pieces

904
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,360
Take one more

905
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,240
That would be really bad luck

906
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,200
Then let's move our red forward

907
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,240
Just take it directly

908
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,120
Charge with two reds

909
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,600
Take it

910
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,120
Take

911
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,160
Oh my goodness

912
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,800
We'll move after they make their move.

913
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,120
Let's make our move first.

914
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,840
We can ignore this side for now.

915
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,080
Because no matter which way he goes here,

916
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,560
we have a spot to block him.

917
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,480
But if he moves forward here,

918
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,040
moves forward,

919
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,840
we'll be waiting for him here.

920
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,200
He'll need one more move to get out.

921
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Only then can he win.

922
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,280
He has no pieces left there.

923
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,200
It'll take him too long to send reinforcements.

924
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,280
Let's move this one.

925
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,520
Right.

926
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,400
Yes, move this one.

927
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,760
The black one.

928
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,160
Correct.

929
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,640
But it doesn't matter.

930
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,440
But if we go in,

931
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
he'll capture us.

932
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,160
This can only go left.

933
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,760
Just defend.

934
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,880
They made a wrong move.

935
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,440
Chasing after us.

936
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,000
Definitely a mistake.

937
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,960
So it doesn't matter which way we go.

938
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,840
He can't move.

939
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,600
True.

940
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,000
Let's make a move

941
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
If he wins, we'll make our move

942
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,680
Lost

943
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,400
If we lose, then we lose

944
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,880
Then you've won

945
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,640
Yes, then we've won

946
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Good

947
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,800
Brilliant

948
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,840
Now for the second round

949
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,760
Clinic Three

950
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,680
With a very close margin

951
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
You could say by just one move

952
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,240
Won this round by a single move

953
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,480
Congratulations to Clinic Three

954
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,040
Successfully accumulated 20% mental energy

955
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,960
Let's go

956
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,080
You two first explain

957
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,360
Your strategy

958
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,280
We give the choice to our opponent

959
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,800
When facing off

960
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,760
You shouldn't move

961
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,880
Let the opponent choose

962
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,160
This way they're more likely to make mistakes

963
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,640
Our red pieces or black pieces

964
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,480
Advance forward

965
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Or serve as bait

966
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,280
As for the follow-up

967
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,640
These two (herb stores)

968
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,160
Must be kept

969
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,000
Keep one or two pieces if possible

970
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,880
This way we can defend

971
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,760
Congratulations to you

972
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,360
Excellent

973
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,600
What should we translate this time?

974
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,440
Rose Petals

975
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,560
Let's try Rose Petals, okay?

976
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,440
Medical skills are superb

977
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,520
The equals sign is automatically generated.

978
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,440
But other symbols

979
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,480
need to be found by everyone.

980
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,400
Parentheses also need to be found (by yourselves).

981
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,720
There are no parentheses.

982
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,200
Alright, everyone.

983
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,480
Now according to our rules,

984
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,720
for our first round,

985
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,960
the defending side

986
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,280
will be the one with

987
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,200
the highest current mental score,

988
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,280
which is Clinic Four.

989
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Please decide between the two of you

990
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,400
who will be the one to go in and hammer.

991
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,240
Me.

992
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
The (required calculation) answer this time is

993
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,680
two.

994
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,920
Three, two, one, begin!

995
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,480
Lower, lower.

996
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,760
Forward.

997
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,280
Backward.

998
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,600
Back.

999
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,080
Hit.

1000
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,640
One, two.

1001
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,040
Wei Xiaolong was hit three times.

1002
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,960
Wei Xiaolong was hit four times.

1003
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,080
Be careful

1004
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,800
He's going to help again

1005
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,280
Alright, Wei Xiaolong got hit again.

1006
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
To your left.

1007
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,320
Left.

1008
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,800
Forward.

1009
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,080
Hit.

1010
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,240
Wei Xiaolong got hit twice.

1011
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,360
Wei Xiaolong has been hit seven times.

1012
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,600
Move forward.

1013
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,560
Go.

1014
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,640
Right.

1015
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,680
Okay.

1016
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,240
Huang Kai got hit twice.

1017
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,600
Left.

1018
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,280
Left side.

1019
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,400
Back, turn around.

1020
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,640
Okay, who is this?

1021
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,440
Yu Haoyang got hit twice.

1022
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,560
Forward, charge.

1023
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:54,840
Charge.

1024
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,160
Five.

1025
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,880
Move back.

1026
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,320
Four.

1027
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,200
Go.

1028
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
Three.

1029
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,360
Hit.

1030
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,320
Two.

1031
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,400
One.

1032
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,720
Okay, stop.

1033
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,680
Alright.

1034
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,920
Three-minute calculation timer starts now.

1035
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,400
Calculation done.

1036
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,040
Your calculation is done.

1037
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,440
Four, minus two and two.

1038
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,720
This isn't minus.

1039
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,080
This is not minus.

1040
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,840
This is negative two.

1041
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,880
You took the wrong one

1042
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,960
Right, this is a nine

1043
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,840
Wrong pick

1044
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,360
There's another nine here too

1045
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,560
Oh no

1046
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,440
All nines

1047
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,920
These two

1048
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,360
Yes

1049
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,000
Let's see if we can add them

1050
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
No operation symbols left

1051
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,240
None left

1052
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,520
Let's try this

1053
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,080
How much can we calculate

1054
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,720
Three

1055
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,840
Four minus three

1056
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,880
So the result is two, right?

1057
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,280
Yes, two.

1058
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,320
Wait, then this addition...

1059
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,960
must definitely be included.

1060
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,320
Right?

1061
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,080
This addition needs to be included.

1062
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,120
Correct?

1063
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,360
You have to add it.

1064
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,120
One plus one equals two.

1065
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,080
And then seven...

1066
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,760
How was it calculated just now?

1067
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,880
I know.

1068
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,240
It's negative.

1069
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,360
One is negative nine.

1070
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,920
This isn't negative eight.

1071
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,440
If it were negative eight, it would work.

1072
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,880
Alright, calculation time is over.

1073
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,680
Everyone,

1074
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,920
let's start checking from Clinic Room 2.

1075
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,560
Our answer is two.

1076
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,800
You...

1077
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,920
minus one point.

1078
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,360
Two equals two.

1079
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,920
Four and negative two equals extra.

1080
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,400
In pure calculation, you get minus one point.

1081
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,680
Then Clinic Room 3...

1082
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,400
has two sets.

1083
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,680
Six divided by three,

1084
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
and square root of four.

1085
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,560
Okay, that's equivalent to five points.

1086
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,800
Take three extra.

1087
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Which means you get two points.

1088
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,400
Clinic Room 1...

1089
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,920
One times one times two.

1090
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,960
These five are all useless, right?

1091
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,640
Yes, useless.

1092
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,560
Zero points.

1093
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,920
So what really determines...

1094
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,400
the direction of everyone's scores...

1095
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,840
is still the hammer.

1096
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,440
Our Clinic Room 1 was hit eight times,

1097
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,240
in total.

1098
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,600
Clinic Room 2 was hit seven times in total.

1099
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,200
Clinic Room 3 was hammered four times.

1100
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,760
Alright.

1101
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,160
So now it's minus two points,

1102
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
minus eight points, minus eight points,

1103
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,480
and the highest score of zero points.

1104
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,000
Now next,

1105
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,520
The second highest in mental ability ranking

1106
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,320
Since it's a tie

1107
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,840
Who wants to defend first?

1108
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,440
Either way

1109
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:18,960
Either way

1110
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,680
Either way

1111
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,640
Let us defend

1112
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
Okay, then next round

1113
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Clinic 3 will defend

1114
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,480
Alright?

1115
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,520
This round's (calculation required) answer is

1116
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,040
Negative eight

1117
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,000
Three two one, go!

1118
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Strike backward

1119
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,240
One

1120
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,640
Strike backward

1121
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,160
Strike forward

1122
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,640
Move right

1123
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,240
Move right

1124
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,920
Left

1125
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,520
Left

1126
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,560
Strike backward

1127
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:40,880
Backward

1128
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,240
Backward

1129
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,960
Which direction exactly?

1130
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,360
Strike backward

1131
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,720
Backward

1132
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,040
Backward

1133
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,080
Go, charge!

1134
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,040
One two

1135
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,480
Three four

1136
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:51,920
My hammer

1137
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,000
Can someone return it to me?

1138
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,880
Right

1139
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,080
Strike forward

1140
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,800
Charge forward

1141
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,920
Strike backward

1142
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,280
Backward

1143
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,480
Backward

1144
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,320
Charge!

1145
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,960
Strike backward

1146
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,240
Faster

1147
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,760
Faster

1148
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,800
So tired

1149
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,800
To the back

1150
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,560
One two

1151
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,720
Pause

1152
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,640
Switch to hammer

1153
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:14,760
Come

1154
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,360
Continue

1155
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,320
One

1156
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,360
Run

1157
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,160
Behind

1158
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,040
Charge

1159
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,880
Go straight

1160
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,360
Behind

1161
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,080
Right

1162
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,520
Behind

1163
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,240
Correct

1164
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,520
One two three four

1165
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,760
I'm so tired

1166
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,680
Thirty seconds

1167
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,200
One

1168
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,080
Two

1169
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,600
Broke again

1170
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,840
Too much force

1171
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,880
Charge forward

1172
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,680
To the back

1173
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,560
Strike backward, charge

1174
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,280
Charge

1175
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,200
Three

1176
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,160
Two

1177
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:48,520
One

1178
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,560
Over

1179
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,800
Come on, everyone, step out

1180
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,000
Exhausted

1181
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,960
So strong

1182
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,280
After your combo jump

1183
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,960
Got hit four times

1184
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,600
Come

1185
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,640
Three-minute calculation countdown starts

1186
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,040
We have to

1187
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,480
We don’t have enough operators

1188
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,800
They're so good at collecting

1189
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,360
And they don't discard a single one

1190
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,840
It's over

1191
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,240
We're done

1192
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
We're running out of operation symbols

1193
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,600
Do we have a multiplication sign?

1194
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,680
Is there a multiplication sign?

1195
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,000
No multiplication sign—this is frustrating

1196
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,120
So we're just stuck like this, huh?

1197
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,720
Let me check

1198
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,680
I think this is very risky

1199
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,760
Alright

1200
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,280
I think

1201
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,280
I think it's very risky

1202
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,680
Eight minus nine equals negative one, right?

1203
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,680
Then multiply by eight

1204
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,080
Then

1205
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,000
How do we get eight?

1206
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,320
Divide by the square root

1207
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,480
Divide this

1208
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,760
No good

1209
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,360
Giving up

1210
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,080
We can't figure it out

1211
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,120
Nothing works

1212
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,720
One, two, three, four, five, six

1213
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,560
Let's see how many times I get hammered

1214
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,720
You try calculating again

1215
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,120
We just calculated and got something

1216
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,760
We were just randomly trying

1217
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,720
And we still got something

1218
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,120
Not a single negative sign

1219
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,320
How did we get negative eight?

1220
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,160
Okay

1221
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,240
Stop calculating

1222
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,400
So let's start from

1223
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,320
Our second consultation room

1224
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,400
There is

1225
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,240
Negative five plus negative three is negative eight

1226
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,080
Negative eight

1227
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,680
So they accumulated four points total

1228
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,480
One, two, three

1229
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,880
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

1230
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,120
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen

1231
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,920
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen

1232
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,600
Eighteen minus four, negative fourteen

1233
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,120
Their calculation score is negative fourteen

1234
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,520
Calculation score: negative fourteen points

1235
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,400
A very failed strategy

1236
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,360
We're at negative six

1237
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:36,840
You guys just

1238
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,080
We gave up

1239
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,640
Then our first consultation room

1240
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,040
Negative four minus negative three

1241
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,600
Equals negative one, right?

1242
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,280
Eight needs to divide negative four first

1243
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,040
Because multiplication/division comes before addition/subtraction

1244
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,120
Can we rearrange it?

1245
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,600
Of course not

1246
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,080
So our Clinic One is

1247
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,280
minus ten points

1248
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,240
Now let me tell everyone

1249
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,480
about the number of hits just now

1250
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,800
First, our Clinic One

1251
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,080
was hit six times

1252
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,840
Then our Clinic Two

1253
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,120
was hit a bit more

1254
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,480
eleven times

1255
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,240
Strike backward

1256
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,360
One, two, three, four

1257
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,600
One, two

1258
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,120
Three

1259
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:18,920
Four, nice!

1260
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,560
One

1261
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,120
Two

1262
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,560
You got minus twenty-five points in just one round

1263
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,440
Our Clinic Four was hit seven times

1264
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,640
Then for the third round's defense,

1265
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,160
it will be our Clinic One's turn.

1266
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,840
We've been holding in frustration for too long.

1267
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,200
Bring it on.

1268
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,720
Clinic One, decide who will defend.

1269
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,120
Who will go?

1270
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,440
I'll do it.

1271
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,240
Let me.

1272
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:44,880
You go ahead.

1273
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,480
Come on then.

1274
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,320
Now then,

1275
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,560
the answer for this round's calculation is...

1276
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,480
Ten.

1277
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,000
Start the timer please.

1278
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,400
Back.

1279
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,440
One, two.

1280
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,200
Back.

1281
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,520
One, two, three, four, five.

1282
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,360
Stop.

1283
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:02,720
Wait a moment.

1284
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,320
Time out.

1285
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,840
The hammer went flying.

1286
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,680
Please continue.

1287
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,840
Right.

1288
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,280
One, two, three.

1289
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,040
Right back.

1290
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,560
It broke again.

1291
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:10,960
Hold on.

1292
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,080
Stop.

1293
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,800
Change the pillow

1294
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,120
Okay, change the pillow

1295
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,920
Let's continue

1296
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,840
Ready, three two one

1297
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,440
Please continue

1298
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,040
Right

1299
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,800
Back

1300
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,760
Yes

1301
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,640
Left

1302
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,360
Forward

1303
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:26,720
Right

1304
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,440
Yes, to the right

1305
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,280
One

1306
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,600
Backward

1307
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,680
Yes, to the left

1308
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,560
Backward

1309
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,160
Suddenly backward

1310
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,360
Need a feint

1311
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,920
Left

1312
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,880
Yes, got it

1313
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,640
Okay, to the left

1314
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,280
Left rear

1315
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:39,800
Done

1316
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,440
Right side

1317
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,120
Correct

1318
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,960
Forward

1319
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,400
Just go forward in that direction

1320
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:45,800
One

1321
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,480
Right rear

1322
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,680
Five

1323
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,040
Four

1324
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,200
Three

1325
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,240
Two

1326
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,680
One

1327
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,160
End

1328
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,360
Don't pick it up

1329
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,320
Don't pick it up

1330
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:06,720
Let go

1331
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,560
Come here

1332
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,400
Three-minute calculation timer starts now

1333
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,320
Calculation complete

1334
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,160
Now that we've finished calculating,

1335
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,720
Let's start calculating directly.

1336
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,120
Two plus eight.

1337
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,240
Our Clinic Two gets three points.

1338
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,840
Nine plus six minus five.

1339
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,200
Five cards.

1340
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Our Clinic Three has accumulated five points.

1341
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,560
Then Clinic Four,

1342
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,320
Two times five, three plus seven.

1343
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,720
has accumulated six points.

1344
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,560
Clinic Two gets hit twelve times.

1345
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,960
Clinic Three gets hit five times.

1346
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,960
Clinic Four gets hit seven times.

1347
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,960
Which of you two will decide who does the hitting?

1348
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,320
I'll do it.

1349
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,120
You give directions.

1350
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,320
Right, just say which way to go.

1351
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,440
Okay, then our Clinic Two,

1352
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,680
choose a defender.

1353
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,560
Who is it?

1354
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,160
Come on.

1355
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,320
Yu Haoyang, come.

1356
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,680
Everyone,

1357
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,400
the answer for the final round (requires calculation) is

1358
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,440
Brother Huang Kai, just say the direction directly.

1359
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,040
Okay.

1360
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,680
Zero.

1361
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,480
Please begin.

1362
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,960
There are three ahead.

1363
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,800
Further forward.

1364
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,520
Right side.

1365
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,560
Hit like crazy.

1366
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:20,960
Too difficult.

1367
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,400
All on the right.

1368
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:22,920
Forward.

1369
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,360
Now forward.

1370
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,400
Okay.

1371
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,280
Further forward.

1372
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,640
Okay.

1373
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,120
I think I'm a failed commander.

1374
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,440
Go backward.

1375
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,640
I'm about to collapse.

1376
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,960
So hard.

1377
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,840
Behind you.

1378
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,560
Back.

1379
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
All behind.

1380
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:49,800
Forward again.

1381
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,440
Forward.

1382
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,560
Hang in there.

1383
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,600
All to the left.

1384
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,360
Left.

1385
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,520
Wei Xiaolong's shoe fell off.

1386
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,200
Go right.

1387
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,680
It's okay.

1388
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,720
We accept mental enhancement.

1389
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,240
Go right.

1390
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,400
We accept mental enhancement.

1391
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,560
Okay, it's right...

1392
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,520
Left.

1393
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,200
All behind you.

1394
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,960
Keep going.

1395
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,680
All to the left.

1396
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,120
Left.

1397
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:18,880
Five

1398
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,040
Five

1399
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,000
Forward

1400
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,280
Four

1401
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,360
Three

1402
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,880
Two

1403
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,400
Rest

1404
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,320
One

1405
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,760
Okay

1406
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,280
It's okay

1407
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,760
Done

1408
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,160
No problem

1409
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,600
Okay, timing three minutes

1410
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,520
Begin

1411
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,200
Let's try to form a group first.

1412
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,200
Just check if there are matching numbers.

1413
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,000
Forty-six plus negative forty-six.

1414
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,440
This is the only way.

1415
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:46,920
Clinic One.

1416
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,480
Seven minus seven equals zero.

1417
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,120
Three points.

1418
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,040
Then our Clinic Three.

1419
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,720
Forty-six plus negative forty-six also equals zero.

1420
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,240
But because we drew extra.

1421
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:55,880
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1422
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,720
Six extra cards drawn.

1423
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,960
So the calculated score is minus one.

1424
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,840
Then our Clinic Four.

1425
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,280
Nine minus nine equals zero.

1426
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,360
Eight minus eight equals zero.

1427
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,040
So the cumulative score is six.

1428
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,440
Earlier, our Clinic Two.

1429
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,600
Put on quite a show.

1430
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,840
But it was just for show.

1431
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,040
Didn't hit a single comrade.

1432
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,760
The entire time.

1433
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,600
Missed everything the whole time.

1434
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,400
So what's the final score?

1435
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,120
What's the situation?

1436
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,840
Our Clinic One.

1437
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,160
Successfully accumulated minus twenty-one.

1438
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:29,800
Brilliant.

1439
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,520
Brilliant.

1440
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,640
Clinic Two did even better.

1441
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,280
Accumulated minus forty-two.

1442
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,000
Double that.

1443
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,360
Whose team is this?

1444
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,080
Wait, how did you...

1445
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Clinic Three.

1446
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,080
Is our highest score.

1447
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
Accumulated minus three.

1448
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,320
Then our Clinic Four.

1449
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,680
Is second place.

1450
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,960
Accumulated minus eight.

1451
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,720
The final results

1452
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,000
Taking first place

1453
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,080
is our

1454
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,920
Clinic Three

1455
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,040
having successfully accumulated 45% mental capacity

1456
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,880
Our Dong Zifan

1457
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,920
after five seasons

1458
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,480
has become acting hall leader for the first time

1459
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,200
Thank you

1460
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,680
Therefore this time

1461
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,440
the value-added service

1462
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,840
will go to our

1463
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,080
Clinic One and Clinic Two

1464
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,120
I'd really like to experience it

1465
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,280
My brain needs some upgrading

1466
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,600
Haven't you had the value-added service before?

1467
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,800
Missed it the last three times in a row

1468
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,440
I could see it in his eyes

1469
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,240
the sheer delight he felt

1470
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,720
and the corners of his mouth he couldn't keep down

1471
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,120
Pure bliss

1472
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,400
Ecstasy

1473
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,080
"The Raptor Duo"

1474
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,760
Now comes the most crucial part

1475
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,440
is about to begin

1476
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,240
What is it?

1477
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,360
Dong Zifan probably doesn't know

1478
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,280
the most ceremonious part

1479
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,080
is the Acting Hall Leader inauguration ceremony

1480
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,360
No way

1481
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,080
I may not have eaten pork

1482
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,320
but I've seen pigs run

1483
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,080
Too sensitive

1484
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,680
Overly sensitive

1485
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,160
Still a bit too sensitive

1486
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,040
Now, bring forth the gourd

1487
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,200
The Tai Chi Gourd

1488
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,640
Such a cool gourd

1489
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,040
Let us now begin

1490
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,360
this session's Acting Hall Leader inauguration ceremony

1491
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,280
Brothers, where's the applause?

1492
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,680
Let's coordinate our outfits.

1493
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,200
Thank you.

1494
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,600
I'll wear dark colors, you wear light ones.

1495
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,640
Because my clothes are light-colored.

1496
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,840
Yours are dark.

1497
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,360
This guy really knows how to coordinate outfits.

1498
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,600
We should show it off.

1499
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,120
Let's show it.

1500
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,560
Show it off.

1501
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,560
Now let's invite.

1502
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,120
Our acting hall leader.

1503
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,960
To decide.

1504
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,640
What mental enhancement services.

1505
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,200
Clinic 1 and Clinic 2 will receive respectively.

1506
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,920
Then you'll get courage enhancement.

1507
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,640
Courage.

1508
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,560
Challenge your courage.

1509
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,880
And for Clinic 2.

1510
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,240
It'll be endurance enhancement.

1511
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,640
Let's begin the services.

1512
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,480
What's this for?

1513
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,040
What's this?

1514
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,520
Clinic 4, pull on this.

1515
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,880
Then let Clinic 3 do the flicking, okay?

1516
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,480
Come on, keep pulling back.

1517
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,680
Ready.

1518
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,080
Let's go.

1519
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,760
Are you ready?

1520
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,320
Okay.

1521
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,360
Three.

1522
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
Two.

1523
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,440
One.

1524
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,160
I don't feel anything.

1525
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,200
When Dong Zifan was hitting me earlier,

1526
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,120
the force wasn't this weak.

1527
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,720
Want to try again?

1528
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,280
Want to try again?

1529
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,200
Want to try again?

1530
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,440
Want to try again?

1531
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,080
He's just being stubborn.

1532
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,720
Actually, he secretly

1533
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,920
made a heart gesture with his fingers

1534
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,280
asking me to go easier.

1535
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,120
Okay.

1536
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,200
Next up then.

1537
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,200
Three.

1538
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,000
Two.

1539
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,160
One point five.

1540
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,800
Applying pressure.

1541
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,480
Psychological torture.

1542
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,200
One.

1543
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,720
Zero.

1544
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,880
Zero.

1545
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,640
This sound...

1546
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,560
Too weak.

1547
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,960
Too weak.

1548
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,640
Really?

1549
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,040
You're still being stubborn.

1550
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,440
Let's congratulate our Clinic 2.

1551
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,080
Value-added service successful.

1552
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,600
Presenting our second value-added prop.

1553
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,960
Bicycle.

1554
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,520
Run it over? Yes.

1555
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,440
Indeed.

1556
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,560
We want to tell the audience

1557
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,520
there's no problem.

1558
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,840
Because we've tested it repeatedly

1559
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,560
many times.

1560
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,960
Wei Xiaolong, you need to hold on.

1561
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,760
He looks excited.

1562
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,080
Hou Zhuocheng, hold on!

1563
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,280
Just don't press on my face.

1564
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,760
Okay.

1565
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,840
You can start whenever you're ready, okay?

1566
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,000
Here he comes.

1567
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,880
What do you think?

1568
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,720
It's not too bad.

1569
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,320
I think he's actually handling it fine.

1570
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,480
It's like cutting the Gordian knot.

1571
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,320
Get it over with quickly.

1572
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,800
This board is heavier, right?

1573
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,880
I think this board is heavier.

1574
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,080
Don’t look.

1575
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,920
Don’t look.

1576
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,360
Don’t be afraid.

1577
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,280
It’ll be over soon.

1578
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,240
It’ll be over soon.

1579
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,160
Ready?

1580
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,080
Hou Zhuocheng, it's fine.

1581
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,480
Trust me.

1582
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,200
I trust you.

1583
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,000
Come on.

1584
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,560
Let’s go.

1585
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,200
Come on.

1586
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,120
Okay

1587
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,760
Alright

1588
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,760
Thank you

1589
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,480
Good

1590
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,280
Let's come up with

1591
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,120

1592
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,600

1602
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,760
Alright everyone

1603
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,960
Today all you doctors

1604
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,240
Not only exercised your brains

1605
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,960
But also built courage

1606
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,240
Strengthened endurance

1607
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,080
And in the Brain Gym

1608
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,200

And keep working hard

1612

1613
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,120
Deputy Hall Leader competition

1614
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,840
Before we end

1615
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,240
Let's shout it one last time

1616
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,160

Bye bye

1620
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,480
Guess the Prescription

1621
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,040
Doubt

1622
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,880
"Dragon's Doubt"

1623
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,440
Begin

1624
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,200
Question

1625
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,280
I feel a bit dizzy

1626
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,040
Doubt-based shows aren't for me

1627
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,920
Tell me, are our rules from wrestling

1628
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,840
Or from free combat

1629
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,800
Or from the octagon

1630
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,680
Just stay alive

1631
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,840
Cue the music

1632
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,160
Start

1633
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,560
Where's the promised elegance?

1634
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,360
My pants

1635
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,560
These pants seem...

1636
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,680
Move the soldier to the far left

1637
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,120
Then swap both sides

1638
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,840
Swap these two

1639
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,360
Swap these two

1640
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,320
I already know everything

1641
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,800
Then I can only not believe it

1642
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,440
This is a soldier

1643
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,880
This is a chariot

1644
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,920
What's this?

1645
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,920
Commander

1646
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,760
Wait a moment

1647
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,320
So this is my day
