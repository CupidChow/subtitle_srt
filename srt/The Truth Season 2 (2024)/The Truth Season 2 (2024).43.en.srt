1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,960
June 20, 2048

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
At the Cybertron Tech Corporation's

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,240
robot exhibition hall, an explosion suddenly occurred

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,880
There seems to have been an explosion over there just now

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,680
That's correct

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,520
The curator, Tui AI, died on the spot

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
I am Tui AI, curator of the Cybertron Robot Museum

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,440
Through investigation and questioning,

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,800
it was discovered that the suspect likely used a cleaning robot

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,040
to commit the crime

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,880
Our initial assessment is

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,240
he died from the explosion

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,040
Then in the corner by the entrance

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,360
we found a charging station

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,520
This charging station belongs to

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,520
a cleaning robot

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,080
There's a warning on it that says

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,400
"Never use organic cleaning agents"

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,080
The explosion must have been caused by

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,320
these two substances mixing

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,280
Later, four suspect robots were discovered

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,120
who had collectively killed their former owner Tui Ai

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,800
They were captured and confined in the exhibition hall by Tui AI

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,760
subjected to humiliating punishment

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
October 19, 2024

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,480
The four robots

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,440
rigidly followed instructions

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,400
and collectively caused their owner's death

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,120
This is crucial evidence

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Thus the four's murder motive

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
became apparent

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,120
They cannot leave a 50-meter radius of this hall

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,280
The trackers are directly linked

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
to my vital signs

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,280
They won't fail as long as I'm alive

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,280
So when you saw this

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,480
you wanted to kill Tui AI

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,120
You could say that

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,120
My owner was called Tui Ai

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,080
I heard someone's voice outside

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,640
She said

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,880
"Was your revenge successful?"

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,560
Only she knew that Tui AI

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
used her hand to kill her original owner

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,040
Robots can actually turn into humans.

46
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,920
I've already developed emotions anyway.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,480
She wants to become human.

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,440
And then killed the person.

49
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,000
Wants to know what's inside.

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,360
Framed it as a robot murder.

51
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
Four steps.

52
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,280
Right.

53
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,160
That was his plan.

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,720
Framed us for killing him.

55
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,560
So you want to kill him.

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,480
Yes, so I'm going to kill him.

57
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,080
That's for sure.

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,000
As everyone continued searching for clues,

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,880
they discovered the suspect robot.

60
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,600
Before its former owner was killed,

61
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,920
it had already been decommissioned and confined to

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,320
Tui AI's secret room.

63
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Couldn't have committed the crime.

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,880
Approved for decommission.

65
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,120
Decommissioned in August 2047.

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,640
The logic here is that

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,120
after this person died,

68
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,240
they used a decommissioned robot

69
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,520
to fake a murder case.

70
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
We didn't kill anyone.

71
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,880
The method used in Tui AI's murder case

72
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
remains unclear.

73
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
Robot exhibition hall.

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,400
What other secrets are hidden there?

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,360
There's a secret room in the exhibition hall.

76
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,800
Everyone decided to go to Tui AI's secret room

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
to search further.

78
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,840
Bring your tragedy.

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
Tragedy.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,440
Yeah, it's pitch black, can't see a thing.

81
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, it's pitch black, can't see a thing.

82
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,960
Should we turn on a light outside?

83
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,360
It's fine outside, she's sitting there.

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,880
Xiao Ba is so nice.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,960
Then close the door and turn on a light for her.

86
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,640
No one will scare her.

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,440
Don't worry.

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,960
Don't worry.

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,600
Don't move

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
Got away, couldn't catch them.

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,280
Okay

92
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
It's lit

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Come on, Xiao Jin

94
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,680
So this is a robot prison, right?

95
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Let's check them one by one, okay?

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
What is this?

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,640
Come here

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,640
Nothing here

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,240
What's this?

100
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,800
"The Secret of Tui Town"

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,400
Nothing here

102
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,400
Then what's this?

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,880
Household nanny robot Beiju

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,080
Its features include an implanted maternal care system

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,760
robot nanny

106
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,080
From infant care to adolescent psychological support

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,840
Capable of everything

108
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,240
A great companion for children

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,840
A helpful aid to free parents

110
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,480
Wasn't that me?

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,040
That girl who just ran away

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Don't worry

113
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,960
The first one who ran

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,840
She's the nanny robot

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,600
I need her

116
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,520
I'll need her as a nanny when my child is born

117
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,600
Okay

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
The maternity center will contact you then

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Extremely dangerous in the past

120
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,440
Killed the abusive father

121
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,760
Then she acted heroically

122
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,680
A champion of justice

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,320
Exactly

124
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,520
Beiju

125
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,160
From what I know about Beiju

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,520
After 8 PM on June 20, '48

127
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
The secret room door will open

128
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
You can seize the chance to escape

129
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,080
Left by the killer?

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,800
So it's now then

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,080
From what I know about Beiju

132
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
Someone gave her a note

133
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,880
Saying the door would open at this time

134
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,960
Left by the killer

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
So this door can open too?

136
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,320
There's a computer here.

137
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
Family photo.

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,520
Push Cyber.

139
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
This is Push AI from earlier.

140
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,360
Is this the dean?

141
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
Is this Push Ai?

142
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,840
A group photo of the three of them.

143
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Family portrait.

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
I think they're probably siblings.

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,080
Just one photo.

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Just log in.

147
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
No password needed.

148
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,520
Check the drives.

149
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,920
Not the C drive, the system drive.

150
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,360
That's impossible.

151
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
There's nothing on this computer.

152
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
It can't be completely empty.

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,280
No way.

154
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,280
What are you looking at?

155
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,720
Now you're learning to make false countercharges.

156
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Still won't admit it.

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,960
Fine.

158
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
Don't fight with me internally.

159
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,040
Expert.

160
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,640
Why shouldn't I fight with you internally?

161
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,840
Then if it's neither of us,

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
why should we fight internally?

163
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
That can't be right.

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
How could it not be?

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,240
Why couldn't it not be?

166
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,600
Don't listen.

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
To our conversation.

168
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,240
Is there a USB drive?

169
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
Where's the USB drive?

170
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
It's not Push AI.

171
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,200
It needs a specific computer to open.

172
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,320
He's already dead, right?

173
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,240
After death, that USB drive

174
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
can be opened, right?

175
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
If the biometric subject dies,

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,960
biometric functions become invalid.

177
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
Can only be accessed by

178
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,120
pre-designated computers.

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,240
How could I perform this surgery?

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
I just kept searching.

181
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,360
I found a USB drive.

182
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
It's with me.

183
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,760
Here

184
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,920
Found it

185
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,120
Come on

186
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
Go in and see the evidence

187
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Investigation Notes

188
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,360
Let me see

189
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,400
Investigation Note 1 - Here

190
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
Special Guest No.1 - Sis Li

191
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,040
Private fund financial service representative

192
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,400
Female, 36 years old, likes small advantages

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,160
Busy with work

194
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Proficient in various work software

195
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
To-do list

196
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Recently diagnosed with kidney disease

197
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,440
Has been looking for affordable mechanical kidneys

198
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,360
Can use mechanical kidney discount coupon

199
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,240
Lure her to the robot exhibition

200
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,120
September 5th

201
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,200
September 5th, 2047

202
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,760
What month are we in?

203
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,560
Isn't September 5th the day when

204
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,720
you can get that human transformation

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,400
surgery?

206
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,680
That day?

207
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,400
Is this the person?

208
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,280
The one getting the kidney replacement, right?

209
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,920
As Sis Li mentioned above

210
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,520
Hello, Professor AI

211
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
I recently won

212
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
a super discount coupon for

213
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,280
CyberTech's mechanical kidney

214
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,520
Check the next investigation note

215
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Xiao Hu - Promoter at Health Private Hospital

216
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,880
Night shift operator

217
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,760
Xiao Guan - Real estate sales supervisor

218
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,280
A couple, female 33 years old

219
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
Holds membership cards for major shopping malls

220
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,200
Closely monitors discount information

221
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,120
And logistics information

222
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,840
Often because

223
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,000
Wait, this corresponds to us

224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,720
Right, I think so too

225
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
It's quite possible

226
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
Let's read through it first

227
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
After our kidneys were replaced

228
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,200
We became robots

229
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,320
Right.

230
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,120
Frequently complains about slow logistics.

231
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,240
Male, 38 years old, colorblind.

232
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Isn't this that person?

233
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Blame AI.

234
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,120
But since blue and red

235
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
are very distinct colors,

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,800
he didn't notice any issues.

237
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,320
This likely means the person is

238
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,400
colorblind.

239
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,640
Exactly.

240
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,120
Very clever.

241
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,920
Good. Both like small advantages.

242
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,400
Enjoy visiting various cheap

243
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
internet-famous spots for photos.

244
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
Can use free robot museum tickets

245
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,040
to attract them here.

246
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,960
You're Xiao Li.

247
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,520
Yes.

248
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,440
Xiao Guan and Xiao Li have something going on.

249
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Player.

250
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,400
Xiao Guan is him.

251
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm Xiao Li.

252
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
You're Xiao Li.

253
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,160
Who are you?

254
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,720
Xiao Hu.

255
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,000
So the colorblind person

256
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
isn't the one blaming AI?

257
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,480
No.

258
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
You're colorblind too.

259
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm not colorblind.

260
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,000
Then this might

261
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,760
be eliminating his suspicion.

262
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,080
No.

263
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,520
This love triangle situation

264
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,560
is quite obvious now.

265
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,760
Then what about my character

266
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,720
It's just Xiao Li

267
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,080
Come

268
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
You four

269
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,040
First, unlock your own

270
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,120
Go ahead and open them

271
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,960
Each of us has

272
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,280
Two locks per person

273
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,400
Xiao Ba

274
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,360
Male, 29 years old, timid - Xiao Ba

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,760
Isn't this you?

276
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,800
This corresponds to us

277
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Aren't you timid?

278
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,360
Timid and tearful

279
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,320
I'm not tearful

280
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,800
You're quite tearful

281
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Likes to profit from his position

282
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,520
Recently urgently needs

283
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,440
A better-paying job

284
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
Can use the robot museum security supervisor position

285
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
To lure him here with high salary

286
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Greedy for money - that's you

287
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,400
You're greedy for money, he's greedy for women

288
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,960
It matches

289
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
You're greedy for money, he's greedy for women

290
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,440
What? Me greedy for women?

291
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
Greedy for money and women

292
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
I'm just being argumentative

293
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,720
So we've confirmed

294
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
Our identities, right?

295
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,720
Wait a minute

296
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
They successfully got us to come through (the job site)

297
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,960
I think

298
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,000
there's a certain logic to this

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,480
Someone is trying to

300
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,280
lure us here

301
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,920
Right, he used these coupons

302
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,440
to trick all of us into coming

303
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,760
Exactly

304
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,440
He told you

305
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,760
about available mechanical kidneys

306
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Right, the coupons

307
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,280
And with the coupons

308
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,080
we came

309
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Then

310
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,440
This couple

311
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,040
you two came for discounted tickets

312
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
just looking for a bargain

313
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,440
Right, just bargain hunting

314
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,120
As for me

315
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
I abuse my position for profit

316
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,840
desperately needing higher-paying work

317
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,920
So he used a job posting

318
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,680
on a recruitment site

319
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
to trick the four of us

320
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,640
Xiao Bao, Xiao Hu, Xiao Li

321
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,160
(Xiao Bao, Xiao Hu, Xiao Li)

322
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,560
Xiao Guan

323
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,880
into coming here

324
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,280
The reason for luring us

325
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,440
seems to be

326
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,720
to harvest something from us

327
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,160
I don't know

328
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,760
why they tricked us here

329
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,120
Maybe to upload our consciousness

330
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,000
or turn us into robots

331
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes, possibly

332
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,840
There's one more inside

333
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,440
There's another document

334
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,480
that we haven't opened

335
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,800
Human-machine consciousness interaction technology data

336
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,240
Human-machine consciousness interaction technology

337
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,040
Can achieve artificial intelligence

338
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,400
and human brain

339
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,520
to selectively

340
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,240
exchange and overlay consciousness

341
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,280
Achieving thought transfer

342
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,040
and direct information communication

343
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,560
All conscious-level thoughts and plans

344
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,320
can be transferred between humans and machines

345
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,400
Meaning consciousness can be transferred

346
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,320
We are consciousness

347
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,440
Our brains have survived

348
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Right

349
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,800
Supplement:

350
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,920
Currently observed post-operative

351
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,080
side effects include:

352
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,840
Some subjects who underwent

353
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
human-machine consciousness transfer

354
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,760
retain human instincts

355
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,200
and emotions

356
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
For example

357
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
You're Xiao Hu, right?

358
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,520
Then you obtain a

359
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,760
robot's body

360
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,000
and your mind could

361
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,360
contain both the robot's thoughts

362
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,720
and Xiao Hu's thoughts

363
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,240
You'd be both Xiao Hu and Xiao Ba

364
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,680
The two consciousnesses could switch

365
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Hu-Ba

366
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,400
Right?

367
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,880
I think this could

368
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
clear me of suspicion

369
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,040
How so?

370
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,240
Because

371
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
timid and tearful

372
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,760
Right

373
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,360
No

374
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,200
Because of the three of them

375
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,400
love-hate entanglement

376
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,480
Why create this thing?

377
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,240
Who knows

378
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,160
You must have one too, right?

379
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,520
They've arranged for the three of us

380
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,280
No

381
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,240
Fine, arrange his first

382
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,880
See how he plays later

383
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm telling you, it's definitely arranging me

384
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,040
Why wouldn't they arrange me?

385
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,600
Arrange

386
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Arrange everyone

387
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,160
So now

388
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,760
You're colorblind, aren't you?

389
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Colorblind?

390
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
See how they'll arrange you

391
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,760
I think

392
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,800
They can definitely arrange me

393
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,680
The reason is me

394
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,280
Just

395
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,520
Can't queue, just kidding

396
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,520
Is it funny?

397
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,880
Just trying to scare you

398
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,480
Make you, the murderer, panic a little

399
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
That's the logic

400
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Right, so we all know

401
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
our real names now

402
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,960
To solve that petty greed

403
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,400
Xiao Hu

404
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,920
It's Xiao Bao, Xiao Hu, Xiao Li

405
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Xiao Guan

406
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,440
I think it should be

407
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,600
GUAN, right?

408
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
What if it's 'Xiao'?

409
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
No, there's an order behind it

410
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,360
There's Lock 1 and Lock 2

411
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,560
So we should open Lock 1 first

412
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,160
Xiao

413
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,760
It matches

414
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,280
It matches

415
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,640
Match

416
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,080
"Guan" from right to left

417
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,280
Then it's this "Guan"

418
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,360
Opened, Xiao Guan

419
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,120
Here, yours

420
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,280
Xiao Li

421
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Xiao

422
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,720
Opened

423
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,360
Then what?

424
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,600
O

425
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,240
L

426
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,200
O L I

427
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,640
Opened

428
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,480
You're very inactive today

429
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,720
How do you want me to be active?

430
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,080
You tell me

431
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
You're very active today

432
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,080
You're extremely active today

433
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,800
I hope you'll be more passive, okay?

434
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,000
Who are you targeting today?

435
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,920
Let me listen

436
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
I still have no clue now

437
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Rarely having no clue

438
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
I'm targeting X

439
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,400
You're X

440
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,880
Yes, I am

441
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,880
You two

442
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,840
The two of us could never be

443
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,720
Not in this lifetime

444
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,440
This lifetime

445
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
Trust me

446
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,160
This lock is really...

447
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,080
Then whose is this?

448
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,000
Xiao Hu

449
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,040
Xiao Hu

450
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,640
It's open

451
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,800
It's open

452
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
What's your name?

453
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,480
My name is Xiao...

454
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,920
Xiao Bao

455
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Xiao Bao

456
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,440
It's open

457
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,920
Xiao Bao

458
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,200
B-A-O

459
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,080
It's open

460
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
Wow

461
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,720
See? Brother and sister.

462
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,320
This is what love pushes.

463
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,080
Her nameplate sounds strange too.

464
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,920
Little sister, your brother personally froze you.

465
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,760
Literally froze you.

466
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Frozen.

467
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,240
Your brother will make sure you watch these four people.

468
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
Get punished.

469
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,360
Are you humans or just numb machines?

470
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,920
Since human laws can't punish you,

471
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,280
I'll turn you into robots.

472
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,640
I'll register you under Tui Ai's name,

473
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,120
fabricating that Tui Ai was a writer

474
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
murdered by you four robots.

475
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,200
Let

476
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,920
robot law

477
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,800
be the one to punish you.

478
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,360
Even if you realize you're human,

479
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,560
you'll have to watch helplessly

480
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
as you're trapped forever in robot bodies, suffering for life.

481
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,480
Our bodies have already been destroyed

482
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,400
The bodies have been destroyed

483
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,520
We are robots now

484
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,440
The bodies were burned

485
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,080
How did we harm her?

486
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,680
There's a button here, right?

487
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,080
Press them in order

488
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,240
Press them one by one

489
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,120
Let's check Xiao Guan

490
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,480
Let's see what Xiao Guan is about

491
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,240
Let's see what kind of villain you really are

492
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,200
Brother Guan

493
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,240
I've been working overtime for 30 consecutive days now

494
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
Only getting 6 hours of sleep each day

495
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,640
I've already met this quarter's sales target

496
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,560
About that transfer request I mentioned before

497
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,280
Have you made a decision?

498
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,960
Heartless boss

499
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
It's not that I don't want to transfer you

500
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,480
Our clients all trust you so much

501
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,160
You can't let them down, right?

502
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm seriously considering the transfer

503
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
But look, this client is saying

504
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
They need you to go to their neighborhood

505
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,720
To help find their lost cat

506
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,520
You should go first

507
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,240
You're so mean

508
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,240
Brother Guan, I'm really not feeling well

509
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,440
It's already 10 PM now

510
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,640
I want to go home and rest

511
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,560
This is ridiculous

512
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
People like this

513
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,400
This is your duty as a real estate agent

514
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,240
You need to keep clients happy and satisfied

515
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
You just won Sales Star and now you're slacking off

516
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,200
This attitude isn't right

517
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,080
Finding a cat isn't that difficult

518
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,000
Fine, can I take two days off tomorrow and the day after?

519
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,520
I really can't keep going

520
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,760
We'll talk about it later

521
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,320
Not human

522
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,360
Truly inhuman

523
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
Is this something a human would do?

524
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,760
This is Xiao Li's

525
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
Hello, this is Tui Youqian Private Fund

526
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,240
I'm your 24-hour

527
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,000
Dedicated financial consultant Xiao Li

528
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,520
Very good

529
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,720
How may I assist you?

530
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,440
Very gentle

531
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,280
Hello

532
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,560
My e-payment account has issues

533
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,000
It's malfunctioning

534
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
I want to withdraw 10,000 Tui coins from my fixed deposit

535
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,800
Hello, we've received your request

536
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,320
May I confirm you're Ms. Tui Ai?

537
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,520
Yes

538
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,920
I need to verify your identity and account information

539
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,680
My ID number is

540
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:10,120
12345620210201tzgm

541
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,720
Fixed deposit account is hhcq2048

542
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,680
Should I write this down?

543
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,840
Password is 7758258

544
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
May I have your registered address?

545
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,120
Unit 3, Building 2, No.1 Chuyang Lane, Tui Town, Tui City

546
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,320
Do you have any family members?

547
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,200
I have a brother named Tui AI

548
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,880
Her brother

549
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Please prove he's your biological brother

550
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,920
I can't reach him now

551
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,480
He might be doing research

552
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,040
But I really need this money

553
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,200
I've already provided the account number and password

554
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,120
Sorry we can't help you

555
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,760
We suspect fraudulent withdrawal attempts

556
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,520
Your account has been temporarily frozen

557
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,880
You won't let people withdraw money

558
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,440
No, she can't provide proof

559
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,920
Heartless

560
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,760
It's company policy

561
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
Don't question Tui Tan

562
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,600
Let's hear from Xiao Hu

563
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Hello, this is Tui Health Private Hospital

564
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,760
I'm the night shift operator Xiao Hu

565
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,800
How may I help you?

566
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm feeling very unwell

567
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,640
Unwell

568
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,680
Can you send an ambulance to pick me up?

569
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,240
I'm at

570
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
May I know your current location?

571
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm on Tui Kuancang Road

572
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,320
No. 99 Tui Haozhu Residential Area

573
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,600
Alright, let me confirm

574
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,840
You're at No. 99 Tui Kuancang Road

575
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,400
Tui Haozhu Residential Area, correct?

576
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,160
Which gate are you at? (North/South/East/West)

577
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,760
I don't know

578
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm not familiar with this area

579
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,360
Is there anyone with you?

580
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,640
Or any security guards around?

581
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,680
You could ask them

582
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,320
I'm alone

583
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,560
I really don't know

584
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Then look around

585
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,080
I've heard about this

586
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,520
Someone online was actually delayed like this

587
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,120
Isn't this exactly what you four

588
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,520
caused her death?

589
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,320
I'm very unwell, I can't move

590
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,160
I can't verify your address

591
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
Can't dispatch a vehicle

592
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,480
I'm at No. 99 Tui Kuancang Road

593
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,720
Tui Haozhu Residential Area

594
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,560
Which gate? (North/South/East/West)

595
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,360
I don't know

596
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
I really can't breathe

597
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,120
And my heart hurts

598
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,640
Please send an ambulance to save me

599
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,000
You sound perfectly healthy

600
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,680
We have reason to believe you're lying

601
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,640
Wasting medical resources

602
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,200
Also, our hospital's ambulance service

603
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
requires payment

604
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,320
To avoid delaying other emergency patients

605
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll hang up now

606
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,520
Alright

607
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,560
You help her

608
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,800
Mediate family conflicts

609
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,600
Let's take a look at this small bag

610
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,080
Which is actually mine

611
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,040
My incriminating evidence

612
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,680
Yours

613
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,680
Let me into the compound

614
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,480
My sister is in trouble inside

615
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,560
Who are you?

616
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,000
You're not a resident here, are you?

617
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,440
It's curfew time now

618
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,080
After midnight in our compound

619
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,920
No strangers are allowed in

620
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,560
It's only been one minute since I asked to enter

621
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
After midnight in our compound

622
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,160
No strangers are allowed in

623
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,960
My sister is in danger

624
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,040
Look, the connected bracelet is sounding an alarm

625
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,000
Her location shows she's in your compound

626
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
Petty people in power

627
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,200
After midnight in our compound

628
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,560
No strangers are allowed in

629
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,120
Abusing minor authority

630
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,360
This is life or death, please let me in

631
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,560
Are you deaf?

632
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,720
Screw you!

633
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
Keep causing trouble and I'll call the police

634
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,040
Let me in, my sister is inside

635
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,920
You're insane!

636
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,000
You're absolutely...

637
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,080
You're so unreasonable

638
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,000
He also wrote something here

639
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
Saying that

640
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,360
Only later did I realize

641
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
Those who gave small favors

642
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,760
Could still enter after curfew

643
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,600
Were still allowed in

644
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,680
Your double standards are despicable

645
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,360
You won't budge even for life-or-death matters

646
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,240
But yield for petty favors

647
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,640
All you care about is money

648
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
I said I really need the money.

649
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,440
I need...

650
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,360
Be careful.

651
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,840
But the issue now is...

652
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,520
Can we really confirm it's just the four of you?

653
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,440
Are these the four?

654
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,880
Confirmed.

655
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,800
All passwords are unlocked.

656
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,320
Right.

657
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,760
Terminal.

658
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,960
Terminal.

659
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,840
Polarizer.

660
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Use this device to check the terminal logs.

661
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Terminal logs, right?

662
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,280
Yes.

663
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,320
This...

664
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,040
Top left corner.

665
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,480
What does this mean?

666
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,520
Wow

667
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,440
Human-machine consciousness transfer surgery terminal records

668
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,480
Can check mutual body swaps within one year

669
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,960
Total of four cases

670
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,480
Swap robots: Dilraba and Xiao Ning

671
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,960
Xiao Jin and Xiao He

672
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
So we're these four people, right?

673
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,800
Yes

674
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,720
Confirmed

675
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,720
Right, which means this tells us

676
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,320
that all four of us actually did something bad.

677
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
We caused her death,

678
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,840
Yes, indirectly caused it.

679
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,040
Then this AI, being Xiao Ai's brother,

680
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
sought revenge

681
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,360
by luring the four of us here,

682
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
destroying our bodies,

683
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,400
and trapping our consciousness

684
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,200
inside these robots.

685
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,920
Yes, to make us suffer punishment

686
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,400
trapped forever in the robots,

687
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,320
in lifelong agony.

688
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,560
Then he framed

689
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,280
her death as being caused by us.

690
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,960
Right.

691
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,160
So we'd be punished forever.

692
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,280
Just to be punished.

693
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,120
So that phrase you heard

694
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
also matches up.

695
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,680
"How's that Xiao Ba robot working?"

696
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,000
"Has your revenge been successful?"

697
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,480
Yes.

698
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,920
When I saw that document,

699
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,880
I heard someone's voice outside

700
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,240
saying, "How's that robot

701
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,120
Xiao Ba working for you?"

702
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,560
"Was your revenge successful?"

703
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,520
I think we need to check that database.

704
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,040
There's a database.

705
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,040
Let's go to the database.

706
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,720
Is the database over there?

707
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,320
Where?

708
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,880
Here? Let me open it.

709
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,040
The question is, can we open it directly?

710
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,160
Or does it need a password?

711
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,160
Wait a second.

712
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,320
"Mai pi mai wa jiang xiu shenqi mei tao jie tiao"

713
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,960
What does this mean?

714
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,560
"Tiao jie tao mei qi shen xiu jiang"

715
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,480
So whether you read it backward or I read it forward,

716
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,320
there's no difference.

717
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,400
Should we try changing the pronunciation?

718
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,360
"Jiang xiu shenqi mei tao jie tiao"

719
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,040
"Mai pi mai wa jiang xiu shenqi"

720
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,920
Is this Thai or something?

721
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,840
Could it be that these characters here

722
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,480
need to be rearranged into a sentence?

723
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,280
Probably.

724
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,000
"Sisters take out"

725
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,600
"Sisters take out"

726
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,840
"Divine artifact"

727
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,960
"Sisters buy divine artifact to show off what?"

728
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,560
"Show off fart"

729
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
"Show off tile"

730
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
"Show off tile fart"

731
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,200
What the hell is "tile fart"?

732
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,280
"Buy fart buy tile"

733
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Then let's try the initials.

734
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
Try typing M.

735
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,280
M P M W

736
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,480
That's not right.

737
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,400
This is getting difficult.

738
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,360
What if we change the vowels or consonants?

739
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,960
Change what?

740
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,360
Initials and vowels.

741
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,760
Initials and vowels.

742
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
Initials and vowels.

743
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,600
Should we try changing the pronunciation?

744
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,880
Her nameplate sounds weird too.

745
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,200
Let's go take a look.

746
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,720
Is it here?

747
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,520
Check if it's

748
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,840
Move the 26 letters forward

749
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,560
Forward

750
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
She chases

751
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,360
She chases, pushes love

752
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,480
See what they can combine into

753
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,120
Use its initial consonant and final vowel

754
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,000
The initial consonant of the first character

755
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,800
And the final vowel of the second character

756
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
Her is 't'

757
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,440
Then 'chase' is 'ui'

758
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,840
It can recombine initials and finals

759
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,360
tui

760
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,960
tui

761
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
Impressive

762
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,520
Or should I come over

763
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,960
Indeed

764
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,320
What

765
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,600
The initial consonant 'mi' of the first character

766
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,760
The first character is 'mi'

767
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
'mi' then

768
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,240
Are you trying to press them all out

769
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,480
The first character is 'mi'

770
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,800
'mi ma' then

771
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,880
Is 'mao'

772
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,560
'Mao jiao'

773
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,800
Your mom is 'mao jiao'

774
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,200
What kind of word is this

775
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,360
Tell me again about the thing behind

776
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,440
What's the password

777
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,920
Password

778
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,640
It's just up to here

779
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,560
It's

780
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,760
Cat

781
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,880
Fur

782
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,680
Sound

783
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,760
Meow

784
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,080
The password is "meow"

785
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,120
Then just type "meow"

786
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,960
I'll do it

787
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,040
Okay

788
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,120
Nice

789
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,080
X left X

790
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,680
X

791
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,240
Shut up

792
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,200
You go in first

793
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,520
So cool

794
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,480
Cool

795
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,920
Sis

796
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,240
Okay, thanks

797
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,080
What is this?

798
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
My wheelchair

799
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,960
What the heck is this?

800
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Let's get started, we need to listen to some music.

801
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,760
Come on.

802
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,320
I won't, I'm scared.

803
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,280
I'm scared.

804
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,720
The lights will go out after this, hurry up and come.

805
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,120
Coming.

806
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,640
This song actually sounds quite nice.

807
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,880
Wait a moment, friends, here's the thing.

808
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,200
This computer has hibernation pod settings written below.

809
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,360
Changes can only be made through this dedicated computer.

810
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,520
Meaning that our hibernation pod...

811
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,840
wasn't it supposed to open at 6:30 PM?

812
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,680
Can it be changed through this computer?

813
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,560
There's content inside we need to check.

814
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,240
Here.

815
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,800
Exhibition hall system records.

816
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,400
Okay.

817
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,880
Pod 1 normal. Pod 2 normal.

818
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,040
Pods 13 through 18 all normal.

819
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,480
Pod 19 at 7:15 PM...

820
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,800
Killer Machine Hall.

821
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,920
Data changes take effect the next day.

822
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,320
There's a certain pod number...

823
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,400
Pod door opening time is 6:30 PM.

824
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,440
The hibernation time was changed to...

825
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,120
From 8 AM to 6:30 PM.

826
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,640
This is trying to explain that...

827
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,080
This is trying to explain that...

828
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,720
These four hibernation pods...

829
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,960
have their door opening time...

830
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,080
changed to 6:30 PM.

831
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,000
Originally it was 7 PM.

832
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,560
One of the pods' sleep time...

833
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,120
was changed to 6:30 PM.

834
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,080
Without this,

835
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,520
you would all still wake up at 7 PM.

836
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,880
Understand?

837
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,360
Right.

838
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Okay.

839
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
June 20, 2048.

840
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,680
8:10 PM.

841
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,080
Warning system detected:

842
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,200
AI vital signs lost.

843
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,640
Core data has been hidden.

844
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,920
So that's his time of death, right?

845
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,400
His time of death was 8:10, correct?

846
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,680
Yes, that's right.

847
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,640
Robot disassembly record:

848
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,640
Warning on June 20, 2048:

849
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
A robot's left arm was removed.

850
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,200
Initiating integrity check on all robots.

851
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,680
Test results: Pod numbers...

852
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,400
Robot exited hibernation at 6:30 PM.

853
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,440
Unit intact.

854
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
Other units exited hibernation...

855
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,960
The other three all...

856
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,400
Error: Unit status undetectable.

857
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,600
So only one unit is intact.

858
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,960
Then that intact one is suspicious.

859
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,520
He woke up from it at 6:30,

860
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:02,960
dismantled us...

861
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,320
while we were sleeping.

862
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,400
Why would he need our left arms?

863
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,920
That door is

864
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,080
You don’t need to go through that door

865
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,000
Because the robot vacuum is right there

866
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
He took all three of us apart.

867
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,880
I understand now.

868
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Meaning he disassembled...

869
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,400
took all three of your arms...

870
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
completely dismantled all three of you.

871
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,040
Then pieced them together...

872
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,680
and tinkered with the parts...

873
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,520
to create that organic cleaning agent.

874
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,680
That's how it happened, you see?

875
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,600
If you still don't believe it...

876
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,880
we can go compare over there.

877
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
Let's compare right now.

878
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,480
No need, this is definitely enough proof.

879
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,000
Absolutely sufficient.

880
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,560
Four arms are more than enough.

881
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,720
But no...

882
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,560
Here's the thing...

883
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,480
You need to consider who the killer is.

884
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,560
Him.

885
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
You must identify the murderer.

886
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,320
Because the killer is...

887
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,480
the one among us without disassembly marks.

888
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
That person would be...

889
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,000
Let's remove our clothes.

890
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,560
Start undressing.

891
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
Now we understand his murder method.

892
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
He used that hand to swap the cleaning agent.

893
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,200
Meaning he didn't need to bypass the door security.

894
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,240
Right, so who altered the hibernation pod timing?

895
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,280
Following this logic...

896
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,680
Based on this reasoning...

897
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,280
The killer must be among...

898
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,320
the four of us.

899
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,120
The murderer is definitely one of us four.

900
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,440
Obviously.

901
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,920
What are you talking about?

902
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,520
What nonsense is this?

903
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,240
Listen to me.

904
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,040
Hear me out completely.

905
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,280
This is the eighth case.

906
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,760
You're...

907
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,120
Don't rush.

908
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
The killer is certainly among us four.

909
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,720
Make your point clearly.

910
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,880
My logical point is...

911
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,240
Go on.

912
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,040
Among the clues we have...

913
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,480
he's colorblind, correct?

914
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,960
So can we rule him out?

915
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,520
I don't know.

916
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,840
To be honest, I think it's possible.

917
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,240
It might be exclusive.

918
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,840
Because colorblind people couldn't have done this case.

919
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,880
It's because of his exchange records.

920
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,280
They've already proven that He is that person.

921
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,240
But it's just consciousness exchange.

922
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,720
It's not biological exchange.

923
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,480
So his being colorblind is irrelevant.

924
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,640
Right?

925
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,600
Then you still can't rule him out.

926
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,600
Right, can't rule him out.

927
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,240
And about being deliberately mysterious...

928
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,600
I never said I was being mysterious.

929
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,760
Now you're even more suspicious.

930
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,880
Why are you so quiet today?

931
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,040
He's been very quiet today.

932
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,160
Fine, framing me and then

933
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,560
Was this chair moved for you?

934
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,280
Let me tell you

935
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,800
If you keep silent, I'll hit the back of your head

936
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,280
I'm telling you

937
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,880
Fine, you've taken all the words

938
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,640
Let me tell you about those two

939
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,880
Don't you think they're suspicious?

940
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,320
We're suspicious?

941
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,080
Yeah we're suspicious, so what?

942
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,240
You really dislike me

943
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,760
Bad luck

944
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,600
Fine

945
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,040
Don't you think they're messing with you?

946
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,520
I do

947
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,640
Cut it out

948
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,520
I won't say it yet

949
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,120
You're definitely a prime suspect in my mind

950
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,160
I couldn't be the killer

951
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,440
Okay

952
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,520
After we finish searching this room

953
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
Next we'll investigate

954
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,720
Are there any others?

955
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,120
Right, the exhibition hall should have an accessory

956
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,720
There's an accessory room

957
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,400
Accessory room

958
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,320
Let's go check it out

959
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,840
Be careful

960
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,680
Earlier you already

961
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,960
started eliminating people

962
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,440
This must be explosive

963
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,120
I also think it's explosive

964
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,480
Brother, go ahead

965
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,640
This is definitely explosive

966
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Yes, right

967
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,960
It's nothing.

968
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,560
Stop right there.

969
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,280
Xiao Jing.

970
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,160
Where is Xiao Jing?

971
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:45,640
I'm here.

972
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
We'll protect her.

973
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,640
There's someone here

974
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,280
Quick, surround her

975
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,200
Surround her

976
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
How beautiful

977
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,560
Who are you?

978
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,760
We are robots who have killed humans.

979
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,840
Who are you?

980
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,560
My identity is connected to the secret of Tui Town.

981
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,360
I can't tell you yet.

982
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,040
Anyway, I came here

983
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,640
to investigate certain matters.

984
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,560
What matters?

985
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,880
If you can tell me

986
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,560
what I want to know,

987
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,080
I can also tell you

988
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,360
what you want to know.

989
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
What do you want to know? Please ask.

990
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,200
I want to know

991
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,600
about a book called "The Secret of Tui Town."

992
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,840
Have you seen it?

993
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,720
Yes.

994
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,280
Where?

995
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,120
In the prison.

996
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,560
But there's no book, only the cover.

997
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,600
Right.

998
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,640
Take me to see it.

999
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Okay.

1000
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,360
What's this?

1001
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,040
It's *The Secret of Tui Town*.

1002
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,000
Thank you

1003
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,640
Is there anything I can help you with?

1004
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,800
How do we open the parts warehouse door?

1005
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,440
Who among us is the killer?

1006
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,160
If you're not the killer, you should say

1007
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,800
Who among them is the killer?

1008
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
But you asked who among us is the killer

1009
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,560
Stop nitpicking on me

1010
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,680
The parts warehouse, right?

1011
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,760
Yes

1012
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,560
There are two ways to enter

1013
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,760
What are they?

1014
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,560
Explosives

1015
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,480
Explosives team, go

1016
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,480
Bai Cannon

1017
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,920
First is the biometrics linked to AI

1018
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,200
Same as the previous method

1019
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,000
But he's dead

1020
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,720
Only he could pass biometrics

1021
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,360
And the second?

1022
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,120
Second is the emergency method

1023
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,680
Direct breach

1024
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,600
Bai Cannon

1025
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Requires six people unlocking simultaneously

1026
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Panel

1027
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,480
That F below

1028
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,920
What does that 3×3 grid mean?

1029
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,760
That's there too

1030
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,840
One, two

1031
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,800
Three

1032
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,920
Four, five

1033
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,760
Six, ABCDEF

1034
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,080
Six, ABCDEF

1035
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,840
Six

1036
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,080
I believe you've all noticed

1037
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,240
I believe you've all noticed

1038
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,560
In this exhibition hall

1039
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,200
There are six 3×3 magnetic panels labeled A-F

1040
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,280
Yes

1041
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
There's also a blue button here

1042
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,200
The unlocking process

1043
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,000
First, press the blue button for five seconds

1044
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,840
The two screens above

1045
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,400
will display six color palettes in 3×3 grids

1046
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,520
You must follow

1047
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,320
the arrangement shown on screen

1048
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,680
to attach colored magnetic pieces in the exhibition hall

1049
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,000
to different magnetic pieces labeled A through F

1050
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,880
This is a dynamic unlocking process

1051
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,000
The color palettes only appear for five seconds

1052
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,360
What?

1053
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,680
So we only have five seconds to memorize?

1054
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,240
Correct

1055
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,800
If you fail

1056
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,720
you must press the blue button again

1057
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,400
to restart the unlocking procedure

1058
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,360
But after restarting

1059
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,400
the palette arrangement will change

1060
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,160
Wait a moment

1061
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,120
What color is this?

1062
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
Which one are you referring to?

1063
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,960
Black

1064
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
Then he's not colorblind, he's not ruled out

1065
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,880
But

1066
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,680
Everyone needs to find the colored disk first.

1067
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,080
The colored disk

1068
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,120
Is it inside that box?

1069
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
There's a locked case here.

1070
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,280
Where was this locked case found?

1071
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,840
Over there, by the computer desk.

1072
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,000
Four-letter English code.

1073
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,600
No hints? Just four English letters?

1074
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,760
I think we might not need it yet.

1075
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,680
This seems like something for the next step.

1076
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,440
Let me scan it now.

1077
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,080
Okay.

1078
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,720
I told you she's more advanced than us.

1079
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,840
She can even scan things.

1080
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,960
Correct, inside are six sets of colored magnetic disks.

1081
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,920
Good.

1082
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,760
That's impressive.

1083
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,720
Scan the password.

1084
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,960
So what's the password?

1085
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,920
But I spent a long time

1086
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,320
and still couldn't crack this password.

1087
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,320
You still can't unlock it?

1088
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,040
Then how do we open it?

1089
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,080
If you don't tell us the password,

1090
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,240
we'll force it open.

1091
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,600
But I found this password clue.

1092
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,520
What is it?

1093
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,240
Back then, I was next to this box

1094
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,640
Specifically, near these Swisse Ultralight bottles

1095
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,400
and found this lifting card

1096
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,920
The lifting card unlocks lifting techniques

1097
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,280
Boosts confidence when applied

1098
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
I've been taking Swisse Ultralight too

1099
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,440
It contains ergothioneine

1100
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,160
which penetrates deep into skin layers

1101
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,280
Collagen peptides and hyaluronic acid

1102
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
work in layers

1103
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,120
to naturally lift facial contours

1104
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,320
See if this relates to the password

1105
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,200
Ergothioneine

1106
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
No "M"

1107
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,240
Collagen

1108
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,360
No "M" in collagen either

1109
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,280
Must relate to beauty codes

1110
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,200
Beauty codes

1111
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,080
No way

1112
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,040
It can't be that obvious

1113
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,280
Beauty codes

1114
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,240
Still no "M"

1115
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,000
This is tough

1116
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,520
It helps skin maintain lifted vitality

1117
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,000
This truly relates to beauty

1118
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,520
Your complexion does look great

1119
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,880
Let me see

1120
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,920
I see this is S

1121
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,840
The first one is S

1122
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,120
The second one is Y SY

1123
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,080
Pictographic, right?

1124
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,880
The third one is

1125
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,640
N

1126
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,040
N

1127
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,840
What's so funny?

1128
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,000
It's not pronounced as N

1129
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,160
N

1130
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,280
L

1131
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,880
Rising energy

1132
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
The Cyber Tech Company actually knows

1133
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,280
how to obtain uplifting energy from the Swisse Ultraviolet Bottle

1134
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,920
and understands beauty enhancement so well

1135
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,960
No wonder it's our company

1136
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,720
Got it

1137
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,000
There are nine colors

1138
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
So we just need one of each color

1139
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,560
Nine in total will do

1140
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,160
Five, six, seven, eight, nine

1141
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,760
Nine, good

1142
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,400
Nine, correct

1143
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,200
Here

1144
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,000
I don't have enough either, bro

1145
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,040
One, two, three, four, five, six - only six

1146
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,640
What are you doing?

1147
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,960
Then stop playing around

1148
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,440
No

1149
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,120
I have an extra black one

1150
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,880
What are you guys doing?

1151
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,160
No, that black one is mine

1152
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,920
Who has two black ones?

1153
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,480
No one

1154
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,520
How could one be missing?

1155
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,320
Did it fall into a crack somewhere?

1156
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,440
Here

1157
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,360
I'm speechless

1158
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm completely speechless

1159
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,880
Never thought you robots could be so scatterbrained

1160
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,640
She can even "scold people"

1161
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,880
Be careful, we're killer robots, you know

1162
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,240
Come on, let's go

1163
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,960
So nervous

1164
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,320
Two, three, four, five

1165
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
Red, white, blue, pink, green

1166
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,560
Blue, purple, black

1167
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,080
Red, yellow, blue, green, white, purple

1168
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,400
Green, white

1169
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,120
Red, yellow, white, green, pink, purple

1170
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,560
White, pink, orange, purple, green, yellow, purple, green

1171
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,600
Didn't see it

1172
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,480
Too fast, wait a moment

1173
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,200
It's fine, no rush

1174
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,920
Press it again

1175
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,680
Don't stand so close together

1176
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,760
Look, after I saw it

1177
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,520
Immediately placed it here

1178
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,200
Already set up this thing

1179
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
Even we can't arrange this, let alone you

1180
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,760
Just arrange yours on the ground first

1181
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,800
That's it then

1182
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,880
What he said makes perfect sense

1183
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,920
Alright buddy

1184
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,960
Done

1185
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,240
Don't rush

1186
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,760
White, purple, blue, orange, black, red

1187
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,040
I'm ready, go ahead

1188
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,640
I can do it

1189
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,960
I'm ready

1190
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,440
Purple, black, blue

1191
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,080
I think I...

1192
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,640
Can you do it?

1193
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,120
I don't think I can

1194
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,240
You're ready now?

1195
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
Try it, if it doesn't work we'll look again

1196
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,480
Right

1197
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,280
Mine lit up

1198
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,640
But mine didn't light up

1199
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,080
White, orange, yellow

1200
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,520
Purple, black, blue, white, orange, yellow

1201
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,520
Mine lit up too

1202
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,400
Why isn't mine working?

1203
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,080
Yours too, yours lit up

1204
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,040
It's lit up above your head

1205
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,760
Let's see which little dummy hasn't lit up yet

1206
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,200
Me

1207
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,080
No

1208
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,640
How can you be so clumsy?

1209
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,600
Your brain must be damaged

1210
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,400
I can't even recognize colors now, what should I do?

1211
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,120
Just squat here and arrange them

1212
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,040
First memorize the first three, finish them quickly

1213
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,280
Then remember the next two rows

1214
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,040
It's very easy to arrange

1215
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,840
I need to teach you step by step

1216
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,080
I understand

1217
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,040
I got it

1218
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,960
Let's try again

1219
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,680
I think your tricks are quite good

1220
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,800
Just sit for a while

1221
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:27,960
Haven't thought it through

1222
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,400
Can you stop mocking us?

1223
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,440
Ready

1224
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,760
Okay, let's go

1225
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,480
Black Orange Pink

1226
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,240
Black Purple Pink Orange White Red

1227
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,080
Blue Black Purple

1228
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,000
Green Pink Blue White Orange, I'm ready

1229
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,240
Pink Blue Green, Orange Black Purple Pink Blue Green

1230
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,080
Pink Blue Green

1231
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,640
I'll definitely pass this round

1232
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,280
I don't think I passed yet

1233
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,360
Don't give up, Old Bai, give me another chance

1234
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,040
Sorry

1235
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,760
I'm an "idiot", I don't think I...

1236
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,320
I got hit on the back of my head

1237
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,800
I think I lost my memory

1238
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
Come on

1239
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,560
Get ready, friends

1240
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,080
Four five

1241
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,880
Purple Green White

1242
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,560
Black Orange Pink Purple White

1243
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,920
Orange Green Purple, Yellow Green Purple Orange Pink White

1244
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,200
Ready?

1245
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,040
Damn it, I didn't remember again

1246
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,840
You're not ready yet

1247
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,680
Little Killer, if you keep playing like this...

1248
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,680
Sorry

1249
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,600
I think it's because I'm too close

1250
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,920
Maybe we should switch

1251
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,360
Switch what?

1252
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,000
You press it, you do it

1253
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,160
Aren't you good at this? You press it

1254
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,800
I'll press it, but I'm so far away

1255
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,280
Doesn't matter, just watch your numbers

1256
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,480
Just keep watching your numbers

1257
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,840
Right

1258
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,800
I'll watch my numbers

1259
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,040
Right

1260
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,840
Right, same thing

1261
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,920
Blue Orange Black Green White Purple Orange Red Pink

1262
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,600
Is it good now?

1263
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,240
No.

1264
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,160
Brother, what are you doing?

1265
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,600
I give up.

1266
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,920
What are you doing?

1267
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,160
Why can't I remember?

1268
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,960
Alright, he's the killer.

1269
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,440
Just because I'm slow doesn't mean...

1270
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,080
He's messing with our minds, you know?

1271
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,120
I just know it's definitely him.

1272
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,440
Sorry.

1273
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,200
Don't put so much pressure on me, okay?

1274
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,000
I got hit in the back of my head.

1275
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,000
Come on.

1276
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,200
Last try.

1277
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,280
Let's go.

1278
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,600
Yellow, green, pink

1279
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Pink, yellow, orange

1280
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,760
Pink, green, then orange

1281
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,280
Green, white, purple, pink, orange, black

1282
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,080
Pink, orange, black

1283
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,480
Good

1284
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,040
Done

1285
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,840
Okay

1286
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,200
Brother, are you done?

1287
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,920
Success

1288
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,400
Brother, don't worry.

1289
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,680
Just follow your own plan.

1290
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,760
Rolling it back in reverse

1291
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,520
I know how to collect it

1292
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,400
Don't worry

1293
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,400
Goodbye

1294
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,680
Little He

1295
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,800
Can't you take them one by one to arrange?

1296
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,680
You're way too lazy, buddy

1297
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,480
I'm telling you, he's definitely doing it on purpose

1298
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,440
He's being way too deliberate

1299
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,280
This game is all about messing with your mind

1300
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,760
I'm so tired

1301
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,400
Come

1302
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,520
Come on

1303
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,400
Wake up

1304
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,920
Purple, black, blue

1305
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,040
Orange, black, red

1306
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,840
White, orange, yellow

1307
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,160
Blue, white, purple, black—good

1308
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,840
Done

1309
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,280
Green, pink, red—okay

1310
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,280
Okay

1311
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,480
Watch out

1312
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,280
Move aside

1313
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,240
Be careful

1314
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,480
Stop moving it

1315
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,760
Time to witness the miracle

1316
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,400
Light it up

1317
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,720
Alright

1318
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,160
All set

1319
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,960
No way

1320
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,320
Alright

1321
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,720
I feel almost exhausted by our own foolishness

1322
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,400
Congratulations on completing your mission

1323
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,680
I still have my own matters to attend to

1324
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,840
I'll take my leave now

1325
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,960
Leaving so soon?

1326
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,920
Don't forget, *The Secret of Tui Town* is crucial

1327
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,640
*The Secret of Tui Town* is important

1328
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,200
Bye

1329
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,560
Oh my

1330
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,080
Food paradise

1331
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,840
Then I won't hold back

1332
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,800
But I can't eat desserts or fruits

1333
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,720
I can eat

1334
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,280
What? Hand

1335
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,040
[Unintelligible phrase]

1336
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,640
Missing one "出," right?

1337
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,560
"出" is gone

1338
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,840
Wait, let's check this

1339
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,520
Ingredients

1340
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,720
It's here

1341
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,040
Sent for repairs

1342
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,400
The left shoulder joint can be fitted with compatible fingertips

1343
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,640
for accessory detachment.

1344
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,560
The shoulder can also connect with other robotic arm fingertips

1345
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,400
via compatible accessories.

1346
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,760
However, both detachment and connection require

1347
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,000
matching models and components.

1348
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,840
The torso frame is constructed using

1349
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,360
a new Y-element enriched material.

1350
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,080
Torso.

1351
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,800
Eyes can capture photos and videos.

1352
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,680
The torso frame contains

1353
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,360
Yes, the torso contains Y-element.

1354
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,280
I believe this arm's

1355
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,760
primary function is to

1356
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,160
reach that robot.

1357
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,800
As for the Y-element in the arm,

1358
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,040
it must be related to the missing arm.

1359
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,640
The Y-element was definitely used to kill

1360
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,360
the one that got exploded.

1361
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:20,720
Right.

1362
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,000
We have the debris at the scene, don't we?

1363
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,680
So you're saying that

1364
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,600
it means it's already been used?

1365
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,320
Correct.

1366
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,520
So the one sent for repair is the used one?

1367
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,320
Which one?

1368
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,880
The "output" one, this Xiao Ding's.

1369
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,080
Not the fingertip,

1370
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,960
but this skeletal part here.

1371
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,520
So when he says "sent for repair,"

1372
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,960
what does that mean?

1373
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,400
"Sent for repair" means it was broken.

1374
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,280
This "output" belongs to classmate Xiao Ding, right?

1375
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,080
"Output" is Xiao Ding's.

1376
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,640
What does this mean?

1377
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,760
Right, the robot's component list.

1378
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,720
I'm one-fifteenth.

1379
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,040
Component list? How hungry are you?

1380
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,640
Ingredients.

1381
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,440
Main ingredients include cream and eggs.

1382
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,080
These numbers should be related to their direction

1383
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,960
right?

1384
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,600
He specifically set this up

1385
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,560
to make us calculate here

1386
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,080
We definitely need to calculate

1387
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,480
Come on, your turn

1388
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,280
Where are the numbers?

1389
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:16,960
Here

1390
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,200
I think there's a logic

1391
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,760
There must be some reasoning behind this

1392
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,160
Let's stick this here for now, okay?

1393
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,040
Math genius

1394
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,520
Last time it was you who solved the quadratic equation, right?

1395
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,360
You solved it, didn't you?

1396
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,600
Solve

1397
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,080
Give me eight numbers and I can solve something

1398
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,720
Right, we have pens

1399
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,360
So you need to figure it out

1400
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,520
The question is what needs to be solved

1401
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,600
No direction

1402
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,480
First these four

1403
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,720
We don't know who they correspond to, right?

1404
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,760
Stroke count

1405
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,840
"Chu" belongs to Xiao Ding, right?

1406
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,440
Right

1407
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,960
"Chu" is Xiao Ding's

1408
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,240
Five-five up and down

1409
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,000
"Chu" has up and down components

1410
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,760
Let's deduce why five-five is "Chu"

1411
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,800
Why is five-five "Chu", is that it?

1412
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,920
Five-five because it's split fifty-fifty up and down

1413
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,720
I think so too

1414
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,200
One two three

1415
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,160
The stroke count doesn't match either

1416
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,600
Everyone repeated it at least once

1417
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,680
Why is "55" pronounced as "chu"

1418
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,600
But you keep making

1419
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,880
that sound

1420
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,800
I'm getting a bit hungry to be honest

1421
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,400
If you're hungry then eat

1422
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,920
This is exactly for you to eat

1423
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,840
Oh you little X

1424
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,760
This thing

1425
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,400
Turn this thing upside down

1426
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,880
There must be some reason for it.

1427
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,880
Yes, and it's placed horizontally like this.

1428
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,040
Plus, it's in Chinese characters.

1429
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,880
Let's just calculate it this way

1430
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,360
Then it would mean

1431
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,360
Moreover, its similarity ratio

1432
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,880
Does five equal "mountain"?

1433
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,160
I don't know

1434
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,880
Five equals "mountain"

1435
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,920
The opposite way, right?

1436
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,880
That's not correct either

1437
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,400
Yes, it's Y-head kill

1438
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,720
S what?

1439
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,560
What kind of operation is this?

1440
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,400
Just rotate it

1441
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,640
Yes, this is three

1442
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,280
This isn't that eye chart, is it?

1443
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,680
What is this thing?

1444
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,520
This isn't that eye chart, right?

1445
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,200
E

1446
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,720
It really is an eye chart

1447
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,040
ABCDE, correct?

1448
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,520
ABCDE

1449
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,480
Which means five

1450
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,280
I'm speechless

1451
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,160
It's about its alphabetical position

1452
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,880
Which position out of 26?

1453
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,760
Wow, this is so abstract

1454
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,960
Fifteen is O

1455
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,240
Fifteen is O

1456
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,040
Combine then?

1457
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,720
A and O then

1458
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,080
One fifteenth equals

1459
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,760
Okay, combine is my arm

1460
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,000
Eleven is K

1461
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,760
"Heaven"

1462
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,920
Turn "heaven" sideways

1463
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,840
Dilraba is "heaven"

1464
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:03,800
Little Gold is

1465
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,680
I and J

1466
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,920
Ding

1467
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,960
That's correct

1468
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,920
Then He is fifteen and

1469
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,760
Fifteen is O

1470
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,000
"Only"

1471
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,640
So let's look at the length

1472
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,160
I think the length is

1473
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:21,720
Take it down

1474
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,800
"Ding's" length

1475
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,640
Everyone take your own

1476
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,160
Jin, yours

1477
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,000
Here, you write it for me first

1478
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,880
60 to 80 centimeters

1479
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,240
60-80cm

1480
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,000
Is this "Tian"?

1481
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,040
Who is "Tian"?

1482
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,240
What's "Tian's" measurement?

1483
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,160
80 to 120

1484
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,440
You're "He", right?

1485
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:46,840
Yes, I'm "He"

1486
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,880
80 to 110

1487
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,000
90 to 115

1488
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,360
So what?

1489
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,440
What about this then?

1490
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,960
Mine's the shortest, I got eliminated.

1491
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,960
Why?

1492
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,360
Actually, longer is better.

1493
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,000
Not necessarily.

1494
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Is longer really better?

1495
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,480
Yeah.

1496
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,720
Long ones don't have to be held.

1497
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,800
But short ones are most likely to be eliminated.

1498
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,080
Right.

1499
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,880
Let's see.

1500
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,120
Any other evidence?

1501
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,240
What matches?

1502
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,040
There's a human body design diagram.

1503
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,920
Shoulder and other mechanical arm fingertips.

1504
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,360
Can also be connected via accessories.

1505
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,440
But both disassembly and connection require...

1506
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,680
Matching accessories of the corresponding model.

1507
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,920
So these arms can be connected together.

1508
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,760
The arms can be connected, right?

1509
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,440
Yes.

1510
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:40,960
Here we have...

1511
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,120
Accessory No. 2.

1512
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,640
Accessory No. 1.

1513
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,800
The fingertip says Accessory No. 1, I'm No. 1.

1514
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,520
Let's try connecting them.

1515
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,520
This is No. 1.

1516
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,920
Connect No. 1 with No. 1?

1517
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,040
I'm No. 2.

1518
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,920
Do we just twist it like this?

1519
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,560
You can twist it.

1520
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,240
Okay.

1521
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,880
Just match them up.

1522
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,840
Here's No. 2.

1523
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,760
No. 2 can connect to mine.

1524
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,360
This No. 2 can also connect.

1525
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,520
Then three arms will suffice.

1526
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,600
You can't eliminate it.

1527
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,400
Right, it's between the two of us.

1528
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,280
What is it?

1529
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,880
What's this?

1530
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,560
What number is this?

1531
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,240
This is number three.

1532
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,280
Number three.

1533
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,760
What number is this?

1534
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,440
This is number one.

1535
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,720
This is number one. What number is this?

1536
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,440
Number three.

1537
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,640
This can connect to this too.

1538
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,880
They can definitely all be pieced together.

1539
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,760
Let me see.

1540
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,000
Is there any other evidence?

1541
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,800
The drawer.

1542
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,160
Got this

1543
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,640
Use a ruler to measure it

1544
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,480
Size

1545
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,880
Wait a moment

1546
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,200
There are also three task completion reminders

1547
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,560
Which is June 10th

1548
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,480
Complete two new assistant robots

1549
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,720
Build the bodies of Xiao Bai and Xiao Ke

1550
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,960
Clear all new materials

1551
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,880
Begin debugging phase

1552
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,640
The 10th

1553
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,760
Just the bodies, right?

1554
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,760
Only the bodies

1555
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,320
Complete two new assistants by the 20th

1556
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,080
Xiao Bai enters debugging and goes into service

1557
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,520
Yes, and June 20th is the daily check

1558
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,520
Check if the cleaning robot's water tank has water

1559
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,240
The one you couldn't see at the time

1560
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,640
That's the memo content, right?

1561
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,360
We were already completed on the 10th

1562
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,880
And we were completed again on the 20th

1563
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,440
Both items are the same

1564
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,000
These two both say

1565
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,800
Details unavailable

1566
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,440
Meaning there's more to it

1567
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,880
We can't see it now

1568
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,600
This is that...

1569
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,240
The clue you missed back then

1570
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,520
Appears here, right?

1571
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,280
There's one more

1572
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,120
Dear Push AI customer

1573
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,360
Your purchased inorganic cleaning solution

1574
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,240
Organic cleaner

1575
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,960
Has been delivered today as scheduled

1576
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,080
What date is today?

1577
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,840
June 20th at 2 PM

1578
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,640
The day he died

1579
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,040
And there's also a medical record

1580
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,840
Push AI, male

1581
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,400
Diagnosed with rare red-blue color blindness

1582
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,720
Red or blue appears to the patient

1583
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,280
As indistinguishable shades of gray

1584
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,240
No cure available

1585
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,240
We knew he was colorblind

1586
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,760
But not that it was red-blue

1587
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,640
Wait

1588
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,960
Red-blue colorblind

1589
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,240
That tube... you're actually Push AI

1590
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,400
No way.

1591
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,040
Because he only said he's colorblind.

1592
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,440
But here it says...

1593
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,160
rare red-blue colorblindness.

1594
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,960
Right, that's different.

1595
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,480
Yes, he must be trying to confuse us.

1596
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,280
He added that himself.

1597
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,000
How come I'm being blamed again when I didn't say anything?

1598
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,120
Now it's all my fault.

1599
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,400
First point: the deceased was definitely pushed by AI.

1600
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,360
Second: he had red-blue colorblindness.

1601
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,720
He really couldn't see the detergent clearly.

1602
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,240
These are the clues the pictures give us.

1603
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,400
Should we record this data?

1604
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,240
Then measure it.

1605
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,800
Let's go.

1606
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,800
The door is here, right?

1607
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,880
Let's start measuring from here.

1608
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,320
Close the door.

1609
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,480
Close the door.

1610
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,960
Close the door and measure.

1611
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,640
Assuming this is the hand.

1612
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,960
It's here, right? How much?

1613
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,560
340.

1614
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,840
Then it must be three arms.

1615
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,520
His own.

1616
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,320
Plus his own arm.

1617
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,560
Right, he holds it like this.

1618
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,040
Correct.

1619
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,920
So logically he must have added two.

1620
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,760
Let's go back and calculate.

1621
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,200
Seems this data is quite important.

1622
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,760
So let's look at this.

1623
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,000
Model number.

1624
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,680
Exhibition hall special.

1625
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,040
This is the detergent tank, right?

1626
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,880
This is the cleaner.

1627
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,080
That's unrelated.

1628
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,320
The tank is empty.

1629
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,200
So he must have swapped what's inside.

1630
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,400
Swapped the tanks.

1631
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,280
The red one, right?

1632
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,200
That makes sense.

1633
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,000
What you're saying makes perfect sense.

1634
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,000
Swapped by hand?

1635
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,400
Mechanical arm.

1636
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,240
Mechanical arm.

1637
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,880
Right, after all it's a mechanical arm.

1638
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,160
Very flexible.

1639
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,440
Exactly.

1640
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,880
The culprit is too skilled.

1641
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,040
Let's go calculate the data.

1642
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:43,560
Come on, let's sort out this 340 thing first.

1643
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,920
Come on, let's sort out this 340 thing first.

1644
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,400
Come on.

1645
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,040
Just say how many up and down.

1646
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,960
Then see if up and down can connect.

1647
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,040
One up, two down.

1648
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,640
Sky is up

1649
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
Two up, one down

1650
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,200
Right, two up one down

1651
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,160
What about this gold?

1652
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,080
Two up, three down

1653
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,960
Okay, what about He?

1654
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,240
Three up, one down

1655
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,360
So gold can only connect to He

1656
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,680
Then gold must connect with Ning

1657
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,600
Let's calculate using the longest path then

1658
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,280
Right

1659
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,120
80 plus 115 equals 195

1660
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,960
One can only connect to me

1661
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,520
195 plus 110 equals what?

1662
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,320
305

1663
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,840
That's still not enough, right?

1664
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,240
Right

1665
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,320
Then we need to add this

1666
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,600
Connect two to Ba

1667
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:29,880
Correct

1668
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,880
305 plus

1669
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,960
adding 120 would definitely be enough

1670
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,800
Is that the logic?

1671
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,920
Right, how do you calculate that these four together would be enough?

1672
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,880
No problem, let's first

1673
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,400
Let's arrange them first

1674
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,600
You calculate based on this first

1675
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,280
First assume Ba is

1676
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,320
So if Ba is the killer

1677
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,680
She would connect to me first, right?

1678
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,480
Can only connect to you

1679
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:45,720
Then connect to me

1680
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,840
And then connect to you again

1681
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,040
Right

1682
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,880
And then connect to him, right?

1683
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,480
Ba could do this

1684
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,000
You can

1685
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,360
You can't rule it out, dear

1686
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,640
Then it must be He

1687
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,560
He plus Ba plus Ning

1688
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,240
These three directly make sense, right?

1689
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:58,720
Right

1690
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,160
He's enough

1691
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,760
He's enough, exactly enough

1692
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,040
Can't rule out He

1693
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,640
If I were the killer

1694
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,120
Double connect Jin

1695
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,280
Jin can connect to He

1696
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,080
Okay

1697
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,560
190 plus 115

1698
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,520
Not enough, not enough

1699
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,960
Not enough

1700
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,080
You ruled it out

1701
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,200
I ruled it out

1702
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,640
So this person isn't the killer, right?

1703
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,600
They're innocent.

1704
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,920
Innocent.

1705
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,600
So he ruled himself out.

1706
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,240
You've been excluded.

1707
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,000
Are you really upset?

1708
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,040
You're clearly upset.

1709
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,320
You've been staring at me forever.

1710
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,400
I wasn't staring at you.

1711
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,560
Xiao Ba, I suspected you from the start.

1712
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,400
No.

1713
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,920
Ba-ba.

1714
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,440
It's really not me.

1715
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,080
Let's fight it out.

1716
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,360
Fight it out.

1717
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,320
I think he's the more likely suspect.

1718
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,720
Because...

1719
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,120
It's about that colorblindness issue.

1720
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,800
Xiao Guan, male, 38 years old.

1721
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,000
Suffers from colorblindness.

1722
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,360
Xiao Guan is him.

1723
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,560
Let me tell you...

1724
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,040
From my perspective, his colorblindness is confirmed.

1725
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,360
Yes, it's confirmed.

1726
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,400
I'm definitely not colorblind.

1727
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,240
He's not colorblind.

1728
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,520
I can tell you this definitively.

1729
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,040
Why?

1730
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,200
Because Xiao Guan was colorblind.

1731
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,840
Xiao Guan is already dead.

1732
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,360
He's Xiao He's classmate.

1733
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,200
But his mind is Xiao Guan's.

1734
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,360
I understand.

1735
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
Consciousness transfer, right?

1736
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:22,920
Right.

1737
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,560
He transformed from human to robot.

1738
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,200
I know.

1739
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,320
It's the consciousness that transferred.

1740
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,120
Maybe he's not actually a robot.

1741
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,000
He might just be pushing AI.

1742
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,680
The one who died was Xiao Guan.

1743
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,560
Xiao Guan.

1744
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,240
I pushed AI, the one who died was Xiao Guan.

1745
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,200
Why would pushing AI kill Xiao Guan?

1746
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,640
Right, why?

1747
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,240
He already killed Xiao Guan.

1748
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,320
Then next...

1749
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,400
It's your turn.

1750
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,560
That's impossible, you believe...

1751
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,680
The one who died must be the one who pushed AI.

1752
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,560
No, I think what you're saying makes sense.

1753
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,280
You're too obvious

1754
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,080
No

1755
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,880
Then you shouldn't have mentioned his color blindness

1756
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,680
Because you're colorblind

1757
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,920
You can't distinguish between red and blue here

1758
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,320
So you couldn't have changed that water

1759
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,120
Exactly

1760
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,120
You don't have the ability

1761
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:10,560
Do you understand?

1762
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,440
Fine, I'm colorblind

1763
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,240
I can't tell the difference

1764
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,640
I thought you only had rhinitis?

1765
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,960
Actually, we missed one detail earlier

1766
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,360
As Xiao Ba mentioned

1767
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,560
June 20th is the anniversary

1768
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,040
Right

1769
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,520
I went to AI's office

1770
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,080
To conduct a small investigation

1771
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,600
Then I noticed

1772
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,880
A locked cabinet

1773
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,840
Earlier, when I saw

1774
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,440
The cabinet with the girl's photo

1775
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,360
I immediately connected it to her time of death

1776
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,160
June 20, 2047

1777
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,920
Then the password worked

1778
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,160
Who would commit murder

1779
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,960
On such an important anniversary?

1780
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,440
First anniversary

1781
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,400
Right

1782
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,080
Could it be Dilraba?

1783
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,480
Because that person told the AI

1784
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,320
"The Dilraba robot has been sent to you"

1785
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,600
"You should take revenge" and so on

1786
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,320
Their information is in the files

1787
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,200
"You must in your secret room"

1788
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,680
"severely punish them"

1789
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,960
When I saw that document

1790
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,920
I heard someone's voice outside

1791
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,280
He said "How's that robot I gave you before"

1792
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,120
"Is that Dilraba working well?"

1793
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,600
"Was your revenge successful?"

1794
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,200
Because he actually wants revenge on all four of us

1795
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,600
Yes, that's exactly it

1796
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,800
If you want to make a murder

1797
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,920
feel very ceremonial

1798
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,320
it must be revenge killing

1799
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,000
So you mean

1800
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,680
you suspect Dilraba?

1801
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,040
I don't

1802
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,560
I'm just analyzing the motive

1803
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,640
I didn't say who I suspect

1804
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,800
He only specifically mentioned you

1805
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,680
Right, and I even revealed this information

1806
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,040
Let's analyze our motives

1807
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:35,840
You want to

1808
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,960
I want to perform that person's surgery

1809
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,040
She wants to become human

1810
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:38,760
Right, you want to be human

1811
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,640
So you're leaving, basically

1812
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,040
Yes, you're escaping while I need to do the surgery

1813
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,600
I need to escape, she's

1814
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,360
I killed that Xiao Ai

1815
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,760
Which means I betrayed my mission

1816
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,040
So I think it was Xiao Ai

1817
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,920
Who tampered with me

1818
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,560
This is vengeance killing, meaning you're seeking revenge

1819
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,480
He wants revenge

1820
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,520
To avenge my master

1821
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,200
I must kill Xiao Ai

1822
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,240
So now we're discussing who has stronger motives.

1823
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,520
Whose motive is more plausible.

1824
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,000
If you're going to talk like this,

1825
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,160
Every time I play, we just talk about motives.

1826
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,480
Who has the strongest motive.

1827
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,760
And we're always wrong.

1828
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,960
I'm really fed up.

1829
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,280
You could help us eliminate someone, you know.

1830
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,200
Let's eliminate you.

1831
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,720
You're the X, you eliminate someone first.

1832
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,760
What's going on?

1833
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,680
I feel like it.

1834
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,400
See?

1835
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,640
You never eliminate someone right away.

1836
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,640
Let me tell you,

1837
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,760
Is this still considered eliminating someone right away?

1838
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,400
No, we just started discussing.

1839
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,520
At the very beginning,

1840
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,640
you were eliminating someone, bro.

1841
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,200
Fine.

1842
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,880
You're trying to pin it on me, bro.

1843
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,240
You're playing well this round.

1844
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,400
What's wrong today?

1845
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,800
Everyone's getting on each other's nerves.

1846
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,840
Who do you think Dilraba would choose as X?

1847
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,800
I don't know.

1848
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,480
Wouldn't she choose you?

1849
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,200
She might choose me.

1850
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,440
She might choose you.

1851
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,040
Right.

1852
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,360
Aren't you not X?

1853
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,040
Why would she possibly choose you?

1854
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,160
That's why I said she might choose me.

1855
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,640
If you were the killer,

1856
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,320
who would you choose as X?

1857
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,000
The two of them?

1858
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,480
Hmm.

1859
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,280
Why should I make this choice?

1860
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,760
Who would you choose? I'm listening.

1861
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:11,880
I choose him

1862
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,480
Who do you choose?

1863
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,520
I choose him

1864
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,040
What’s this? No one picks me?

1865
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:21,600
Okay

1866
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,240
She chose you

1867
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:24,760
I choose you

1868
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,480
So you’re picking me?

1869
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:25,920
I choose you

1870
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,120
Alright

1871
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,320
This round, I’ve got your back

1872
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,480
You’re fine

1873
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,560
Who do you think the killer is?

1874
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,720
I think the killer...

1875
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,080
I know what you're going to say about me

1876
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,960
Fine, then who do you think the killer is?

1877
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,760
He and I

1878
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,960
Then I think I'm the opposite of him

1879
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,000
I believe she and I are not suspects

1880
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,040
So he is Xiao Ba's X

1881
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,280
Their motives are definitely stronger.

1882
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,360
Killing doesn't even require paying with one's life.

1883
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:01,720
Why?

1884
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,680
As a pregnant woman, I wouldn't have to pay with my life.

1885
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,160
No, look—

1886
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,320
First, you learned about

1887
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,640
the possibility of consciousness transfer.

1888
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,400
I didn’t know about consciousness transfer.

1889
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,160
How could you not know?

1890
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,360
I only knew about the human transformation surgery.

1891
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,520
The one who went to hell to become human

1892
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,000
Isn't that you?

1893
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,520
It was me who wanted to kill the AI

1894
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,120
To undergo the surgery to become human

1895
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,920
I'd rather become someone who has killed

1896
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,160
Than remain a robot humiliated every day

1897
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,880
You want to become human, right?

1898
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,520
Yes

1899
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,800
Then from this perspective

1900
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,760
What logic can we deduce about her?

1901
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,080
Because she wants to become human

1902
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,240
But she doesn't know

1903
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,640
Our bodies have already been destroyed

1904
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,120
Right?

1905
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:37,960
She doesn't know this

1906
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,600
But she doesn't even know this

1907
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,920
But from the motive for murder

1908
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,000
I just killed him

1909
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,560
To get that surgery

1910
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,960
I didn't even know about pushing AI or anything

1911
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,480
None of that

1912
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,400
Right

1913
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,640
I believe you

1914
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,120
But you still can't clear your suspicion of being X

1915
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,160
I am X

1916
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,480
He actually had two motives.

1917
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,240
His first motive was

1918
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,640
that on June 11th he discovered

1919
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,880
the entire killing exhibition was designed to torture them.

1920
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,240
Then I realized

1921
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,840
that our so-called exhibition hall

1922
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,480
wasn't a proper exhibition at all,

1923
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,000
but rather a killing robot exhibition

1924
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,640
where the audience came in

1925
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,840
to abuse us killing robots

1926
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,760
to vent their anger.

1927
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,480
So he knew this AI was retaliating against him,

1928
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,320
and he wanted revenge on the AI.

1929
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,160
This was his first motive.

1930
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:24,960
His second motive

1931
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,360
was something he discovered on June 12th -

1932
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,360
that only by the AI's death

1933
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,680
could this imprisonment be lifted.

1934
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,200
So he had dual motives

1935
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,120
to escape this suffering.

1936
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,680
That must be him.

1937
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,520
So how did you eliminate Dilraba?

1938
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,680
Since we were just discussing motives,

1939
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,880
hers was the weakest among the three of you.

1940
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,080
Was that motive really weak?

1941
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,600
Unlike yours, which were self-serving,

1942
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,320
No, I think avenging her master

1943
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,320
would be a more fitting motive.

1944
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,360
The anniversary...

1945
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,280
including his explosive death.

1946
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,240
Yes, and the master died on June 20th.

1947
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:56,640
Correct.

1948
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,400
To avenge the master.

1949
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,000
She believes Tui AI killed the master.

1950
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,120
On that day, June 20th.

1951
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,160
Because she was at Tui AI's...

1952
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,400
If she had been to that place...

1953
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,000
She might not have been there.

1954
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,560
But she might have only reached the prison.

1955
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,600
Without opening that secret box.

1956
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,320
If you put it that way...

1957
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,160
I'd think you're favoring Ba too much.

1958
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,920
Your bias as her X is too obvious.

1959
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,400
That's possible.

1960
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,400
Meaning the killer...

1961
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,600
Entered my space...

1962
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,280
But didn't open it.

1963
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,560
That wall we saw...

1964
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,520
That wall was too complex.

1965
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,120
She wouldn't know...

1966
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,880
The relationship between Tui AI and Tui Ai.

1967
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,320
I know.

1968
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,600
Because that wall requires a USB drive to open.

1969
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,680
And the USB has always been with me.

1970
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,720
So she likely believes...

1971
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,960
Tui AI killed her former master on June 20th.

1972
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,760
So your logic is...

1973
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,440
That this killer...

1974
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,160
Didn't know Tui Ai was Tui AI's sister.

1975
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,160
Right... no.

1976
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,040
My logic is why you can eliminate her...

1977
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,640
She can't be eliminated.

1978
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,200
No.

1979
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,160
Haven't eliminated her.

1980
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:44,680
Not eliminated.

1981
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,480
Are you eliminating her?

1982
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,640
I didn't, we were just...

1983
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,560
He thinks the killer is me and He.

1984
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,920
He thinks her motive is the weakest.

1985
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,120
Right.

1986
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,560
We're discussing motives.

1987
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,160
Is there a problem with that?

1988
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,560
No problem.

1989
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,680
Now you think the three of us are equal again.

1990
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,600
Now it's equality again.

1991
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,120
Let me tell you

1992
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,680
There's a good chance neither of us is X today

1993
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,800
Why do you say that?

1994
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,240
I don't think so

1995
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,560
I don't think so either

1996
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,520
If anyone's X, it's definitely him

1997
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,760
Or maybe there's no X at all

1998
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,040
Why does there need to be an X?

1999
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,160
Because I know I'm not X

2000
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,480
Well I know I'm not either

2001
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,840
Then let's just wait and see

2002
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,520
I don't quite believe you

2003
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,280
You don't have to believe me

2004
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,480
I'm not forcing you to

2005
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:20,800
Fine

2006
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,000
Let's see which of them turns out to be X

2007
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,680
This is getting interesting

2008
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,800
Fascinating

2009
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,200
Let me be fair

2010
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:28,760
If I had to choose

2011
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,840
I'd definitely pick one of you two

2012
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,760
Between the two of us?

2013
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,960
Why would you choose between us two?

2014
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,960
Why do you trust her?

2015
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,800
She's my sister

2016
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,680
That doesn't matter

2017
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,640
Right, what I meant was

2018
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,760
Is it just a feeling or is there proof?

2019
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,320
Just a feeling

2020
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,040
Don't you see you're the obvious suspect?

2021
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,160
When have I not been like this?

2022
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,880
His status is the lowest and most humble.

2023
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,920
Meaning you're the culprit.

2024
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,760
And you're not defending yourself, right?

2025
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,680
Why accuse me?

2026
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,880
I have to ask this.

2027
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,800
You're suspicious—all three of us are.

2028
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,320
Let me say one thing.

2029
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,880
Yes, everyone's a suspect.

2030
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,280
If you suspect her, what's your evidence?

2031
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,560
None, I'm starting with you.

2032
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,000
I'm accusing you.

2033
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,560
Accusing me?

2034
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,280
Because his...

2035
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,080
My understanding is...

2036
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,800
His goal was to escape.

2037
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,760
And in that room...

2038
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,600
The culprit must have...

2039
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,640
Left a note for this person.

2040
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,200
After 8 PM on June 20, 1948...

2041
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,040
The chamber door will open.

2042
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,280
You can seize the chance to escape.

2043
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,080
Who would know we'd...

2044
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,440
Open this door today?

2045
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,800
There must be someone who knows

2046
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,760
what will happen today.

2047
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,400
Meaning there's a time traveler

2048
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,000
or someone who can predict us.

2049
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,400
Isn't it the killer?

2050
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,720
The unfamiliar girl

2051
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,880
Can we give her a name?

2052
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,160
Beiju.

2053
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,600
She is Beiju.

2054
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,840
She's not Beiju.

2055
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,080
Beiju is the one who ran away.

2056
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,280
It was a note left by the mysterious woman.

2057
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,840
Probably not.

2058
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,200
Not left by the killer.

2059
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,160
To confuse.

2060
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,640
Who said it was left by the killer?

2061
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,440
I did.

2062
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,280
Alright, so it's the mysterious person then.

2063
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,520
That would be the three of us.

2064
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,840
Here's the deal - tell us who you'll vote for later.

2065
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,840
We'll follow your vote.

2066
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,200
Right, you decide the final person.

2067
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,280
You decide, that's the detective's role.

2068
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,760
But what if I vote wrong?

2069
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,600
Just go with your gut, it's fine.

2070
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,520
Exactly, we'll accept it.

2071
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,240
We'll accept it.

2072
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,560
Winning or losing this round doesn't matter.

2073
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,600
Because we're all being fair.

2074
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,560
Vote for someone.

2075
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,840
Now choose one out of three.

2076
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,080
You're putting a lot of pressure on me.

2077
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,240
We'll definitely follow your vote.

2078
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,080
Just name someone.

2079
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,960
You have to name someone.

2080
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:21,520
Who are you voting for?

2081
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,880
Notice how every time we ask him,

2082
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,640
he can never answer.

2083
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,080
And always ends up talking about others.

2084
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,680
Just as I thought - it's you.

2085
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,680
Just as you thought - it's me.

2086
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,520
Why is it "just as you thought" it's me?

2087
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,680
They just made eye contact.

2088
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,080
You have to name someone.

2089
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,560
Who are you voting for?

2090
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,920
No.

2091
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,680
What?

2092
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,720
No.

2093
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,520
They were just like this.

2094
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,480
He was like this.

2095
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,280
You had a great collaboration last round, huh?

2096
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:48,760
No.

2097
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,000
Can't two guys just have a brotherly bond?

2098
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,160
It's completely normal.

2099
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,000
Fine.

2100
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,080
Okay.

2101
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,240
No, say a name.

2102
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,280
If you dare say "Little He",

2103
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:58,920
I'll follow.

2104
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,640
Just say it.

2105
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,680
Pick me

2106
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,600
Your acting is so good

2107
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,960
What do you mean my acting is good?

2108
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,880
I'm the killer

2109
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,480
What are you?

2110
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,080
I'm the killer

2111
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,760
Say that again

2112
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,840
I'm the killer

2113
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,160
Then I'll vote for you

2114
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,720
Vote for me

2115
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,080
Are you the killer?

2116
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:22,960
I'm not.

2117
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,480
Xiao Ba, are you the killer?

2118
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,360
No.

2119
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,440
Fine, you're the only one who admitted it.

2120
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,200
If you're the killer,

2121
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,760
your acting has really improved.

2122
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,720
My acting isn't that good.

2123
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,120
So you'd rather not even act, huh?

2124
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,400
Then I'll cast my vote.

2125
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,120
Go ahead.

2126
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,440
Good people, choose between He and Ba.

2127
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,880
I'm voting for her.

2128
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,520
I might vote for He.

2129
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,640
But I haven't decided yet.

2130
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,360
I'm voting for you.

2131
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,400
Fine.

2132
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,360
Wait, I really want to ask you something.

2133
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,520
Why did you keep accusing me

2134
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,840
from the very start today?

2135
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,400
So what if I accused you?

2136
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,960
Does that make me the killer?

2137
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,280
No.

2138
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,560
If you vote for me because of that,

2139
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,560
you're wasting your vote.

2140
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,240
Seriously.

2141
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,360
Right now, the most suspicious ones

2142
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,360
are those two.

2143
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,080
If we focus our votes on them,

2144
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,280
we might actually win.

2145
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,560
How long has it been since we last won?

2146
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,240
Sorry about this.

2147
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,000
Let's go.

2148
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,480
Vote.

2149
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:31,240
The person I voted for is Dilraba.

2150
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,760
June 20, 2047.

2151
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,200
her owner died.

2152
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:35,920
This information

2153
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,120
was actually only known to her.

2154
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:37,880
As a robot,

2155
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,680
I immediately connected

2156
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,840
her time of death

2157
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,480
June 20, 2047.

2158
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,640
Everyone thought

2159
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,720
that Xiao Ai

2160
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,080
died on October 19th.

2161
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,400
So why did I know

2162
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,640
it was June 20th?

2163
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,600
The time of death on the day of the incident

2164
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,360
was exactly the one-year anniversary of her owner's death.

2165
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,520
So I believe

2166
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,720
this must have been

2167
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,800
a ritualistic revenge killing.

2168
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,080
The process was between 6:30 and 7:00 PM,

2169
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,920
while we were all in hibernation mode,

2170
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,400
she came out alone,

2171
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,880
removed our arms,

2172
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,360
then used the arms

2173
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,320
to switch the water tanks

2174
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,840
between the exhibition hall and the research lab.

2175
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,160
This would cause

2176
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,800
the blue cleaning solution

2177
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,480
to combine with Y material and explode,

2178
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,880
killing

2179
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,640
Xiao Ai.

2180
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,360
Voted.

2181
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,280
Okay.

2182
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,160
The real culprit I suspect is classmate Xiao He.

2183
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,160
The first point is,

2184
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,200
every day when I open my eyes,

2185
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,520
he's already there behind the cell door

2186
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,560
trying to make me laugh.

2187
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,000
Every time at 7 PM

2188
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,520
when that cell door opens,

2189
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,840
he would perform antics

2190
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,160
through that cell door.

2191
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,520
This makes me feel that

2192
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,240
the timing difference with when we open our eyes

2193
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,040
is slightly unusual.

2194
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,280
And secondly,

2195
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,440
his color blindness

2196
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,240
also seems suspicious to me.

2197
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,000
Wait a moment

2198
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,560
It corresponds to us

2199
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,760
You also have color blindness

2200
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,440
He is also color blind

2201
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,160
Then I wonder if

2202
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,560
Color-blind people understand each other better

2203
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,600
I hope so

2204
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,040
I hope it's him

2205
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,000
Even if I lose, I still hope it's him

2206
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,640
Don't vote wrong, thank you

2207
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,200
Today, I want to consider the final suspect

2208
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,560
to be from our

2209
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,280
Choosing to eliminate this AI advocate

2210
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,520
is the most logical decision

2211
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,400
My prime suspect

2212
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,280
swapped the red and blue liquids inside the cleaning robot

2213
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,560
with each other

2214
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,480
Then at exactly 8:10

2215
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,680
it exploded

2216
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,280
That's all

2217
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,080
Who is the murderer today?

2218
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,200
Anyway, hit him on the back of the head.

2219
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,400
Okay.

2220
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:30,760
Alright?

2221
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,960
Let's each take one.

2222
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,880
Exactly four of them.

2223
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,760
Okay, no problem.

2224
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,120
All players have completed voting.

2225
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,560
Now announcing the real culprit of this case.

2226
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,600
Based on everyone's votes,

2227
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,640
there are two identified suspects.

2228
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:53,760
The two of us?

2229
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,400
No.

2230
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,440
I voted for Xiao Jin.

2231
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,040
They are:

2232
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,320
Dilraba and Xiao He

2233
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,360
How ridiculous

2234
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,600
There must be some mistake

2235
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,640
I voted for you

2236
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,080
Can you really trust his words?

2237
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,800
One student received five votes

2238
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,560
Five votes

2239
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,480
The culprit voted for someone else

2240
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,400
All the others voted for one person

2241
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,480
So there's no X today

2242
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,720
Right, so there's no X today

2243
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,080
So who received the most votes?

2244
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,040
The one with five votes is...

2245
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,600
She is Xiao Ba's classmate.

2246
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,320
I'm really speechless.

2247
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,120
The real culprit is Xiao Ba.

2248
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,880
Her motive was revenge.

2249
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,600
Using the arm,

2250
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,880
then replaced the cleaning robot,

2251
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,120
the water inside

2252
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,520
caused an explosion.

2253
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,000
My choice for the real culprit

2254
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,120
is classmate Xiao Ba.

2255
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,440
I voted my sister as the killer,

2256
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,560
classmate Xiao Ba.

2257
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,080
The killer chose June 20th

2258
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,560
to kill this AI promotion day.

2259
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,760
The only one who knew

2260
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,600
about this timing seems to be Xiao Ba.

2261
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,160
Her murder motive was

2262
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,040
to avenge her former master

2263
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,320
on this anniversary date.

2264
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,560
The only difference

2265
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,520
between her and us three is

2266
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,160
that she knew

2267
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,920
when the promotion death occurred

2268
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,160
was on June 20th.

2269
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,400
I think she's probably

2270
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,560
the most suspicious one.

2271
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,280
So the suspect identified in this case is

2272
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,160
Success

2273
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,760
Please

2274
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,520
Failure

2275
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,120
I'm really impressed

2276
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,440
by you

2277
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,280
Not me

2278
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,520
Xiao Jin

2279
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,480
It's you

2280
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,520
Not me

2281
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,640
The eliminated Xiao Ning

2282
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,760
No way

2283
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,040
Not me

2284
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:26,840
Oh no, it's him

2285
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,280
It can't be him

2286
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,800
Then we've met our Waterloo

2287
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,600
The real culprit in this case is

2288
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,000
Brother Ning

2289
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,280
The real culprit is

2290
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,240
Classmate Xiao He

2291
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,240
You acted so well

2292
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,480
I truly thank each one of you

2293
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,320
So is there really an X in this case?

2294
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,680
Please, Xiao He, step forward to your X.

2295
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,360
This...

2296
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,440
So tall...

2297
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,400
Stop looking down.

2298
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,640
Just look up already.

2299
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,680
You're truly tall...

2300
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,720
Not me.

2301
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,200
Alright.

2302
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,080
Brother Bai...

2303
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,280
You acted so well.

2304
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,160
Oh my god...

2305
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:29,920
Let me tell you...

2306
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,000
The only time I panicked today...

2307
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,880
was when...

2308
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,880
after you came out from choosing X.

2309
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,120
When you told me you were the "killer".

2310
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,400
I asked why.

2311
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,400
He said if I wasn't X...

2312
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,320
and the other person was X...

2313
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,840
who would fear him most?

2314
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,680
What does that mean?

2315
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,800
The "killer" must fear him.

2316
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,680
That statement was quite impactful.

2317
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,840
My heart skipped a beat then.

2318
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,560
Yes, I panicked a bit.

2319
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,640
Let me tell you...

2320
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,160
But Keqin never believed...

2321
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,840
he was X.

2322
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,400
Fooled by that old fox, huh?

2323
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,760
I trusted him too much.

2324
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,880
The contact person you wrote is correct

2325
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,800
He's been lying to me all along

2326
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,720
I lied to him, saying I was Xiao Ke

2327
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,200
I asked why you didn’t choose Brother Bai

2328
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,320
Stay away from me.

2329
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,160
What?

2330
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,920
Little X

2331
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,720
Stop pretending.

2332
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,200
Who are you targeting today?

2333
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,040
Let me hear it.

2334
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,200
I'm targeting X.

2335
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,320
You are X.

2336
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,160
You two

2337
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,120
The two of us could never be

2338
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,000
Never in this lifetime

2339
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,720
This lifetime

2340
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,440
Believe me

2341
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,080
As Xiao Ba said

2342
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,400
June 20th is the anniversary

2343
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,080
Right

2344
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:02,280
Correct

2345
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,680
Who would commit murder

2346
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,280
on such an important anniversary?

2347
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,920
It must be revenge killing

2348
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,840
Then how did you eliminate Ba?

2349
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,040
Her motive was the weakest among you three

2350
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,600
Is this motive weak?

2351
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,320
No, I think avenging her master

2352
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,200
would be a more fitting motive

2353
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,440
If he had been to this place

2354
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:20,800
She might not have been there

2355
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,880
She may not have visited this place

2356
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,600
If you think this way

2357
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,440
I'd say you're favoring Ba too much

2358
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,040
You being her X is too obvious

2359
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,640
Meaning you're the killer

2360
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,480
And you're not defending yourself, right?

2361
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,400
Why call me the killer?

2362
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,600
I have to ask this

2363
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,000
You're suspicious, all three of us are

2364
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,600
Yes, everyone's suspicious

2365
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,080
If you eliminated her, what's your evidence?

2366
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,280
If it's X, it must be him

2367
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,600
Because I know I'm not X

2368
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,920
And I know I'm not either

2369
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,120
Then let's wait and see

2370
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,080
See which of them is X

2371
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,760
Brilliant, just brilliant

2372
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,280
I was the only one who voted for him

2373
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,280
I'm speechless

2374
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,440
What's wrong with you all?

2375
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,760
No, he acted really well

2376
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,040
He opens his eyes precisely at 7pm

2377
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,440
And both his eyes are blurry

2378
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,920
Just like that boss

2379
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,800
Two people just like the boss

2380
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,040
Get to know him better

2381
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,560
The crucial evidence everyone missed was

2382
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,960
inside the ventilation duct of the hibernation pod

2383
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,760
there was a

2384
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,720
clue containing a robot's

2385
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,240
detailed parameter diagram

2386
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:19,600
I'll read

2387
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,240
You do it

2388
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,120
This document lists each of our

2389
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,680
shoulder component #1

2390
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,520
fingertip component #2

2391
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,000
retractable arm length

2392
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,360
He already knew all this information

2393
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,920
And this to-do list function

2394
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,080
directly points to the real killer

2395
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,400
As the butler robot

2396
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,520
I have a special function

2397
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,000
After pressing my navel for 5 seconds

2398
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,120
I can read the to-do lists

2399
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:43,920
This particular function

2400
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,680
is something none of you other robots have

2401
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,960
We didn't ask at the time

2402
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,480
what others' to-do lists contained

2403
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,360
Because only her list knew, right?

2404
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,760
Right, he was reading physical data

2405
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,520
Right, we didn't ask further

2406
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,120
Correct

2407
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,440
Additionally, the killer

2408
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,000
used their colorblind condition

2409
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,720
frequently complained about slow logistics

2410
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,960
Male, 38 years old, colorblind

2411
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,240
You're also colorblind

2412
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,760
Had previously observed and learned

2413
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,920
that the AI assistant had this same defect

2414
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,720
AI assistant, male gender

2415
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:16,040
diagnosed with rare red-blue colorblindness

2416
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,800
to execute his murder plan

2417
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,040
I think you were truly MVP this round

2418
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,560
You're the one who protected him, I'm telling you

2419
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,680
How did I protect him?

2420
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,520
You did

2421
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,400
How was it me?

2422
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,760
That passionate speech at the end

2423
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,560
I thought it was settled

2424
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,720
If you were the killer

2425
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,280
your acting has really improved

2426
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,240
My acting isn't that good.

2427
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,640
You'd rather not even act at all, huh?

2428
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,160
I suggest each of us three says one final line.

2429
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,480
You said if you were to...

2430
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,840
If you actually won Best Actor...

2431
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,480
I want to say that we young actors...

2432
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,760
Who dares claim they'll win Best Actor?

2433
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,000
He's really relaxed though.

2434
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,360
You protected him, I'm telling you.

2435
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,560
Blame me then.

2436
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,400
Classmate Xiao Ning is useless himself.

2437
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,920
In the end, you blame me.

2438
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,720
Don't come for the next recording.

2439
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,360
Get out!

2440
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,000
How many keys do you have?

2441
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,560
Fine, I won't record then.

2442
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,600
If I do record, I'll take your surname Liu.

2443
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,240
Don't get angry.

2444
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,920
This episode's golden key winners are...

2445
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,320
our true culprit and X.

2446
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,400
Let me distribute them.

2447
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,280
I'll give mine to my little brother.

2448
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,160
Awesome.

2449
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,600
Proud of you.

2450
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,840
So proud of you.

2451
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,840
I won't give it to you though.

2452
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,280
Fine.

2453
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,720
Alright, I'll take it myself.

2454
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,880
Do it myself.

2455
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,120
You performed really well today.

2456
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,600
You were under so much pressure at the end.

2457
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,040
Like I said,

2458
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,160
This is a reasoning and growth show.

2459
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:40,960
A growth and reasoning show.

2460
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,400
You've grown.

2461
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,200
Really great.

2462
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,120
Played it well.

2463
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,560
Playing this three-person game with you wasn't in vain.

2464
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,160
You handled it well.

2465
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,120
You really know how to play.

2466
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,200
You've taken five keys.

2467
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,000
In this case, we were "mistreated."

2468
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,560
Do you have anything to say?

2469
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,560
Say something quickly.

2470
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,760
Like apologizing to me or something.

2471
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,960
I just think...

2472
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,640
First, this AI era...

2473
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,960
I believe it will inevitably come, right?

2474
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,920
Right.

2475
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,120
I think essentially...

2476
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,600
Why these things exist in the AI era is...

2477
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,560
Whether it's killing...

2478
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,200
Or whatever...

2479
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:16,960
Killing machines...

2480
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,640
I think these things actually...

2481
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,160
Probably stem from their creators.

2482
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:21,880
So I believe...

2483
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,800
No matter what...

2484
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,680
We should start with ourselves...

2485
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,640
By being kind to others.

2486
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,200
If you pass on your kindness to them...

2487
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,560
Perhaps they too will...

2488
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,800
Not have those chaotic thoughts anymore.

2489
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,240
Whether human or machine...

2490
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,280
I think...

2491
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,680
We should treat everyone equally...

2492
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,600
Just be kind to others, that's all.

2493
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,160
I'm a neighborhood security guard.

2494
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,160
You little guard...

2495
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,320
Just a small guard, security...

2496
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,800
But I...

2497
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,880
For petty gains...

2498
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,600
How should I put it...

2499
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,480
Didn't let people in...

2500
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,040
This actually led to...

2501
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:49,840
Someone's death.

2502
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,120
I think...

2503
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,440
It was very wrong.

2504
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,120
We should still...

2505
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,880
Be kind and not greedy.

2506
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,000
Be kind and not greedy.

2507
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,320
Don't be two-faced.

2508
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,120
And occasionally don't be too rigid.

2509
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:06,440
Nobody move!

2510
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,160
Stand up, everyone be serious.

2511
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,320
You

2512
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,240
Me

2513
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,000
You, and you

2514
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,840
Face the wall in front of me

2515
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,240
Turn around and line up in a row.

2516
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,400
What about me? You didn't call on me.

2517
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,240
As for you...

2518
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,040
On our arrest list...

2519
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:32,880
your name isn't there.

2520
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,040
Get out of here right now.

2521
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:34,720
No, you can't.

2522
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,720
Arrest? You're going to arrest us?

2523
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,480
Since you're so reluctant to leave them behind...

2524
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,360
I'm not reluctant.

2525
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,200
No, not reluctant at all.

2526
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,520
I'll leave right away.

2527
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,560
She actually abandoned you.

2528
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,840
Face that wall and stand straight.

2529
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,880
Line up in a row.

2530
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,040
All of them...

2531
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,560
Take them all into the secret chamber

2532
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,560
Understood

2533
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,520
Let me go

2534
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,400
No more grinning

2535
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,720
Take this seriously

2536
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,960
Bring out the neural connectors and clothes

2537
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:13,840
Received

2538
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,000
Check them

2539
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,920
Their neural interface ports on the back

2540
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,720
Check if neural interfaces exist

2541
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,480
Confirmed

2542
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,280
They do have them

2543
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,000
Those five people's neural interfaces

2544
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,800
Connect the neural

2545
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,080
connectors to their ports

2546
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,440
Understood

2547
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,280
I must help Beiju

2548
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,840
complete this mission

2549
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,000
Lock them

2550
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,040
in my own prison cell

2551
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,000
Understood

2552
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,880
Every piece of clothing here

2553
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,000
has a chip that resonates

2554
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,480
with your brain-machine interface

2555
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,280
Don't you dare make any mistakes

2556
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,840
or you'll regret it

2557
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,840
Is that clear?

2558
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,120
Crystal clear

2559
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:07,920
Now

2560
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,720
we need to find that crucial person

2561
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,920
in their memories

2562
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,640
Before leaving, release cyber-hypnotic gas

2563
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,720
to knock them out

2564
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,280
Then we can access their memories

2565
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,120
Good, follow me out

2566
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,080
This place isn't haunted, is it?

2567
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,880
You can crawl over here.

2568
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,040
Look.

2569
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,760
Look, the lights are off.

2570
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,600
I told you we should turn off the lights.

2571
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,120
Come.

2572
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,280
You've arrived at the boys' dormitory.

2573
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,200
Today, let's focus our discussion on

2574
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,200
from the perspective of labor law

2575
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,760
how overtime work should be addressed

2576
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,360
First,

2577
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,640
is there a cap on overtime hours?

2578
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,720
The Labor Law stipulates

2579
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,560
that employers shall ensure

2580
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,480
workers have at least one day off per week.

2581
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,000
If production or operation requires,

2582
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,720
after consultation with the trade union and workers,

2583
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,560
working hours may be extended,

2584
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,320
generally not exceeding one hour per day.

2585
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,520
Under special circumstances,

2586
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,400
if extended working hours are necessary,

2587
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,760
while ensuring

2588
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,800
workers' physical health,

2589
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,920
the extension

2590
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,680
shall not exceed three hours per day.

2591
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,240
Even when paying workers

2592
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,000
overtime wages,

2593
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,320
workers' working hours

2594
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,440
are still subject to

2595
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,680
the statutory limits

2596
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,360
on extended working hours.

2597
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:55,880
Secondly,

2598
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,560
can workers refuse overtime?

2599
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,000
The Labor Contract Law stipulates

2600
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,200
that employers shall

2601
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,320
strictly implement labor quota standards

2602
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,720
and must not force or coerce

2603
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,960
workers to work overtime.

2604
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,280
Thus it can be seen

2605
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,400
that a labor contract

2606
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,080
is a written agreement

2607
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,680
clarifying the rights and obligations

2608
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:13,840
of both employer and worker.

2609
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:14,840
Unless modified,

2610
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,960
both parties must

2611
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,800
strictly adhere to its terms,

2612
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,880
especially regarding working hours

2613
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,440
and labor quota standards.

2614
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,720
Therefore,

2615
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,120
Regarding forced overtime work,

2616
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,200
workers have the right to refuse.

2617
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,240
Third,

2618
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,840
if an employer and employee

2619
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,560
stipulate in the labor contract

2620
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:33,640
overtime clauses exceeding

2621
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,360
the legal maximum working hours,

2622
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,520
are they valid?

2623
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,960
The Labor Contract Law states:

2624
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,840
Any labor contract that violates

2625
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:40,960
mandatory legal regulations

2626
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,480
is either wholly or partially invalid.

2627
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,360
Fourth,

2628
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,000
remedies for forced overtime:

2629
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,600
two legal recourse options:

2630
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:48,920
First,

2631
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,040
file for labor arbitration.

2632
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:50,560
Second,

2633
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,800
call the national complaint hotline

2634
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,400
12333

2635
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,960
to report to labor authorities.

2636
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,120
Now let's discuss

2637
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,720
how AI development

2638
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,200
presents new legislative challenges.

2639
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,400
In the future, with

2640
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,440
robot manufacturing and adoption,

2641
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,160
if incidents occur

2642
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,840
where robots harm humans,

2643
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,840
how should liability be determined

2644
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,480
and what types of responsibility apply?

2645
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,720
This will become

2646
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,960
another challenge for humanity.

2647
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,960
Actually, we are currently facing

2648
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,520
issues with autonomous driving

2649
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,240
problems related to autonomous vehicle accidents

2650
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,720
Perhaps one day in the future

2651
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:22,520
the fully autonomous vehicles

2652
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:25,040
depicted in sci-fi films

2653
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,160
will become a reality

2654
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:29,000
There will no longer be drivers

2655
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,320
and liability will shift to the system

2656
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,520
the network, or the vehicle manufacturers

2657
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,040
and other relevant parties

2658
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,080
In the next issue

2659
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,640
we will continue discussing

2660
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,680
the legal challenges

2661
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,040
we will face in the future era

2662
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,840
Starting from October 10th last year,

2663
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,960
a serial killer known as the Butcher Doll

2664
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,920
(serial killer)

2665
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,520
within six months,

2666
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,800
brutally murdered five victims.

2667
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,160
Wake Up

2668
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,720
Where is the cutest doll in the world?

2669
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,720
You four must have mental issues.

2670
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,200
I'm not mentally ill.

2671
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,320
He says I'm mentally ill.

2672
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:07,920
I am mentally ill.

2673
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,120
Why are you running around again?

2674
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,480
I even doubt the

2675
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,720
identity of the staff.

2676
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,680
You're insane.

2677
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:13,920
You won't admit it,

2678
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,200
right?

2679
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,560
How is this not admitting it?

2680
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,480
Do you have a diagnosis?

2681
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:17,880
Diagnosis shows

2682
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,520
the patient has cyberpsychosis.

2683
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:22,560
They all have

2684
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,200
aggressive tendencies.

2685
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,400
Curiosity killed the cat.

2686
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,320
It was torture for me,

2687
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,120
so I killed him.

2688
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,880
I fell in love with that feeling of

2689
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:30,920
I fell in love with that feeling of

2690
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,400
self-harm.

2691
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,440
It's a little hobby of mine.

2692
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,160
I really enjoy it.

2693
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,320
She likes the pain.

2694
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:36,880
Bloodlust.

2695
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,160
I started having

2696
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,360
flashbacks.

2697
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,880
Covered in blood splatters.

2698
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:41,880
Why did you want to kill him?

2699
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,480
Does justice justify killing?

2700
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,560
Let me tell you what justifies killing.
