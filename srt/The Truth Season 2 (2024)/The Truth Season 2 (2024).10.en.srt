1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,880
"Start Reasoning" Season 2 Game Rules

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,040
Six players per episode

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,560
Divided into four suspects

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,320
And two investigators solving the case

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,040
The real culprit hides among the suspects

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,000
The culprit's mission

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
Is to conceal their identity

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,520
Without being discovered by others

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,120
Only the real culprit can lie

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,840
Notably

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,760
This season introduces new gameplay

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,440
The player as the culprit

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,360
If passing a certain test

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Can choose between the two investigators

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,800
To corrupt one into becoming X

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,920
X's mission is

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,840
During subsequent investigations

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,680
To help the culprit escape

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,720
Victory conditions

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,240
After investigation

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Players vote for the culprit

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,600
If the culprit receives

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
Fewer votes than others

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,000
Then culprit and X get golden keys

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,240
Otherwise correct voters

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,640
Receive golden keys

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,240
February 1924

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,760
The week-long Bali Fashion Week

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,680
concluded successfully at Tuilemen

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
But the next morning

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,600
Master Le

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
Master Le, owner of Tuilemen

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,200
was found dead in his room

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
After investigation

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,920
the suspect was identified

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,480
Well hidden indeed, Legendary Brother

37
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Wang Chuanshuo

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,040
As Sanjia Alley remains

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,400
under 48-hour lockdown

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,960
the suspect remains at Tuilemen

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,320
After the lockdown ends

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,000
he'll be handed to the police

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,320
However

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
Tuilemen still has

45
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,080
many unsolved mysteries

46
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,120
There's a door here

47
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,280
that's sealed

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Jiawei

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,360
Are you Baduanjin or Bali?

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,800
In that mysterious room

51
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,960
there's a high-powered lock

52
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,440
An orphan girl with no parents

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
The Long-haired Witch

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,960
Young Marshal He, what Jiawei?

55
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,720
The real and fake Young Marshal He

56
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,560
It doesn't matter

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,840
If you don't believe me

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,880
I'll find someone else to prove it

59
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,640
Wait

60
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,800
Actually, the mystery is quite big

61
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
It seems

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,360
Young Marshal He has many friends

63
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
Doctor

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,480
has invited everyone here again

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,640
for the purpose of having everyone

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,320
help Young Marshal He regain his memory

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,760
From what I know

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,920
Young Marshal He had a close group of friends in childhood

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,040
They enjoyed playing games together

70
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,840
The name of that game was

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,960
Radish Squat

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,840
Here

73
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,000
we'll recreate the Radish Squat game

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
to stimulate Young Marshal He's

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
deep memory

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
If after we squat with you

77
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,040
you still can't remember anything

78
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,680
I won't let you off easy

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,760
Then give each person a

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
name similar to the previous ones

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,200
I'm Flower Fertilizer

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
Didn't we just figure this out?

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,560
Right

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Bali is

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Black Fertilizer

86
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Then I'm Gray Fertilizer

87
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm Effective

88
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm Volatile

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,600
You're Blackening

90
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,760
Blackening

91
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,200
What was it again?

92
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
You're Volatile

93
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,560
He's Effective

94
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
He's Black

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
Blackening

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
You're Effective

97
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,760
Effective

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,040
Volatile

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Done

100
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,640
Flower Fertilizer

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm Gray Fertilizer

102
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm Flowering

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Flower

104
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Effective

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
I'm Volatile

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm Blackening

107
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
Black Fertilizer

108
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,160
This is so hard

109
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
This is too difficult

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,600
Is everyone ready?

111
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,040
Okay, let's go

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,920
Don't give us time to prepare

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,760
Just start already

114
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,560
Floral fertilizer squats

115
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,000
After floral fertilizer squats, black fertilizer squats

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Black fertilizer squats

117
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,360
After black fertilizer squats, volatile squats

118
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,600
Volatile squats

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,960
After volatile squats, black fertilizer squats

120
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,520
Black fertilizer squats

121
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,040
After black fertilizer squats, gray fertilizer squats

122
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Gray fertilizer squats

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,480
After gray fertilizer squats, darkening squats

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,920
Evaporating squats

125
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,200
What nonsense is this?

126
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,520
What did you say?

127
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm not from around here

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,120
My accent isn't good

129
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,880
Alright, my accent isn't good

130
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,560
Eliminated one that darkens

131
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
I remember now

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,760
Through me, you regained your memories

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:03,920
No

134
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
I was wondering what you are

135
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,520
It has nothing to do with memories

136
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,480
Just playing a game

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
Can perform and can volatilize

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Volatilize

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,440
Can volatilize

140
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,160
Can volatilize, can perform

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
Come on

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,760
This is fun

143
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,880
Quick

144
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
Let's begin round two

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,680
Can perform squat

147
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,600
Can perform gray volatilize squat, then gray fertilizer squat

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
You're out, bro

149
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
What's this?

150
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,040
What did you say, bro?

151
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,840
Can volatilize squat

152
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,080
Can volatilize squat, then black fertilizer squat

153
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,640
Black fertilizer squat

154
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,280
Black fertilizer squat, then flower fertilizer squat

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
Flower fertilizer squat

156
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,400
Flower fertilizer squat, then black fertilizer squat

157
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,800
What's going on?

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,520
Black fertilizer squat

159
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,120
Black fertilizer squat, then gray fertilizer squat

160
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,040
Gray fertilizer squat

161
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,200
After gray fertilizer squat

162
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,680
Continue or not?

163
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,560
Continue

164
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,240
Can volatilize squat

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,960
Can volatilize squat, then black flower fertilizer squat

166
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,920
He's wrong

167
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
Okay, you three

168
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,040
Now it's us three

169
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
Just like when we were kids

170
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,840
Back to the very beginning

171
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
Everything is fate

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,960
This time

173
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,760
If your memories don't return this time

174
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,840
Let me tell you

175
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,520
You're definitely not Young Marshal He

176
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,600
Maybe he wasn't even him as a child, right?

177
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,520
It wasn't him playing

178
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
He looks very flustered right now.

179
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's begin.

180
00:06:59,480 --> 00:06:59,840
Black Chemical Fertilizer

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,360
Floral Chemical Fertilizer

182
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
You start first.

183
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,600
I'll begin.

184
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,240
Okay.

185
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,280
Flower fertilizer.

186
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,080
Let's start over.

187
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
Flower fertilizer squat.

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,360
After flower fertilizer squat comes gray fertilizer squat.

189
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,600
Gray fertilizer squat.

190
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
After gray fertilizer squat comes flower fertilizer squat.

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,280
Flower fertilizer squat.

192
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,680
After flower fertilizer squat comes black fertilizer squat.

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,040
Black fertilizer squat.

194
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,760
After black fertilizer squat comes flower fertilizer squat.

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm out.

196
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,720
The tiptoe boy and the four-word boy.

197
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,520
You two win.

198
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,760
Winner - tiptoe boy.

199
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,720
Young Marshal He.

200
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Do you have any recollection returning?

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
No memories have returned.

202
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,040
Then let's try a different therapy.

203
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,560
Next I'll introduce to everyone.

204
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,120
Dongnao Hall's new therapy.

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,480
Doctor's secret method.

206
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
This therapy.

207
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,200
Only requires five participants.

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,200
Just five people needed.

209
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,880
You should remember something soon.

210
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,960
Trust me.

211
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,640
Is anyone there?

212
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,840
Is anyone here?

213
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,800
Hello? Anyone?

214
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,400
Yes.

215
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,920
Come.

216
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,200
Isn't this place full of people?

217
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,840
What's wrong?

218
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,360
Come here.

219
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Everyone's here.

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Come on.

221
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,920
Everyone gather around.

222
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
What's the matter?

223
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm Master Xiu.

224
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,280
Here's the thing.

225
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,600
I met everyone yesterday.

226
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
I am Master Xiu.

227
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,480
I just received a notice.

228
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,520
From the local power company.

229
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,200
They said your establishment.

230
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
Currently has.

231
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,560
High-power equipment running.

232
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,480
So.

233
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,040
Quickly.

234
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,600
Turn off that high-power device.

235
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
Today I came.

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
First to thank everyone.

237
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,400
For turning off the equipment yesterday.

238
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Or Sanjia Alley would've lost power.

239
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,920
Stop talking.

240
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,960
You scared us to death.

241
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,120
Help!

242
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,040
You must know what's going on.

243
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,120
You made us do it.

244
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,280
I really don't know, Brother Shan.

245
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,960
I truly don't know.

246
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,760
Brother Shan.

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
Brother Shan.

248
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,960
Our town

249
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,880
has many strange occurrences happening

250
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,120
Today I came because

251
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,040
I want to inspect the equipment here

252
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,120
to check if they've been affected by

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,720
high-power electrical appliances

254
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Excuse me, everyone

255
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
Yes, I'll just take a quick look

256
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,600
You can all disperse now

257
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,480
Okay

258
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
Where are you going?

259
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm just looking around

260
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,760
Stop staring at me

261
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,400
No, we must keep an eye on you

262
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,280
Let me tell you

263
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,000
From now on

264
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Brother Shan will watch you

265
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,560
Brother Shan

266
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Sorry, Brother Shan

267
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,400
Brother Shan, my apologies

268
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
About yesterday, I really...

269
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,840
Stop staring at me

270
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,160
If I don't stare at you, who should I look at?

271
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,120
Brother Shan will be in prison soon

272
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,240
Let me tell you

273
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,280
Do you know who I am?

274
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,720
You'll be arrested immediately

275
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
What are you doing?

276
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,960
He's a murderer

277
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,600
I've killed before

278
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
Watch yourself

279
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,880
Let me see what's in your bag

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,920
Why did you snatch his bag?

281
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,680
I'll inspect the clock's inner layer.

282
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,120
What?

283
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Need help?

284
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,600
What? Found something again?

285
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,640
This isn't the VIP room on the second floor

286
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
Is this some kind of mystery?

287
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
Damn it, what terrible luck

288
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
The fortune teller mysteriously died

289
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,560
Other than me

290
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,040
No one knew about this mechanical clock

291
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,920
having a hidden compartment

292
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,880
I never told anyone

293
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,080
I swear

294
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,320
I didn’t tell a soul

295
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,720
What did you tell anyone?

296
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,000
I swear

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
I never told anyone

298
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,840
There’s a hidden compartment behind this clock

299
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,200
I really didn’t tell anyone

300
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,960
There’s no way anyone could’ve known

301
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,960
I’m not doing maintenance today

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,240
This murder has nothing to do with me

303
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,400
I’m leaving now

304
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,320
You are a VIP guest

305
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,240
I push open the mysterious room

306
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,640
This is not a place you should be

307
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,400
Ever since this

308
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,040
VIP guest appeared

309
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
Tui Le Gate started making profits

310
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,560
And business boomed

311
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,400
It is the morning of February 3rd, 1924.

312
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,720
The deceased in this case is Tui Shenmi.

313
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,960
He was a VIP guest at the Tuile Gate.

314
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,440
After preliminary investigation,

315
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,520
Tui Shenmi's death

316
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,640
cannot rule out the possibility of homicide.

317
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,440
The suspects are narrowed down to:

318
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,240
Bali,

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Wang Chuanshuo,

320
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,240
Commander He,

321
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
and Commander Ke.

322
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,360
In this game's setting,

323
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,280
Commander Ning and Bai Youcai are currently not suspects.

324
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,080
Therefore, you will act as investigators for this case.

325
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,720
No wonder you put on glasses

326
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,920
Does this give you Conan vibes?

327
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,360
My forehead is stamped with the word "Justice"

328
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,240
What should we do then?

329
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
Two consecutive deductions

330
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,720
Do you need backup?

331
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,360
Hang in there

332
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,520
You're suspicious—you!

333
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,600
I naturally ruled myself out already

334
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,560
Killing one is still killing

335
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Killing two is still killing

336
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Didn't I tell you

337
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,840
within twenty-four hours

338
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,880
not to kill anyone again

339
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,840
But sometimes I can't control

340
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,040
my own murderous impulses

341
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,040
Both detectives please remain at the crime scene

342
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,800
for preliminary evidence collection

343
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,400
Alright, Bai detective

344
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,280
what should we do

345
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,520
Big bro, you take this

346
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,320
Put down those melon seeds

347
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,040
For this part

348
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,360
let's not snack on seeds, okay?

349
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I think better while eating seeds

350
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,360
It's up to you, X

351
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,440
No, it's up to you

352
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,400
Right, I'm X

353
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,840
They haven't chosen yet

354
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
Still haven't chosen

355
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,160
Whether chosen or not, I'll still

356
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,800
play the X role myself

357
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,760
Let's go

358
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,080
Let's examine

359
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
Is this the cause of death?

360
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,000
Right?

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,040
Direct stab to the chest

362
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,320
The knife says "Tui Le Men Hall"

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,120
This is the fruit knife from the table

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,760
Exactly

365
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,920
Then let's check if

366
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,560
there's one missing from this table

367
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,400
We need to check

368
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
This one's here

369
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,040
This one too

370
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,800
And this one

371
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,760
So none missing, right?

372
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,600
Nothing here

373
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,320
First, we need to take a look.

374
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,800
The body is bound with electrical wires.

375
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,640
The question is, where did the wires come from?

376
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Microphone cables.

377
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,800
Stage power cables.

378
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,520
Do not touch.

379
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,800
These wires are inside here, right?

380
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,720
Can we pull them out?

381
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
They've been cut.

382
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,240
There's something on the ground.

383
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,800
Wang.

384
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,600
There's another message here.

385
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320
The Tuilemen clock.

386
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,200
Every night from 10 to 12.

387
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,560
It chimes on the hour.

388
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,720
Let's check the pockets first.

389
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
There's a piece of paper here.

390
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,280
Someone has...

391
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,480
written a letter to Tui Shenmi.

392
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,000
Let me smell this first.

393
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,840
The knife has already...

394
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,800
pierced the heart, bro.

395
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,520
Is this something you should smell?

396
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,320
No.

397
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,080
First, let's take the body down.

398
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
Check the back of the head...

399
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,960
for signs of being knocked unconscious.

400
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
Bro, you're really skilled with pliers.

401
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,680
This is so heavy.

402
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Extremely heavy.

403
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,240
Alright.

404
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,040
Let's place it on the ground.

405
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,760
Sorry, brother.

406
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,560
My apologies.

407
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,840
Let's search thoroughly again.

408
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,160
Tuck the legs in.

409
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,160
Nothing.

410
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,520
No injuries at all.

411
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Nothing.

412
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Absolutely nothing.

413
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
Good, excellent.

414
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,640
This corpse is really something.

415
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,800
So...

416
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,360
So the two of us useless detectives...

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,200
What was the point of taking him down...

418
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,960
then?

419
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,560
Well, you...

420
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
You...

421
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
ask yourself.

422
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
Everyone...

423
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Master Xiu just told me...

424
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
that someone else died here.

425
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,440
Here.

426
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,880
Let me see.

427
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Who is this?

428
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,520
This is...

429
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,360
one of our...

430
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,400
VIP guests.

431
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,840
Named Tui Shenmi.

432
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,280
Tui Shenmi.

433
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,560
Shall I perform an autopsy for you?

434
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,520
Good, very good.

435
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,200
What time is it now?

436
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,920
It's six o'clock now.

437
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,280
The estimated time of death is

438
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,200
10 hours before the autopsy

439
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,880
to 11 hours prior.

440
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,280
Understood.

441
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,200
Here’s the autopsy report.

442
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,240
You can review it first.

443
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,600
Got it.

444
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,480
I’ll head back to the Think Tank now.

445
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,960
Contact me if you need anything else.

446
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,320
Will do.

447
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,120
Alright, goodbye.

448
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,040
Okay, bye.

449
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Autopsy report.

450
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,840
Go ahead.

451
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,160
Look

452
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
Between 10 to 11 hours

453
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,760
Which means it's currently 6 AM

454
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,520
What time was it 10 hours ago?

455
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,800
10 hours before 6 AM is 8 PM

456
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,320
Right, 11 hours would be 7 PM

457
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,920
So between 7 PM to 8 PM

458
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
It's around 7 PM to 8 PM

459
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,480
Last night at 11 PM

460
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
we were still playing games, right?

461
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,600
Yes

462
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,520
Doctor's Secret Code

463
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
This therapy

464
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,240
only requires five participants

465
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,240
Five people are enough

466
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,320
You should remember something soon

467
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,400
Initial crime scene investigation completed

468
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
Detectives, please escort the suspect

469
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,160
to the Brainstorm Hall

470
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,280
for interrogation

471
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,680
This season's interrogation sessions

472
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
will be conducted in the Brainstorm Hall

473
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,560
This appears to be an herb shop

474
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,560
but is actually Tui Town's investigation center

475
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,600
It's Tui Town's investigation center

476
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,040
While investigating the crime scene,

477
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,160
the Dongnao Hall members also collected

478
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
some evidence related to

479
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,360
the four suspects in this case.

480
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,280
Please examine the evidence, players.

481
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,960
Who drew this?

482
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,840
What does this mean?

483
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,640
Other than us,

484
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,080
can anyone else enter this place?

485
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,360
Who drew it?

486
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,280
I did.

487
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,880
Bali.

488
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,800
I drew it.

489
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,480
You drew this?

490
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
What do you mean by this?

491
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
It's unrelated to the case.

492
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,160
No,

493
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
this is

494
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,800
related to

495
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,960
the case.

496
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800
Another psychological

497
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,880
This is definitely relevant.

498
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,160
Big house, small house, sunflower,

499
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,320
with smoke rising.

500
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,120
I think this reflects her inner state.

501
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,520
Is that a person?

502
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,160
That's a doghouse.

503
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,720
Doghouse.

504
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,040
The small house is a doghouse.

505
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
I think Ke Shaoshuai is acting suspiciously.

506
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,880
He just glanced at me secretly.

507
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Before everyone examined the evidence,

508
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,320
only he looked at me.

509
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Before this round even started,

510
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,920
I could sense something was off about him.

511
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,080
He didn't even understand his own story.

512
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,080
See how he's not arguing back?

513
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,520
Normally he's very argumentative.

514
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,000
Right.

515
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,080
If he were normal, he'd argue.

516
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,640
He'd get embarrassed.

517
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
He'd say "I didn't!"

518
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,560
"Bro, I didn't!"

519
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,880
That's how he'd react, I'm telling you.

520
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,120
But he didn't argue at all.

521
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,360
Didn't dare say a word.

522
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,160
You two

523
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
We two are great detectives

524
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,640
You two

525
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,160
Can you provide evidence?

526
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,800
We can completely

527
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,160
rely on our brains

528
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,800
to defeat you

529
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:41,840
defeat you

530
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,080
Many great detectives rely on

531
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,880
intuition and guesses

532
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,080
So, little killers

533
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,760
First

534
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,880
let's have everyone introduce

535
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,880
their relationship with the deceased Tui Shenmi

536
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,320
Because yesterday

537
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,880
in Tui Shenmi's room

538
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,680
we encountered him

539
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,040
It seems like

540
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,560
he knew each one of us, right?

541
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,040
Everyone has said it once

542
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,880
But you two

543
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,600
are inexplicably

544
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,680
He suspected you were Jiawei

545
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,560
You were Baduanjin

546
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,120
Somewhat familiar

547
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,280
Are you

548
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,520
Baduanjin or Bali?

549
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,600
Baduanjin

550
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,200
Are you Jiawei or Commander He?

551
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,680
I don't know this Tui Shenmi

552
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,360
Don't know him at all

553
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Right, I don't know him

554
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,040
Didn't you go to his room?

555
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,280
And then on

556
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,880
February 5, 1923

557
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,120
Master Le took me to

558
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
the premium room on the second floor of Tuile Gate

559
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,160
He had me wait there for

560
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
the owner of Tuilao Hui

561
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,200
The Tuilao Hui person wore a mask

562
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,720
called Lao Dongjia

563
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,680
He's the owner of Tuilao Hui

564
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,360
Not Tui Shenmi

565
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,680
Makes sense, yes, that's right

566
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,560
I've never seen this person before

567
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,680
Yesterday he called me He Jiawei

568
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,760
I was completely confused too

569
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,160
I have no relationship with the deceased

570
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,000
I only just met him yesterday

571
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,720
Then do you know

572
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,560
the person Tui Shenmi mentioned

573
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,240
with your cousin's other name?

574
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,280
He Jiawei

575
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,640
Right

576
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,440
Don't know him

577
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,800
Little Assassin

578
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
It's fine, continue

579
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,600
Brother Wang the Legend

580
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,560
I've heard about him long ago

581
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,440
But I've never met him

582
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,280
I only heard from Master Le

583
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,880
Whenever our Tui Le Sect

584
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,000
wants to "ascend" to Tui Broadway

585
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,800
it's always through Tui Mystery

586
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,160
which also harmed your Pink Phoenix

587
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,000
Possibly

588
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,920
So you developed murderous intent toward him

589
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
No, not murderous intent yet, just investigating

590
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,120
Let's investigate first

591
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,680
Sorry, bro

592
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,680
None of us know him

593
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,440
Nobody knows him

594
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,280
But he knows

595
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,200
Every one of us

596
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,720
Right

597
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,120
That's strange

598
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,160
That means

599
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,480
Someone is lying

600
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,280
Let me first brief everyone

601
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,800
about the crime scene investigation report.

602
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,160
First and foremost,

603
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,760
the victim was Tui Shenmi.

604
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,160
The time of incident

605
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,280
was today, February 3rd,

606
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,640
at 6:00 in the morning.

607
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,200
The cause of death,

608
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,040
as you all saw,

609
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,200
was a knife stabbed into the left chest

610
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,560
piercing the heart directly.

611
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,200
That was the fatal wound.

612
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,160
Yes, the fatal wound.

613
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,400
Definitely the cause of death.

614
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,400
From the lack of struggle marks,

615
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,120
we can determine it was

616
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,040
kill first, then bind.

617
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,720
Was tying him there to hide the body?

618
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,680
Or was there some other meaning?

619
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,840
For pleasure.

620
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,600
What? Pleasure?

621
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,280
I think it was probably to hide it.

622
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Then a coroner came to the scene

623
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,080
and through the autopsy report,

624
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,440
estimated the time of death

625
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,640
to be within 10 to 11 hours

626
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,400
before 6 AM,

627
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,440
between 7 PM and 8 PM.

628
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,400
We were together

629
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,040
playing that fertilizer squat game.

630
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,680
Black fertilizer squat, then flower fertilizer squat,

631
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,240
flower fertilizer squat, flower fertilizer squat,

632
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,160
flower fertilizer squat, then black fertilizer squat.

633
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,160
But the time of death

634
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,440
if it's accurate,

635
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,600
he died between 7pm and 8pm.

636
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
We indeed

637
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
have alibis for all six people.

638
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,560
No problem.

639
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,360
If it's between 7pm and 8pm,

640
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,600
then congratulations everyone,

641
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,840
none of you are the killer.

642
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,680
If that's the case,

643
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,480
then no one is a suspect.

644
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,600
Also, we have another clue.

645
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,120
There's something attached to the clock.

646
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,440
Here's another message.

647
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,160
The Tuilemen Clock

648
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,960
Every night at

649
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,840
10pm, 11pm, and 12pm,

650
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,480
this clock chimes.

651
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,040
Announcing the time.

652
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Precisely on the hour.

653
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,440
But here's a possibility:

654
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,280
When we hear the clock chime,

655
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,600
it might not actually be 10pm.

656
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,040
It's possible,

657
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,920
very possible,

658
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,800
possible that

659
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,040
the time might have been altered.

660
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,720
It's also possible

661
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,880
that it was actually 8pm,

662
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
but hadn't reached 8pm yet.

663
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,240
For example, at 7:40pm,

664
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,480
it chimed for 10pm.

665
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,040
10pm,

666
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,160
so we thought it was 10pm.

667
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,000
I think there's another possibility

668
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,720
That one person here might actually be two people

669
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,040
Right

670
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,200
Yesterday, that other person said

671
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,360
"Why do you look exactly like me?"

672
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,560
"I am the real Young Marshal He, everyone."

673
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,640
The real and fake Young Marshal He

674
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,920
One of them brought us here to play

675
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,480
While another person who looks identical to him

676
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,600
Was over there killing people

677
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,240
That's another way to look at it

678
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,200
Can you try to hide your expression a little?

679
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,280
Then we also discovered at the scene

680
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,880
And found a letter

681
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,040
I know you just returned to Shangshang House

682
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,520
I'm someone who knows your secret

683
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,720
If you still want to continue

684
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,160
doing business here

685
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,840
come find me at the lobby clock of Tuile Gate

686
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm in the performance passage inside the clock

687
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,120
The way to open the passage is

688
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,760
Rotate the gem at the two o'clock position

689
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,040
Can I take a look?

690
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
Do you want to verify

691
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,600
if it's your own handwriting

692
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,600
He's deliberately behaving this way

693
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,240
What's the reason?

694
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
Because I've made myself very clear

695
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,680
Right

696
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,000
I also think you've been very clear

697
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,320
He wants to take it back to verify

698
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,400
To pretend

699
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,960
To act unfamiliar with this letter

700
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,560
Pass it around

701
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,440
He's pretending about this

702
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,200
We've never seen this letter before

703
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,160
When actually he wrote it

704
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,360
Here, let me draw this clock

705
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,400
Sorry about this

706
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,560
I'll sketch it roughly first

707
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,120
Okay

708
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,720
Get the permanent one

709
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
Need to use wet wipes

710
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,800
Wet wipes

711
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,880
Moist towelettes then

712
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,160
Wet wipes, moist towelettes

713
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,080
Same thing

714
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
No problem, I'll dismantle your little doghouse

715
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,640
I'll draw it over here

716
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,560
That's fine, wipe that side too

717
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
Tui Town Siblings Cleaning Service

718
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Sweet sister, handsome brother

719
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,040
Loved by all

720
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,280
Meticulous service

721
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,480
To win your favor

722
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,960
For details and appointments call

723
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,200
88888

724
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,280
And here's this clock

725
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,400
Then

726
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,760
The killer said there's a gem at the two o'clock position

727
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,360
Rotate it

728
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,480
to open this passageway

729
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,400
the same runway we walked on

730
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,520
But this gem

731
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,160
is a fake

732
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,560
and can't be rotated

733
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,280
Twelve o'clock, one o'clock, two o'clock

734
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,800
I turned this knob

735
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,760
but nothing happened

736
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,920
Could it be that when he turns it

737
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,440
suddenly

738
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
a blade would shoot out from here?

739
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,000
Let me try turning it (the gem at two o'clock)

740
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
One o'clock, two o'clock - this must be when

741
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
the blade would stab through me while turning, right?

742
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,920
Let's see if there's any place here

743
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,720
where a blade could extend from this gap

744
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,120
Just the right spot to extend the knife

745
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,440
Wang Esq., the little assassin

746
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,760
You described it exactly the same way

747
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,600
And at this moment

748
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,080
Through this method

749
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,440
It means I'm behind

750
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
You twist here

751
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,000
I twist here

752
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,560
One, two, three

753
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,600
And stab!

754
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,840
Understood

755
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,120
For example, if he's 1.7 meters tall

756
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,720
That would place his heart

757
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,640
At about 1.5 meters high

758
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,120
At this point

759
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,320
We can measure

760
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,360
When he stands on the ground

761
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
His heart

762
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,120
Would be approximately this far from the ground

763
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,360
1.45 meters

764
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,040
Perfect

765
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,520
The victim's heart position based on height

766
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,480
Exactly aligns with this opening

767
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,880
Allowing the knife to be thrust through

768
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,280
The killer likely used this opening

769
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,520
To kill him

770
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,800
And he died

771
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,440
That's what it means

772
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,280
Young Master He

773
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,280
Just died

774
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,360
Your height is just right

775
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,520
Your knife technique is quite practiced

776
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,640
The victim was 1.75 meters tall

777
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,800
1.75 meters

778
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,400
His heart

779
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,080
Would be around 1.4 meters high

780
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,880
Therefore

781
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
Any one of us here

782
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,960
Could have stabbed him

783
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,600
Height has nothing to do with it

784
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,360
Is it possible that the method used

785
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,240
was through some

786
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,080
He turned that knob which might have contained a blade

787
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,160
mechanism to kill him?

788
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,480
Right,

789
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,560
rather than a person killing him.

790
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,880
Not that he was actually a person

791
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,280
using human hands to kill him.

792
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,480
Currently,

793
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,160
these are all the clues I have.

794
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Now,

795
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,480
let our Bai Chief Detective explain.

796
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,120
Okay.

797
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,840
Little detective.

798
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,240
Little killer.

799
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,160
Great investigator.

800
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,120
Little killer.

801
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,680
My clues are fascinating,

802
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,840
extremely fascinating.

803
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,840
First clue:

804
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,560
This is

805
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,560
the knife found in the victim's body,

806
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,680
and this knife

807
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,560
is from our lobby's

808
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,480
table knife set.

809
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,840
It was from table number one.

810
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,520
This also has...

811
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,840
So nothing else, right?

812
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,760
No, nothing here.

813
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
This is the murder weapon, correct?

814
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,360
Murder weapon.

815
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,080
This cord

816
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,320
was used to bind the corpse,

817
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,440
the cord binding the limbs.

818
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,160
And where does this cord come from?

819
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,840
It's microphone cable.

820
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,800
Microphone cable.

821
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,280
It was cut off.

822
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,520
Right.

823
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,640
Someone who can skillfully use

824
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,280
such tools

825
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,800
might likely be Wang the singer.

826
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,760
I'm just suspicious of you

827
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,720
because this is

828
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,280
what you had the most contact with.

829
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,040
No.

830
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,840
I sing,

831
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,080
As a singer, I wouldn't

832
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,440
go get this myself.

833
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
They always bring it to me,

834
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,240
I leave right after singing.

835
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,520
Really.

836
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,080
Why do I suspect you?

837
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,680
Because at the scene

838
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,000
there was your handkerchief.

839
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
Wang Chuan's handkerchief, right?

840
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,600
With "Wang" written on it.

841
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,760
Isn't that you?

842
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,480
Brother Shan's fragment.

843
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,000
Brother Shan.

844
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,200
Brother Shan.

845
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,120
This is your handkerchief.

846
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,400
Brother Shan, this is your handkerchief.

847
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,880
Maybe I dropped it while singing.

848
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,640
So what were you doing?

849
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,400
Let me think.

850
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,760
Think about it.

851
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,040
Think of an excuse.

852
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,560
I'll tell you later.

853
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,320
You have to say it now.

854
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,520
No.

855
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,400
Little killer.

856
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,760
Say it now.

857
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,600
It was around 1 AM.

858
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,120
1 AM.

859
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,240
It was too dark that night.

860
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,520
I was leaving the hall to go back

861
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,480
when I tripped on the stage.

862
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,640
That's probably when I dropped it.

863
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Tripped.

864
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,560
Yes.

865
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,800
So let's take turns sharing

866
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,320
the evidence we've found.

867
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,240
We'll start with Legendary Brother.

868
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,680
My evidence is somewhat frightening.

869
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,800
Quite frightening indeed.

870
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560
This first piece of evidence

871
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,680
was found on the coffee table in Bali's private room,

872
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,600
a letter hidden beneath the tablecloth.

873
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,960
This letter was addressed to the former hall leader.

874
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,280
The letter reads as follows:

875
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,200
Honorable former hall leader,

876
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,320
Please save

877
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,560
this girl with abdominal injuries.

878
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,240
She's Bali, the tailor from Tuile Gate.

879
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
To my knowledge,

880
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,080
all girls sent from Tuile Gate to Tuile Hui

881
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,840
have met with misfortune.

882
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,040
I rescued Bali

883
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,240
before she could be harmed.

884
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,680
I hope you can heal her

885
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
and keep her safe.

886
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,760
Once my investigation is complete,

887
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,680
I'll arrange to meet you

888
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,120
at Tuihao Restaurant for further discussion.

889
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,240
If you see someone wearing a mask,

890
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,920
with a sunflower brooch,

891
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,960
and a sunflower bracelet,

892
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,720
that will be me.

893
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,520
My name is Ba Duanjin.

894
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,280
February 7, 1923.

895
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,520
Do you know Ba Duanjin?

896
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
Let me explain now

897
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,200
where this letter came from

898
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,880
After all these events

899
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,120
including learning that

900
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,880
when I accidentally

901
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,200
fell into the river

902
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,320
I saved myself

903
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,280
rather than being rescued by someone else

904
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,080
But I also knew about

905
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,160
the existence of this bracelet and brooch

906
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,120
So I was very confused

907
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,240
Actually after returning last night

908
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,000
I wanted to know

909
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,480
what the truth of this mystery was

910
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,920
I wanted to know whether this person

911
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,640
actually exists or not

912
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,760
So yesterday I went to

913
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,240
the old hall master's room

914
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,560
I found it yesterday

915
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,160
before we played the game yesterday

916
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,240
Then in the old hall master's

917
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,400
room corner, I discovered this letter

918
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,400
I learned that the mysterious push that day

919
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,520
mentioned Ba Duanjin

920
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,680
She does exist

921
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,800
And she is

922
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,760
the woman wearing the sunflower

923
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,960
She also saved my life

924
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,320
But the next piece of evidence

925
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,400
is also related to this

926
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,600
yet contradictory

927
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,000
This is a photo

928
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,200
This was also found in Bali's

929
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,920
VIP room, under the coffee table's tablecloth

930
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,600
(completing previous line)

931
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Let me show you first

932
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,120
This is a photo

933
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,320
showing someone wearing a sunflower brooch

934
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,440
and bracelet

935
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,200
which is Ba Duanjin

936
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,560
But the writing on this photo

937
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,880
says the following:

938
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,640
Master Le

939
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,640
This woman wearing the sunflower brooch

940
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,080
and bracelet

941
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,760
is a Broadway killer

942
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,680
who not only harmed Bali

943
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,960
but also many stars

944
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,160
who frequented Tuilemen

945
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,640
You must find and kill her

946
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,440
Was this written to Master Le by someone else?

947
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,400
Yes, but who is this person?

948
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
High-power electrical appliance

949
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,760
Pushing the mystery

950
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,120
There's a handwriting inside

951
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,200
that we've seen

952
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,880
in the mysterious person's room before.

953
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,680
The character he often uses is "no."

954
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,840
This photo is of me

955
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,920
After leaving the Sect Leader's room

956
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,640
I passed by Brother Le's room

957
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,800
I felt I needed to search one more time

958
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,640
Because there might be

959
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,280
some evidence we hadn't found yet

960
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,400
Then I discovered this photo

961
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,600
The writing on this photo

962
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,520
was written by Tui Shenmi

963
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,840
He wrote it to Brother Le

964
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,960
telling Brother Le

965
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,880
to kill by proxy

966
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,040
to have Brother Le kill Ba Duanjin

967
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,160
When I learned about this

968
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,400
I became very angry

969
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,080
He always

970
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,880
treated this girl named Ba Duanjin

971
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,560
as an enemy

972
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,000
This person wears

973
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,200
a sunflower-shaped accessory as shown

974
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,480
This woman is extremely dangerous

975
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,360
She is a sworn enemy of our Tui Le Sect

976
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,280
If you see her

977
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,520
contact me immediately

978
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,360
But this girl actually saved me once

979
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,920
I see

980
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,560
So your motive for murder

981
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,600
has become clear

982
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
You did indeed want

983
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,200
to kill this Tui Shenmi

984
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,400
I think that

985
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,640
Brother Le's death

986
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,160
might actually also be a misunderstanding

987
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,800
Brother Le's death was a misunderstanding.

988
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,840
Is it possible that Brother Le

989
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,680
was actually just a

990
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,720
puppet in the middle?

991
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,080
So you're saying that

992
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,520
it was actually that mysterious

993
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,000
mysterious

994
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,200
figure who was the mastermind behind it all?

995
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,320
I killed the wrong one

996
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,480
Now let's welcome Xiao Ba to share

997
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,400
From Ke Shaoshuai's private room

998
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,560
Little Killer

999
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,640
Little Killer

1000
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,880
First is a large one

1001
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,520
It's a photo

1002
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,520
This was found on the table in his private room

1003
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,480
discovered

1004
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,960
Looks like a family portrait

1005
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,600
Am I in it?

1006
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,440
You're not in this one

1007
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,040
And there's also a ticket from the Push Music Club

1008
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,600
Exclusively for Ke Shaoshuai

1009
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,480
Top-ranked Ke Shaoshuai's exclusive

1010
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,960
The beam went dark overnight

1011
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,560
This was your darkest hour

1012
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,120
It couldn't be...

1013
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,880
Does this face look familiar?

1014
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,080
This is Pink Phoenix

1015
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,920
Little Killer

1016
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,000
Don't you...

1017
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
play these games

1018
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,080
Don't be like this

1019
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,720
You, wait a minute

1020
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,320
What's going on?

1021
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
Speak

1022
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,840
What exactly is happening?

1023
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,920
This photo is a family portrait

1024
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,800
I actually come from a

1025
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,240
family of five

1026
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,400
These two are my parents

1027
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,480
My father

1028
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,320
My mother

1029
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,920
This one is my aunt

1030
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,840
And this is my sister

1031
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,600
Your sister?

1032
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,320
Brother-in-law

1033
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,200
Right

1034
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,160
I waited for the previous episode

1035
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,040
I was wondering why I didn't have

1036
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
any connection with your characters

1037
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,680
Ticket

1038
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,600
Explain what that ticket is about

1039
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
This ticket is for the Tui Le Gate

1040
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,240
A lifetime access pass

1041
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,600
My parents passed away very early

1042
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,000
After their death, my aunt took my sister

1043
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,880
to live elsewhere

1044
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,240
Meanwhile, I was adopted by my uncle

1045
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,960
He Shuai

1046
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,320
Not long after my sister and aunt left

1047
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,200
my aunt fell ill and died

1048
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,520
<summaryA character explains the significance of a lifetime access ticket and recounts their family history, including the deaths of their parents and aunt.

1049
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,920
After dying from illness,

1050
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,720
my sister was left all alone.

1051
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,840
To make a living,

1052
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,440
she entered Tui Le Men

1053
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,520
to become a songstress,

1054
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,840
transforming into Pink Phoenix.

1055
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,080
She's my only

1056
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,240
remaining family in this world.

1057
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,960
So I often come to visit her,

1058
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,160
to see how she's doing.

1059
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,200
The second piece of evidence is an account book.

1060
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,160
Found in Ke Shaoshuai's private room's

1061
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,920
cabinet drawer.

1062
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,720
This one is the same

1063
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,800
as the one you found belonging to Master Le.

1064
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,680
They're identical.

1065
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,600
I found this in Tui Shenmi's room.

1066
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,840
When did you go to his room?

1067
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,680
Actually, after we finished

1068
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
investigating on the first day,

1069
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,680
around 6 PM,

1070
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,360
I secretly returned to

1071
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,640
Tui Shenmi's room

1072
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,040
and found this account book.

1073
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,040
Take a look at this book.

1074
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,320
The cover says "Shenmi Productions" -

1075
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,680
"Shenmi Productions: Every product a masterpiece."

1076
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,480
"What people obtain is my decision."

1077
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,560
"What people obtain is my decision."

1078
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,120
"What horses see"

1079
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,520
"is decided by people."

1080
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,960
Little Killer.

1081
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,080
Another point is that

1082
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,680
below the name list there's a note,

1083
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,600
and under each note

1084
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,920
there's actually a letter.

1085
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,040
I don't know what it means.

1086
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,320
For January, it's Pink Phoenix.

1087
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,680
Below it says:

1088
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,720
"Unwilling to go to Tui Lao Hui alone,"

1089
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,680
"insisted on bringing"

1090
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,280
"that flawed partner along."

1091
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,080
She wanted to bring me,

1092
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,160
so she...

1093
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,680
right?

1094
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,120
"Flawed partner" - that must be me.

1095
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,200
Flawed? What flaws do I have?

1096
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,640
No choice -

1097
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
Pink Phoenix is too special.

1098
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,400
I had to drug her and take her by force.

1099
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,280
The note under his name

1100
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,600
what does it mean?

1101
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,720
Under Xiao Ba is

1102
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Under Xiao Ba is YS

1103
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,240
Then under Pink Phoenix is CXGS

1104
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,400
CXGS

1105
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,000
GS

1106
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,680
Is this their talent agency?

1107
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,880
All the ones below are talent agencies.

1108
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,480
Alias

1109
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,200
What is YS?

1110
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,720
YS

1111
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,960
Your company Yixin

1112
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,440
Yes

1113
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,000
Not Yixin

1114
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,000
Xin

1115
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,360
Yixin, are you a Yixin artist?

1116
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,320
This Bali also has beasts?

1117
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,600
Beasts

1118
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,280
Beasts

1119
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,520
Bali is a beast

1120
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,320
Beast

1121
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,640
Could there be... no

1122
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,720
I want to point out a logic

1123
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,440
Is it possible

1124
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,840
This is just a

1125
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,680
Could there be a way to explain his

1126
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,480
Form or something

1127
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,080
Form

1128
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,040
Let me explain the logic to you

1129
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,760
We can deduce from... I think

1130
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,280
That is, he

1131
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,080
The mysterious selection criteria they had

1132
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,400
The standards for selecting people

1133
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,000
One was having no relatives

1134
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Another was passing a physical exam

1135
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,920
This is from the physical exam results

1136
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,720
As long as you're over 18

1137
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,000
And an orphan with no relatives

1138
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,080
Isn't this suspicious?

1139
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,920
Once you pass the physical exam

1140
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,240
You get the chance to perform on

1141
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,360
Tui Le Men's stage

1142
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,000
What's written here is

1143
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,760
Besides the name

1144
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,040
It says remarks

1145
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,200
Remarks would be

1146
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,720
Results from the physical exam

1147
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,920
Either related to the physical exam

1148
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,720
Or about physical condition

1149
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,320
Or about relatives and such

1150
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,880
There's also a small box

1151
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,440
It was in the drawer of the cabinet in the private room

1152
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:48,920
that we found

1153
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,680
When we opened it

1154
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,040
there was a note inside

1155
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,120
written in blood

1156
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,680
that said "Help me"

1157
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,040
Where did this come from?

1158
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,280
This box is

1159
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,720
a birthday gift I gave to my sister.

1160
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,840
Actually, it's just a

1161
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,160
small mechanism

1162
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,360
Only my sister and I

1163
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,600
know how to open it

1164
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,080
He just opened it

1165
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,840
It's completely empty

1166
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,320
Do you want to open it?

1167
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,080
How do you open it?

1168
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,960
Thank you.

1169
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,440
I was also pushing open the mysterious room.

1170
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
I saw this box.

1171
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,960
When I looked at this box,

1172
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,920
isn't this the one I gave to my sister

1173
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,280
as a birthday present?

1174
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,800
Inside was supposed to be her gift -

1175
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,160
I bought her a ring.

1176
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,280
You bought your sister a ring?

1177
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,800
I gave her a present.

1178
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,920
So what? What's the problem?

1179
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:54,960
No problem.

1180
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,640
When I opened it, I didn't see the ring.

1181
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,120
Instead I saw

1182
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,360
a bloodstained "Help me" note.

1183
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,680
So you had strong motive for murder.

1184
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,520
What's wrong with me protecting my sister?

1185
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,440
Is there anything wrong with that?

1186
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,000
Next is Commander He.

1187
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,640
My evidence is Wang Chuanshuo's evidence.

1188
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,160
First,

1189
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,080
I was in Wang Chuanshuo's private room,

1190
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,880
on the dressing table,

1191
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,000
where I found

1192
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,280
a blood-stained note.

1193
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,480
There was no pushing Old Hui.

1194
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,440
I was pushed by Mysterious,

1195
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,520
locked in a strange room,

1196
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,760
living a nightmare every day.

1197
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,680
Wang Chuanshuo, will you come save me?

1198
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,200
My blood is almost drained.

1199
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,120
Where did you get this?

1200
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,560
This was after I killed Master Le,

1201
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,200
when we were investigating,

1202
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,560
After the push at 6 PM,

1203
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,760
I returned to my room

1204
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,440
and saw on my dressing table

1205
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,200
this piece of paper.

1206
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,920
When I looked at it,

1207
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,680
I recognized the handwriting immediately.

1208
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,200
It was Pink Phoenix's writing.

1209
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,400
From this, Pink Phoenix was in

1210
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,840
what I believe was

1211
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,760
a near-death state

1212
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,200
when she wrote this note.

1213
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,640
At that moment,

1214
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,720
I felt completely hopeless.

1215
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,280
I hated Mysterious to death.

1216
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,240
I regretted

1217
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,560
not dealing with him

1218
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,720
when I first encountered him.

1219
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,360
If I see him again,

1220
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,760
I'll definitely take him down.

1221
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,520
You returned to your room,

1222
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,720
and the note suddenly appeared there?

1223
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,680
It appeared out of nowhere.

1224
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,040
The killer wants to use his resentment

1225
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,080
to kill Mysterious.

1226
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,200
Possibly.

1227
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,320
After finding this,

1228
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,800
didn't you want to meet Mysterious?

1229
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,160
No, after 7 PM we began

1230
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,400
helping treat your mind.

1231
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,680
Your mind isn't quite right.

1232
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,320
Next

1233
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,600
There's another one at

1234
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,440
the long sofa in the VIP room

1235
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,600
where this was found

1236
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,600
a cube-shaped box like a Rubik's cube

1237
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,240
It was around

1238
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,320
11 PM when

1239
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,400
Me too, I had stomach issues

1240
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
I wasn't feeling well

1241
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,360
So I used that as an excuse to leave

1242
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,720
Actually I went to the mysterious room

1243
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,920
I wanted to find him

1244
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,400
But there was nothing there

1245
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,680
He wasn't there

1246
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,400
Then I discovered

1247
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,920
he had this box there

1248
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,280
I took it and tried to open it

1249
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,040
I returned around 11:30 PM

1250
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,600
So you left at 11 PM

1251
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,960
left this place

1252
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,600
left here

1253
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,160
and spent 30 minutes

1254
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,960
looking for the mystery

1255
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,440
Right

1256
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,200
Is there anything in this box?

1257
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,960
There's something in the box.

1258
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,000
There's a key.

1259
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,440
Wait, how did you open it?

1260
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,120
This one opened up.

1261
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,240
A warehouse passage key.

1262
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,880
Warehouse passage.

1263
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,240
That's the sealed door.

1264
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,280
There's a door here.

1265
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,480
It's sealed.

1266
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,440
Right.

1267
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,800
This might be.

1268
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,000
The key to that room we went to yesterday.

1269
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,480
The door we couldn't open.

1270
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,360
Exactly.

1271
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,600
Next

1272
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,000
On Commander He's private booth table

1273
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,760
we found a

1274
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,760
medical report from Dr. Hou

1275
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,080
because he treats brain conditions

1276
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,920
February 2, 1924

1277
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,280
Location: Brain Stimulation Hall

1278
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,520
Key Memory Stimulation Method

1279
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,440
It recorded how the six of us

1280
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,920
played the Squatting Game

1281
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,040
from 7 PM to 10 PM

1282
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,760
First round - Commander He's reaction

1283
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,440
gradually adapted to the squatting rhythm

1284
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,240
Then the second round

1285
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,040
Commander He became immersed

1286
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,000
with steady, powerful movements

1287
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,480
Third round - Commander He learned to anticipate squats

1288
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,400
According to experience

1289
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,520
most patients

1290
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,560
would have recovered their memory by now

1291
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,040
Commander Ke urgently asked Commander He

1292
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,840
"Cousin, how do you remember me? With a smile"

1293
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,040
or

1294
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,280
"How do you remember me?"

1295
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,600
"With a smile or in silence"

1296
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,840
Is that the lyric?

1297
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:56,520
Yes

1298
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,680
"All these years"

1299
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,800
"has anyone kept you from being lonely?"

1300
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,440
Commander He remained silent

1301
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,800
Later

1302
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,600
The sixty-sixth time

1303
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,200
Finally, after Marshal He squatted down

1304
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,880
his brows furrowed tightly

1305
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,520
and he stopped his leg movements

1306
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,720
as if something

1307
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,160
as if some important memory

1308
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,520
was about to surface

1309
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,880
He slowly raised his head

1310
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,280
and looked at Marshal Ning with eyes

1311
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,760
filled with complex emotions

1312
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,600
What kind of storyline is this?

1313
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,840
I finally learned how to love.

1314
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,200
But sadly, you were already gone.

1315
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,560
Vanished among people...

1316
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,280
It's chaotic, really chaotic.

1317
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,040
Who exactly are you, bro?

1318
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,200
Go on, finish what you were saying.

1319
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,800
No, I mean...

1320
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,280
Then, turning to Young Master Ning, he said:

1321
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,880
Do you still remember me?

1322
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,480
Brother...

1323
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,920
I'm numb.

1324
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,800
Give me a hand.

1325
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,120
My leg's numb, help me up.

1326
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,680
Bro, my leg's numb, give me a hand.

1327
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,240
This is what you remember?

1328
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,000
Evaluation.

1329
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Change the treatment.

1330
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,920
Communication-activated memory therapy.

1331
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,320
It's a new type of therapy.

1332
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,720
The doctor's secret five-person session.

1333
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,760
Between 10 PM and 11:30 PM.

1334
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,560
So that means...

1335
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,160
Between 10 PM and 11:30 PM.

1336
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,440
We started losing people.

1337
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,280
Right.

1338
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,200
Correct.

1339
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,360
Because there were only five people.

1340
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,560
Each time one person was missing.

1341
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,200
First round: Tuile Gate clock.

1342
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,760
Chimed ten times.

1343
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,480
Bali returned to Tuile Gate.

1344
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,760
Adjusting clothes.

1345
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,760
10 PM.

1346
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,280
First round: Bali was absent.

1347
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,280
Second round: Bali returned.

1348
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,880
Said it was already...

1349
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,160
10:25 PM.

1350
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,120
10:25 PM.

1351
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,920
Then Ke Shaoshuai...

1352
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,680
Returned to Tuile Gate to eat.

1353
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,680
Third round: Ke Shaoshuai returned.

1354
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,200
Said it was already...

1355
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,400
10:45 PM.

1356
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,720
He Shaoshuai left.

1357
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,120
He Shaoshuai actually left.

1358
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,280
He said he needed rest from over-treatment.

1359
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,440
Fourth round: He Shaoshuai returned.

1360
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,400
Tuile Gate clock chimed eleven times.

1361
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,160
At 11 PM, Wang Chuanshuo left.

1362
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,200
From 11 PM when Wang Chuanshuo left until 11:30.

1363
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,040
The doctor concluded:

1364
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,520
He Shaoshuai, your memory...

1365
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,000
Could return at any moment.

1366
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:39,760
Any patient...

1367
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,360
Actually during this process...

1368
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,600
You've already recovered.

1369
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,400
But the medicine hasn't taken effect yet.

1370
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,880
My memories haven't returned.

1371
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,920
I haven't remembered anything.

1372
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,240
Is there a possibility

1373
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,120
that before he left

1374
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,280
and after he returned

1375
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,120
he wasn't the same person?

1376
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,560
You're saying between 6pm when he left and 7pm when he came back

1377
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,280
It's possible.

1378
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,840
But if that's the case,

1379
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,560
then the person here at 7pm

1380
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,520
might not have been him, right?

1381
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,400
It's that simple.

1382
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,160
I'll maintain this suspicion.

1383
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,440
This is what I found in that

1384
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,960
hidden layer of Commander He's sofa

1385
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,040
Mysterious buddy

1386
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,240
You've been pushing me

1387
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
to find that Sunflower Woman

1388
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,840
She appeared today

1389
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,680
Turns out she is

1390
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,400
the long-haired witch who's been harassing

1391
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,560
Tui Town residents for nearly a year

1392
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,440
Who exactly is she?

1393
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,080
But don't worry, mysterious buddy

1394
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,320
Now that we know

1395
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,640
Sunflower Woman is the long-haired witch

1396
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,240
I'll definitely find her quickly

1397
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,840
and kill her

1398
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,400
to avenge my singers

1399
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,800
January 30, 1924

1400
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,560
Boss Le

1401
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,000
It's over

1402
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:55,960
Let me tell you

1403
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,280
You are the mysterious one from Tui

1404
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,400
Mysterious buddy

1405
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,360
Where did this letter come from?

1406
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,040
This letter...

1407
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,560
After we finished investigating that day,

1408
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,480
I remembered something.

1409
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,640
When I encountered

1410
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,200
the mysterious person,

1411
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,040
didn't he say I was Jiawei?

1412
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,120
So I decided to find this mysterious person

1413
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,240
to talk about this matter.

1414
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:21,680
So I went

1415
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,720
to the mysterious person's room,

1416
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,120
but didn't see him.

1417
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,560
What time did you go?

1418
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,840
Around 6 o'clock in the evening.

1419
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,280
The words written in that notebook

1420
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,760
were also found by me

1421
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,480
in his room.

1422
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,440
There's another part, why didn't you read it?

1423
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,040
There's another section...

1424
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,240
He's quite familiar with letters.

1425
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,680
If, as Master Le said,

1426
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,520
the sunflower woman

1427
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,040
that is, Ba Duanjin,

1428
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,560
hasn't been killed by Master Le yet,

1429
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,600
then the Ba we met today

1430
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,680
is she Ba Duanjin or Ba Li?

1431
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,200
So you and Ba Duanjin

1432
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,800
look very much alike.

1433
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,640
I probably look very similar to her.

1434
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,040
Then you might actually be Ba Duanjin.

1435
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,240
Also,

1436
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,400
He who seems to remember nothing,

1437
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,900
is he Commander He or He Jiawei?

1438
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,040
If Dilraba and Huang Zongwei

1439
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,360
reveal my secrets

1440
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,440
then my business at Phoenix Nightclub

1441
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,360
won't be able to operate here anymore

1442
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,320
Even if I have to eliminate Dilraba and Huang Zongwei

1443
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,440
together

1444
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,320
I won't hesitate

1445
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,360
Phoenix Nightclub

1446
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,440
wants to kill Huang Zongwei and Dilraba

1447
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,720
But when Phoenix Nightclub saw us today

1448
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,240
they weren't sure

1449
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,160
if we were Huang Zongwei and Dilraba

1450
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,600
so they decided to kill indiscriminately

1451
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,120
These four people

1452
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,160
No matter who you are

1453
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,880
(all must die)

1454
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,960
How ruthless

1455
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,000
This means

1456
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,600
that Huang Zongwei and Dilraba

1457
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,520
know all the truth about Phoenix Nightclub

1458
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,120
Right

1459
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,720
And then

1460
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,040
because the person who invited him out today

1461
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,200
knew he was coming to Phoenix Nightclub

1462
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,240
to do business here

1463
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,400
which means

1464
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,320
you two are highly suspicious

1465
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,720
So now there's a question

1466
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,440
Here's the thing

1467
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,760
She might not be Dilraba

1468
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,520
He might not be Huang Zongwei either

1469
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,280
There are two people with you

1470
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,080
So here's the logic:

1471
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,040
Let's go verify this now.

1472
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,080
All four of us had motives to kill, right?

1473
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,680
You, because...

1474
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,800
you wanted to protect my sister.

1475
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,200
What about you?

1476
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,120
I just saw that blood-written letter.

1477
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,200
The one from Pink Phoenix.

1478
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,080
Right, and you saw this...

1479
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,400
to protect yourself.

1480
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,600
And to protect Bali.

1481
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,720
At this point,

1482
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,120
stop playing the devoted lover role.

1483
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,520
Okay?

1484
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,280
But I am the devoted lover type.

1485
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,120
Very suspicious.

1486
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,360
Very suspicious, Jiawei.

1487
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,200
You're really something.

1488
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,720
Is it possible that...

1489
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,760
you're not Commander He?

1490
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,520
You knew this person...

1491
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,080
knew you might not be Commander He,

1492
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,320
so you killed him to silence him.

1493
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,760
Based on current evidence,

1494
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,200
he had the strongest motive to kill (mystery person).

1495
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,400
Right.

1496
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,000
Most likely.

1497
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,360
Because he might be Jiawei.

1498
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,840
Yes.

1499
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,600
Now she has the same issue.

1500
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,360
Yes, she has the same problem.

1501
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,400
No, I didn't know he wanted to kill me.

1502
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,680
I thought...

1503
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,400
he wanted to kill my savior.

1504
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,040
And he's already killed...

1505
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,160
Bro, I feel like...

1506
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,920
they're working in sequence.

1507
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,520
Breaking down the actions,

1508
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,560
each of us did one part.

1509
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,400
Each did one part - killing,

1510
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,320
tying up,

1511
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,600
then finally resetting the clock.

1512
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,640
This is getting very mysterious.

1513
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,280
Next, we will enter the X confirmation phase

1514
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,560
In this season's program

1515
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,960
Players acting as the murderer

1516
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,920
will all face X's challenge

1517
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,080
If the true murderer player

1518
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,840
succeeds in the challenge

1519
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,960
they can then choose between the two detectives

1520
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,040
to corrupt one of them

1521
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,040
I wish I were X

1522
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,040
Just you wait

1523
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,160
You'll see what I'll do today

1524
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,760
He's over there

1525
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,440
That's so scary

1526
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,400
He looks like he just killed someone

1527
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,920
When he comes out, he'll definitely say he's X

1528
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,080
Hello, X

1529
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:01,800
Did you see that?

1530
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,120
The real X

1531
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,720
They only opened the door a tiny bit.

1532
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,600
Let's go

1533
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,560
Let's go back and discuss first

1534
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,160
Go

1535
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,760
Take this key

1536
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,880
You keep the key

1537
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,560
Move

1538
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,040
Let's go

1539
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,960
Still lying around here?

1540
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,720
Earlier, in this evidence,

1541
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,880
did he find a key?

1542
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,400
Next, we'll go

1543
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,120
check the warehouse

1544
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,360
Let's go then

1545
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:37,840
Come on

1546
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,400
Ke Wuku

1547
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,520
You little killer

1548
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,560
I'm really not

1549
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,760
a killer

1550
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,840
His tactic is

1551
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,400
to attack first,

1552
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,600
then see how the person responds,

1553
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,200
whatever it is.

1554
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,360
He plays mind games.

1555
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,320
Only we rely on logic.

1556
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,200
The final decision is uncertain.

1557
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,320
There's a door here

1558
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,560
It's sealed

1559
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:12,920
Next,

1560
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,240
we're about to open this mysterious passage.

1561
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,160
Of course, before opening it,

1562
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,880
with so many wooden planks,

1563
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,000
let's... uh...

1564
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,440
Brother Bai,

1565
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,000
this season, I'm not in charge of demolition.

1566
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,680
This board is practically useless.

1567
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,160
It's not even nailed properly.

1568
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,200
True.

1569
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:33,960
Let's go.

1570
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:34,840
Come on.

1571
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,480
Here, Brother.

1572
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,200
Your turn now.

1573
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,200
So it's my turn, huh?

1574
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,280
Then I'll do it.

1575
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,280
This building doesn't belong to this era

1576
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,160
Right?

1577
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,280
This definitely

1578
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,120
Modern?

1579
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,840
Very modern?

1580
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:08,960
There's an opening here

1581
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,520
Come here

1582
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,160
Another secret passage

1583
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,160
He's a tank leading the way

1584
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,160
We'll just

1585
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,240
go all out

1586
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,040
The tall ones are tricky

1587
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,960
I can dodge them

1588
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,200
There might be someone below

1589
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,920
Below

1590
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,560
might be someone

1591
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,600
No one

1592
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,080
Don't mess around

1593
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,440
Push Lao Hui's room

1594
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:44,880
Did you see Push Lao Hui?

1595
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,600
Isn't it written here?

1596
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,200
Push Lao Hui

1597
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,680
Right

1598
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,640
You remember now, don't you, Bali?

1599
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,640
Yes.

1600
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,880
Which means...

1601
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,200
This place is called "Push Lao Hui."

1602
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,000
Because this door...

1603
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
has no handle.

1604
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,760
So she can't get out.

1605
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,520
Meaning she's trapped.

1606
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,760
Seriously...

1607
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,000
Let's search the place first,

1608
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,280
alright?

1609
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,120
We'll do a quick search.

1610
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,080
Here's a diary

1611
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,200
This is a journal

1612
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,320
You

1613
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,760
February 5th

1614
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,720
I met a fairy at Tui Health

1615
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,520
What's wrong?

1616
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,440
Yes

1617
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,760
It's you, right?

1618
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,040
This diary

1619
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,400
I had someone bring over the costumes I've worn

1620
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,080
All of them

1621
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,680
Tried them on one by one to show her

1622
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,400
I decided to be her muse

1623
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,040
And encouraged her to start a brand

1624
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,840
Then after a while, someone came

1625
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,240
He was wearing a mask

1626
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,640
He didn't tell me his name either

1627
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,120
He brought me some

1628
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:05,760
Exceptionally beautiful

1629
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,680
Clothes I've never seen before

1630
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,680
For the first three days I actually took notes

1631
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,920
I listened to what that person told me

1632
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,640
About how to grow and strengthen my brand

1633
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,760
It was written by a man

1634
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,080
The one I met at that time

1635
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,280
That man wrote it

1636
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,800
Who is that man?

1637
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,720
This man

1638
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,400
Let me tell you

1639
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,320
The man is that, uh

1640
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,920
Called Jiawei

1641
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,280
Do you know who this man is?

1642
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:25,840
I don't know

1643
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,480
Is it you?

1644
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:26,920
I don't know

1645
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,440
How can you not know?

1646
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,680
How would he know?

1647
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,640
How can you not know?

1648
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,480
Isn't that the one wearing a mask?

1649
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,960
You mean the guy with the mask on?

1650
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,560
Is it really him?

1651
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,560
Bro, I can't cover for you this time.

1652
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,720
How can you not know?

1653
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,200
It's you.

1654
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,000
There's more written on the back.

1655
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,680
Jiawei

1656
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,160
You must wear your mask properly here

1657
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,960
to avoid causing a commotion

1658
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
And take this

1659
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,360
This is my necklace.

1660
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,240
Yes.

1661
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,440
Pervert.

1662
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,800
What are you doing?

1663
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,920
You pervert.

1664
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,120
What do you want?

1665
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,280
You disgusting creep.

1666
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,560
I was right to hit you with that stick.

1667
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:17,800
Talk.

1668
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,800
That's right.

1669
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,760
It was you, Wei.

1670
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,520
Are you the one who pushed the mysterious assistant?

1671
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,160
I don't know.

1672
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,600
Then what do you know?

1673
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,920
There's a question at hand.

1674
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,520
You see,

1675
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,520
February 5th,

1676
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,480
I met a fairy at Tui Jiankang.

1677
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,120
She was wearing a qipao,

1678
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:39,960
sitting quietly in a

1679
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,240
retro-style room.

1680
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,680
What kind of person would say

1681
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,120
"this room is retro"?

1682
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,200
Modern people.

1683
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:46,720
Exactly.

1684
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,160
Does this logic hold?

1685
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,120
To say your design is retro,

1686
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,000
but you're designing what's most trendy.

1687
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,480
Right.

1688
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,000
Because you're from this era.

1689
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,560
I had someone bring all the costumes

1690
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,200
I've worn before.

1691
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,640
I tried them on one by one to show her.

1692
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,440
She specifically adjusted

1693
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,960
the costumes - she's also an actress.

1694
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,720
Possibly.

1695
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,280
Yes.

1696
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,680
Then here,

1697
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,200
the fairy disappeared.

1698
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,480
Tui Jiankang staff said

1699
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,480
no such person exists.

1700
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:08,960
You're actually

1701
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,760
the version of you he saw

1702
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,800
doesn't exist in this era.

1703
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,120
And didn't exist in his era either.

1704
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,960
So this is Tui Jiankang.

1705
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,240
I returned to Tui Jiankang again

1706
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,680
and discovered

1707
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,440
that going up the stairs

1708
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,240
from the retro room

1709
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,440
might lead to some

1710
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,280
unknown place.

1711
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,000
Namely, that place earlier.

1712
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,040
Returning to our era again.

1713
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,160
Is it possible that

1714
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,160
this Tui Laohui

1715
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,120
is sending our people

1716
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,720
to the modern era?

1717
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,240
In that small photo just now,

1718
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:42,760
that person

1719
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,520
was together with him in this photo,

1720
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,120
right?

1721
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,680
This...

1722
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,000
Yes, together.

1723
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,840
My necklace...

1724
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,880
which means

1725
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,960
the person who wrote this diary

1726
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,400
might be Jiawei.

1727
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,080
Exactly.

1728
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,560
Or it might be him.

1729
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,040
He might actually be Jiawei.

1730
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,280
He's not from this era.

1731
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,040
Right.

1732
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,240
That's why his memories are confused.

1733
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,040
Correct.

1734
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,080
Good.

1735
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,360
We've finished deducing this part.

1736
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,600
Is there anything else you need to confess?

1737
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,080
I'm not Jiawei.

1738
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,800
Then who are you?

1739
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,320
I'm Marshal He.

1740
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,680
You're lying.

1741
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,080
Still being stubborn, huh?

1742
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,560
You've already regained your memories.

1743
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,720
What else can you say?

1744
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,720
You've definitely regained your memories.

1745
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,000
Is it time for torture now?

1746
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,200
Come on, tie him up.

1747
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,760
Come on.

1748
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,200
Hurry up.

1749
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:22,400
Come on.

1750
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:22,640
Tie him to the bed.

1751
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,400
Tie him up.

1752
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,000
Tie him.

1753
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,680
Little brother.

1754
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,560
Nobody touches him.

1755
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,120
Next,

1756
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,480
let's search for more clues.

1757
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:32,920
Alright?

1758
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,000
Wait a minute

1759
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:43,920
There's writing underneath

1760
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,080
There's writing under the bed

1761
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,360
There's writing under the bed

1762
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,160
Could it say 15 by 15?

1763
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,480
Pull the mattress off

1764
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Makes sense

1765
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,880
Careful, get out

1766
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,640
Let's take this out

1767
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,200
You guys move it

1768
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,560
Come on, just drag it out

1769
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,400
Okay, let's go

1770
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:04,880
Can you drag it?

1771
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,240
Is it easy for you to drag?

1772
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,120
I can drag it

1773
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,440
What's so hard about dragging this?

1774
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,520
This is super easy to drag

1775
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,400
You're too strong

1776
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,720
Way too strong

1777
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,840
Slow down

1778
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,880
1, 2, 3, lift

1779
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,760
Every night I hear

1780
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,160
a terrifying woman's voice

1781
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,360
screaming

1782
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,480
We moved into this luxurious room

1783
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,960
but only death awaits us

1784
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,600
There's a demon

1785
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,480
Never leave through the stained glass

1786
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,440
door

1787
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,200
Leaving through this door means death

1788
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,160
Wait a moment

1789
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,760
There's so much hair down here now

1790
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,080
This hair loss is worse than mine

1791
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,520
So terrifying

1792
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,840
Seriously

1793
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,240
So what's behind that door

1794
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,120
What could it be?

1795
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,480
It must be the gate to a new world

1796
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,000
What's the meaning of this photo?

1797
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,840
This photo should have a

1798
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,880
As I mentioned earlier, it should

1799
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,720
The room in this photo

1800
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,600
should be different from

1801
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,520
the room we're currently in

1802
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,880
in some aspects

1803
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,360
But now you can't tell anymore

1804
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,840
Everything's already messed up

1805
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,200
Let's look for other things

1806
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,040
Alright?

1807
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,120
Jiawei

1808
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,160
answered instinctively

1809
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,920
He answered instinctively

1810
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,720
So that's how it works

1811
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,160
Here

1812
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,360
Put your fairy necklace around your neck

1813
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,640
This belongs to you

1814
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,920
Belongs to you

1815
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,760
The lovesick persona is established

1816
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,480
Jiawei

1817
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,720
There are two bracelets

1818
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,160
And a jade necklace

1819
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,320
Are the jewelry pieces the same as above?

1820
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:07,840
Take a look

1821
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,400
Maybe if we arrange the jewelry correctly

1822
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,560
that door will

1823
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,760
This one's different

1824
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:18,880
Which one?

1825
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:19,880
The teapot

1826
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,160
One of the things here

1827
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,120
Where's that bowl?

1828
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,640
Is it this one?

1829
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:31,920
Seems like it

1830
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,240
Wait a second

1831
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,800
It's nothing

1832
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,480
So exciting

1833
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,920
Can that door be opened now?

1834
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,640
No, let me move forward a bit

1835
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,400
This...

1836
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,080
Come on

1837
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,720
Sorry about that

1838
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,320
This door is...

1839
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
The door's open

1840
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,160
What are you guys doing?

1841
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,400
The door opened

1842
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,640
No, where are you guys?

1843
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,400
Where is the light?

1844
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,320
Where is this?

1845
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:23,960
What is this thing?

1846
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,760
Where is this place?

1847
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,400
Artificial human

1848
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,880
Where is this place?

1849
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,920
It's possible we're artificial humans.

1850
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,520
This is...

1851
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,520
Harvesting organs.

1852
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,160
Removing the right kidney.

1853
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,080
Tui Shenmi wants to take the organs.

1854
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,960
You are...

1855
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,840
Jiawei, right?

1856
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,320
You went missing before.

1857
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,200
Why did you disappear?

1858
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,080
Ke Shaoshuai's whereabouts are unknown.

1859
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,800
We just don't know when he died.

1860
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,000
She's your great-granddaughter.

1861
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,560
She's actively involved in medical work.

1862
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,680
She came to save me.

1863
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,640
Bai Youcai.

1864
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,760
You've lived all these years.

1865
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,440
Tui Shenmi.

1866
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,120
Call you grandfather.

1867
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,920
Death is too good for you.

1868
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,680
What is this?

1869
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,200
As long as we're alive, there's hope.

1870
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,680
That means back then we...

1871
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,000
The person we remembered in our hearts...

1872
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,120
Was Ba Duanjin.

1873
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,080
Where exactly are you?

1874
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,880
Dead or alive?

1875
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,200
I'll make Tui Shenmi pay for this.

1876
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,080
Pink Phoenix.

1877
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,000
This is too terrifying.

1878
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,080
The Long-haired Witch had motive to kill Tui Shenmi.

1879
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,480
Everyone wanted to kill him.

1880
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,680
I was protecting Ba Li.

1881
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,720
To avenge Ba Duanjin.

1882
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,920
Both of us were protecting my sister.

1883
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,760
The only possibility...

1884
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,840
Is Ba Duanjin.

1885
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,800
Are you Ba Li or Ba Duanjin?

1886
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,000
I really am Ba Li.

1887
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,840
And what about Jiawei?

1888
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:37,440
Brother.

1889
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,320
I really don't remember.

1890
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,400
You're lying.

1891
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,480
So it must be him.
