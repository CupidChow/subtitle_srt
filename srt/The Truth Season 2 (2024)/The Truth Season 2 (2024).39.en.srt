1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,440
Welcome everyone to this event sponsored by all our bulldozers

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,320
the strongly supported "Let's Push It! X"

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,440
I am Cui Shaoyang

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,440
Tui Zhen Art Academy

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,920
The three-day anniversary celebration

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,880
is about to come to an end

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,360
During the closing event

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,880
the Tui Yi Basketball Friendship Match

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,840
the award presenter Ba Zimei

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,760
failed to show up

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,600
Who would have thought

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,200
that an incident would occur in the library exhibition hall

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,560
With the help of X He Dinghong

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,040
the culprit Ke Daole managed to escape

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,720
Now, let us all

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,560
"Let's Push It! X"

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,680
Guess the idiom, right?

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
One minute timer.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,680
What does this mean?

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,280
What's going on here?

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,320
What are we supposed to do?

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,240
Okay, ready, start.

23
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,120
Square turtle round pig.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,080
Proper pig farming.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
Compass, drawing a pig with a compass.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,760
This is so hard.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,960
Turtle round pig.

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,440
Longan pig.

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,800
Longan distant pig.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,720
Turtle round bead.

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
Punish even from afar.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,160
Return to the rightful owner.

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,640
Terrible.

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,440
Awful.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,640
You think I'm a fool, huh?

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,040
No, you're completely...

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,400
Playing with my intelligence.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,080
No one can't answer it.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,280
Superb craftsmanship.

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,840
Today there must be X.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Pen.

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,760
Notebook.

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,640
Clip.

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,160
Clip.

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,360
Single-handedly.

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,760
Hurtful words.

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I am just...

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,920
Confirmed X then.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
Music, chess, calligraphy, painting.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
Right.

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,440
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

53
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,600
I give up. I don't even know how to proceed now.

54
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,480
X

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,320
How to manage expressions

56
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,280
Only one—it must be you

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,600
Won't give me an identity

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,720
This is a bit unusual, isn't it?

59
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,000
This is so abnormal

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,560
This isn't just a little abnormal

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,600
No matter how I look at it, it's abnormal

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,280
No, now I'm asking you

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,760
Look into my eyes

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
Did you draw X just now?

65
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,680
Yes, I did

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,720
Alright, let's play this round openly

67
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,440
Okay

68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,920
That's rough

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,680
You're X

70
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,280
Yes

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,480
If that's the case

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,440
If he's lying to us

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,720
Then he's not a competent investigator

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,680
You're the only investigator

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,960
Even if you're X

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,040
You should still help the good side

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,720
That's right

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
Fine, keep manipulating me

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,840
It's fine

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,360
You can't betray your profession

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,160
You're the investigator now

82
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,800
You're the justice bringer

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,320
Hedinghong, you're having it rough

84
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,720
Detective, have you finished thinking?

85
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,040
Speak.

86
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,600
Take charge.

87
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,720
I was thinking if we can rotate while pushing.

88
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,320
You clearly didn’t pay attention.

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,880
Who are you helping escape?

90
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,320
I’m not helping anyone escape.

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,480
Just say which of us three fits.

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,400
You fit the most.

93
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,800
You’re acting too suspicious.

94
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
Fine.

95
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
That’s right, it’s me.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
Are you X?

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
Is everything once again within your

98
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,040
calculations?

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,760
Are you X?

100
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,360
Do you actually have an identity right now?

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,720
I am X.

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,200
Wait a minute.

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
Look into my eyes and tell me.

104
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
Do you have an identity today?

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,480
I am X.

106
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,360
Then who do you think it is now?

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,880
I'm telling you, it must be him.

108
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,520
I've already locked it.

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,520
Why protect him? No need anymore.

110
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,440
Too late now.

111
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,840
You should've acted sooner.

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,240
Starting now, count six times.

113
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,680
One.

114
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,640
Two.

115
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Three.

116
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,240
Eliminate.

117
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
Four.

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Five.

119
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,800
Six. Return.

120
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Good, so this is sufficient.

121
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,640
D to F.

122
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,040
One, two, three, four, five, six - got it.

123
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,480
Next we'll calculate C.

124
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,120
Same. One, two, three - eliminate.

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,800
One, two... fifth time.

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,280
Now calculate E. Starting E.

127
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
Once. Twice. Thrice.

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,520
Fourth. Fifth. Sixth.

129
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,040
Seven - exceeded count for E.

130
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,160
I've been eliminated.

131
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
The route starting from F.

132
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,040
This is the law of all things.

133
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Must proceed exactly like this.

134
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
Because he must reach A.

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,800
This is the shortest path.

136
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
He can't possibly detour like this.

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,160
In that case...

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,120
When he circles back to A...

139
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,480
He'll have no moves left.

140
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,720
So this is certain.

141
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
Therefore what we must watch...

142
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
is actually the return from A.

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
Each person's room movements.

144
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,680
After noting these movements...

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,360
Only CD and F can return.

146
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,560
My brother - whenever he finds a clue...

147
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,440
He thinks "I've got an idea"...

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,560
and immediately voices it.

149
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
As for Ke Daole...

150
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,160
Could be me.

151
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,240
All three of us are possible.

152
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,760
He too - he can't possibly escape.

153
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,640
X never expected

154
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,760
We actually have another little math genius

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,720
You've met your match

156
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,280
You've hit a steel plate

157
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,040
You've hit a steel plate

158
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,920
Who do you think it is?

159
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,880
Actually, I think...

160
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,520
It's him.

161
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's just go with our instincts.

162
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,000
In my opinion,

163
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
he can also be ruled out.

164
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,880
Why?

165
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,760
Because he is F.

166
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,440
He's better than us

167
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,360
at the simplest way to kill.

168
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,520
But all of us have to get to F.

169
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Yet you eliminate him,

170
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,560
which makes you more suspicious.

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,600
If he can do it,

172
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,680
he's disrupting things.

173
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,560
No, I think you're the one disrupting things.

174
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,520
You're the one causing chaos.

175
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm certain I'm not

176
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,920
But he's the most likely one

177
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,880
Because he is F

178
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,080
But if he's F, it would be too obvious

179
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,160
So it must be him

180
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,760
Fine, it's me

181
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,520
He's been agreeing all along

182
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,920
Then I'm C

183
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,160
Am I more likely to kill than F?

184
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,200
What if we reconsider?

185
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,320
No

186
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,600
Because you can't be F

187
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
I understand what you mean

188
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,800
F's murder motive

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
and method are too straightforward

190
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
If as the killer

191
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,600
you should actually be in a position like C

192
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,960
And you shouldn't put yourself

193
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,520
in E, the safest position

194
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,840
Right

195
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,000
Psychologically speaking, this makes sense

196
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,040
Yes

197
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,600
I don't think this works

198
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,280
This is too simple

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,000
Your evidence is too obvious now

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
What's the difference between us?

201
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,600
Is there any difference between us?

202
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Any of our three rooms

203
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
would work

204
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,360
All could commit murder

205
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
Right

206
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,440
Old Bai, you've really lost today

207
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
You're acting too strange today

208
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,280
Really unusual, I'm telling you

209
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,560
To me, it's one of you two

210
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,600
You both know who the killer is

211
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,920
For me, it's you

212
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,440
Between us, one must know

213
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,040
they're innocent

214
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,200
Between us, one must be the wolf

215
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,760
I am this round's X

216
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
I voted for Ning Hao

217
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,200
There's no other reason

218
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,240
It's simply because Bai Yang voted for Ning Hao

219
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,800
Today, my suspect is Ning Hao

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,760
Prime suspect: Ning Hao

221
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,400
For this case, my prime suspect is Ning Hao

222
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,160
Voted for Ke Daole

223
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,800
Failed to identify the true culprit this round

224
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,800
The real culprit is

225
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,680
Ke Daole

226
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,120
I have to say

227
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
We have some chemistry, don't we?

228
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
That's amazing

229
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,320
We really do have some chemistry

230
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
It's you two again

231
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
He got away

232
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,960
Whose fault is it?

233
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
Let's hug

234
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,280
When Ning Hao started targeting me,

235
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,160
I knew something was wrong.

236
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,800
Because he was clashing with Bai Yang.

237
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,960
If he pushed me out,

238
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,120
Bai Yang would have to target him.

239
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,840
So at that moment,

240
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,040
I felt things were already off.

241
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
I actually started pacing back and forth.

242
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,200
You know what?

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,240
If Ning Hao had just five to ten more minutes,

244
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,920
her intuition would have kicked in.

245
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,600
The only time she panicked—

246
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,680
was when her intuition started working.

247
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,640
But what’s the use?

248
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,040
Still got caught by this—

249
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,080
I realized this *Start Guessing 2*

250
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,960
is the biggest "poisonous bug" of all.

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,320
I also know it wasn't me

252
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,520
Then who was it?

253
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,000
It's the person we all know

254
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,560
I don't know why you

255
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,280
still suspect me in the end

256
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
I don't know

257
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,800
Look at my condition later

258
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,280
His condition was normal too

259
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,800
We were both murderers at the same time

260
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,080
I roughly knew his condition

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
He was deducing normally too

262
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,800
But later I

263
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,560
Actually during the early escape room phase

264
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,520
When you were discussing that door

265
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,640
I was completely confused

266
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,840
It's good that you were confused at that part

267
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
You know?

268
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,960
Most importantly you protected him

269
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,120
I protected him normally

270
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,640
Let me tell you

271
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
You realized that point

272
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,200
I think you're really amazing

273
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,160
He protected me

274
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,800
This episode's Kedao Le designed an ingenious trap

275
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,840
How did he methodically carry out the crime?

276
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,080
What is the truth of the story?

277
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,560
I'm Xiao Dong

278
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,440
Ever since I was cursed to become invisible

279
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,160
No one can see me anymore

280
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Gradually, they all forgot about my existence

281
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,160
And I can't leave the school grounds

282
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,440
I've been desperate to break this curse

283
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Until I saw

284
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,480
the message in that drifting bottle

285
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,920
I need to eliminate the source of bullying in this school

286
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
June 4th

287
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,320
Canary killed Rui Sisi using the method I provided

288
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,840
But the curse on me still wasn't lifted

289
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,040
They found Rui Sisi's locked box

290
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,280
Later, I secretly found a way to open it

291
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,760
Only then did I discover the true source of the bullying

292
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
It was actually Ba Zimei

293
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,800
The bullying won't stop, the curse won't break

294
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,160
So the person I need to kill is Ba Zimei

295
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,320
When she dies, the curse on me will be lifted

296
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,960
But as an invisible person,

297
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,480
I can't harm others directly.

298
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,320
I need to find someone to do this for me.

299
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,920
My first choice was Bai Yangzuo.

300
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,520
He was my classmate.

301
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,120
Because his cousin Hu Jie was secretly manipulated by Ba Zimei,

302
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,480
making him rank last in this year's Talent Star competition,

303
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,960
and facing a year of complete neglect.

304
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,720
This became the last straw for Hu Jie.

305
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,040
So I secretly gave him Hu Jie's belongings

306
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,960
and that Ruisibai's box.

307
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,000
As long as he saw them,

308
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,280
he would surely want to kill Ba Zimei.

309
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,120
And naturally cooperate with me.

310
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
But unexpectedly,

311
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,880
he kept wandering outside campus

312
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,160
and never returned.

313
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,960
As time was running out,

314
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,880
I needed a backup plan.

315
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,480
Those three cursed individuals -

316
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,720
Canary, Ning Hao, and Ke Daole.

317
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
I first ruled out Canary,

318
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,560
since there's no telling

319
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,800
when her identity might change.

320
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,520
Too unpredictable.

321
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,000
I set my new targets

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,160
on Ning Hao and Ke Daole.

323
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,440
First I forged a document called "Secrets of Talent Legends"

324
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,320
mentioning how to lift the curse.

325
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,280
Then I specifically went to Ba Zimei's dorm

326
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,360
and left a note using Ba Group's special stationery

327
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,040
with Ruisibai's QQ account and password.

328
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,640
Then I took that staged photo from their dorm

329
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,520
that clearly showed Ba Zimei's uniform

330
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,440
and the script for "Swan Lake Talent Show,"

331
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,960
and uploaded it to the Talent Legends section of Talent Empire.

332
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,720
I knew Ning Hao and Ke Daole

333
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
frequented the dark web.

334
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,880
Once they logged in,

335
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,360
they'd immediately see the post

336
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,120
and would logically conclude

337
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,960
that Ba Zimei was the one who cursed them.

338
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,840
And that killing her would lift the curse.

339
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,440
Ning Hao was the first to discover the truth.

340
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,240
Then Ke Daole also targeted Ba Zimei.

341
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,480
with murderous intent.

342
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,280
But due to Ning Hao's curse,

343
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,000
wounds would split open randomly,

344
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,320
the unbearable pain and excessive bleeding hindered the act.

345
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,080
So between the two,

346
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,560
I chose the one with more stable

347
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
curse symptoms—Ke Daole.

348
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,640
I am Ke Daole

349
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,680
June 4th

350
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
After the case of Rui Siba ended

351
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,080
I still couldn’t let go of the curse

352
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,280
It weighed heavily on my mind

353
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,160
I logged onto the dark web

354
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
Following the photos from an anonymous post

355
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,400
I went to Rui Siba and Ba Zimei’s dorm room

356
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,040
And that’s how I discovered the one who truly cursed me

357
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,680
The person who turned me into a pig-headed monster was Ba Zimei

358
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
And the way to lift the curse

359
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,600
Was to kill the one who cast it on me

360
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,720
So I had to kill Ba Zimei

361
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,040
Just as I returned to my dorm room,

362
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,080
while pondering how to kill Ba Zimei,

363
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,360
someone slipped a piece of paper under my door.

364
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,240
It was from a mysterious person

365
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,400
who claimed to know about my plan to kill Ba Zimei.

366
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,840
If I cooperated with them,

367
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,320
they could provide me with a detailed plan.

368
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,880
Naturally, I agreed.

369
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,280
So, this mysterious person and I

370
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,000
without ever meeting face-to-face,

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
finalized the murder plan through notes slipped under the door.

372
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,760
By utilizing the upcoming event starting at midnight,

373
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
the Tuiyi Mysterious Art Exhibition,

374
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,920
the mysterious person told me

375
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,680
the entire process of the art exhibition

376
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,400
as well as the floor plan and basic layout of the exhibition hall

377
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,160
He also told me

378
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,920
how to control the rotation of the revolving doors inside

379
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,240
At midnight, everyone gathered at the exhibition hall

380
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,320
Before it began, everyone would be in the exhibition corridor

381
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,000
according to the order they signed up for the exhibition

382
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,320
Those ranked third to sixth would draw lots

383
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,440
The top two who registered

384
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,240
namely Ba Zimei and He Dinghong,

385
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,920
were automatically assigned to Hall A and Hall B

386
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
According to the plan between me and the mysterious person

387
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,960
that we had arranged beforehand,

388
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,200
I absolutely must not draw Hall E

389
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,360
The mysterious person said he had a way to make it happen

390
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,360
Using my identity as an invisible person,

391
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,480
when the first person, Canary, was drawing lots,

392
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,560
I stuffed four E balls into her lottery box

393
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,880
This ensured that the first person to draw

394
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,480
would directly draw Hall E where no crime could occur

395
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,800
Then I used the staff area

396
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,520
to access the back of the lottery box

397
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,800
and replace the remaining three E balls

398
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,240
with C, D, and F balls

399
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,760
This way, Halls C, D, and F

400
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,400
would be randomly drawn by Ke Daole

401
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
He drew Hall F

402
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,520
Then everyone entered their assigned halls

403
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,960
in order from A to F

404
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,720
After Ba Zimei left the corridor and entered her hall,

405
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,240
I immediately came out through the staff door

406
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,040
Using my invisible identity,

407
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,000
I followed Ba Zimei into Hall A

408
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,120
After everyone arrived,

409
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,080
the audio guide announced all hall doors were closing

410
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,840
All members present

411
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,560
All exhibition hall doors are now closed

412
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,840
Students in previous rooms

413
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,480
Before the doors are fully locked,

414
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,280
you will not be able to return

415
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,960
The exhibition experience officially began that night.

416
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
The mysterious person had told me in advance

417
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,880
that during the exhibition

418
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,240
there would be a prolonged blackout period.

419
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,520
I planned to use this darkness

420
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,800
to kill Ba Zimei.

421
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
When the lights went out,

422
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,920
I quickly used the fingerprint scanner in Hall F

423
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,480
to authenticate my identity.

424
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,560
All exhibition hall doors unlocked.

425
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,280
Doors between Halls A to F became bidirectional passages.

426
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,440
However, all doors

427
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
could only open/close freely six times total.

428
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,120
After six operations, all doors would lock

429
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,280
and only reopen via door access buttons.

430
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,600
Then I rotated the dolls in the halls

431
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,040
to make walls between Halls C/D/E/F rotate 90 degrees.

432
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,320
This allowed me to move from Hall F

433
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,000
directly to Hall C,

434
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,800
then from C to B,

435
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,440
finally entering Hall A.

436
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,360
Moving stealthily,

437
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,560
I pulled the knife embedded in Hall A's doll.

438
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
In the darkness,

439
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,840
I stabbed

440
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,960
Ba Zimei standing by the central cabinet.

441
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,720
Then stuffed both body and knife

442
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,280
into the hall's central cabinet.

443
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,880
As long as the knife remained inserted,

444
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,400
no blood would spray out.

445
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,560
After completing everything,

446
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,640
Then I took advantage of the darkness to move from Exhibition Hall A through Hall B

447
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Hall C

448
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,280
and returned to my own Hall F

449
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,800
just as I used up all six free passes through doors

450
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,080
After returning to the room

451
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
I rotated the doll again

452
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
to reset the central revolving wall

453
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,760
Shortly after returning to my exhibition hall

454
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,640
the candles in the hall suddenly lit themselves

455
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,120
The guide's voice asked everyone to blow out the candles before them

456
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Please blow out the candles in front of you

457
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,680
Remove the knife from the doll

458
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,400
Then the museum lights came on

459
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,640
signaling the end of the exhibition experience

460
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,200
Next the guide asked everyone

461
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,560
to simultaneously press the button

462
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,640
on the door to the next hall to unlock it

463
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
I knew that at this moment

464
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
the mysterious person cooperating with me

465
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,800
using his method

466
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
would press the button between Halls A and B

467
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,360
on behalf of the deceased Ba Zimei

468
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
As I was in the final hall

469
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,040
I didn't need to press any buttons

470
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,480
I pressed the button between Halls A and B

471
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
on behalf of the deceased Ba Zimei

472
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,800
so the people in Hall B could exit

473
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,040
Following the guide's instructions

474
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,680
everyone left in the order of Halls A B C D E F

475
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,440
one after another

476
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,720
though of course no one would leave from Hall A

477
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,480
I was the last one to exit the exhibition hall

478
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
Xiao Ba, something happened to Xiao Ba!

479
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
Is anyone there?

480
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,160
Is anyone there?

481
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,360
Thank you, dear audience

482
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,760
for watching this episode of *Let's Push It! X*

483
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,240
To find out what happens next

484
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,160
stay tuned for Shaoyang's breakdown next time

485
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
Same time next week—don't miss it!

486
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,240
Goodbye
