LET'S FIGHT FOR
THE THREE BASIC LABOR RIGHTS!

FREE PRESS - WE DEMAND FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS

00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,121
It's a mess in here! [laughs]

00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,127
[sighs]

6
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,255
My apologies. For surprising you.

7
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,299
I was shocked, honestly.

8
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,845
When Ju-ae told me
that <i>you </i>would be coming over… I'm, uh,

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,015
kind of a big fan! [laughs]

10
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,642
- [inhales deeply]
- Well, I've heard about <i>you</i>.

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,686
I did quite a bit of research

12
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,773
into what kind of work you're doing here.

13
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,942
I've read your papers too.
As many as possible.

14
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,781
And in doing so, I got the impression that

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,868
you'd be willing to assist
in airing some dirty laundry.

16
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,370
[gentle music playing]

17
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>Noona,</i>

18
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,395
congrats are in order.

19
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,732
This place will have to do.

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,277
And for what?

21
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,904
Huh?

22
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,906
Congrats for what?

23
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,825
Oh, <i>noona.</i>

24
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,536
You're winning
the Best Supporting Actress this year.

25
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,080
And so they asked that you be there.

26
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,721
[music fades]

27
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,270
I didn't mean
you had to come all this way.

28
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,689
Just that we'd catch up
when I was in Seoul.

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,695
Well, I came here 'cause I had somethin'
to tell you. You're not busy, are you?

30
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,697
Not remotely.

31
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,658
Been taking a nice break.

32
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,786
Since I had to get dental work done,

33
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,455
I took that time to touch up the script.

34
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,419
I saw your <i>Aema </i>picture.

35
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,463
It was total shit.

36
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,050
It was.

37
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,553
Jung-ho ruined it as usual?

38
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,349
Despite his terrible edits,
you still came out looking good

39
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,767
and did the best you could.

40
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,770
You were fearless
in the way you approached it.

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,192
Even while surrounded by mediocrity,
you didn't stoop to their level.

42
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,486
I've always had an appreciation
for your work.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,071
Now I respect you more.

44
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
That's why I asked to see you.

00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,314

<i>I mean, just picture it, it's genius!</i>

53
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,484
<i>There are so many elementary</i>
<i>and middle schools in the area.</i>

54
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,528

56
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,076

57

60
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,211
<i>Oh, hey, Ju-ae, uh,</i>
<i>don't you kinda have a decent living now?</i>

61
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,380
Mm. I'll give you money.

00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,341

63
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,719

00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,056
<i>All right, I'll get Dad on the line.</i>

66
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,059

<i>Stay right there.</i>

[man] <i>"Okay?" C'mon, Dad! Jeez…</i>

71
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,404
Your office is all new and shiny.

72
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,074
It even smells different in here.

73
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,665
Congratulations.
Isn't it nice, rollin' in the dough?

74
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,543
Do me a favor.

75
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,503
Have a tail put on Hee-ran.

76
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,047
Jeez, you're tenacious.

77
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,467
Now you're gonna stalk
the poor woman? [laughs]

78
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,973
This exclusivity agreement of yours
has been sucking that girl dry for years.

79
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,141
Why not just let her go?

80
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,602
Look, you've made all this money
off of her. Isn't that enough?

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,565
No, this is about Mi-na.

82
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,777
Her death must've had
a big impact on Hee-ran.

83
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,822
She had this weird, determined look
I've never seen.

84
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,282
[ominous music playing]

85
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,617
Implied she was gonna blow the lid off
this whole thing

86
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,411
and take me down with her.

87
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,791
And if she blabs about the banquets,
that'll be a problem for you as well.

88
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,836
[apprehensive music playing]

89
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,964
That would be dumb.

90
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,760
'Cause out of all of us involved,
she has way more on the line.

91
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,846
I'm sure she knows it too.

92
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,266
You're forgetting Jeong Hee-ran is insane.

93
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,227
Tail her.

94
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,525

[cork popping]

97
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,036
[Jung-ho] So, uh, a little birdie told me

98
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,956
that Jeong Hee-ran's set to receive
the Best Supporting Actress Award.

99
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,252
Yup, that's right. Speaking of which,
you owe me, Mr. President.

100
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,797
<i>Madame Aema </i>will win twice.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
With Jeong Hee-ran and Shin Ju-ae.

102
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,803
And as for Ju-ae, I'd appreciate
being able to break it to her.

103
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,721
Y'know, about her winning.

104
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,473
So mum's the word.

105
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,767
[laughing]

106
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,311
I'm a massive <i>Madame Aema </i>fan!

107
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,898
So I pulled some strings
to make all this possible.

108
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,734
A way to say thanks for all the boners!

109
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,695
Hee-ran doesn't need another award.

110
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,907
Let someone else win.

111
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,618
She's won so many times
I've lost count now.

112
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,288
And she's not humble anymore.
She's really let the fame inflate her ego.

113
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,419
She needs a reality check,
and if she were to win another award now,

114
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,713
I'm worried her ego
might get outta control.

115
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:07,301
I go outta my way to help you out,
and this is the thanks I get?

116
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,845
Did you fight with her?

117
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,557
Even for you, c'mon…
this is petty. [laughs]

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,809
[Jung-ho] Well, you know… [chuckles]

119
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,149
That's only because I made her.
I gave that woman her entire career.

120
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:26,320
In my opinion, it'll be healthy for her
to just sit in the audience.

121
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,030
I'd say even quite humbling.

122
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,826
She doesn't need to give a speech
to those who adore her.

123
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,203
Make sure she doesn't get up there
with a microphone.

124
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,874
Not only would losing take her down a peg

125
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,376
but I'd find it incredibly entertaining.

126
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,256
You'll get your Ju-ae interview on Friday.

127
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,758
I'll make sure she's free all day.

128
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,470
So you can do whatever you want.

129
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,014
[Jae-geon] Do whatever I want?

130
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,727
So "whatever" means… whatever?

131
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,439
Well, when you put it that way…

132
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,030

Who are you two?

143

Whoever you are, you got some nerve
breaking into a guy's home!

144
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,231
Get out right now!

145
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,027
What?! What's <i>your </i>problem?
Are you people deaf?

146
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,488
Don't interrupt someone during dinner!

[relaxing music playing in restaurant]

148
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,250
I'll ask just once.

149
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,753
Do I look like a thug?

150
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,380
One who takes bribes from people

151
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,259
and then skims funds
off the top of that dirty money?

152
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,886
[inhales deeply]

153
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,512
Listen, man,

154
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,807
this industry can be like that,
that's for sure.

155
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,935
But I've always done my best
to not cross that line

156
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,813
into becoming
nothing more than a no-good gangster.

157
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,900
<i>You </i>jumped right over it.

158
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,070
Who decides where those lines
should be drawn?

159
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,989
'Cause the world's full
of powerful individuals

160

Like the banquets
those poor girls get sent to.

163

I know that wasn't the first one.

164
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,297
They've been going on
for a while now, haven't they?

165
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,802
And you know all about it, Mr. Gi.

166
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,137
Yet you talk to me about lines.

167
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,764
Huh?

168
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,018
Don't lecture me
when you're such a hypocrite.

169
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,230
'Cause then you'll <i>really </i>look

I know I'm the last person
with the right to be lecturing you,

173
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,035
so here's what my supervisor told me
when <i>I </i>got fired.

174
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,290
Thanks for your hard work.

175
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,502
Now, don't you ever come back.

176
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,136
[sighs]

177
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,557
[hypnotic music fades in]

178
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,111
- [Jae-geon sighs] God, it's dark.
- [switch clicks]

179
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,738
Huh? Oh, was that it?

180
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,490
Oh, it's on now. Hmm?

181
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,910
Whoa!

182
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,663
It's Little Miss Showgirl! [chuckling]

183
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,210
Heh? Huh? Huh? [chuckling]

184
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,588
What d'ya think?

185
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,299
It's a phenomenal interview setting,
isn't it?

186
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,426
I had to really think about it.

187
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,472
Where's the best place to get
the most authentic Shin Ju-ae story?

188
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,723
[laughs cockily]

189
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,185
[music fades]

190
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,478
[Jae-geon clears throat]

191
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,230
The venue's rented for the day.

192
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,356
It's all ours!

193
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,400
So we can drink to our hearts' content.

194
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:03,991
Don't be shy.

195
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,670
Sweetheart,

196
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,215
this calls for a celebration.

197
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,219
Because you're gonna be winning
the Best New Actress Award.

198
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,430
I called in some big favors
to get this! [laughs]

199
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,474
You grateful?

200
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,185
Yes, I'm grateful.

201
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,649
[gulping noisily]

202
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,317
- [glass slams]
- [sighs loudly]

203
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,029
Well, then, how does it feel to be back?

204
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,991
The memories…
getting your heart all worked up again,

205
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
in your beautiful chest. Hmm?

206
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,413
It reminds me of my hard work back then.

207
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,749
I still work hard.

208
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,461
That hard work's
what made you a star though.

209
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,758
Also, what landed you this interview.
I don't work with just anybody.

210
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,262
Sweetheart,
I <i>only </i>interview big A-listers, okay?

211
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,558
And before we start,
I think it'd be really great

212
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,893
if we took a photo for the article.

213
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,855
I have something amazing for the shot.

214
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,315
[giggling] It'll be great.

215
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,152
Now, feast your eyes… on this!

216
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,737
[hypnotic music playing]

217
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,408
Wow! Pretty much worked my dick off
to get my hands on it. [chuckles]

218
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,286
Look.
Just like what you used to wear, huh?

219
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,124
Put this bad boy on.
It's gonna be an amazing photo.

220
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,502
"Madame Aema's ascension
from humble beginnings."

221
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,254
"Get the full story!"

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,256
Hell of a narrative, right?

223
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,383
[sniffs] Ah!

224
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,801
[sniffing] Ahhh!

225
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,846
So put it on!

226
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,807
Oh, that's right.

227
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,685
You never did have a proper changing room.

228
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,564
I guess you could
just get changed right here.

229
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,441
I'd be fine with that.

230
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,320
[Ju-ae inhales deeply, exhales]

231
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,032
Can you close your eyes?

232
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,450
Huh?

233
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,996
[humming softly]

234
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
I want you to put your hands
on your chest.

235
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,503
[Jae-geon chuckling, breathing lustfully]

236
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,421
[Ju-ae] Y'know,

237
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,215
I've been wanting to ask you…

238
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,302
You, um, wanna know about me?

239
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,471
[giggling]

240
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,725
- [breathing lustfully]
- Can you…

241
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,062
- [music fades]
- …even get an erection?

242
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,730
[Jae-geon] Mm?

243
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,524
[Ju-ae sighs softly]

244
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,069
I've been thinking about it.

245
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,155
You've always made
such a concerted effort to objectify me

246
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,407
and make me uncomfortable, Mr. Lee.

247
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,578
Men, in my experience,
are often one-dimensional

248
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,039
in what all of their actions
are driven by.

249
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,166
They all want sex.

250
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,002
Yet your motivation seems to be different.

251
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,923
You don't actually wanna sleep with me.
You just get off on harassing me.

252
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,510
When that's the case, it's often because
that man can't maintain an erection.

253
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,597
[chuckling] You crazy little bitch.

254
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,265
My God. [laughs]

255
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,350
[glass rattles]

256
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,603
Your dick's trying its best every day,
isn't it?

257
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,648
It's trying so hard,
you're afraid it'll fall off.

258
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,818
You may be impotent,
but I'm sure you still value your cock.

259
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,277
Hey…

260
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,696
[synth music playing]

261
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,072
…I can get hard.

262
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,075
I'm hard every day.

263
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,285
Rock hard!

264
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,538
So fuckin' hard, you hear me?! Shit!

265
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,748
Hard!

266
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,083
Oh yeah?

267
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
Great to hear.

268
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,051
You goddamn bitch!

269
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,762
You'll pay for that. [grunts]

270
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,015
- [vibrant disco music playing]
- [sickening crunch]

271
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,645
[groaning, sobbing]

272
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,696
You better sleep with one eye open, buddy.

273
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,282
[groaning]

274
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,701
[music fades]

275
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,911
[quietly] Fuck. [sobbing]

276
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,916
[classical music plays in studio]

277
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,427
[Paul exhales]

278
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,144
[clears throat]

279
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,443
Ah.

280
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,738
Kitten, you're here.
I'd been meaning to call you.

281
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,908
I just figured you were busy
Super busy. Aren't you busy?

282
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,786
Ignoring my calls
is a little immature, yes?

283
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,953
We can't have that.

284
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,497
[car engine idling]

285
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,544
[Hee-ran] Well, darling,

286
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:12,049
there's one value we should all hold
regardless of what happens.

287
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,468
Being classy.

288
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,763
For people like us, in particular,

289
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,474
elegance is everything.

290
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,144
And since I'm feeling benevolent today,

291
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,148
just this once,
I'll overlook your immaturity.

292
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,988
[Paul] I've fallen for her!

293
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,034
I'm smitten.

294
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,620
Shin Ju-ae's my new inspiration.

295
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,873
I want her

296
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,377
to be my muse and wear my designs.

297
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,171
"Smitten," you say?

298
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,967
[chuckles]

299
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,264
That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

300
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,144
When <i>we </i>met,
<i>I </i>said I was smitten with you.

301
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,772
Before anyone else knew your name,
I believed in you.

302
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,526
I had plenty of designers
falling all over themselves to dress me,

303
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,488
and yet I always said,
"Paul Goh is my designer."

304
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,200
I catapulted you to fame by wearing
your miniskirt at the airport, right?

305
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,326
Yeah. I did that.

306
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,537
And you repay that how?

307
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,541
By falling for another?
How dare you say that!

308
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,585
Well, things change!

309
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,546
Me, you, even fashion,
all go through stages.

310
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,339
[disco music playing]

311
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,424
You and I

312
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,302
just need a bit of a break for now.

313
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,597
"A bit of a break," you say?
No, I don't think so.

314
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,600
Yeong-bae, we're taking that!

315
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,686
- Wha-- Uh… Uh…
- Mr. Cha, guard the clothes.

316
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,605
[Mr. Cha grumbles]

317
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,065
Hmph!

318
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,656
Oh! Stop pulling!
You're acting like a crazy toddler!

319
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,243
<i>You </i>stop it! What has gotten into you?
Really? You're acting crazy!

320
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,913
You're the person
I last expected to abandon me.

321
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,373
Kitten, dear,
you and I had a good run, huh?

322
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,085
Good memories.
C'mon, don't spoil them. Hmm?

323
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,046
[Hee-ran grunts]

324
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,757
My-- Whoa! Oh! [groans]

325
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,008
[all] Oh my.

326
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,009
Oh!

327
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,345
- [Paul] Damn it!
- [loud clattering]

328
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,472
[Hee-ran breathing deeply]

329
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,309
[quirky percussive music playing]

330
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,992
This award ceremony
is an important one for me.

331
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,245
You'll come to understand.

332
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:53,460
My legacy… is gonna be more
than just some miniskirt I once wore.

333
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,754
This show is what I'll be remembered by.

334
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,217
Since it's such an important event,

335
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:05,264
you… were the only designer
I wanted to wear.

336
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,395
After all… I was so very "smitten"
with your work, right?

337
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,356
[Paul sniffling, whimpering]

338
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,775
And even now,

339
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,736
I'm an idiot. [sniffles]

340
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,490
I'm still madly in love.

341
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,910
[quavering] Kitten, you and your… [sobs]

342
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,497
It's tugging on my heartstrings.
[inhales shakily]

343
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,295
[Jung-ho] "Exclusive."

344
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:40,924
"The shocking, guilt-ridden past
of the debuting actress Ms. S,

345
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,592
nightclub dancer."

[drumroll intensifies]

515
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,612
[cymbal crashes]

516
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,322
I can't do it either. I'm chickening out.

517
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,282
You do it, Ms. Ju-ran.

518
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,745
All right, then let me muster up
my courage and try again.

519
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,626
The award for Best New Actress
for the 21st annual Daejong Film Awards…

520
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,627
[drumroll plays]

521
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,337
…the honor goes to…

522
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,676
[drumroll intensifies]

523
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,719
- [cymbal crashes]
- [applause]

524
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,644
[sighs]

525
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,979
I'm exhausted.

526
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,740
Well, I went up there
and gave the crowd what they wanted.

527
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,284
So that's a job well done.

528
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,123
I'll just stay
till Hee-ran wins her award.

529
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,708
To support her.

530
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,543
[hypnotic music playing]

531
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,169
[audience applauding]

532
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,509
[man 1] <i>Now then, next category,</i>

534
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,474
<i>Please welcome Choi Gi-ryong</i>

535
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,102

00:33:56,242 --> 00:34:00,371
[Seon-a] Best Supporting Actress
for the 21st annual Daejong Film Awards

541
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,456
goes to…

542
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,128
<i>I Leave Tomorrow Night'</i>s Seol Su-hee!
Congratulations!

543
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,796
[man 1] Congratulations!

544
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,882
[celebratory music playing]

545
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,104
Bravo! Bravo!

546
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,323
[man 1] <i>Up next</i>
<i>is the highest honor of all.</i>

547
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,284
[louder] <i>We'll be handing out</i>
<i>the Lifetime Achievement Award.</i>

548
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,621
<i>Let's welcome last year's winner</i>
<i>up to the stage.</i>

549
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,539
<i>An actress who many might say</i>

550
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,085
<i>is truly unrivaled</i>
<i>and a living legend of the silver screen.</i>

551
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,171
<i>A warm welcome for Mrs. Bang Hyeon-ja.</i>

552

553
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,468
[audience applauding]

554
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,140
Good evening.

555
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,143
I starred in <i>Days of Glory</i>,
a wonderful film.

556
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,146
And in that movie,

557
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,774
I recall one line.

558
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,864
"Looking back on it, not a day went by
that wasn't filled with glory."

559
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:22,036
[inhales deeply] As an actor,
looking at my career,

560
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,706
it certainly wasn't easy at times.

561
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,501
I had many high highs and low lows.

562
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:33,005
But in the grand scheme of things,
as I stand here today,

563
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,508
I can happily say

564
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,594
that my line from that movie rang true.

565
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,806
Because my life had many moments of glory.

566
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,518
And one of my most memorable moments

567
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,854
was with this director.

568
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:52,733
Filming with him was
one of the greatest honors of my career.

569
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:59,365
The 21st annual Daejong Film Awards
Lifetime Achievement winner is…

570
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,118
Director Kwon Do-il.

571
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,873
[subdued upbeat music playing]

572
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,735
What the hell is he…

573
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,071
[man 1] Huh? What is it?

574
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,199
- What the hell?
- <i>Congratulations, Director Do-il.</i>

575
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,909
[man 1] Why are they going up together?

576
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,661
- They've worked together before?
- No.

577
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,539
I was terrified to come up here all alone.

578
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,335
I'm usually behind cameras, not on-stage.

579
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:57,006
So instead, this lovely lady…
offered to escort me up here tonight.

580
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,507
[audience laughing]

581
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,220
[Do-il chuckles]

582
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,013
And since she's here,

583
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,060
I figured, why not have Ms. Jeong Hee-ran
deliver a speech in my stead?

584
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,396
To make up for not winning earlier.

585
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,732
[audience laughing, applauding]

586
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,487
[Do-il] I'm sure you prepared
an acceptance speech.

587
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,657
So why not say what's on your mind
since you have the opportunity?

588
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,742
[music fades]

589
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,664
[gentle music playing]

590
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,040
[Gi] Did you hear that?

591
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,376
Excuse me. [softly] 'Scuse me.

592
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,428
[Hee-ran] <i>I know</i>
<i>I won't actually win an award.</i>

593
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,765
So instead,
I've come to ask you for a favor.

594
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,476
When you go up there,

595
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,770
let me come up with you
and say a few words.

596
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,107
Got something
you wanna get off your chest?

597
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,776
[camera shutter clicks]

598
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,111
For years now,

599
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,030
a vague fear haunted me.

600
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,199
It whispered,

601
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,119
"Be careful or you'll lose everything."

602
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,664
I was filled with anxiety.

603
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,168
- I never thought I'd be brave enough…
- [softly] Shit.

604
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,629
…to overcome this fear.

605
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,381
- Get her off the stage.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,259
[Hee-ran] A few events
gave me the push I needed.

607
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,760
So now

608
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,391
I am finally ready
to say what needs to be said.

609
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,479
It's time that someone
finally blew the whistle.

610
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,858
Let's bring the truth to light.

611
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,776
[audience muttering]

612
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,237
- [man 1] What's she talking about?
- [man 2] You don't think…

613
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,281
- [man 1] Hey…
- [man 2] Is what she's saying true?

614
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,866
[dramatic music playing]

615
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:04,133
The president of Shinsung
and <i>Madame Aema</i>'s producer, Ku Jung-ho,

616
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,262
has been hiding
a terrible secret from you.

617
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,722
This man

618
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,851
has been exploiting me
and my fellow actresses…

619
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,228
- That fuckin' crazy little whore.
- …offering us up for sex.

620
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,024
He has a secret ledger
and records of all these exchanges.

621
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,069
This ledger is then used…

622
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,404
- Goddammit!
- …as his leverage to blackmail us.

623
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,531
Ensuring our silence.

624
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,201
But I am no longer afraid.

625
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,745
So I'm here to tell you all the truth.

626
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,997
To speak for those who cannot.

627
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,337
<i>As we speak,</i>

628
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,217
<i>there are incriminating flyers</i>
<i>being dispersed in the streets.</i>

629
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,970
Those flyers contain
every last sordid detail.

630
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,764
Kill everything.
The mic, lights, everything.

631
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,599
Who the hell are you?
This area's restricted.

632
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,268
Just kill it!
Just fuckin' kill everything!

633
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,481
[Hee-ran] I implore you all to believe me.

634
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,734
[man] No fucking way.
Cut to color screen! Hey, c'mon now!

635
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,861
[Hee-ran] <i>So that</i>
<i>they can no longer blackmail us…</i>

636
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,073
- Only air the color screen. No, the mics!
<i>- …or prey upon more innocent victims.</i>

637
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,616
God fucking damn it! Cut it!

638
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,784
[high-pitched tone]

639
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,662
- [PA] <i>Everyone, please remain calm.</i>
- [Jung-ho] Damn it, Jeong Hee-ran!

640
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,580
[PA] <i>Due to unforeseen circumstances,</i>

641
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,167
<i>tonight's event has been placed</i>
<i>on immediate hiatus.</i>

00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,629
<i>As a precaution, we will be conducting</i>
<i>an evacuation of the venue…</i>

643
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,925
Get off me, bastard!

00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,427
[music intensifies]

645
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,930
<i>Once again, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

646
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,850
<i>we ask you to remain calm</i>
<i>and follow directions…</i>

647
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,649
<i>…and exit the building</i>
<i>in an orderly manner. We ask that you…</i>

648
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,775
Ah shit!

649
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,070
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. President. Sorry!

650
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,117
[Jung-ho groaning]

651
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,037
- [Yeong-bae] Yaaargh!
- [man 1] You bastard!

652
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,459
[man 2] Hey. Who the hell are you?

653
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,462
Jeong Hee-ran's agent, you stupid-- Argh!

654
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,005
Yaaargh!

655
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,633
- [man 2] Come 'ere!
- [Jung-ho] Shit, shit, stop!

656
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,051
[Yeong-bae] Get off me!

657
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,053
Hah! Hah!

658
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,891
[music becomes tense]

659
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,817
POWERFUL MEN'S SECRET BANQUET
ACTRESSES AND SINGERS SACRIFICED

[breathing raggedly]

661
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,299
Sir, these flyers
are being widely distributed right now.

662
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,178
[exhales shakily] Shit. Those fuckers.

663
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,056
Ah shit, where the hell are they?

664
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,142
Ah! Why are you taking your sweet time?

665
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,477
Go catch Hee-ran!

666
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,270
Follow me!

667
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,690
Whoa! Wha-- what the fuck are you doin'?

668
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,692
What the fuck is going on? Get off me!

[crowd muttering]

675
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,803
[insincerely] Oh no!
It appears we should go that way.

676
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,055
[woman] Don't push us!
You're blocking the way!

677

[crowd chattering loudly]

678
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,309
- Get outta the way!
- [Paul] You, in the tacky suits!

679
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,729
Step aside. You're in our way. Move along.

680
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,690
- With the jacket?
- [both] Perfection.

Hee-ran, hold onto me. Hyah!

714

[sighs] I shouldn't have involved you.

724
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,133
I involved myself.
I couldn't just leave you there.

725
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,511
Although I didn't know
you were gonna go all out like <i>that</i>.

726
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,474
[Hee-ran] I went all out
because I had nothing to lose, but you do!

727
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,934
We left Mr. Yang and Yeong-bae behind.

728
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,019
We've failed.

729
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,319
Where's Mr. Yang?

730
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,945
They dragged him out of there.

731
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,783
It's hard to tell where he might be, but

732
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,743
most likely…

733
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,286
…to be tortured.

734
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,919
Give me the envelope.

735
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,171
It looks like I'll need it.

740
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,455
It's my turn.

741
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,250
Motherfucker!

742
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,214
[sickening crunch]

743
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,883
I'll ask you one last time.

744
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,968
Who are you?

745
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,846
And who do you work for, asshole?!

746
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,099
[Yang groaning]

747
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,823
[music intensifies]

748
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,086
[man 1 whistles softly] Huh.

749
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,464

[Jung-ho moaning]

751
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,848
[man 1] Shhhh.

752
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,350
I've given it some thought,

753
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,312
and you know, ultimately,
I don't think it really matters

754
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,731
whether you were gonna
blackmail them or not

755
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,483
or if they can prove
the existence of the ledger.

756
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,568
I don't care.

757
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,905
I'm pretty sure I said this before,

758
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,283
but… your heyday was in the '70s.

759
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,785
Your time is over, President Ku.

760
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,746
It's long gone now.

761
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,082
You had a good run
and enjoyed your time in the sun.

762
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,167
No more!

763
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,337
That sun has set for you.

764
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,006
[inhales deeply]

765
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,051
Hate to break it to ya,

766
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,637
but a new era has dawned.

767
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,601
You have nothing now.

768
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,605
No opportunities, no future,
nothing at all.

769
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,814
You got that?

770
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,195
Your little empire is all gone.

771
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,615
You're a dead man, Jung-ho.

772
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,035
[footsteps approaching]

773
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,794
[exhales sharply]

774
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,636
[man] Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

775
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:38,517
- What in the world have you done?
- I'm sure you already know.

776
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,979
My voice was on
every television and radio.

777
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,691
And more than 5,000 flyers
have been dispersed through the city.

778
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,404
Now the whole country
will be watching what happens to me.

779
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,488
[scoffs]

780
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:56,326
Which means all this will be over
once we put your head out on a spike.

781
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,329
And why did you come here
so late in the night?

782
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,373
To ask a favor of you.

783
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,210
Please set those
who got swept up in this free.

784
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,921
And you can put my head on a spike

785
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,173
after they're released.

786
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,927
You're awfully courageous
for someone without any power.

787
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,846
[music darkens]

788
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,063
[Hee-ran] A page out of Jung-ho's ledger.

789
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,441
With your name there in black and white.

790
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:31,528
And it goes without saying,
that's not the only information I have.

791
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,364
And in the follow-up articles,

792
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,825
everything else will be revealed.

793
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,493
Hey, don't push it.

794
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,666
Don't push me past the point of no return.

795
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,633
Oh, I plan on pushing you
way over your limit.

796
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,678
So feel free to cut my head off.

797
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,472
Unless, of course,

798
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,808
you can decide
to cut your losses here and now

799
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,351
and bury the hatchet.

800
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,729
The choice is yours.

801
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,607
I can't tell you which decision to make.

802
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,108
Choose the former

803
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,361
and it wouldn't end with just <i>my </i>head.

804
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,113
So choose wisely

805
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,657
or begin spiking the heads
of all the actors.

806
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,117
Before you know it,

807
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,411
'cause it will be soon,

808
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,331
your head will share our fate.

809
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,125
[sighs] Oh, you're a fuckin' bitch.

810
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,127
But if you choose correctly,

811
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,091
I might leave you out of it
and permit you to go on with your life.

812
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,844
And if you promise
that other actresses are safe

813
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,137
and no harm will come to them,

814
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,350
that follow-up article
might just disappear, at least for now.

815

816
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,355

You okay?

857
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,702
Mmm.

858
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,328
I'm all right.

859
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,170
Are you leaving?

860
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,839
Mm-hmm.

861
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,387
Now that I know you're doing okay,

862
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,806
I can leave.

863
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,658

[Ju-ae panting]

865
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,039
Everyone said that the '80s
would be a new era.

866
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,042
That it's different from the '70s.

867
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,336
But the world is still fucked up!

868
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,007
No one out there
gives a shit about anybody else!

869
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,553
If everyone's an asshole,

870
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,139
then I'll be an asshole!

871
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,769
I'll be the baddest bitch
they've ever seen.

872
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,949
Thank you so much.

873
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,079

874
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,165

Born in the Year of the Rabbit.

879
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,918
Well, I was born in the Year of the Tiger.

880
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,671
Guess I'm older than you.

881
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,468
Guess you are,

882
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,552

883
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,102

[Yeong-bae] Yes.

885
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,358
Sir.

886
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,534
It was very dark.

887
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,329
It all seemed out of reach.

888
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,919
But we're finally here.

889
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,884
I guess the only way to go is forward.

[jingle plays]

906
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,241
[in Japanese] <i>Hello, everyone.</i>

907
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:42,829
Today's guest needs no introduction.
She is Korea's definitive sex symbol.

908
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,666
The heroine of the film <i>Madame Aema</i>,
Ms. Shin Ju-ae, is with us!

909
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:51,337
- Hooray!

I'm Shin Ju-ae.

913
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,766
[in Japanese] My, Ms. Shin Ju-ae!
Your voice alone just oozes eroticism!

914
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,729
Um, he said your voice alone,
just in and of itself, is erotic.

915

[in Japanese, laughs] Even that
reserved reaction radiates eroticism.

916
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,488
I love it, this reserved eroticism!

917
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,241
Let me start with this question.

918
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,828
Koreans tend to be more conservative
when it comes to sex,

919
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:27,373
so how is the life
of a sex symbol in Korea?

920
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,169
[woman] How is living as a sex symbol
in a more conservative country?

921
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,176
[subdued thoughtful music playing]

922
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,553
It's like doing battle in an arena.

923
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,057
You need nerves of steel

924
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,476
and an unwavering resolve.

925
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:51,356
Some days,
the battle may feel impossible to win.

926
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,359
<i>You may even lose hope.</i>

927
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,029
<i>But once you find meaning</i>
<i>in the struggle itself</i>

928
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,530
<i>and getting back up again,</i>

929
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:03,993
<i>and realize everything</i>
<i>you've done and are doing matters,</i>

930
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,162
<i>you have nothing to fear.</i>

931
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,292
<i>So my heart's desire is…</i>

932
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,588
<i>if my words speak to you…</i>

933

954
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,456
