1
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,947
LET'S FIGHT FOR
THE THREE BASIC LABOR RIGHTS!

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,660
FREE PRESS - WE DEMAND FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,704
It's a mess, isn't it?

4
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,255
Sorry for the surprise visit.

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,090
Well, I was surprised

6
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,385
when Ms. Ju-ae told me
you would be dropping by.

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,970
Right now,

8
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,014
I'm just starstruck.

9
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,352
I've heard about you,
but I've also done my research.

10
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,689
About what kind of work you've been doing.

11
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,651
I've gone through
as many of your past papers as possible.

12
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,530
I'm not sure why,
but I felt this would be a good outlet

13
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,826
for me to finally open up
about some things.

14
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,810
Hee-ran.

15
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,395
Congratulations.

16
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,524
This place will do.

17
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,319
What for, though?

18
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,904
Sorry?

19
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,906
The congratulations?

20
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,825
Well, Hee-ran,

21
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,869
you're winning Best Supporting Actress
at the Daejong Film Awards.

22
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,038
They asked that you be there.

23
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,894
I didn't mean
for you to come all this way,

24
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,689
but for us to catch up when I visit Seoul.

25
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,943
I came here to tell you something.

26
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,695
Is this a bad time?

27
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,655
Not at all.

28
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,366
I've taken a few months off

29
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,786
to get some dental work done.

30
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,455
And I've been touching up my script.

31
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,377
I saw Madame Aema, by the way.

32
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,463
A terrible film.

33
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,050
Yes.

34
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,553
Let me guess. Jung-ho's work?

35
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,056
And yet, despite it all,

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,767
I could see you fought on
to the end by yourself,

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,770
truly carrying the film.

38
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,733
You held your ground,
even amid all that mediocrity.

39
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,986
I've always been a fan,

40
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,071
but I saw you in a new light.

41
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,490
That's why I asked to see you.

42
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,872
PREDATION NIGHT
FINAL DRAFT

43
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,085
Let's do it together.

44
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,598
AEMA

45
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,058
You know that place?

46
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,352
The cold soy noodle joint
near the terminal?

47
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,813
It's on the second floor of that building.
Think about it.

48
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,317
That area is
elementary and middle schools galore,

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,028
but there's never been
a single martial arts studio.

50
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,739
The kids must be dying
for tae kwon do classes.

51
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,367
Father and I rushed down
and made a provisional contract…

52
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,369
WE ARE MADAME AEMA,
SHIN JU-AE'S FAMILY

53
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,790
…but they're saying there's a premium
because of its prime downtown location.

54
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,166
Ju-ae.

55
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,794
Don't you make a decent living now?

56
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,505
Sure, I'll give you the money.

57
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,760
Good. And make sure you behave properly
and act humble wherever you go.

58
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,971
You're a public figure now, aren't you?

59
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,432
Hey, let me put Father on.
Not heard his voice in a while, have you?

60
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,350
Stay right there.

61
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,602
-Father!
-What?

62
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,396
Ju-ae's on the phone.

63
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,106
It's a long-distance call.

64
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,650
-Really?
-Hurry over here.

65
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,279
Now that your office is all lit up,

66
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,365
it even smells different.

67
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,079
Money

68
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,707
sure is great, isn't it?

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,543
Do me a favor

70
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,503
and put a tail on Hee-ran.

71
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,757
You sure are relentless as hell, Mr. Ku.

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,263
Stop sucking the poor girl dry

73
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,141
with the whole exclusivity contract thing
and just let her go.

74
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,602
You worked her to the bone for all this.
What more do you want?

75
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,565
This is about Mi-na, not money.

76
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,777
Mi-na's death
must have rattled Hee-ran hard.

77
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,822
There's this new resolve in her eyes.

78
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:28,202
She sounded like she'd spill everything
and take me down with her.

79
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,791
If she exposes anything,
it'll be the banquet, which includes you.

80
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,756
Even if it comes to that,

81
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,718
Jeong Hee-ran's the one
with far more to lose.

82
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,846
She'll know that better than anyone.

83
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,974
Jeong Hee-ran is one crazy bitch.

84
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,227
She'd do it.

85
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,534
From what I hear,

86
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,998
Jeong Hee-ran's set to receive
the Best Supporting Actress Award.

87
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,041
Yes, that's right.

88
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,003
Speaking of which,
you owe me big time, Mr. Ku.

89
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,840
Madame Aema is slated to win two awards
with Jeong Hee-ran and Shin Ju-ae.

90
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,384
As for Shin Ju-ae,

91
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,012
I'd like to surprise her
with the news myself,

92
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,473
so mum's the word.

93
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,728
I happen to be a huge fan of Madame Aema,

94
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,898
so I just pulled
whatever fucking strings I wanted

95
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,026
as my thank-you to the film
for making me horny.

96
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,695
But Hee-ran doesn't need it.

97
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,618
Hee-ran's won plenty of awards
over the years.

98
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,288
The fame must have gone to her head.
She's not who she used to be.

99
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,419
A wake-up call's long overdue,
but if she were to win an award,

100
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,380
I worry she'll lose perspective.

101
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:07,343
After how I looked out for you,
do you have to be such a buzzkill?

102
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,845
Did you fall out?

103
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,140
I gotta say,
it's a petty way to get back at her.

104
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,100
Goodness.

105
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,149
I'm the one who turned a nobody
into Hee-ran, the star she is today.

106
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,443
I think this year,

107
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:28,030
going home without a trophy
would help her to face the bitter reality.

108
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,742
As long as she doesn't get on stage
under the spotlight

109
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,203
with a mic in her hand, we're good.

110
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,165
Playing second fiddle

111
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,376
will be a meaningful experience
for her and for me.

112
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,256
As for Ju-ae,
I'll set up an interview for Friday.

113
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,758
I'll make sure she has the whole day

114
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,178
for you to use however you wish.

115
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,014
Use what however I wish?

116
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,641
So I could, like,

117
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,768
really just…

118
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,439
use however I wish?

119
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,675
Let's go.

120
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,848
Who are you guys?

121
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,687
You've got some nerve,
barging into someone's home like this!

122
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,814
Get out, now!

123
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,610
Did you not hear me?

124
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,071
Don't you know it's rude
to interrupt a meal?

125
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,791
Do I look like

126
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,336
a bandit to you?

127
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,505
Someone who takes bribes

128
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,259
and skims unofficial funds
left off the ledger?

129
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,262
Listen, kiddo.

130
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,849
That's how it's always been in Chungmuro.

131
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,351
Despite it all,

132
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,563
I've always done my best
never to cross the line doing what I do.

133
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,816
You crossed that line.

134
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,153
Like there were ever any lines
in the first place.

135
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,532
Whichever way you look, up or down,
the entire world is fucked.

136
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,581
Ju-ae being picked to join their banquet.

137
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,377
She's not the first, is she?

138
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,130
It's been happening for a while,
hasn't it?

139
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,468
And you knew all about it, didn't you?

140
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,720
And you're telling me

141
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,348
I crossed a line?

142
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,018
Don't say you didn't cross any lines.

143
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,230
That's what really
makes you sound like a bandit.

144
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,115
I'm in no position
to tell you to clean up your act,

145
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,035
so I'll tell you exactly
what my supervisor once told me.

146
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,290
Thanks for your hard work.

147
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,335
Don't let me see you again.

148
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,277
Can't see a thing.

149
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,738
Wait, is it on now?

150
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:20,948
There it is.

151
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,410
Hey!

152
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,163
If it isn't Ms. Lasting Friendships.

153
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,299
How do you like this place?
Perfect for our interview, isn't it?

154
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,009
I gave it a lot of thought.

155
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,346
Where do we begin the Shin Ju-ae story
to bring out the real deal?

156
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,147
We've rented out this whole venue.

157
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,983
That means we can drink
everything here today.

158
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,575
Go on.

159
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,670
Sweetheart.

160
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,215
Gotta say congrats first.

161
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,635
Soon you'll be crowned Best New Actress.

162
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,721
I pulled some strings and made it happen.

163
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,474
Feeling grateful?

164
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,185
Thank you.

165
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
How does it feel being back here?

166
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,699
Do the old memories
make your heart flutter,

167
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
stir something in your bosom?

168
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,247
It reminds me of the hard work
that got me here.

169
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,749
Like this.

170
00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:00,172
That hard work made you a star, though,
and got you an interview with me.

171
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,508
I don't just interview anybody.

172
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,095
I only do one-on-ones with A-listers.

173
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,973
That's right.

174
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,893
Why don't we start off by taking a photo?

175
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,771
I've brought something amazing, you see.

176
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,898
Brace yourself.

177
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,651
And drumroll.

178
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,486
Ta-da!

179
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,991
I worked so hard to get my hands on this
that my dick almost fell off.

180
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,286
Look, baby.
Just like the one you used to wear.

181
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,124
Let's start by getting a shot of you
wearing this up on that stage.

182
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:40,254
Your rise from a lowly nightclub dancer
to Madame Aema. The full story.

183
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,256
Hell of a narrative, no?

184
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,721
Go put it on.

185
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,807
That's right.

186
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,685
You never did have a proper changing room.

187
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,520
What to do?

188
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,188
I guess you could just

189
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,441
get changed here?

190
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,032
Close your eyes.

191
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,575
What?

192
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
Put your hands on your chest.

193
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,421
Now,

194
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,840
tell me.

195
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,135
What? About what?

196
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,600
You…

197
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,062
can't get your cock up, can you?

198
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,777
I've always wondered

199
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,030
why you kept slobbering all over me

200
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,950
and persistently pushing me
to be obnoxious, Mr. Lee.

201
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,956
Most men are pretty simple, and it's easy
to see through their words and actions.

202
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,041
They only want one thing.

203
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,002
But you have no goal.

204
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,297
Harassing me in and of itself
is your endgame.

205
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,927
And from experience,
most assholes like you can't get it up.

206
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,682
Man, get a load of this crazy bitch.

207
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,603
Did you say your dick almost fell off
organizing this?

208
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,939
That was a close shave, no?

209
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,818
Impotent or not,
I'm sure you still care about your cock.

210
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,236
Hey.

211
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,655
I can get it up.

212
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
It gets up every day.

213
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,829
I can get it up!

214
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,748
Damn it, I can!

215
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,125
Is that right?

216
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,085
Good for you.

217
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,592
You crazy bitch.

218
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,053
Want a piece of me?

219
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,571
You'd better watch your back at night.

220
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,153
You're here, hon.

221
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,114
I'd been meaning to call,
but I thought you'd be busy.

222
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,908
You must be busy, right?

223
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,953
Ignoring my calls like that
is simply childish, Mr. Paul.

224
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,503
Do you know the one thing

225
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,673
that people should hold on to,
no matter the circumstances?

226
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,635
Decency.

227
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,763
For people like us in particular,

228
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,349
it's worth its weight in gold.

229
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,186
I'll pretend I didn't hear what I did,

230
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,187
so please,

231
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,523
let's stay classy, shall we?

232
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,822
I've fallen for her.

233
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,034
I've

234
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,037
fallen for Shin Ju-ae.

235
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,873
I want

236
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,377
to dress her entirely in my clothes.

237
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,004
Fallen for her, you say?

238
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,264
Why, isn't that a familiar turn of phrase?

239
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,852
Those were the first words
I ever said to you,

240
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,689
back when no one even knew
who Paul Goh the designer was.

241
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,024
When, season after season,

242
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,027
top designers queued up at my door
with their clothes,

243
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,488
I said I had fallen
for Paul Goh's garments.

244
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:21,326
The miniskirt I wore at the airport
shot you to stardom, remember?

245
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,537
And yet, you're telling me

246
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,956
that you've fallen for her?

247
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,541
Some other bitch?

248
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,418
We need to keep evolving.

249
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,546
You, me, and fashion.
Everything must evolve.

250
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,215
It's okay for us

251
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,302
to fall out of love with each other now.

252
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,845
Fall out of love?

253
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,597
Says who?

254
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,600
Yeong-bae, pack the clothes.

255
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,726
Sorry?

256
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,686
Mr. Cha, protect the clothes.

257
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,656
Stop being so uncouth.
This is beneath you!

258
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,243
I could say the same about you.
What's gotten into you? How uncivil!

259
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,913
You of all people
shouldn't be treating me like this.

260
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,124
Sweetheart, we had a good run.

261
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,085
Let's not ruin
those good memories we had, okay?

262
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,380
No!

263
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,008
-Oh my.
-Goodness!

264
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,926
Wow.

265
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,802
Why, you!

266
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,992
You'll soon learn
what the upcoming awards ceremony

267
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,245
means to me.

268
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,665
The actress Jeong Hee-ran

269
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,793
won't be remembered
for her airport miniskirt

270
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,671
but for the upcoming awards ceremony.

271
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,800
Since it means so much to me,

272
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,843
I wanted

273
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,264
to wear your clothes, no matter what.

274
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,353
You're the first person
who made me fall in love, remember?

275
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,942
Besides,

276
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,027
like some fool…

277
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,490
I'm still madly into you.

278
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,660
Sweetheart, you and your…

279
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,080
Do you have to mess with my heart?

280
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:40,924
"The shocking past of S,
the up-and-coming actress."

281
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,676
"A former nightclub dancer."

282
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,595
"Rumors have been circulating

283
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,474
about her lucrative secret affairs
with customers."

284
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,312
"In the latest
box office smash adult film,

285
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,856
S performed some daring sex scenes,

286
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,609
where her impressive expression of orgasm

287
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,988
seemed too real
to simply write off as good acting."

288
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:03,905
LEE JAE-GEON

289
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,534
You.

290
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:12,247
What the hell did you do
at the interview to create this mess?

291
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,417
Guess what Mr. Lee said to me yesterday?

292
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,793
What did he say?

293
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,213
That he confronted you at your turf,

294
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,008
the nightclub,
and you showed your true colors.

295
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,719
Did I, now?

296
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,431
And what are my true colors?

297
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,185
He said you are just
a common gutter whore at heart.

298
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,606
And what do you think, Mr. Ku?

299
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,115
The fact that you were a nightclub dancer
isn't exactly something to take pride in.

300
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,076
Our audiences are conservative.

301
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,869
You may be the lead of Madame Aema,

302
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,372
but they won't approve of you
without an acceptable background.

303
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,916
The village girl who cared for her family.

304
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,796
It's got a great ring to it, no?
We should have left it at that!

305
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,048
Public opinion is no joke.

306
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,093
I could let it slide
if all you did was dance.

307
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,930
Look, Ju-ae.
You have to be honest with me.

308
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,140
No need to beat around the bush.

309
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,478
Ask me exactly what you want to know.

310
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,855
Did you pour drinks?

311
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,733
What else?

312
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,403
And spread your legs?

313
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,282
I seriously

314
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,954
don't know how much more
I need to grit my teeth…

315
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,625
and become an even bigger bitch.

316
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,672
You fucking assholes.

317
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,567
SECRET RELATIONSHIPS
WITH MULTIPLE MALE PARTNERS!

318
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,026
Is that Shin Ju-ae?

319
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,572
CONTROVERSY OVER ACTRESS'S
MESSY NIGHTLIFE

320
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:13,660
CO-WORKER A'S SHOCKING EXPOSÉ
MONEY-MAKING SECRET TRYSTS

321
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,847
It's okay.

322
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,183
No one will believe it.

323
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,019
Who would buy any of that crap?

324
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,688
I don't see why not.

325
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,691
It's a riveting, sensational story.

326
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,361
They'll believe it
and say all kinds of crap…

327
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,408
until there's better gossip
for them to feed on.

328
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,503
Mr. Gi got me an endorsement deal.

329
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,090
I guess he put in
the proper legwork this time.

330
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,610
The awards ceremony is tomorrow…

331
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,822
but I just don't feel up to it.

332
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,699
Maybe…

333
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,577
I just won't go.

334
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,756
I heard you quit.

335
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,591
Yeah.

336
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,969
Are you bummed out?

337
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,638
Yeah.

338
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,309
I found myself a room.

339
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,479
I'll be moving soon.

340
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,148
Should I ask you not to leave?

341
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,528
No.

342
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,323
Okay.

343
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,422
Oh boy.

344
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,258
Do you think those guys get paid overtime?

345
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,677
Well,

346
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,597
what a show of loyalty.

347
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,351
Tomorrow's the day already.

348
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,688
We've both…

349
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,650
been through so much.

350
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,593
As we speak,

351
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:21,139
Korea's pride and global superstar
Jeong Hee-ran has arrived.

352
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,851
Jeong Hee-ran has been nominated
for Best Supporting Actress

353
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:29,481
for her role in the megahit Madame Aema
at this year's Daejong Film Awards.

354
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,700
That's Jeong Hee-ran for you,
a true superstar.

355
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,746
She's the living epitome
of what an actress should be.

356
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,331
Indeed, she is beautiful.

357
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,713
And now it's time to see some new faces.
It's the new actors' turn.

358
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,925
Shall we all guess
who will be the first to arrive?

359
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,805
-What's going on?
-The car's empty.

360
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:06,101
It's not quite clear what's going on,
but no one seems to be in the car.

361
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,145
It looks as though
there has been a mix-up.

362
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,940
Wait. What the heck is that?

363
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:40,802
Could this be in response
to the rumors surrounding her as of late?

364
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,556
Shin Ju-ae has made her entrance
on her favorite horse,

365
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,058
in clothes fitting of a nightclub dancer.

366
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:52,939
I'm not quite sure if it's appropriate
to describe her as such,

367
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,816
but she is… gorgeous.

368
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,901
I wonder how she came up with that.

369
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,991
That bitch is going places.

370
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,203
21ST ANNUAL DAEJONG FILM AWARDS

371
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,917
Director Kwak, what are you doing?
Hurry and join us.

372
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,544
Best of luck, Director.

373
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,465
Oh my. Hello, Director.

374
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:19,799
Hello, sir.

375
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,927
My, Director Kwak.

376
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,389
-Congrats on the box office hit.
-Thank you.

377
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:30,935
Let's go, sir.

378
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,771
God darn it.

379
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,959
Would I really feel a pang in my heart?

380
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,338
Would I really be moved to tears?

381
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:21,611
Without further ado, we give you
the 21st annual Daejong Film Awards.

382
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,572
First, we've prepared
a special show for you.

383
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,826
A celebratory performance
from the Best New Actress nominees.

384
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,577
A big hand for them, please!

385
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,250
Would I really feel a pang in my heart?

386
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,169
-Camera three, stand by.
-Would I really be moved to tears?

387
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,756
-Number three, cut!
-I don't know what love is yet

388
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,551
-Camera six, stand by.
-You're the only thing I believe in

389
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,511
-Number six, cut!
-You

390
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:51,266
Always called me such a tease

391
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,979
But today you gently held my hand

392
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,504
That was an impressive show
from this year's new actresses.

393
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,425
I'm sure they were nervous performing
on such a big stage for the first time,

394
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,634
but they were amazing.

395
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,889
-Dim the stage lights.
-Another round of applause, please.

396
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,768
We've kicked off today's event
with a lovely and vibrant performance

397
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,271
from our Best New Actress nominees.

398
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:43,026
Looking back,
I think this year will be remembered

399
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,154
as the year of many new arrivals
in Chungmuro.

400
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,909
Right, and that's why I'm sure it was
no small feat for this year's judges

401
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,536
to reach a consensus
for the upcoming award.

402
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:58,416
Let's begin things by announcing
this year's Best New Actress winner.

403
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,753
Last year's winners
will be announcing the winner.

404
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,797
Let's get Park Ju-ran
and Oh Byeong-seo on stage…

405
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,679
I think I'm more nervous right now
than I was accepting the award last year.

406
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,972
Could you do the honors?

407
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,350
All right, let me announce the winner.

408
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,895
The Best New Actress Award
at the 21st annual Daejong Film Awards…

409
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,322
Goodness, I can't do it either.

410
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,657
Please do the honors.

411
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,328
All right, then let me muster up
my courage and try again.

412
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,626
The Best New Actress Award
at the 21st annual Daejong Film Awards.

413
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,836
The honor goes to…

414
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,187
God, that was totally draining.

415
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,824
I filled my seat
and entertained the crowd,

416
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,034
so I'd say I earned my keep.

417
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,955
Let's go home after we see

418
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,749
Hee-ran win her award.

419
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,051
Right. Next, we have
the Best Supporting Actress Award,

420
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,513
which will also be announced
by last year's winners.

421
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,474
Let's welcome Choi Gi-ryong
and Won Seon-a on stage.

422
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,477
Please welcome them
with a warm round of applause.

423
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:48,651
Allow me the honor
of announcing the winner.

424
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,787
The Best Supporting Actress Award
at the 21st annual Daejong Film Awards.

425
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,497
And the honor goes to…

426
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,045
Seol Su-hee from I Leave Tomorrow Night.
Congratulations!

427
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,129
Congratulations!

428
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,937
Bravo!

429
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,323
Next is the highest honor of all.

430
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,284
We will be handing out
the Lifetime Achievement Award.

431
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,496
Announcing the winner
will be last year's winner.

432
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,539
I daresay she's the only actress

433
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,168
who truly deserves
to be called "unrivaled."

434
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,171
Ms. Bang Hyeon-ja,
please come up on stage.

435
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,216
Let's welcome her
with a big round of applause.

436
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,143
My latest film is called Days of Glory,

437
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,146
and a particular line of mine

438
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,899
from the film comes to mind.

439
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,777
"Looking back,

440
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,572
every day was filled with glory."

441
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,036
To be honest, my life as an actress

442
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,747
was an endless struggle,

443
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,334
a nonstop rollercoaster of highs and lows.

444
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,420
However, looking back,

445
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,383
there were moments in my career
that I can only describe,

446
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,094
without a moment's hesitation,

447
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,806
as "truly glorious."

448
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,477
Getting to work on a film with this person

449
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:52,567
was definitely one of the more memorable
and glorious moments of my career.

450
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:59,365
The Lifetime Achievement Award
at the 21st annual Daejong Film Awards

451
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,118
goes to Director Kwon Do-il.

452
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,735
The hell is that?

453
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,403
What?

454
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,155
Did he…

455
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,491
-Congratulations.
-Why are they up there together?

456
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,661
-Have they even worked together?
-They haven't.

457
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,080
I was nervous to come up here by myself

458
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,626
as I've got a pretty bad case
of stage fright,

459
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,545
so I asked a kind, beautiful woman

460
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,006
to escort me up here.

461
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,429
Thank you, Hee-ran.

462
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,307
Since she's up here with me,

463
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,769
I think I'll ask Ms. Jeong Hee-ran
to say a few words in my stead.

464
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,396
After all, you're empty-handed today.

465
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,487
You must have prepared
an acceptance speech,

466
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,657
so why not use this moment
to say what you didn't get a chance to?

467
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,915
Look at that.

468
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,999
Excuse me.

469
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,428
There's no chance
of me winning that award,

470
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,598
which is why
I'm asking you for this favor.

471
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,770
All I ask is for a chance
to say a few words on stage.

472
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,815
What have you got on your mind?

473
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,111
For the longest time,

474
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,780
I've been haunted by a vague fear.

475
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,199
Perhaps it was the fear

476
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,119
of not being able to protect

477
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,289
the things I had.

478
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,334
-Overcoming that fear…
-Damn it.

479
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,046
It took a lot of courage on my part,

480
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,174
but after a certain series of events,

481
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,844
I'm now ready

482
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,557
to speak up about what must be said.

483
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,184
This is equally

484
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,563
a public confession of my shortcomings

485
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,858
as it is an exposé.

486
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,321
Did she say exposé?
What is she going to expose?

487
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:03,883
Ku Jung-ho, the producer of Madame Aema
and the president of Shinsung Pictures,

488
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,054
has exploited me
and my fellow actresses all this time

489
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,889
by offering us up

490
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,892
as sacrifices to those in power.

491
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,935
That crazy bitch…

492
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,228
Ku Jung-ho

493
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,982
has a secret ledger
that details all such transactions.

494
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,068
Said ledger

495
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:27,406
is his weapon, a means to blackmail
everyone around him.

496
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,242
I'm done letting him coerce me,

497
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,745
so I'm putting my name on the line

498
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,747
to speak up in public.

499
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,337
As I speak,

500
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,217
flyers containing our detailed testimonies
are being dispersed outside.

501
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,012
Those flyers contain every last detail.

502
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,764
Mics, lights, kill everything.

503
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,015
Who the hell are you?

504
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,392
For fuck's sake!

505
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,268
Just kill them like I said!

506
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,481
Please lend your ears to the truth.

507
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,901
-This is insane! Hey!
-So that it can no longer be covered up.

508
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,861
And no more innocent victims are…

509
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,906
Just roll the color bars.
Wait, no. Cut the mics first!

510
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,616
Throw the fucking color bars up!

511
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,370
-Ladies and gentlemen.
-Jeong Hee-ran!

512
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,496
Ms. Jeong Hee-ran!

513
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,665
-Due to unforeseen circumstances…
-Move!

514
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,167
What did you mean?
Tell us more about this ledger.

515
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,837
Please remain calm and do not panic…

516
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,925
The heck are you doing?

517
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,931
I repeat, ladies and gentlemen…

518
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,858
Please remain calm and do not panic
as you follow staff members…

519
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,775
Damn it.

520
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,570
My apologies, sir.

521
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,661
Hey!

522
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,288
You bastard!

523
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,375
Who even are you, you bastard?

524
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:05,087
I'm Jeong Hee-ran's assistant, you prick!

525
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,817
POWERFUL MEN'S SECRET BANQUET
ACTRESSES AND SINGERS EXPLOITED

526
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,174
Sir, these flyers
are being dispersed outside.

527
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,053
Fucking hell.

528
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,477
You sure are taking your sweet time.
Aren't you going to catch Jeong Hee-ran?

529
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,187
Follow me.

530
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,774
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

531
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,692
Have you idiots lost your minds?

532
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,204
-There she is!
-Get her!

533
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,384
Guys.

534
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,554
-Let's go in that direction.
-Get your hands off me!

535
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,309
-Damn it, stop pushing.
-Hey, suits!

536
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,186
We're headed that way.

537
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,521
Move aside!

538
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,690
-The jacket is the final touch!
-Final touch!

539
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,526
-What's wrong with you?
-Ms. Jeong Hee-ran!

540
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,992
Hey, stop right there.

541
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,371
-I said stop right there, damn it!
-Move aside, you sons of bitches!

542
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,755
Hee-ran, get in!

543
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,266
We need you to come with us,
Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

544
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,356
You dickheads!

545
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,576
Go on without me.

546
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,002
Hee-ran!

547
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,589
Hee-ran!

548
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,552
Hee-ran!

549
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,262
Hee-ran!

550
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,557
Hee-ran!

551
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,437
Don't worry! I'll take care of everything!

552
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,856
Let go of me!

553
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,327
Let's go, Thunder! Giddyap!

554
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,553
Jeong Hee-ran!

555
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,514
Get her!

556
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,243
-Jeong Hee-ran!
-Stop there!

557
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,788
Hee-ran, hold on tight.

558
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,587
Go! Get them, damn it!

559
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,321
Giddyap!

560
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,046
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

561
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,133
I couldn't just leave you there.

562
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,511
Still, I didn't know
you would go this far.

563
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,889
I pulled the trigger
because I had nothing to lose,

564
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,517
but I've put you in a tough spot,
and we left Mr. Yang and Yeong-bae behind.

565
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,019
We've failed.

566
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,319
Mr. Yang--

567
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,945
They took him away immediately.

568
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,699
There's no telling where they took him.

569
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,328
-But he'll probably end up in…
-Namsan CIA.

570
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,710
Looks like I'll be needing

571
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,921
that envelope.

572
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,455
Hey, move aside.

573
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,584
Motherfucker!

574
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,508
I'll ask you one last time.

575
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,176
Name and affiliation.

576
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,679
Spit it out, you bastard!

577
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,044
Hey.

578
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,392
I've given it some thought.

579
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,978
Whether the ledger exists

580
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,522
and whether you intended
to use it for blackmail…

581
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,067
I'm not sure any of that
even matters all that much.

582
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,280
I think I've told you this before,

583
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,158
but your heyday, Mr. Ku,

584
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,785
was back in the '70s.

585
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,329
That's where it ended.

586
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,042
You had a good run
and enjoyed your fair share.

587
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,337
Time's up. That's all there is to it.

588
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,217
I'm sorry to say this,

589
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,637
but a new era has dawned.

590
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,601
One in which

591
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:02,814
you'll have no opportunities
and no future whatsoever.

592
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,153
It's about time the sun set forever

593
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,073
on your little empire.

594
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,386
Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

595
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,348
What on earth have you done?

596
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,517
It's like you've heard.

597
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,979
My words were already
broadcast to everyone,

598
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,607
and over 5,000 copies of the paper
have circulated across Seoul.

599
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,693
Following tonight's events,

600
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,404
the whole nation
will be watching me closely.

601
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:56,243
So will it all end if your head's
on a spike at Gwanghwamun by morning?

602
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,329
Why did you want to see me this late?

603
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,456
I came to ask you a favor.

604
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,210
Please release the people
I dragged into this.

605
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,005
Putting my head on a spike

606
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,173
comes after that.

607
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,927
I'm impressed you can be so brave
and audacious in this situation.

608
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:27,441
That's a page out of Ku Jung-ho's ledger
with your name on it.

609
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,525
And, of course,

610
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,445
that's not all I have.

611
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,156
The rest will be revealed in due time

612
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,491
as follow-up articles.

613
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,452
Don't test me.

614
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,458
You're starting to rub me the wrong way.

615
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,508
In that case,
wait until you've hit your limit.

616
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,344
Then you can put my head on a spike.

617
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,472
If that's not the case yet,

618
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,143
why don't you cut your losses
and bury the hatchet?

619
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:08,023
I've got no say
in whichever decision you make,

620
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,150
but if you go with the former,

621
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,278
you'll need a lot more spikes.

622
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,657
You'll need to put countless actors'
heads on spikes after mine,

623
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,909
and in the end,

624
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,203
your own head

625
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,331
will share our fate.

626
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,626
Man, get a load of this fucking bitch.

627
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,127
Choose the latter,

628
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:34,091
and I'm willing
to put down everything I have.

629
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,342
And if you promise

630
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,221
not to lay a single finger
on any actors going forward,

631
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,972
I might even hold off

632
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,350
on the follow-up article for now.

633
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,563
Now choose.

634
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,947
The whereabouts
of the actress Jeong Hee-ran,

635
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:01,368
who stirred up controversy at last night's
Daejong Film Awards, remain unknown.

636
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,122
The police have started a search
for Ms. Jeong right away,

637
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:09,042
and reports from citizens are pouring in,
but the investigation is at a standstill

638
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,461
as the reason for her disappearance
is yet unclear.

639
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:15,173
Police have widened their search
based on Ms. Jeong's speech

640
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:19,678
and the contents of the mysterious flyers
that were distributed across Seoul.

641
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:23,223
They are also raiding the office
of Mr. Ku Jung-ho of Shinsung Pictures,

642
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,475
who Ms. Jeong referred to in her speech.

643
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:30,730
Ms. Jeong burst onto the scene
in 1972 with her debut film Desire

644
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,651
and has remained a beloved,
high-profile actress for over a decade.

645
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:39,322
Shinsung Pictures produced
this year's biggest hit, Madame Aema.

646
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,784
The production company
has been making films since the '70s,

647
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,537
winning Best Picture
at the Daejong Awards several times

648
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,623
to earn its name
as a Chungmuro powerhouse.

649
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,429
Hey, let's go grab some hangover soup.

650
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,017
The hell do you think you're--

651
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,519
Sorry about this, sir.

652
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,566
Take him away.

653
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,405
Let go, you bastards.

654
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,740
Let go of me!

655
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,794
Living in Korea as Aema…

656
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,548
won't be easy. Not even for a moment.

657
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,512
But knowing you…

658
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,100
I think you'll pull it off.

659
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,695
Don't give in.

660
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:45,949
Are you okay?

661
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,576
Yeah.

662
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,328
You know me.

663
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:58,753
You're leaving?

664
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,672
Yeah.

665
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,595
Now that I know you're all right,

666
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,806
I should get going.

667
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,830
Entering the '80s has changed nothing.

668
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,042
We live in just as shitty a world as ever.

669
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,378
It still fucks us over every day,

670
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,799
and the new era is a fucking lie.

671
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,636
That's why

672
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,098
I'm going to be an even bigger…

673
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,769
a much bigger bitch.

674
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,824
Thank you for…

675
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,957
coming here with me.

676
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,164
Born in '51, the Year of the Rabbit.

677
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,460
I was born in '50, the Year of the Tiger.

678
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,254
I guess I'm older.

679
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,468
Right you are,

680
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,552
sir.

681
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,935
Hang in there, kid.

682
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,440
Yes,

683
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,192
sir.

684
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,409
It was dark

685
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,037
and seemed out of reach…

686
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,585
but we've come a long way.

687
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,467
And we'll never be going back.

699
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,241
Hello, everyone.

700
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:42,829
Today's guest needs no introduction.
She is Korea's definitive sex symbol.

701
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,749
The heroine of the film Madame Aema,
Ms. Shin Ju-ae, is with us!

702
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,337
Introduce yourself now.

703
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,258
Hello, I'm Shin Ju-ae.

704
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,635
Nice to meet you all.

705
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,470
Nice to meet you. I'm Shin Ju-ae.

706
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,766
My, Ms. Shin Ju-ae!
Your voice alone just oozes eroticism!

707
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,437
He says he can feel your eroticism
just from your voice.

708
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:15,403
Even that reserved reaction
radiates eroticism.

709
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,488
I love it, this reserved eroticism!

710
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,241
Let me start with this question.

711
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,828
Koreans tend to be more conservative
when it comes to sex,

712
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:27,373
so how is the life
of a sex symbol in Korea?

713
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,752
What does it mean
to live as a sex symbol in Korea?

714
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,303
It's like entering a boxing ring.

715
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,349
You simply have to tough it out,

716
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,434
by hook or by crook.

717
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,897
And, no matter how hard you try,
a day may come…

718
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,067
when you get knocked out cold.

719
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,113
But once you find meaning
in the daily struggle itself

720
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,492
and realize the value
in each and every day…

721
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,162
there's nothing to fear.

722
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,792
That's why I hope…

723
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,588
people don't forget…

724
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,759
that we are still…

725
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,180
in the ring together.

726
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,530
PREDATION NIGHT
FINAL DRAFT

727
01:01:58,923 --> 01:01:59,757
Ju-ae.

728
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,559
Hey, Ms. Shin Ju-ae.

729
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,604
Are you busy?

730
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:16,941
Here.

731
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,738
Just skim through it,

732
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,742
and make sure to rinse your eyes
once you're done.

733
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,586
DOE'S DESIRE

734
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,259
LUST ON FIRE

735
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,928
WET PETALS

736
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,159
A glass of wine, please.

737
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,076
Sure.

738
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,703
Excuse me.

739
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,623
I'd like some tomato juice, please.

740
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:14,582
Sure.

741
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,987
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
