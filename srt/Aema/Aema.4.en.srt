never to be seen again.

179
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,619
But if you decide to just leave her be,

180
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,039
she'll become
a full-fledged actress eventually.

181
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,378
Everyone wins… don't you think?

182
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,922
[man chuckles]

183
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,882

[grumbling intensifies]

186
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,950
Open it.

187
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,789
[music fades]

188
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,792
The clothes you came in
and your belongings.

189
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,005
What you're wearing now is very expensive.

190
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,968
It's not for every day.
Wear it for a fancy date somewhere.

191
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,386
[laughs]

192
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,183
I'll return them right now.

193
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,269
You probably bought this
using taxpayer money.

194
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,353
[man sniggers]

195
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,234
Mm. Take it.

196
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,115
Don't let your pride get in the way.

197
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,034
Take it while you still can.

198
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,078
I won't be as generous next time.

199
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,751
[energetic synth-pop music playing]

[music fades]

201
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,555
You sick piece of shit.

202
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,433
Whoring out a girl
who hasn't even debuted!

203
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,852
- You a pimp or something?!
- All right, listen!

204
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,188
You feel humiliated, yeah?
Welcome to the club, then.

205
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,106
- We've all been humiliated!
- Who cares?

206
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:40,569
That excuse is disgusting! Why the hell
did you say yes to those guys?!

207
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,447
Fucking hell, it's not like
I can say no to them, Hee-ran! Yeah?

208
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,700
Name one person with the balls to do that.
I bet <i>you </i>couldn't!

209
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,831
Talking a fresh-faced kid who's still wet
behind the ears into selling her dignity…

210
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,543
How dare you destroy her future
for your own benefit?

211
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,670
You're disgusting.

212
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,381
You didn't have the courage
to protect even one girl.

213
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,508
Some producer you are!

214
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,178
You say that as if anyone
has any real power in this country!

215
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,015
A place where you can get hauled away,
and the next day you turn up dead!

216
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,811
You are only interested in yourself.

217
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,564
You disgust me with your lack of loyalty.

218
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,481
[scoffs]

219
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,568
You can compromise on all of your values
if it benefits you.

220
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,404
You'll betray anything and anyone.

221
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,197
Right?

222
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,324
What's your point, Hee-ran?

223
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,409
[Jung-ho sighs]

224
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,836
As you know, I wanted this film to fail
more than anyone.

225

MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND PUBLIC INFORMATION

226
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,925
If we let it flop like this, we'll lose
what little is left of our dignity.

227
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,094
All films would suffer.

228
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,305
We'd be setting an awful precedent.

229
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,265

233
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,116
Oh, you did good.

234
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,659
In return,

235
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,204
I expect to see some big changes
in this production.

236
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,167
I might as well do this properly
since I have no choice.

237
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,920
First, we're getting rid
of that ridiculous script.

238
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,089
My next demand
is that you stay out of sight.

239
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,800
Don't meddle.

240
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,306
- [door opens]
- [Mi-na screaming] Hey! Ku Jung-ho!

241
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,517
Ahhh, the crazy bitch is here.

[Mi-na panting]

243
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,063
[quietly] Shit.

244
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,737
I heard there was a grand banquet.
Why didn't I hear about it from you, huh?

245
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,114
[high-pitched laughter]

246
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,699
I can't believe this shit.

247
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,534
Protecting my virtue,

248
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,871
'cause now you think
you're my husband or white knight?

249
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,290
Like I'm your little doll!

250
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,835
Well, wake the hell up!

251
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,090
Stop holding out on me,
you fucking bastard!

252
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,676
- [screeching]
- Why are you blackout drunk again?!

253
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,804
Mi-na! Have you lost your damn mind,
drunken alcoholic?

254
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,013
[Mi-na scoffs]

255
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,725
You! Did you also go?

256
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,228
Has she been there?!

257
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,480
Curse you!

258
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,650
Where you going? Get back here! Huh?!

259
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,569
Think you're special? 'Cause you're not!

260
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,656
[squeals] I should've been there!

261
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,826
I was crowned the queen at the last one!

[door opens]

265
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,135
I pestered Yeong-bae
into giving me your home address.

00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,763
- I'm sorry for coming here out of nowhere.

00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,915
You said trying too hard
was tacky and unrefined.

271
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,338
I guess this is definitely
trying too hard.

272
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,090
[subdued poignant music playing]

273
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,843
…MIGHT AS WELL BE A BADASS BITCH
LIKE JEONG HEE-RAN

274
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,813
After my mother died,

275
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,983
there were only men at home.

276
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,198
My four older brothers
all had victim complexes.

277
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,825
As for my dad…

278
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,958
I'd rather kill myself than spend my life
hand-washing five men's underwear.

279
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,047
I needed to be anywhere else.

280
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,175
So eventually,
I packed up and got outta there.

281
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,971
I would have done anything
that was asked of me,

282
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,391
as long as it meant
I wouldn't have to go back home again.

283
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,812
You were right, y'know.

284
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,608
I almost lost myself that night.

285
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,820
Had it not been for you,

286
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,156
things would've unfolded
a lot differently.

287
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,994
I thought that in order to protect myself,

288
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,957
I had no choice
but to protect the film as well.

289
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,879
I'm grateful.

290
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
I had to say thank you.
That's why I'm here.

[ashtray rustling]

292
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,267
Why are you unloading
this sob story onto me?

293
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,769
What happened to your whole bitch persona?

294
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,689
You're not special.

295
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,234
So you left your tragic life behind
to become a lowly actor.

296
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,820
There's five million "you"s out there.

297
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:19,491
A bitch with a tragic backstory
is still a bitch.

298
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,952
So I say keep being one.

299
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,497
Production will still carry on.

300
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,583
Not because you did something

301
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,043
but because you didn't.

302
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,465
Why do you really wanna be an actor?

303
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,971
You needed a reason to get out,
didn't you?

304
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,058
And you wanna give it your all,
everything you've got…

305
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,560
But what else?

306
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,687
Why?

Grab some chopsticks and chow down.

313
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,649
It's crazy how much money I made

314
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,276
in just one night.

315
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,406
I wanted to tear it into pieces…
but I couldn't do it.

316
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,160
Not when this much cash was on the line,
y'know?

317
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,376
What in the world do <i>I </i>do
with one million won?

318
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,757
I mean, what else is there to do?

319
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,011
[quavering] Just enjoy it, yeah?

[poignant music playing]

321
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,282
You aren't gonna ask
what I had to do for the money?

322
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,577
I just…

323
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,834
I'm so sorry.

324
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,506
Looks like we're both sorry, huh?

325
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,801
It's, um…

326
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,680
[sniffles] …a shame, I guess.

It's money I'm laundering.

But what else?

353
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,710
Why do you really wanna be an actor?

354
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,506
I was in a school play, and

355
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,009
<i>I got to be on stage for the first time.</i>

356
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,770
<i>As a child, I was always taught</i>
<i>to make myself smaller,</i>

357
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,397
<i>to remain quiet.</i>

358
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,988
<i>But on that stage,</i>

359
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,366
<i>I finally discovered that I had a voice.</i>

360
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,414
<i>That I felt things</i>
<i>deeply and passionately.</i>

361
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,499
[music becomes exhilarating]

362
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,128
<i>For the first time, I felt like myself.</i>

363
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,256
<i>It was like</i>

364
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,509
<i>I had finally discovered who I was.</i>

365
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,191
Being here makes me feel like
I'm abroad or something.

366
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,070
I never took you as someone
who appreciated the great outdoors.

367
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,780
Director,

368
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,326
I really wanted no part in this thing.

369
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,578
Yeah. I'm aware.

370
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,914
I hated it with such a passion

371
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,125
that I prayed
that it would flop every day.

372
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,003
That, I didn't know.

373
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,756
But I've changed my perspective.

374
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,718
Since I <i>have </i>to do it,
I guess I should make it better.

375
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:19,976
It dawned on me recently,
we hadn't yet talked about the script.

376
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,689
I know I'm not playing Aema,
but tell me something,

377
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,275
why is she always masturbating?

378
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,363
Oh, why so shy?
You're the one who wrote her like that.

379
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,032
She does it while showering,
while driving her car,

380
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,035
next to her sleeping husband…

381
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,663
That's gotta be a mental illness, right?

382
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,373
I'm sorry, ma'am.

383
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,917
Oh, save your apologizing.

384
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,211
I just wanted to know the reason.

385
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,382
Why this poor woman's been driven
to a life of masturbation.

386
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,389
[somber electronic music playing]

387
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,684
[clears throat] Since--
Well, <i>Aema </i>is a story of sexual desire.

388
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,520
I figured the character needed a quirk
like that to fit the film's tone.

389
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,690
And masturbation is the only version
of sex that's independent.

390
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,276
It's unlike sex in that
it's a non-stop race to your desire,

391
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,235
individually.

392
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,029
A whole entire universe of pleasure
that exists for oneself.

393
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,699
It's more than just masturbation.
It's liberation!

394
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,912
- [music stops]
- Hm. All right.

395
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,791
Instead of focusing
on the act of masturbation,

396
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,919
don't you think it'd be better
to describe the feelings and emotions

397
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,921
of the masturbator in detail?

398
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,385
Even a middle-school boy
wouldn't touch themselves this frequently.

399
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,305
Oh, here. "Scene number 46."

400
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,390
The first scene I wanted to discuss.

401
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,600
Okay, right here.

402
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,686
After Aema's husband goes to prison,

403
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,689
Aema then decides
to get an apartment with Erika.

404
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,109
She then finds out that her first love,
Yun-ho, is living right upstairs.

405
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,653
"Scene number 46."

406
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,616
"Aema and Erika are moving
into their apartment."

407
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,328
"It was an afternoon much like any other."

408
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,205
"<i>The two women return</i>
<i>from grocery shopping."</i>

409
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,958
<i>"They look forward to the peaceful life</i>
<i>that lies ahead of them."</i>

410
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,668
<i>"Or so they think."</i>

411
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,177
- [Erika] Mm?
- [Yun-ho gasps]

412
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,137
[retro erotic music playing]

413
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,183
[Hee-ran] "<i>Erika's heart suddenly sinks</i>
<i>as she encounters Yun-ho."</i>

414
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,310
[Aema moans softly, gasps]

415
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,897
"<i>So imagine how Aema</i>
<i>must be feeling in this moment."</i>

416
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,982
[Aema gasps breathily, echoing]

417
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,275
[Yun-ho] <i>Aema.</i>

418
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,861
- [baby babbles]
- [woman] Ah, that's a good baby.

419
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,779
[Aema gasps]

420
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,947
- [woman] Peekaboo!
- [Yun-ho grunts]

421
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,993
[woman] Can you say "Mama"?
Say "Mama." "Mama!"

422
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,746
[Erika] <i>He lives on… the 11th floor?!</i>

423
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,956
[Hee-ran] "<i>Seeing Aema again</i>
<i>reminds Yun-ho</i>

424
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,751
<i>of all the beautiful memories</i>
<i>they've shared in the past."</i>

425
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,213
"Aema too recalls the memories
of their love."

426
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,715
Then, shocking no one, touches herself.

427
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,050
[music fades]

428
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,178
Touching herself, left and right.
Ugh! It's weird.

429
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:01,888
[clears throat softly]

430
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,101
- "Erika notices Aema's faltering resolve."
- [retro erotic music playing]

431
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,896
"Erika grabs onto Aema's shoulders
and shakes her, saying…

00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,233
- [breathily] "Aema, get it together."
- [camera whirring]

433
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,360
- "Get it together, Aema."
- Get it together, Aema.

434
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,239
That man, as you knew him, is dead.

435
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,576
The man you fell in love with,
he's different now.

436
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,498
And so are you.
He died to you the moment he betrayed you.

437
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,333
[sighs] <i>Unni!</i>

438
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,502
Slap me in the face, Erika.

439
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,296
Then this nightmare can finally end.

440
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,632
Slap me, please, as hard as you can!

441
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,677

[Jun-ho sobbing shakily]

445
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,944
Now, coming up,

'kay?

[scornfully] <i>Yun-ho was blinded</i>

[Yun-ho] Hmm<i>.</i>

- Who…
- Shhhh!

It's me. Yun-ho.

458
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,616
Aema… you belonged to me once.

459
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,452
Why'd you take so long to return?

460
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,704
[gasps] Yun-ho, we can't!

461
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,540
Please don't do this. Please!

Why does Erika moan in corners constantly?

481

Her character pisses me off.

482
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,187
"As Yun-ho's hands caress her,

I mean, seriously?

496
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,990
You want me to believe

497
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,576
you understand what women want?

498
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,080
- [In-u sighs]
- [music fades]

499
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,041
You see, Aema, well, she…

500
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,502
she still really longed to be with
her first love deep down.

501
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,339
Except now that she's married to another,
there's no way she could.

502
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,258
And also, Yun-ho is married.
He has a wife and child.

503
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,053
So, even though she desires Yun-ho,
Aema's too overcome with guilt.

504
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,095
And that's why he, um--

505
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,556
Yeah, I'm sorry,
there's not a single woman on this planet

506
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,517
who would use any of those reasons
as justification for rape.

507
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:22,148
Didn't you tell me your objective was
showing desire from a woman's perspective?

508
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,735
- [sighs]
- Ah! Too late.

509
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,947
Scrap that idea. That ship has sailed.

510
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,700
You don't know a thing about women.

511
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,913
And, uh, we've filmed too much
of the script already, haven't we?

512
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,665
I can understand.

513
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,794
You were hoping <i>Madame Aema</i>
would accomplish two different things.

514
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,588
You wanted to make
a European art house erotica,

515
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,258
but you mentioned
this conceptual approach that's layered,

516
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,344
that's… dramatic, y'know?

517
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,512
The Japanese thing?

518
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,556
<i>Ero guro nansensu.</i>

What?

534
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,416
I'm just saying,
you were sent here by Mr. Gi,

535
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,002
so I'm trusting you
against all better judgment.

536
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,838
But, gosh,
it's something about that face of yours.

Oof, and your eyes.

This would all make up one outfit.

696
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,662
Good work.

697
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,206
And your little smile,

698
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,750
it looked nice.

00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,237
Hee-ran, wait. I wanted to say something.

701
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,198
I hope that you never lose yourself.

[music fades]

703
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,786
Um, what I mean to say is,
I don't want any harm coming your way.

704
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,873
Or for you to end up in a bad position.

706
00:43:56,342 --> 00:44:00,012
You're a woman of power and influence,
so I don't know if you'd ever need this.

707
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,057
But I figured I'd share it anyway.

708
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,061
It might come in handy for you
one of these days.

709
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,646
But, um,

710
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,231
if I overstepped,

711
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,942
then I'm sorry.

712
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,988
What exactly do you think
you saw that day?

713
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,619
If you're not sure what you saw…

714
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,123

It's been two weeks.

719
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,905
Just one week without eating
can kill a person, y'know?

720
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,866
Not if I drink water, it won't.

721
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,119
If you drink water. Not alcohol.

722
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,831
What's wrong?

723
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,166

How cute!

There's so much of me left to indulge in,
and you don't wanna miss out.

Would you be okay
with a different banquet?

I hear there's gonna be another one soon.

What's the catch for this one?

735
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,790
It's a different kind of banquet.
It's gonna be a bit of a mixed bag.

C'mon, baby.

737
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,340
How can you say that?

738
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,136
I'm a mixed bag in the flesh.

739
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,021
Why settle for something
predictable and boring

740
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,442

Aema,

00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,148
I'm telling you it's not too late.

766
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,569
Start trying to find a way
to be your own person.

767
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,906
Stop living as someone's wife
and as someone's memories.

768
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,534
Don't live for them anymore.

769
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,329
[regular voice] So that one day,

770
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,623
you will learn

771
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,793
to love everything about yourself.

772
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,339
No matter how much the world
tries to chain you or hold you down,

773
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,674
don't shrink away.

774
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,594
Don't let them push you
to make yourself small.

775
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,430
And whatever the case,

776
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,724
protect yourself.

Okay.

on <i>Madame Aema</i>!

You've been through a lot, but you did it.

- [man 4] We actually did it!
- [man 5] Yeah, awesome job.

- [man 3] You were amazing.

I want you to know how grateful I am.

00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,488
Grateful for what?

790
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,615
We were just acting.

791
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,951
Now get going.

to take your things with you, guys.

Don't forget anything.
Don't leave anything.

Everybody…

797
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:43,063
I would like to thank you
for all your hard work on this film.

798
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,399
My sweetheart couldn't make it tonight,

799
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:49,194
so I organized this humble dinner
for all of you to enjoy tonight.

800
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,906
To say thank you for a job well done.

801
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,158
So please, enjoy.

802

Ms. Ju-ae?

803
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,960
Hmm.

804
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,921
You probably aren't aware,

805
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,425
but I've always been a big fan of yours
right from the very start.

806
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,885
Actors know other actors. Hmm.

807
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,268
And as it turns out,
we're both quite similar.

808
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,521
I see the same things in your eyes.

809
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,065

[man 5] Another glass! Another glass! Sir?

823
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,523
We hit a lot of snags
on this film in particular.

824

[easy-listening music plays in background]

825
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,778
It was hard for us both.

826

Please, you know it's all over now,
and you're trying to draw out this moment.

827
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,578
Don't be clingy now.

828
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,872
[patronizing] I know
getting dumped is hard.

829
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,125
But your heartbreak will eventually heal.

830
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,921
Ah, yeah. So about that.

831
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,091
There's a hiccup
you might wanna be aware of.

832
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,808
I was looking at your contract earlier.

833
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,059
[sighs dramatically]

834
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,103
The law's a fickle beast.

835
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,983
According to article three, paragraph two,
it says that you are to,

836
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:56,696
"star as the lead in 12 total films
produced by Shinsung Pictures."

837

Did you hear me?

The lead, Hee-ran.

839
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,621
Your character in this film
was only supporting, wasn't it?

840
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,668
So, by law, I can't rightfully qualify it
as your last film.

841
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,962
Man, the law's a harsh mistress,
I tell ya.

842
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,674
[resignedly] But that's how the law is.

843
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,176
It's completely inflexible.

844
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,262
And very cruel.

After that, we can finally part ways.

00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,541
Hmm.
