Didn't I say to stop doing that?

[man] Now, times have changed.

39
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,564
Because this ain't
the 1970s anymore, people.

40
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,817
My friends, the '80s is a brand-new era.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,652
An era ruled by three things.

42
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,406
And those are the screen, sex, and sports.

43
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,032
Times have changed, so you might ask,

44
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,660
"How does the film industry
change along with them?"

45
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,455

no Korean movie's gone before.

Wait, you said sports too though.

from the airport, okay?

59
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,118
But until then,

60

let's make some trouble, huh? [laughs]

61
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,999

all the reporters a ring?

- [music fades]
- [Yeong-bae] And tell them what?

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,412
That I'm taking them all to lunch.

107
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,956

110

[Hee-ran softly] I did some counting.

111
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,598
Since my debut back in '72 with <i>Desire</i>,

112
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,144
I have been the lead actress
in over 30 films in my career.

113
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,731
In all of my various roles,
I held nothing back.

114
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,983
You've seen all of me.

115
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,404

I mean that quite literally, as you know.

So far, I've had so much love and support

120
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,794
and a successful career.

121
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,423
But now that it's the '80s,

122
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,925
I'm thinking it's time for a change.

123
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,926
Out with the old!

124
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,304
And instead,
we'll try something new, y'know?

125
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,849
So, from now on,

126
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,519

What?

00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,816
Read the papers.
You're a damn movie director.

She's no longer our lead.

154
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,701
So what do you think, huh? Eriko…

155
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,703
- Erika?
- Yeah, yeah.

156

What? What's the issue?

160
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,506
I'm not, um… against new talent.
It's just that…

161
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,633
I-- I mean, being an unknown actress

162
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,719
gave Sylvia Kristel's portrayal
of <i>Emmanuelle </i>way more attention.

163
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,681
New faces are always a plus in this genre.
But, uh…

164
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,227
Will Hee-ran be okay with this though?

165
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,771
The character of Erika
is a supporting one.

166
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,691
And what is she gonna do about it?
She's under contract.

167
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,153
An open casting call is what I want.

168
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,656

got it?

- Mr. Gi.
- [Gi] Thank you.

174
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:55,177
Uh… so, um, since we'll be
reimagining the whole character,

175
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,930
what do you think
about reworking the story as well?

176
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,682
Instead of in-your-face mindlessness,

177
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,768
we could instead have deep,
subtle, and artistic,

178
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,645
um, uh… something different!

179
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,316
You can be subtle and artsy if you'd like.
Just get them as hard as a rock.

180
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,444
Oh, I will, I will! So hard…
They're gonna be rock hard 'cause…

181
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,863
Wh-- when I say "subtle,"
I just, uh, I mean that, uh…

182
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:18,117
The super sexy won't kick in right away
but, uh, it's gonna be just a slow burn.

183
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,370
But then it overtakes you, and then, uh…

184
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,414
while you're caught off guard, it just…

185
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,582
The film

186
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,334
has you rock hard, and…

187
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,753
deeply and profoundly…

188
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,589
horny.

189
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,676
[sighs]

190
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,012
I'll rewrite it, then.

191
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,139
And this Eriko broad, make her--

192
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,223
It's Erika.

193
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,686
Yeah, since she'll be played by Hee-ran,
have her as a world-class bitch, huh?

194
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,856
Trust me,
that girl's gonna come crawling back

195
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,026
once she realizes she's no longer
the media's little darling.

196
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,278
She's let it all get to her head.

197
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,530
Been on a pedestal too long.

198
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,157
Let's knock her down a peg.

199
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,464
OPEN CASTING CALLS
FOR THE LEADING LADY OF MADAME AEMA

200
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,800
Should I go tell 'em you're sorry?

201
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,510
I'll say you asked me to do it.

202
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,261
Tomato? It's fresh.

203
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,940
<i>Noona</i>… they're recasting you.

204
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,067
They're having you play Erika.

205
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,736
This is so wrong. She's a small role.

206
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,363
It's beneath you.

207
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,782
How could he do this to you?

208
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,827
Mmm!

209
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,620
I heard that, apparently…

210
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,039
Huh?

211
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,209
…Director Kwon Do-il's
been working on a new screenplay.

212
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,628
Last I heard about it was in spring.

213
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,172
INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED
KOREAN AUTEUR KWON DO-IL

214
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,258
[apprehensive music playing]

215
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,221
[Yeong-bae grunts]

216
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,726
[panting]

217
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,061
I saw him leave Dongsin Inn.

218
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,564
He's in Jingogae. And he's alone.

219
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:12,982
Mm.

220
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,032
[music fades]

221
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,118
- [woman] There. Welcome to…
- [bell jingles]

222
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,870
Oh my word! Oh my, oh my!

223
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,372
It's Jeong Hee-ran! It's Jeong Hee-ran!

224
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,416
[laughing hysterically]

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,418
Oh my God, it's her!

226
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,796
[Hee-ran moans softly]

227
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,138
It's been quite some time
since we last met.

228
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,976
I must say, I absolutely adored
<i>Woman in the Dark, </i>by the way.

229
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,771
Goodness.
The entire time I was crying my eyes out.

230
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,191
Why were you crying?
That film wasn't a tearjerker.

231
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,777
Why, I was mad at myself.

232
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,489
I turned down
working with such a great director.

233
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,324
I completely understood though.

234
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,034
You were planning your wedding.

235
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,286
- I would have turned it down too.
- [chuckles softly]

236
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,288
We actually called the wedding off.

237
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,540
It's better this way.

238
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,126
We get along well as business partners.

239
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,047
Mmm, and while we're on
the topic of business…

240
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,591
You're working on a new script, right?

241
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,053
What do you think
about producing it with Shinsung?

242
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,722
- [subdued funk music playing]
- If you did, you could cast me.

243
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,475
- We could finally work together. Hm?
- [liquid pouring]

244
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,602
Shinsung, you say?

245
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,686
Sure.

246
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,315
I mean, Ku Jung-ho and I
went to school together.

247
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,277
Any chance that there'd be a part
for little old me in there, huh?

248
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,449
As an actor, you know,
I'm not half bad. [chuckles smugly]

249
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,244
[sensually] Mmm.

250
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,331
[smacks lips, inhales deeply]

251
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,834
The idea is still pretty rough.

252
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,086
And the script needs a whole lotta work.

253
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,964
Can we get a bottle of Toad?

254
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,384
I, uh… I'm done drinking for now.

255
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,303
I have some work to finish up later.

256
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,306
Then mind if I drink on my own?

257
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,643
I've had a wonderful evening
catching up with you.

258
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,229
Walking down memory lane. Hm!

259
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,273
[lighter pings, ignites]

260
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,607
[music ends]

261
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,234
Yeong-bae.

262
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,735
Yes?

263
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,780
You said you were friends
with his production team head, right?

264
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,324
- I wouldn't say "friends."
- [exhales]

265
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,994
Then change that.
Go get the guy to like you.

266
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,497
The two of you are brothers now.
I need Kwon Do-il's new script.

267
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,876
I don't care how you do it.
Do whatever you need to.

268
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,170
- What are you gonna do, <i>Noona</i>?
- [inhales deeply]

269
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,259
My exclusivity contract says I owe
that Ku Jung-ho bastard one final film.

270
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,802
One more with Shinsung.

271
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,556
If I can get Kwon Do-il to cast me,

272
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,727
I can deliver Shinsung that final movie,
and it'll all work out nicely.

273
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,772
Which means we have two tasks, you and I.

274
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,402
To start, we'll do what we have to
to win Kwon Do-il's affection.

275
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,987
And second,

276
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,657
it's imperative we stop
the Aema casting call.

277
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,242
You understand?

278
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,750
[Jung-ho] <i>Remember hostess films?</i>

279
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,460
Real big in the '70s.

280
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,045
Yeah, the actresses got naked,

281
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,756
but the movies weren't
technically erotica at all.

282
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,716
They just used nudity as a distraction,

283
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,886
so you wouldn't notice
it was actually another tearjerker.

284
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,555
Back then,
they really couldn't bare it all.

285
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,350
But hear me out.
<i>Madame Aema </i>will be different.

286
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,976
This'll change the industry.

287
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,520
A bona fide adult film.

288
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,939
- This way, please!
- [Jung-ho] Sure.

289
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,983
[camera shutter clicking]

290
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,028
The core premise of the film
will be pleasure.

291
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,113
Women's pleasure.

292
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,949
Ay! [scoffs]

293
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,075
Oh, come on.

294
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,912
What girl… mmm… doesn't like horses?

295
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,246
[women giggling]

296
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,414
[Jung-ho whinnies]

297
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,875
You ladies see where I'm goin'?

298
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,794
Now pump those fists in the air!

299
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,878
You got it.

300
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,090
We're creating
a whole new genre with <i>Aema</i>.

301
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,550
- We'll be pioneers of the industry.
- [camera shutter clicks]

302
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,345
If you invest in Shinsung,
you have my word,

303
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,180
we won't let you down.

304
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:14,932
Here we go!

305
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,768
- [all] Cheese!
- [camera shutter clicks]

306
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,605
Enough with the horses or whatever
the heck you said about the ladies.

307
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,150
If your goal is for us
to take this thing seriously,

308
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,570
why are you casting some nobody
as your lead actress, huh--

309
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,488
[grunts] Oh!

310
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,370
What about the Honam people, then, huh?

311
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,247
Have you considered
how much they'll hate it?

312
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,791
[Jung-ho] Yes!

313
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:45,004
President Wang,
I'm not some amateur here! [laughs]

314
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,798
You're looking at the genius
who gave everybody Jeong Hee-ran, 'kay?

315
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,716
Remember that!

316
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,762
In Honam alone,
she had over 50,000 viewers

317
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,681
in the first film I put her in.

318
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,184
And thanks to that, you got to build
five new theaters in Mokpo,

319
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,978
didn't ya, President Wang?

320
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,230
I'd never steer you astray.

321
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,025
Ku Jung-ho

322
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,194
has still got that magic!

323
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,821
Hoo!

324
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,240
Hoo!

325
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,202
[suspenseful music fades in]

Well, then. Should I just stand?

331
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,012
Don't just sit there. Grab her a chair!
What the heck are you waiting for?

332
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:35,971
[man] Got it.

- [In-u clears throat]
- [lighter pings]

336
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,362
Tell me, Director. When did we first meet?

337
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,990
Filming <i>Yeong-ja</i>? Or was it <i>The Rose</i>?

338
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,576
[In-u] It was during <i>Seong Chun-hyang</i>.

339
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,917
Ah, yes, I remember you being
a green little assistant director then.

340
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,462
You could barely make eye contact with me.

341
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,381
Hair a mess. Always blushing in the face.

342
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,509
You were an adorable little potato.

343
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,219
Anyway,

344
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,013
I hear I'm Erika now.

345
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,264
I mean-- [hiccups]

346
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,603
Well, I, um… I was actually meaning
to talk to you about that.

347
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:26,980
Director…

348
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:28,982
[chuckles]

349

in my memories.

696
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,217
CASTING CALL FOR MADAME AEMA

697
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,012
- [In-u] Okay, thank you.
- [man] Yes, see you later. Whoa--

698
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,347
[hypnotic music playing]

699
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,786
Hi, I'm here to formally introduce myself.

700
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,582
I'm Shin Ju-ae.

701
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:48,172
When I was last here, I wasn't able
to answer the producer's question.

702
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,925
So I'll answer it now.

703
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,761
I was asked if I'd get naked on camera.

704
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,852
[man] Hmm?

705
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,021
[breathes shakily]

706
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,326
Yes, I'll strip down if you ask me to.

707
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,579
I can do anything the part requires.

708
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,001
A hundred times if needed.

709
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,801
[chuckles softly]

710
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,637
And I won't just strip either.

711
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,931
I'll put my body on the line.

712
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,936
I'll do anything

713
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,189
to work on this film as hard as I can.

714
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,566
[breathes shakily]

715
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,820
In exchange

716
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,992
for me going above and beyond,
I have just one request for you.

717
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,789
If I'm going to do this
and work on your film…

718
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,253
[music intensifies]

719
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,298
[music abates]

720
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,467
…you'll turn me into
the next Jeong Hee-ran.

721
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,719
[music fades]

722
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,513
[vibrant disco music playing]

723
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,895
