00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,055
That was fun.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,516
You enjoying yourself?

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,478
Why, you must be over the moon right now.

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,815
Since everything's been going your way,
hasn't it?

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,862
Every year, for the last ten or so,

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,698
hundreds of you come here

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,910
dreaming of becoming Jeong Hee-ran,
the next "it" girl, right?

9
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,579
They all fail.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,832
I'm not going anywhere, honey.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,711
Hundreds of girls
fade back into obscurity.

12
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,674
You must think you're special.
I'll tell you now that you're not.

13
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,428
You'll fail and go back to being a nobody

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,848
without ever even knowing the reasons why.

15
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,025
Look at me.

16
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,944
I'm Jeong Hee-ran.

17
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,742
I don't care how desperate you are.

18
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,871
You'll never be me, so don't even bother.

19

[footsteps retreating]

20
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,048
[Hee-ran] You can leave now.

21
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,721
Hey.

22
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,225
I said you can leave.

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,519
[Ju-ae sniffs]

24
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,355
Sure, I'll leave.

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,028
I'd like the opinions
of the other judges before I go though.

28
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,285
There's that "it" factor!

29
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,995
What you said earlier. Hmm?

30
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,248
That girl's got some spunk in 'er!

31
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,916
One thing's for certain,

32
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,503
this lovely little lady's
our hot new siren of the silver screen!

[thumps table]

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,763
I spent the past few weeks…
searching everywhere for this woman.

36
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,100
And even if you were to kick her out now,

37
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,519
well, I-- I'd do it all over.

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,689
I'd just find her and bring her back.

39

[disco music playing]

40
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,411
You're all morons. [scoffs]

41
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,919
Yeah! Ooh, lookin' good!

42
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,715
Hey! Get over here, Director.
Get in the picture!

43
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,800
- This'll be in the history books.
- Right. Great.

44
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,385
Over here, c'mon.

45
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,221
- All right, everyone.
- [Gi] All right, let's go. The final shot!

46
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,140
Big toothy smiles!

47
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,517
And say, "<i>Madame Aema"</i>!

48
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,437

[music fades]

52
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,003
[Gi] As you're under contract
with the studio,

53
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,422
you'll live in places like this
from now on.

54
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,924
It's more fitting.

55
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,844
You're a star now.
Be sure to remember that.

56
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,095
[water stops]

57
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,101
Are there, uh, any open positions?

58
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,563
LET US LIVE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS!
LABORERS DESERVE RESPECT TOO

- [Geun-ha squeals softly]
- [laughs]

64
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:14,128
I signed a contract. They even got me
an apartment, so it's "official" official.

65
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,882
You should work with these guys.

66
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,304
I asked them, and they said
the head of production needs an assistant.

67
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,726
What about the girls?

68
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,688
They'll still be stuck there.

69
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,569
Chungmuro's a place
full of fuckin' snakes,

70
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,864
and… I can't do this on my own.

71
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,826
They say it's a new era.

72
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,120
And that means
new beginnings for both of us.

73
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:48,997
Geun-ha…

74
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,417
I'm heading into war here.

[lighter pings, ignites]

76
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,850
- [Hee-ran] The early termination fee.
- [lighter clicks]

77
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,936
[exhales] It's even more
than our initial agreement.

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,230
- [scoffs]
- So let's part ways.

79
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,940
End on good terms.

80
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,071
You're incredibly predictable,
you know that?

81
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,409
I already broke things off once
because it's what you wanted.

82
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,578
Ms. Jeong Hee-ran,

83
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,789
it's unfortunate that
business transactions would be useless

84
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,584
if there weren't any penalties
for the other party breaking the rules.

85
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,793
It's how the law works.

86
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,920
So, if you still wanna break things off,

87
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,507
then the early termination fee
is just gonna be the start, baby.

88
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,387
You think a termination fee would be
enough for me to walk away? Uh-uh.

89
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,181
Don't pick a fight with me.

90
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,308
Unless you want me to bleed you dry.

91
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,561
[sighs] You got one project left.

92
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,605
So just ride it out!

93
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,941
You can even close your eyes if you want,
like a good little girl.

94
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,946
And once that's done,
I'll dump you like you want, 'kay? C'mon!

95
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,740
[thoughtful piano music playing]

96
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,619
All right.

97
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,956
Let's just get one thing straight here.

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,044
Audiences turn up by the millions
to see my films in theaters.

99
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,048
I've won more awards
and accolades than I can count.

100
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,343
And every month,
I'm shooting a new commercial.

101

103
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,265
Am I making myself clear?

104
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,479
I'm adored by millions of viewers.

105
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,064
They can't get enough.

106
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,903
So, whatever happens,

107
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,615
I won't be the one that they turn on.

108
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,576
It'll be you.

109
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,917
Mm-hmm!

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,001

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,344
Yeah.

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,721
Great.

115
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,558
You start in the morning.

116
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,269
Huh?

117
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,771
Just remember this.

118
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,984
Everything you see and experience
from now on is top secret.

119
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,278
That's my only condition.

120
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,156
You don't get a salary.

121
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,951
But what you <i>will </i>make
is pretty dang good. Eh?

It's on the third floor.

brand-new to the city,

170
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,624

00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,930
Huh?! [gasps]

177
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,264
- [laughs]
- What the hell?!

178
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,474
Ow!

179
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,434
Hey!

180
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,271
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! All right!
- [giggling]

181
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,690
What the hell is going on?

182
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,108
This is blackmail, honey.

183
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,152
- What?!
- Now, if you keep neglecting me…

184
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,696
That little photo?

185
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,824
I'll have it blown up and posted
in the busiest areas of the city.

186
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,909
- [sighs] This isn't happening.
- Here!

187
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,411
- Listen!
- Just like that!

188
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,788
- Say cheese!
- Cut it out, you crazy bitch!

189
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,997
- [laughing]
- I said let it go!

190
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,124
[Mi-na] Oh my God!

191
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,458
Uncuff me, goddammit!

192
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,335
- Peekaboo!
- No, what are you doing?! [grunts]

193
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,878
[music intensifies]

194
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,630
Untie me, damn it! I'm warning you!

195
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,674
Don't you dare! Pull it back up!

196
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,885
You tricky little fucker!

197
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,388
- [music intensifies]
- Go!

198
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,434

204
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,331
That's right!

205
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,208
- [whimpers]
- What?

206
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,669
Ah.

207
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,045
[papers rustling]

208
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,423
What you wanted from Kwon Do-il.

209
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,884
His screenplay! [panting]

211

[music fades]

214
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,855
You already read through it all?

215
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,901
B-- but how?
It's only been, like, three minutes.

216
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,572
Why is Aema tying a guy up
and using a whip all of a sudden?

217
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,034
It's from that Japanese smut
you've been watching. That <i>hentai</i>?

218
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,829
What man doesn't wanna be dominated
by a gorgeous lady?

219
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,665
You and Mi-na have never done
any domination role-play?

220
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,083
[Jung-ho inhales]

221
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,338
[sighs] I'm havin' a day,
so don't make me repeat myself.

222
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,341
Just go vanilla, got it?

223
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,676
Pants and panties off, then pecker out,

224
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,887
puts it in there, dong-dong-dong,

225
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,096
he comes, okay?

226
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,140
Are you kidding me right now?

227
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,852
The whole point was to showcase
sexual desire from a woman's perspective.

228
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,063
Then let her come too! I don't care!

229
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,689
Oh, and also,

230
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,317
three titty scenes are gone.
Explain that to me.

231
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,611
Yeah, I went over this with you before.

232
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,404
- There's a subtle way to--
- Subtle?

233
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,365
Yeah, screw that. Hey.

234
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,993
The audience wants sex,
so shove your subtlety you know where.

235
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,789
You wanna be subtle after casting a girl
with a rack made by the gods?

236
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,706
Are you crazy?

237
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,919
You'll see once you finally get
a taste of the money.

238
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,713
Flash a pair of breasts once
and you can afford a car.

239
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,423
A new house from the second pair.

240
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,634
And a third pair
will change your whole world.

241
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,638
Go back to the old one.

242
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,889
This one is trash.

243
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,560
Things are goin' great. Don't fuck it up.

244
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,521
[door slams]

DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

246
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,407
[Jung-ho] Of course!

247
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,577
You call the shots, Mr. Choi,
and I'll follow.

248
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,703
I'm on my way.

249

250
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm the director here!

251
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,167
It's ridiculous for you to ask

252
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,378
that I direct a project
I don't even believe in!

253
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,298
I had a vision for both Hee-ran
and Ju-ae's parts, all right?

254
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,591
'Cause I am the director here,

255
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,093
and you can bet that I know
how it should be, okay?

256
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,011
So enough!

257
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,972
I refuse to let you step
all over my vision!

258
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,974
<i>Aema</i>'s mine to direct, is it not?

259
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,517
[breathes shakily]

260
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,228
You actually sound like a real director.
Hmm?

261
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,897
I believe in you.

262
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,858
Why else would I let you
direct the project?

263
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,195
The real situation here
is you don't believe in your producer.

264
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,490
If a little feedback is so difficult,

265
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,118
you're gonna have to find
a new project to work on.

266
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,745
[In-u sighs]

267
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,665
And <i>Aema </i>will find a new director.

268
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,792
A shame.

Not many people know of this place.

277
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,665
So, uh, how'd you find me here?

278
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,877
Director… I, uh,

279
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,714
need to apologize to you.

280
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,758
It's wrong, I know. But I…

281
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,094
I got my hands on your new screenplay.

282
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,596
What?

283
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,682
When I read your work…

00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,600
[breathes shakily]

285
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,602
I don't even know.

286
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,355
I just had to come speak with you.

287
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,568
Please use me to help tell this story.

288
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,653
You won't be disappointed.

289
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,531
Well, to be honest,

290
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,034
I'm still rewriting it.

291
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,911
And besides that,

292
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,914
I'm not quite ready
to bring on anyone just yet.

293
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,752
I don't intend to pressure your process.
I can wait.

294
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,212
Just let me know
when you're ready, Director.

295
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,801
Didn't you announce recently
that for all projects moving forward,

296
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,303
you're no longer doing nudity?

297
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,931
I'm sure you know that
since you've read the script,

298
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,351
but this project isn't shying away
from nudity.

299
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,229
Let me be clear.

300
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,025
When I asked for you to use me, Director,

301
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,029
I meant it.
Use every inch however you want to.

302
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,199
When I was 20,

303
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,495
I began my career in this industry,

304
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,541
entirely focused on
increasing my celebrity rather than craft.

305
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,253
I became famous
without exercising my skill.

306
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,717
In my career…
I have experienced incredible success.

307
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,261
I never chose roles for the art.

308
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,474
I chose fame and celebrity status,
anything for the publicity.

309
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,600
Never before

310
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,522

to play a part in any film, you know?

For real, though,
what an incredible honor.

388
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,809
Well, I guess you must think
I'm a half-decent producer now

389
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,395
if you're entrusting me
with a precious script of yours.

390
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,313
Do not misunderstand.

- What I want is Hee-ran.

Ah, well, you'd be right.
She's still all mine.

If I want her, you come as a package deal.

It's unfortunate.

Director, what do you think about
making the budget bigger?

403
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,688
'Cause, as you know,
a bigger budget is a bigger picture.

Let me make some calls and arrange that.

What do you say?

406
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,987
Increasing the budget
will raise the stakes.

But would you ever consider
someone new instead?

411
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,669
And why would I bring on
an unknown talent?

she might even end up
serving as some kind of muse for you.

someone in mind already.

Well, since you mention it,
when I read it,

00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,946
an actress did immediately jump to mind
that'd be <i>absolutely </i>perfect.

Yeah. I thought so.

I don't know if it's love necessarily.

This one here.

454
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,897
She's an up-and-coming actress
I discovered.

455
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,066
So treat her with some respect, Director.

456
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,068
I tell you I'm casting Jeong Hee-ran,

457
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:14,114
and so you decide to manipulate me
into casting your girlfriend?

458
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,407
What the hell's wrong with you?

459
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,450
All these years in the business

460
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,452

Director. Come on now! [laughs]

Miss Mi-na, wasn't it?

464

Look at you. You're barely 20 years old.

Why sleep with this asshole?
Did he say he'd make you a star?

Yeah.

so desperate that she had to resort
to grabbing a producer's cock!

Whoa, hey, take it easy! What the hell
are you doing? He's the director.

- That's not how you talk to him.
- Piece of shit.

I see
you're still acting like a little shit.

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,989

All right, enough!

you have a leg to stand on.

for this shitshow, it's you, old man!
