00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,180
[In-u] No, no, no.
Stop laying there like she's dead.

349
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,850
- Embrace the sensation!
- [stand-in] Uh, I'll try to.

350
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
Uh-- [groaning softly]

351
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,645
Don't look at me!

352
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,189
[In-u] You squirm in pleasure.

353
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,066
[stand-in groaning]

354
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,901
[In-u] It turns you on!

355
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,654
- [stand-in moaning]
- [acupuncturist] Huh?!

356
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,906
- [stand-in whimpering, sobs]
- Dude!

357
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,950
- Cut!
- [panting]

358
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,493
- You made it weird!
- [man 1] Ah shit…

359
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,245
- [moaning]
- [In-u] What do you think?

360
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,248
I feel like the boobs are glaring at me.

361
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,125
- Can we put a bra on her?
- [stand-in] Hmm?

362
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,419
[In-u] Who the hell wears bras
during acupuncture?

363
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,045
[man 1] Well, turn her over, then.

364
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,048
They would know
it was to hide her breasts.

365
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,217
[man 1 sighs] Yeah, you're right.

366
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,678
[woman] Well, people usually
get acupuncture face down, right?

367
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,430
Do they get pricked on their boobs?

368
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,725
If their breasts hurt.
Then they probably would, yeah.

369
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,059
[man 1] Hey, stay still.

370
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,478
What if we just showed one breast, then?

371
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,815
If it's one boob,
it should be fine, right?

372
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,194
Didn't they stipulate
how many breasts we can show?

373
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,238
We can't show breasts
or even nipple at all!

374
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,490
- [man 2] Ohhhh.
- [man 1] Ah.

375
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,367
No nipples, c'mon!

376
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,745
Huh?

377
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,790
[retro erotic music playing]

378
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,210
[gasps, whimpers sensually]

379
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,796
[gasps]

00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,343
[moans, sighs breathily]

381
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,848
[gasping]

382
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,023
[gasping echoes]

383
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,733
- Okay. Now ecstasy!
- [music stops]

384
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,692
[camera whirring]

385
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,487
Ah, that's good, yeah!
Now it hurts, but you're turned on!

386
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,948
All right, okay!

387
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,157
Now it hurts!

388
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,742
[moans]

389
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,036
Oh yeah! Now, c'mon, ecstasy!

390
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,206
[gasps] Didn't I already do that?

391
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,625
Uh, yeah, we did. You're right.
Uh, where's my Erika?

392
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,127
- Erika!
- [man 1] Erika!

393
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,089
[mystical tinkling]

394
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,591
[Aema moaning erotically]

395
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,718
[gasps]

396
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,390
[camera whirring]

397
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,100
Cut.

398
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,393
[whirring stops]

399
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,646
[Hee-ran sighs]

400
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,023
[footsteps retreating]

401
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,736
[knocking at door]

402
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,241
Ms. Hee-ran.

403
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,750
Are you… unhappy with something?

404
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,173
I don't get what's going on here.

405
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,967
What don't you get?

406
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,761
Why the hell is acupuncture
turning her on?

407
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,972
What, is it a fetish or something?

408
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,391
Ah, the scene is to show
that pain and ecstasy

409
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,935
are actually just one and the same,
really.

410
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,813
What are you saying?
How are those two the same thing?

411
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,569
[exasperated] Forget it. It's not like
<i>I'm </i>the one having to act it out.

412
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,367
"Erika experiences the same pain
and pleasure as Aema."

413
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,702
Why do I feel it?

414
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,289
- Uh--
- "Erika licks her lips with her tongue."

415
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,374
"She's incredibly turned on."

416
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,168
Why am I getting turned on?

417
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,214
I'm sitting by myself like an idiot,
just watching and getting aroused?!

418
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,300
I don't have any motivation!

419
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,845
This idea,
it comes from this Japanese trend.

420
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,890
It's a combination of the erotic
and the grotesque. It's nonsensical.

421
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,476
Like sweet and sour or spicy and bitter.

422
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,187
The idea of, uh, harmony opposing the, uh…

423
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,271
Director,

424
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,649
you're not sure you can convince me.

425
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,693
Ms. Hee-ran…

426
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:48,033
this scene, when people watch <i>Madame Aema</i>,
this is what they'll remember.

427
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,993
No! You merely hope so.

428
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,455
I was asking about my motivation.
Don't change the subject.

429
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,751
If actors don't get a scene, how the hell
are we supposed to act it, huh?

430
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,297
I'm done.

431
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,551
We'll shoot the scene
once you're a bit more convincing.

432
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,261
[dance music fades in]

433
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,430
Yeong-bae! Start the car!

434
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,475
[Yeong-bae clears throat nervously]

435
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:19,815
[to himself] All right, grab that.
Script, wallet, handkerchief…

436
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,816
MADAME AEMA
SHIN JU-AE

437
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,858
Oh shoot.

438
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,244
Hee-ran, wait!

439
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,871
How could you just walk out like that?

440
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,926
You hate the script, hate your co-star…

441
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,054
So if you hate everything,
why did you sign on?

442
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,305
Don't push me.

443
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,898
It's clear to me that you only care
about the money, don't you?

444
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,608
[apprehensive tone fades in]

445
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,027
[gasps]

446
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,450
[somber tone plays]

447
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,287
You're a big bitch, Hee-ran,
you know that?!

448
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,123
[solemn music playing]

449
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,633
[music becomes ethereal]

450
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,642
All right, then.

451
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,686
Keep working hard.

452
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,606
Keep being a tacky, talentless, try-hard.

453
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,567
Trust in the script.
Trust in the director.

454
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,611
And keep at it.

455
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,574
But at some point, there'll come a time
when you can't believe in them anymore,

456
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,284
no matter how hard you try.

457
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,662
[patronizing] What will you do
when there's no one for you to believe in?

458
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,165
How will you handle that?

459
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,834
Keep giving it your all?

460
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,961
Even after losing faith?

461
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,422
What's the point of working hard

462
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,925
when you don't even know
what you're working for?

463
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,054
Take a moment
to reflect on what you're saying.

464
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,516
Is there never a justified reason
to walk away?

465
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,728
And also,

466
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,898
since you know I'm a bitch,

467
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,944
I suggest you stop trying to be one,
Little Miss Superstar.

468
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,530
Unless you wanna find out

469
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,866
how bitchy I can be.

470
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,953
[unsettling electronic music playing]

471
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,749
[footsteps slowly retreating]

00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,211
[music intensifies, ends]

473
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,672
All right,
let's clean things up and roll out!

474
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,216
We'll give you the new call sheet
when it's ready.

475
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,301
[indistinct chatter]

476
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,345
[man 1] Good work, everyone.

477
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,848
[man 2] This whole thing needs to be
completely torn down. Let's hurry it up.

478
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,101
Director.

479
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,061
I swear to you

480
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,064
that I'll be giving your film
everything I've got.

481
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,733
I'll devote my heart and soul
to this project.

482
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,151
[dreamy electronic music playing]

483
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,236
But in return…

484
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,613
[man 3] How's your day been, man?
I missed you.

485
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,949
- [chair thumps]
- [Ju-ae breathes shakily]

486
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,661
…you need to give me
the confidence to trust you.

487
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,208
I needed to say that.

488
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,211
[footsteps retreating]

489
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,147

IF I'M GOING TO BE A BITCH, MIGHT AS WELL
BE A BADASS BITCH LIKE JEONG HEE-RAN

493
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,211
[subdued wistful music playing]

494
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,724
It is good to see you, Aema.

495
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,933
[music fades]

496
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,477
Aema?

497
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,896
Ooh!

498
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,065
Oh, seriously?!

499
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,027
I told you not to wear any underwear!

500
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,531
Now we'll have to hold off on filming
until those imprint lines are gone!

501
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,492
Oh… [spluttering] Sorry, I just…

502
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,746
Uh… just felt so weird going commando.

503
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,123
It's, uh… uh, a thing.

504
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,542
I try not to walk around
with no underwear on.

505
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:54,589
Since I was a kid, I've been sensitive to…
to cold, um, temperatures. So…

506
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,552
- Make a fist for me.
- 'Kay.

507
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,846
That's your wiener.

508
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,557
And your scrotum, okay?

509
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,478
Uh, wiener and my scrotum.

510
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,688
Now hand me your fist.

511
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,818
Then you'll wrap it.
Depending on your size, it should be easy.

512
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,572
Like that. Trim the parts that stick out
like this with a pair of scissors.

513
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,701
But don't get too close and cut yourself
or I have to pull an all-nighter.

514
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,703
[scissors rattle]

515
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:30,125
Wrap it around properly,
separating the penis from the testicles.

516
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,002
This area right here?

517
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,840
You have to pay attention and be careful
if you don't want it coming off.

518
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,925
- You think you got it?

00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,375
They told us to shut down the shoot
in the middle of filming

693
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,378
'cause we didn't make the adjustments
they demanded or something.

694
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,213
We already changed it.

695
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,299
We did what they asked,
gave them gifts and everything.

696
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,259
I just don't get it.

697
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,097
We made all their changes,
so I don't know why they're still unhappy.

698
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,640
Think you could look into it?

699
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,896
It's gonna be the end of Shinsung
if <i>Madame Aema </i>ends up failing.

700
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,356
Could you help us out here?

701
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,901
Yes, you've certainly brought
lots of "art" to the world.

702
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:10,408
I guess the past decade was
a way more lucrative time for you, huh?

703
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,744
It's not like it was before.

704
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:18,374
International films have stolen
the interest of our younger crowd.

705
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,043
Everybody has a color TV now,

706
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,005
meaning fewer and fewer people
are seeing films in the theaters.

707
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,051
Unfortunate your little industry

708
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,345
must feel the heat.

709
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,767
It's a shame
you're not better taken care of.

710
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,228
We government boys,
should be helping with that.

711
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,611
[muted synth-pop music playing]

712
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,740
[Jung-ho sighs]

713
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,830
President Ku,

714
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:01,876
d'you have any idea where
they'll be hosting the Olympics in '88?

715
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,337
Yeah. You don't, huh?

716
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,090
They're announcing it today.

717
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,342
The consensus

718
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,388
is that everybody thinks Seoul
will be the one getting the honor.

719
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,516
So, thanks to that,
I've been working my ass off.

720
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,601
It's terrible.

721
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,147
You see, they're planning a grand banquet.

722
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:29,361
The higher-ups are hoping
for a little "fresh meat," so to say.

723
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,531
I know from experience
that's easier said than done,

724
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,493
but, uh, unfortunately,
it's all the same old, same old.

725
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,785
We're tired! It's not exciting!

726
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,663
[Jung-ho snorts]

727
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,291
Should I maybe snatch people
off the streets?

728
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,045
I'm joking.
Who knows if we'll even get the Olympics?

729
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,129
[Jung-ho chuckles]

730
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,008
[sighs]

731
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,802
Are you kidding me?

732
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,222
I'm certain Seoul's
gonna get the Olympics.

733
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,766
You government boys
have been breaking your backs,

734
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,893
going above and beyond to host it.

735
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,895
Nothing's impossible
with all your hard work.

736
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,564
We've got this in the bag,
so it's smart preparing in advance.

737
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,442
And if you let us,
we in the movie industry

738
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,070
would be more than happy
to contribute however we can.

739
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,488
[man chuckling]

740
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,616
We threw a press event for <i>Madame Aema</i>.

741
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,245
I bet you saw it. It was this huge deal
that got everybody talking.

742
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,871
I dunno.

743
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,831
Did I?

744
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,584
You see, I've got a newcomer on this one.

745
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,629
Ms. Shin Ju-ae.

746
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,589
She's green, sure, but dependable.

747
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,841
And I've got absolute confidence
in her abilities.

748
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,843
From the second
that she came into the room,

749
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,096
I was positive I'd found our Madame Aema.

750
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,223
Insanely talented, that girl.

751
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,475
Get the picture? [chuckles]

752
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,102
[inhales lecherously]

753
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,902
Well, too bad she's busy filming right now
and can't attend.

754
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,031
Ah! My mistake.

755
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,242
Filming's on hiatus.

756
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,952
[music intensifies]

757
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,091
[music fades]

758
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,052
[TV plays quietly in background]

759
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,471
- [Gi inhales sharply]
- [In-u] You're sure?

760
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,891
You submitted everything
exactly like I instructed?

761
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,562
Of course.
I gave them everything you told us to.

762
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,732
Slipped 'em extra too.

763
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,358
[man 1] Sorry I'm late!

764
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,528
- Did they announce it already?
- [man 2] Calm down. No, give it a minute.

765
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,614
Didn't they say before
that Seoul had it in the bag?

766
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,490
Ya skim some off the top?

767
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,453
You did, didn't you?

768
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,623
Huh? You skimmed
some of the bribe money for yourself.

769
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,207
You think I'm some kind of criminal?

770
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,585
You thieving bastard!

771
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,046
What the fuck are you gonna do
to save our shoot now, huh?

772
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,881
I did what you asked!
Why you freakin' out?

773
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,550
Don't you raise your fucking voice at me!
Fucking backstabber!

774
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,303
- I didn't do anything!
- I'll smash the bottle. I'll do it. C'mon!

775
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,139
- [Gi] You ain't smashin' nothin'!
- Motherfucker! Don't think I'll do it?

776
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,058
- Bring me a drink!
- [woman] Seoul, Seoul, Seoul!

777
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,268
[In-u] I'm gonna gut you,
from your fucking tongue

778
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,395
down to your balls,
and brew snake wine out of ya.

779
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,230
SEOUL: 52 VOTES
NAGOYA: 27 VOTES

780
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,691
- [Geun-ha] Ah.
- You're a spineless mother-- Huh?

781
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,568
[Geun-ha] It's Seoul.

782
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,278
'88 OLYMPICS HOST CITY ANNOUNCEMENT

783
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,780
SEOUL CONFIRMED AS THE HOST

784
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,531
- [man 3] Seoul, Seoul, Seoul!
- Olympics.

785
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,752
[people singing drunkenly]

786
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,253
Oh. Hey.

787
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,589
[zipper rasps]

788
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,050
They say that once we host the Olympics,

789
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,096
our GDP, all the way through the roof!

790
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,808
And we'll become
a fucking first-world country.

791
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,269
What's GDP? Do you know?

792
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,979
[lighter rasping]

793
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,023
I feel like I caused it all.

794
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,608
Why?

795
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,736
Should I not have crossed
the ginseng's legs?

796
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,907
- I might've jinxed us.
- You sound crazy.

797
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,367
Just forget it!

798
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,327
Go over there…

799
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,579
You're sober, aren't you?

800
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,499
Head on over to the Yangji Café.

801
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,042
President Ku will be there.

802
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,504
If he's hungry, buy a meal for him.

803
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,464
And drive him around.

804
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,674
[revelers] Yeah!

805
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,467
Ju-ae's gonna be there as well.

806
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,428
[cigarette hissing]

00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,595

810
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,059
[woman] Welcome!

811
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,273
[Ju-ae] What are you talking about?

812
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,484
[Jung-ho laughing heartily]

813
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,531
Like I said, you've got that spunk,
that moxie, charisma.

814
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,949
Use it to your advantage.

815
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,619
Listen, this banquet
is gonna be a big celebration.

816
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,330
It's an honor to be invited, okay?

817
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,251
'Cause only the most elite individuals
in the entire country can attend.

818
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,088
Your common man off the street
would never be allowed to go.

819
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,301
So a newbie like you getting an invite?
You should be honored! [chuckles]

820
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,762
You've got nothing to lose.

821
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,181
It's celebrating the Olympics.

822
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,475
It's a big party. It's gonna be cool!

823
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,436
Besides, one could argue,

824
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:16,106
as the lead character of the movie,
the responsibility lies with you

825
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,150
to go represent and promote it.

826
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:22,362
Right?
If this project thrives, you will too.

827
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,407
You and this movie are intertwined.

828
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,451
Its fate lies squarely in your hands.
You get that?

829
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,661
GREAT FORTUNE WILL COME
IF YOU WORK WITH YOUR SENIOR

830
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,913
[paper crumples]

831
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,791
[Ju-ae exhales]

832
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,378
That's a fancy way
of begging me to save your skin.

833
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,672
Come again?

834
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,468
You don't share authority with anyone,
so why should I share responsibility?

835
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,055
You want your cake,
but you wanna eat it too.

836
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,226
I'm just an employee over here,
and you're a coward.

837
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,897
Am I wrong here?

838
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,981
[Jung-ho scoffs softly]

839
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,316
[paper crinkles]

840
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,360
[Jung-ho] Okay.

841
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,532
I was tryna be nice.
Let me tell it straight, then.

842
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,120
You have no cards to play.
You've got absolutely nothing.

843
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,122
No authority or power.

844
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,503
Go.

845
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,090

[Geun-ha inhales, exhales]

848
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,816
Don't go.

849
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,110
That's not your job.

850
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,073
Are you kidding me?

851
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,784
You're considering it?

852
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,208
Ju-ae!

853
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:04,381
All I have to do is drink and laugh
with some big shots, all right?

854
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,508
Don't worry about it.

855
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,385
[Geun-ha scoffs softly]

856
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,349
So you're gonna go?

857
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,686
You're seriously gonna go?!

858
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,480
You make it sound so easy.

859
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,611
Why are you deciding
what I can and can't do?

860
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,825
This is an incredible opportunity.
I'm surprised you don't understand

861
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,786
why I'd be willing to do
whatever it takes to protect it.

862
