SEOUL JUNGBU POLICE STATION

2
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,412
The first day of the New Year.
Today is an important day.

3
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,790
It's the only day of the year
when the curfew is lifted.

4
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:45,170
Citizens throughout the city
are enjoying the night sights as we speak…

5
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,173
It seems President Ku won't get out
until tomorrow morning.

6
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,925
He didn't just damage any car.

7
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,802
It was a cop car.

8
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,055
Apparently, that's a big deal.

9
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,932
He's in big trouble now.

10
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,353
So, Hee-ran…

11
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,940
Happy New Year.

12
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,155
Yeong-bae, turn the car around.

13
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,949
Around? Where to?

14
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,119
To tear my exclusivity contract to shreds.

15
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,023
Hee-ran.

16
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,025
I took a peek,

17
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,362
and Mi-na isn't home right now either.

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,698
The coast is clear.

19
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,576
Then why are you whispering?

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,748
It just felt like one of those scenes.

21
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,961
By the way, do you know where the safe is?

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,965
I bought him this house.
I know better than anyone.

23
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,635
Just keep watch.

24
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,620

Hee-ran.

35
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,517
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,689
What the hell?

37
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,233
Why are you ransacking my house?

38
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,860
So fucking rude, you bitch!

39
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,323
So you were the one
who proposed and started all this.

40
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,702
Lining your pockets all this time.

41
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,453
Why look so surprised?

42
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,832
You knew I was a scumbag.
Thought I'd draw the line somewhere?

43
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,375
Seriously…

44
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,962
What kind of person are you?

45
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,839
First, put that down.

46
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,883
Let's not overcomplicate things.

47
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,927
That won't be necessary.

48
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,222
You've made things much simpler.

49
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,933
For that, I'm grateful.

50
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,436
You're welcome, you crazy bitch.

51
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,438
Sir.

52
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,773
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,066
What?

54
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,610
What the hell?

55
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,279
Hee-ran, grab it and go!

56
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,868
You goddamn lunatic!

57
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,165
Jeong Hee-ran!

58
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,223
You're an actress,

59
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,476
so I'll spare the moneymaker.

60
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,605
Life's been good, hasn't it?

61
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,774
Your life's been smooth sailing.

62
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,075
Has the sweet life made you forget
what kind of bastard I am?

63
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,094
So you thought you'd be able
to fuck me over with this thing?

64
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,261
This?

65
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,514
It ain't jack shit.

66
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,061
Struggle all you want,
but there's nothing you can do.

67
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,481
Split up?
You want me to let you split us up?

68
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,066
Hee-ran.

69
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,192
Wake up.

70
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,695
Why would I let you go
when you're still bringing in money?

71
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,950
You're gonna do it anyway,
so let's go out with a bang.

72
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,202
Let's get you butt-naked for the next one.

73
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,081
Then I'll let you go, clean and simple.

74
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,512
Put that down.

75
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,099
What, why? What are you going to do?

76
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,267
Shoot me?

77
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,356
Put it down.

78
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,274
Oh yeah.

79
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,401
You're a shooter.

80
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,028
You'll actually pull the trigger.

81
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,013
You crazy bitch. You actually shot me!

82
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,311
For crying out loud, Hee-ran.

83
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,314
What now? Gonna shoot me again?

84
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,026
Just die.

85
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,179
Hey.

86
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,349
Careful, or we might start getting along.

87
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,562
Here's to a long-lasting relationship,
Jeong Hee-ran!

88
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,866
AEMA

89
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,120
Shall we go?

90
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,998
Go where?

91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,044
Anywhere.

92
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,691
It's still a rough cut.

93
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,945
Besides, we haven't gotten around
to editing the sound or anything yet.

94
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,615
We should tighten up the middle though.

95
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,742
I got a little too ambitious.

96
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:45,543
Didn't I clearly tell you to make
Hee-ran's character the ultimate bitch?

97
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,795
She's pretty bitchy already.

98
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,630
But she's a badass bitch.

99
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,508
That's because Hee-ran's just a badass.

100
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,634
So you, the director,

101
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,471
just sat back while a badass actor
played her character like a badass?

102
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,142
It's the director's job
to mold an actor into their character.

103
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,853
I told you to strip girls
and make everyone horny.

104
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,105
But this is all about women being badass.

105
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,775
Why wouldn't people get horny
over badass women?

106
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,737
It makes me feel horny and shitty
at the same time.

107
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,991
If you're turned on, you're turned on.
Why would you feel shitty?

108
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,326
Just beat it.

109
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,493
I'll re-edit this.

110
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,913
-Sorry?
-Seok. Tell the editor to come in.

111
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,333
Come on, what are you…

112
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,752
Sir?

113
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,545
Fetch the editor.

114
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,256
Yes, sir.

115
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,342
I'm the director, okay?

116
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,345
I wrote it and directed it all.
You can't do this.

117
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,888
The law says I can.

118
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,225
"The contractor has the last word
regarding the final cut of this film."

119
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,644
I'm the contractor, okay?

120
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,228
Come on, bro.

121
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,773
"The subcontractor may not contest
the contractor's decision

122
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,650
to omit his name from the credits."

123
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,109
You want out of the credits?

124
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,027
Sir.

125
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,571
I haven't even edited it properly yet.

126
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,740
I'll edit it so it'll make you horny.

127
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,036
You know, this isn't the first time.

128
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,372
I can't help but think

129
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,249
we have very different ideas
about what gets you horny.

130
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,672
Seok, I said call the editor!

131
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,799
Right, he's coming in now.

132
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,300
Get out.

133
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,723
The VIPs today are young, okay?

134
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,811
You'll have more in common with them
than the older VIPs.

135
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,897
But don't get ahead of yourself

136
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,483
and start getting chatty, okay?

137
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,653
Just read the room and go with the flow.

138
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,283
What's wrong?

139
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,079
Does having to drop me off there
bum you out that much?

140
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,709
Or

141
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,920
should the two of us
just go someplace nice?

142
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,854
Why fucking bother finding someplace else?

143
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,022
Why not just do it here?

144
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,157
You fucking bitch.

145
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,995
You think this is a joke?
Think this is going to be fun?

146
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,331
When I told you the VIPs were young,

147
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,460
I didn't mean they were going to be
a bunch of pushovers.

148
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,755
Fucking whore.

149
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,144
You think I'm pathetic, don't you?

150
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,606
I bet you think I'm a common whore.

151
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,701
I'm only trying so hard
because I know my place.

152
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,539
I know I'm not talented…

153
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,586
and I'm unlucky as shit,
but I have a dream.

154
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,383
I try so hard because I know my place.

155
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,148
Bravo.

156
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,421
So you're the top dog here?

157
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,887
Hello.

158
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,725
I'm Mi-na.

159
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,974
Aema. Between faith, hope, and love,
which do you think is the greatest virtue?

160
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,060
Faith, hope, and love?

161
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,312
I'd have to say the greatest of them all

162
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,232
is sex.

163
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,650
Goodness, what's going on?

164
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,485
What do you think? It's me, Yun-ho.

165
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,447
I love it.

166
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,617
Go on, say what you like about me,

167
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,578
but I have to go back.

168
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,747
I still thirst for him.

169
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,833
Wait for me, Yun-ho!

170
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,251
Aema!

171
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,377
Yun-ho!

172
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,295
Aema!

173
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,504
Yun-ho!

174
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,674
-Sex!
-Sex!

175
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,260
THE END

176
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,391
So this is what it's come to.

177
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,811
It didn't even take ten days.
A week? Six days?

178
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,690
In a few days, he trashed what took me
a year to write and months to shoot.

179
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,152
That Ku Jung-ho always did have a knack

180
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,573
for making a steaming heap of crap
purely with his edits.

181
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,450
So his legacy continues.

182
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,079
What should we do?

183
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,917
Shall we go to Mr. Ku together
and try to talk him out of this?

184
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,713
He can threaten to remove my name,
but he couldn't do that to you.

185
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,798
Director.

186
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,176
I recently

187
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,554
had the chance to kill Ku Jung-ho,

188
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,974
but I let pity get the better of me
and let him live.

189
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,352
Looking back,

190
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,604
that may have been hubris.

191
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,862
I guess this won't be over
until he's dead.

192
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,824
Where are you going?

193
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,201
There's a fire raging in my heart,

194
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,954
so I should get some air and cool off.

195
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,206
And to think of a solution.

196
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,294
Also, Director,

197
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,131
stop hiding behind your excuses.

198
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:57,010
If you truly want to protect something,
you need to get your hands dirty for once.

199
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,221
We both know

200
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,766
that you've kept yourself spotless
and stayed pure all this time.

201
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,476
For a director, that is.

202
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,021
It's ours.

203
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,732
How come?

204
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,363
Because we live in a shitty world

205
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,408
that keeps fucking us over.

206
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,619
Don't you think it's time
we fucked it over for a change?

207
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,997
The color is symbolic.

208
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,082
Fiery red.

209
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,711
Get in.

210
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,214
I'm going to need an explanation first.

211
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,509
You said you were paid
purely on performance.

212
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,470
Where's the money from?

213
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,514
I earned it through performance.

214
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,183
My performance.

215
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,227
The film isn't even out yet.

216
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,688
What have you done to afford a Pony?

217
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,523
What

218
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,609
did you do?

219
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,121
What are you implying?

220
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,375
I'm asking what shady stunt you pulled
to pay for this.

221
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,502
Shady?

222
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,213
If my words bother you, explain.

223
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,423
That you played it straight.

224
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,178
Just commend me for my hard work.

225
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,432
If you trust me,
just tell me that I did a good job.

226
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,268
Don't you remember?

227
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,939
I didn't ask any questions that day

228
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,691
because I trusted you.

229
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,276
So what?

230
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,114
I said I was willing to wallow in the mud,
so you thought you'd join me?

231
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,910
Now we're both rolling in the mud,
does that make us even?

232
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,705
You wanted to take me on a ride in this?

233
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,749
Are you insane?

234
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,711
Just how low are you going to sink?

235
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,760
How did you get in here?

236
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,139
I didn't think anyone was here.

237
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,516
No one was.

238
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,893
Weren't the gates locked?

239
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,229
I climbed the fence.

240
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,981
Why?

241
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,109
I didn't want to spend the day alone,

242
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,654
and the only friend who came to mind

243
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,615
was Thunder.

244
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,163
Follow me.

245
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,463
God, what an absolute mess.

246
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,237
Director.

247
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,115
We're in trouble.

248
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,492
What's going on?

249
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,494
What? You're scaring me. What is it?

250
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,139
Did someone die?

251
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,436
It's okay. She should see this too.

252
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,022
The ground.

253
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,274
It's frozen.

254
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,901
Just give me a sec.

255
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,671
Are we allowed to be doing this out here?

256
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,933
MADAME AEMA

257
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,895
They picked the lock without a hitch
and only took the Madame Aema reels.

258
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,272
Who in their right mind

259
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:04,401
steals the reels of an unreleased film
they don't even know about?

260
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,779
Oh God, dear Lord Almighty.

261
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,114
Right.

262
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,575
I felt like doing the same thing.

263
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,077
Sorry?

264
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,580
Still, you shouldn't actually do it.

265
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,958
You can think it,
but you're not supposed to act on it!

266
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,042
What?

267
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,879
If you stole the reels,

268
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,214
then where would you go?

269
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,924
Hong Kong?

270
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,926
Wait, I don't know why I said Hong Kong.

271
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,095
Why would I even steal the reels?

272
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,763
Fire, yeah?

273
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,433
A fire's raging in your heart.

274
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,434
Fire?

275
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,520
You want to get some air.
Where would you go to get air?

276
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,438
Air?

277
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,315
I'm Jeong Hee-ran.

278
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,649
I need some air.

279
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,444
Air. I'm going out to get some air.

280
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,200
The horses.

281
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,385
You mean to burn all this?

282
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,137
Yeah.

283
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,098
Why?

284
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,351
Humiliation.

285
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,897
After shooting certain films,

286
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,609
you feel as though
you didn't finish the film,

287
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,655
but that the film finished you.

288
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,660
As actors,

289
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,162
we pour a part of ourselves
into each film,

290
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,748
and when we truly commit,

291
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,544
we end up carving out a piece of our lives

292
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,713
and offering it up for the project.

293
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,389
Just like you said,
I trimmed the additional footage we shot

294
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,016
and just put the good bits into the film.

295
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,893
Doesn't it bring this scene to life?

296
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,646
See? You should take more
directorial pointers from me.

297
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,027
Oh, so this is how
my blood, sweat, and tears

298
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,406
have been used and abused.

299
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,618
You only realize it too late,
while sitting there in the cinema.

300
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,039
It takes a while to heal
from such memories.

301
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,624
It takes a lot out of you.

302
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,503
I didn't want to go through that again.

303
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,177
Sad to see it go?

304
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,847
Of course I am.

305
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,331
But I got to experience
shooting a film from start to finish,

306
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,375
so this wasn't a total loss.

307
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,671
Humiliation.

308
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,093
You went out of your way to save me…

309
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,350
so it's your turn to be saved.

310
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:58,635
MORGUE

311
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,305
Where?

312
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,142
-You told me to come this way!
-Just keep it down for a minute, will you?

313
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,066
-Hey, to our rear!
-What?

314
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,109
Right behind us.

315
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,319
-Turn around. Hurry, you idiot!
-Yes.

316
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,410
There! There's something over there.

317
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:27,330
That's them, isn't it?
Is that a wheelbarrow? A wheelbarrow!

318
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,791
Hey, it's that fat-ass!

319
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,346
You son of a bitch!

320
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,889
You!

321
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,809
You bastard.

322
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,396
You little shit.
I was scared shitless because of you.

323
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,942
You chunky bastard.
How could you do this to your coworkers?

324
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,069
Hey, you've got it all wrong…

325
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,029
Hee-ran.

326
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,911
Despite everything…

327
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,208
no matter how crappy it is…

328
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,006
I poured my life into this film.

329
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,178
Even if President Ku ruined everything!

330
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,390
No matter how broken,

331
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,561
no matter how flawed and messy it may be,

332
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,439
I wrote it, and I directed it.

333
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,274
It's my film!

334
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,486
No matter what anyone says,

335
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,573
it's the first film I have to my name!

336
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,201
It's my film.

337
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,253
Man, I thought
they'd smoke a little weed at most.

338
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,629
Kids nowadays

339
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,215
sure are unpredictable.

340
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,093
It seems they were doing
cocaine or something.

341
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,558
I don't know whether she was coerced
into doing drugs or not,

342
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,019
but as you should know,
there won't be a police investigation.

343
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,483
They'll wrap things up
with a simple conclusion.

344
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,320
A troubled, addicted rookie actress
overdosed on drugs.

345
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,032
We'll take care of any loose ends
so they don't trace this back to you.

346
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,661
We'll see how things play out and announce
her death when the time's right,

347
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,580
so just go about your life like usual.

348
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,082
Your film will be out soon.

349
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,002
Her death would be
a bit of a buzzkill, you know?

350
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,966
By the way, word is
that the curfew will be lifted soon.

351
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,052
It's been in place
for 36 years and four months.

352
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,972
Isn't that remarkable?

353
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,391
Mr. Ku.

354
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:38,771
That means cinemas will be allowed
to stay open past midnight.

355
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,733
We're about to see
the birth of "midnight movies."

356
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,069
Man, isn't that
just the fucking darnedest thing?

357
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,616
Just imagine people watching movies
in cinemas past midnight!

358
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,330
In due consideration
of your great loss today,

359
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,624
I'll make sure that Madame Aema

360
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,335
becomes the Republic of Korea's

361
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,338
first-ever midnight movie.

362
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,673
That will put my mind at ease.

363
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,387
How kind of you.

364
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:14,933
Here.

365
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,394
-Here.
-Right.

366
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,447
They've already butchered my film…

367
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,619
so why am I still so hung up on it?

368
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:40,583
I'm the one who wanted to burn it all
after seeing the edited version.

369
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,546
I acted impulsively,

370
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,967
and so I overlooked
how much of a big break

371
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,513
this film is for you and for Ju-ae.

372
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,766
I apologize.

373
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,356
I apologize as the director
for failing to protect the film.

374
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,026
You protected it.

375
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,404
From where you're standing.

376
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,542
The film will be a breakout success.

377
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,462
Ku Jung-ho may have ruined it,

378
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,923
but it still offers the audience

379
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,134
something new to watch.

380
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,139
You've got a lot coming your way.

381
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,976
So grit your teeth and be a bigger bitch.

382
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,145
That's how you stay in the game.

383
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,453
-Holy crap, that's insane.
-Who is it?

384
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,954
-No way.
-She's freaking hot.

385
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,497
-Holy shit.
-Tear it off.

386
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,251
-Nice, I have Madame Aema!
-Hey, give me that!

387
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,385
CURFEW LIFTED AFTER 36 YEARS!

388
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,764
MADAME AEMA
KOREA'S FIRST-EVER MIDNIGHT MOVIE

389
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,105
Now, in just a short while,

390
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,400
we will be holding the premiere

391
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,361
of the Republic of Korea's
first-ever erotic film

392
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:36,616
and first-ever midnight movie,
Madame Aema!

393
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,540
All right, please all join me
for the countdown.

394
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,127
-Five! Four!
-Four!

395
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,297
-Three! Two! One!
-Three! Two! One!

396
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,925
Open the doors!

397
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,388
Man, it's going to be fun on a bun!
An absolute blast!

398
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:03,601
Have fun in there, mister.
You too, miss. Enjoy!

399
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,478
Safety first, everyone!

400
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:09,232
Cinemas are now open
even late into the night!

401
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,234
Hello, I'm Jeong Hee-ran.

402
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,445
It's been a while, everyone.
I've missed you all.

403
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,697
Have you all missed me too?

404
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,117
Yes!

405
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,077
Please enjoy the film.

406
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,370
I love you all.

407
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,469
-Ju-ae!
-We're here!

408
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,304
-You look so pretty.
-So pretty!

409
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,893
Hello.

410
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,687
I'm a new actress,

411
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,190
and my name is Shin Ju-ae.

416
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,692
Oh, Ms. Jeong Hee-ran!

417
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,071
Congrats on the release.

418
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,548
Aema, I can't hold it in any longer.

419
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,509
I think I'm about to come. I'm coming!

420
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,511
Yun-ho, hold it in.

421
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,222
I said hold it in!

422
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,517
You're really going to get it
if all you do is splash on the doorframe!

423
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,813
The night is young,
and my thirst hasn't been quenched yet.

424
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,148
I'm still thirsty!

425
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,943
-Aema.
-Yun-ho.

426
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,778
-Aema!
-Yun-ho!

427
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,281
-Sex!
-Sex!

428
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,789
Yeong-suk!

429
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,876
It's been so long.

430
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,545
How have you guys been?

431
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,465
Ju-ae.

432
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,220
We were so happy for you
when we heard you were starring in a film.

433
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,100
But…

434
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,523
we had no clue
it would be a film like this.

435
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,735
We thought it was a bit…

436
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,742
embarrassing.

437
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,796
Guys.

438
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,799
If you were embarrassed,

439
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,551
I'm sorry.

440
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,139
I just

441
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,975
want you guys to know…

442
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,063
how hard I worked for this.

443
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,607
Anyway,

444
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,861
I'm just so happy that my friends…

445
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,615
came all this way to see it.

446
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,997
That's all.

447
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,687
YEONG-JA'S HEYDAYS

448
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,524
Jeong Hee-ran looked so pretty
in that film.

449
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,194
You're right.

450
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,321
She was so cool.

451
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,241
If I'm honest,
I thought Ju-ae looked pretty too.

452
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,829
Right?

453
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:38,167
I've never seen Ju-ae look like that.
I thought it was pretty cool.

454
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,961
Maybe we're into lewd stuff like that.

455
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,172
-Hey, don't say that.
-Hey.

456
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:45,925
Same.

457
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,344
-Don't play coy.
-It was so fun.

458
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,055
-Erotic is fun.
-Right? I loved it!

459
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,434
Well,

460
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,646
she did look pretty.

461
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,524
What's with her?

462
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,818
What's her deal?
I know she enjoyed it too.

463
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,237
Seriously, settle down a little.

464
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,158
MADAME AEMA SELLS OUT ON OPENING NIGHT

465
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,376
-No.
-No?

466
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,294
-No, yes.
-You like that?

467
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,712
I like that.

468
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,880
A little more.

469
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,965
-Sex!
-Sex!

470
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:29,260

Mr. Gi.

475
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,403
Yes?

476
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,613
You little prick.

477
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,948
Get out.

GIL SHIN-AE BOUTIQUE
A SCENE FROM MADAME AEMA

479
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,744
MADAME AEMA ACTRESS SHIN JU-AE

480
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,461
She didn't even wear these.

481
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,920
As for these,

482
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,839
you completely ignored

483
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,091
and rearranged the entire outfit.

484
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,384
On top of all that,

485
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,471
this one.

486
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,390
You guys completely redid
the silhouette for this one.

487
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,850
Did you get it altered?

488
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,853
What are you people?

489
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,771
A motley gang of thugs?

490
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,401
Hey now.

491
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,611
Cough up my money.

492
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,698
Give me back my money, you damn crooks!

493
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,493
Hey now, Ms. Gil!

494
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,912
I mean, come on,
is this really such a big deal?

495
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,080
So what if she switched things up?

496
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,082
They're all Gil Shin-ae's clothes anyway!

497
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:43,751
Hey.

498
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,670
Do you have any idea
how much of my store's revenue

499
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,963
I poured into Madame Aema?

500
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,423
Two million.

501
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,344
Does two million won
sound like child's play to you?

502
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,986
Are you going to be driving?

503
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,197
Get in.

504
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,415
Hey, star director!

505
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,878
The entire world
is talking about Madame Aema.

506
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,214
How does it feel?

507
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,715
I don't know.

508
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,094
I have mixed feelings about it all.

509
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,303
There you go again,

510
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,266
overthinking everything
like every director out there.

511
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,393
I'm glad that people like it,

512
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,438
but men are raving over it,
and women are uncomfortable with it.

513
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,859
It's the exact opposite
of what I set out to do.

514
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,486
Look.

515
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,740
Had we gone with your subtle,
artsy-fartsy film idea,

516
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,493
you would've subtly faded away
after your directorial debut.

517
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,620
I practically saved your life.

518
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,626
Sign with me.

519
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,712
About five films should do.

520
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,757
I turned you into a star director,
so it's time you paid back the favor.

521
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,762
I have a script for Hee-ran,
so get started on that right away.

522
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,979
Okay. In that case…

523
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,483
why don't we make a deal?

524
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,652
MADAME AEMA

525
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,530

THE NATION ACHES FOR MADAME AEMA

530
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,924
We're all curious about
what Madame Aema's childhood was like.

531
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,220
What kind of girl were you
when you were little, Ms. Shin Ju-ae?

532
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,265
I was nothing more than a kitchen hand.

533
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,977
I had no mother,
so I did all the household chores.

534
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:12,399
As an elementary schooler, my entire life
was cooking rice and doing laundry.

535
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,070
Then I became a middle schooler
who wanted more in life.

536
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:21,033
Then a high schooler who feared
that might be all there was to life.

537
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,204
I guess you could say my dream…

538
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,416
was to leave the kitchen.

539
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,961
FROM COOKING RICE
TO TOUCHING THE HEARTS OF MEN NATIONWIDE

540
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,672
A KITCHEN HAND WOKE UP AS A SEXY STAR

541
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:39,802
The 21st annual Daejong Film Awards
are just a month away now.

542
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,180
Today, the awards officially announced
its nominees for each category

543
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,349
and started publicizing the event.

544
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,519
Man, you look pretty.

545
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,979
Yup, so sexy.

546
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,607
Ooh, it's scorching.

547
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,984
It's summer,
but you've got Sac Sac, so all is good.

548
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,446
Oh, you're melting. Melting all over.

549
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,573
Melting, just melting.

550
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,958
You can change into these next.

551
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,168
We'll be shooting in five.

552
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,022
Hey there, Ms. Lasting Friendships.

553
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,191
Long time no see.

554
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,445
Damn, a red swimsuit.

555
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,530
Holy fuck, that's a major turn-on.

556
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,495
You must feel like you have a new
lease on life nowadays, sweetheart.

557
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,458
Did you see my review of Madame Aema?

558
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,586
I'll bet no one wrote
a more flattering article than I did.

559
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,712
I'm telling you,

560
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:01,467
I was all over Madame Aema, I was.

561
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,095
I don't know what business you have here,

562
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,098
but I was just headed back to my shoot.

563
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:09,725
Me?

564
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,105
I'm here to call you out, hon.

565
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,900
Baby,

566
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,193
I'm only human.

567
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,737
I came all this way
because you hurt my feelings.

568
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,322
SHY GIRL SETS AUDIENCES' HEARTS ABLAZE

569
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:28,786
I let it slide when you were playing coy
and turning down my interview proposals,

570
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:34,082
but you should've given me
this kind of family scoop.

571
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,335
If you go around leaking it to others,

572
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:40,047
what would that do
to your long-time regular's reputation?

573
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,093
I didn't give it to them.

574
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,721
I simply answered a question.

575
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,807
Did you see the news yesterday?

576
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,726
You're nominated for a Daejong Award.

577
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,686
Best New Actress.

578
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,606
See?

579
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,567
I knew you'd be clueless.

580
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,695
Can you really blame me
for wanting to toot my own horn?

581
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,198
I got you that nom.

582
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,618
You know our paper hosts
the Daejong Awards, right?

583
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:13,789
I'm the lead of our department,
which means I've got considerable pull.

584
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,502
Do an exclusive interview
with me next week, okay?

585
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,879
I'll make it a major story.

586
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,758
I asked Mr. Gi to schedule a meeting,

587
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,761
but that son of a bitch
kept stonewalling me, so he's out.

588
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,932
I'll reach out to President Ku personally
to schedule an interview…

589
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,729
So let's do some catching up.

590
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,314
Okay?

591
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,241
TRENDY MONTHLY

592
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,243
Shin Ju-ae…

593
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,881
How long has Hee-ran been my muse?

594
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,259
I don't know.
For around ten years, I guess?

595
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:12,848
What is it?

596
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,058
No, you can't.

597
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,853
We can't do this again.
Out of the question.

598
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,398
The Daejong Awards
are right around the corner.

599
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,733
Sir?

600
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,818
Sir?

601
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,326
So, Hee-ran,

602
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,245
for the Best Supporting Actress
at the Daejong Film Awards…

603
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,124
they say you're likely to win.

604
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,504
Ju-ae's also a strong contender,

605
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,049
so I've struck a deal with President Ku

606
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,218
to officially release the film
after the awards.

607
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,971
I'm going to restore my edit

608
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,682
and start again from scratch.

609
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,523
This cut highlights

610
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,318
the two female characters
and their outstanding performance.

611
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:10,197
You could say
that this is the true Madame Aema

612
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,199
that we intended all along.

613
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,951
Dubbed

614
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,079
Madame Aema Originale.

615
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,978
How do you like that title? It's Italian.

616
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,773
Madame Aema Originale.

617
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,858
Something like that.

618
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,362
Or Madame Aema, Eddo, Originaru.

619
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,446
Something like that?

620
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,157
No, Japanese is a no-go,
considering our history.

621
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,951
Or maybe "original…"

622
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,620
English is a bit boring.

623
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,124
I think originale sounds better.

624
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,043
Sounds like the work of an Italian auteur,
you know? Originale.

625
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,336
Despite everything,

626
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,465
I guess Madame Aema is lucky…

627
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,927
to have you as its director.

628
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,865
Remember how you asked me

629
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,492
to make you the next Jeong Hee-ran?

630
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,288
I'll keep that promise.

631
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,418
You'll see once you go over it,

632
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,631
but this contract lets you star
in ten films across seven years.

633
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,925
We usually go for ten years,

634
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,721
but I've shortened the term,
and we can renegotiate once the term's up.

635
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,641
Yes, it is special treatment.

636
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,271
You made your debut film a smash hit,
so I ought to reciprocate.

637
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,276
I haven't…

638
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,280
given any of this much thought yet.

639
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,160
You can start thinking now.

640
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:25,332
Now you've experienced Chungmuro,
you know all actresses need an umbrella.

641
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,336
You need a strong backer
like Shinsung Pictures to survive.

642
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,132
I'm a seasoned veteran in this field.
What do you think I'm here for?

643
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,928
It's all to take care of the little things

644
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:41,765
like putting an umbrella
over the heads of artists like you.

645
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,849
EXCLUSIVITY CONTRACT

646
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,442
DIRECTOR KWON DO-IL
TO WIN LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

647
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,926
ROOKIE ACTRESS HWANG MI-NA FOUND DEAD

648
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,887
OVERDOSE AMID ONGOING BATTLE
WITH DEPRESSION

649
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,681
Her face was full of desire.

650
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,060
I pity girls like her the most.

651
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,067
DEATH AND FUNERAL NOTICE

652
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,320
LOCATION: 917-22 YEOCHA-RI, HWADO-MYEON
DATE: SEPTEMBER 3, 1982

653
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:58,675
CONDOLENCES

654
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,594
Let's eat.

655
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,079
YEONG-JA'S HEYDAYS

656
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:24,135
I heard Mi-na was born and raised here.

657
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,266
The view from my childhood home
was just like this.

658
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,436
It was dark…

659
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,606
out of reach…

660
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,987
and distant.

661
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,992
Remember what you told me a while back?

662
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,036
You said whatever it might be,

663
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,664
you didn't want me to lose anything.

664
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,836
Truth is, I've lived my life

665
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,088
giving things away
ever since I was your age.

666
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,010
And yet, despite living a life of losing,

667
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,389
I was always scared witless
of losing even more.

668
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,646
What was I so afraid of

669
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,274
all the time?

670
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:13,370
Gotta say, I got chills
when you asked to see me first.

671
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,124
Shall we pick up from the almost dramatic
scene we left off on last time?

672
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:24,547
Thanks to you, I redid my whole office.
It's '60s-style LA.

673
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,675
Had I known the film would be such a hit,

674
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:31,137
I wouldn't have just fixed the office,
but relocated entirely.

675
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:37,185
I'll admit, I may have underestimated
Madame Aema's potential.

676
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,607
Oh, and we'll be releasing
the reedited cut of Madame Aema soon.

677
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:48,363
Might as well ride its wave of success
this whole year with a reedited cut.

678
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,244
All right, so…

679
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,705
given it any thought?

680
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,998
Aema Rocked Hong Kong?

681
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,420
We're all ready when you are.
All you need to do is show up and act.

682
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,714
We made a killing with Madame Aema,

683
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,635
so I'll write you a fat check
and slip you a nice bonus. How's that?

684
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,264
Mi-na.

685
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,685
You killed her.

686
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,615
Watch what you say, okay?

687
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,243
Mi-na was near and dear to me as well.

688
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,204
And I'm going to make sure

689
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,791
you pay for all you've done.

690
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:44,752
"All"?

691
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,588
"All I've done"?

692
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,423
Hee-ran.

693
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:53,219
Learn to let go of what you must,
and take what life gives you.

694
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,555
Life is hard enough as it is.

695
00:57:56,347 --> 00:58:00,852
You're an actress, so act like one.
Just enjoy your pretty and glamorous life.

696
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,487
Hey, I know we've got
this love-hate thing going,

697
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:14,741
but would it kill you to start being
more amicable for a change, you bitch?

698
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,785
And quit being such a fucking downer.

699
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,079
Pay for what I fucking did?

700
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,541
What can you even do anyway?

701
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,044
Nothing, Hee-ran.

702
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,130
Just keep being pretty and stay put.

703
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,798
Sometimes,

704
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,134
I think all that beauty's wasted on you.

705
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,725
You think you burned all the evidence
with that single ledger, don't you?

706
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:48,858
