1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,844
May you rest in peace.

2
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,305
What are you on about?
Do I look dead to you?

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,226
Please take this opportunity
to reflect on your life.

4
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,395
Hey.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,771
Are you making fun of me?

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,567
Just you wait

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,985
until I get back up.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,778
I sure hope you get back up.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,073
Don't touch me. Just leave, will you?

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,950
You crazy bastard!

11
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:39,122
How many times have I told you
not to ride your motorcycle drunk?

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,208
Apparently, a fall like this
would have killed your average man,

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,587
but I came out relatively unscathed
because I broke the fall by rolling.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,839
Filming's meant to start on Monday!

15
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,717
Per the contract, you owe us for damages.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,886
Just push filming back a few days.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,431
Broken bones always heal fast
in my family.

18
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,224
I just need a few days, okay?

19
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,143
The doctor said 12 weeks for recovery!

20
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,521
Everything in life happens for a reason.

21
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,273
Just shoot it later.

22
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,400
Much later.

23
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,737
She's right.
Just shoot it later. Much later.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,655
You're out, dimwit.

25
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,533
We'll be filming as planned,

26
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,035
so stay on schedule, okay?

27
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,537
What are you on about?
Your lead actor's injured.

28
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,290
Yeah, what are you on about?
Your lead actor's injured.

29
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,917
Don't overthink this.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,212
The plan was to film what we can
while editing the script.

31
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,339
Hey, didn't you hear me?

32
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,175
How do you plan to shoot a film
without the lead?

33
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,843
Use a stand-in for the whole thing?

34
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,346
Yeah, how?
Use a stand-in for the whole thing?

35
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,555
That would be ludicrous.

36
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,766
I am the heart and soul of Madame Aema.

37
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,392
Will you quit butting in?

38
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,438
And why would you be the heart and soul
of Madame Aema, you crazy bastard?

39
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,856
What? "Crazy bastard"?

40
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,982
You crazy bitch.

41
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,193
Think you're the heart and soul
of Madame Aema?

42
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,820
It ain't you either, crazy bitch!

43
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,531
You're just a crazy bitch,
you crazy bitch!

44
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,080
This can be easily resolved
by finding a new actor.

45
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,375
We just need to focus and stay on course.

46
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,459
Got that?

47
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,836
President Ku.

48
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,464
Since it's come to all this,

49
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,425
why don't you just
drop me from the film too?

50
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,427
Look, Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

51
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,680
Why do you keep putting your hands on me?

52
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,644
Could you please try
to keep things professional?

53
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,278
You dare

54
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,447
use force on an actress?

55
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,870
You crazy…

56
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,038
You're no actress, you crazy bitch!

57
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,291
You're just a crazy bitch,
you crazy bitch!

58
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,043
He's right! You're just a crazy bitch,
you crazy bitch!

59
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,421
Shut the hell up, you crazy bastards!

60
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,839
COMPLETE BED REST

61
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,767
Just shut the hell up, all of you!
You're all driving me crazy!

62
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,647
Focus? You want me to focus right now?

63
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,900
Did you say we'll film as planned?

64
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,111
I wrote the lines and did everything
as the actor asked,

65
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,240
only for him to break every bone
in his body right before the shoot.

66
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,451
The government's riding me
to revise the script,

67
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,287
breathing down my neck
and making me take out the sausage!

68
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,997
The producer wants more breasts,

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,418
but we can't actually show any breasts,
so they're meant to be subtly bare.

70
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,462
What am I meant to…

71
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,214
What even is this?

72
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,673
What is it?

73
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,966
What do you want from me?

74
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,913
AEMA

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,213
FILMING CREW

76
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,217
MADAME AEMA
PRODUCTION VEHICLE

77
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,452
-Nice!
-My, that's refreshing.

78
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,829
Feels great.

79
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,338
That's nice.

80
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,356
Thirty-six counts
of inappropriate subject matter.

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,568
Salaciousness, obscenity, degeneracy…

82
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,737
Fuck.

83
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,910
AEMA CHOOSES HERSELF

84
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,996
TO SEEK INDEPENDENCE
WITH ERIKA'S INFLUENCE

85
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,297
We're finally filming tomorrow.

86
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,923
How do you feel?

87
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,887
Why did you cast me for this role?

88
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,973
I don't know.

89
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,394
I guess the thought just came to me

90
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,355
the moment I first saw you.

91
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,272
"Oh…"

92
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,691
"She's the one."

93
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,777
Because of my breasts?

94
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,952
When I was little…

95
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,208
I was the only girl in our hometown

96
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,169
to hit puberty.

97
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,006
My breasts were constantly
the talk of the town.

98
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,342
"They're bigger today."

99
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,719
"They're smaller today."

100
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,807
Everywhere I went, I always slumped over

101
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,850
and looked down at my feet.

102
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,146
Getting so much attention
for my breasts made me feel guilty.

103
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,234
Who knows why I felt that way?

104
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,114
I don't care
if you cast me for my breasts.

105
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,117
Let's be honest.

106
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,828
Breasts like these deserve
some screen time.

107
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,499
And it's about time
these breasts did me some good.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,336
We can't bare your breasts anymore.

109
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,464
The government won't allow it.

110
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,051
Then how are we going to film
those scenes?

111
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,596
Well…

112
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:13,933
it's like this.

113
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,978
We can't actually show your breasts,

114
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,773
but we'll be subtly alluding
to your breasts

115
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,735
so that it's no different
from actually showing your…

116
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,327
I'm still working on it.

117
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,665
I'm okay with that.

118
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,630
No matter what happens, I believe in you.

119
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,758
So whatever you come up with,

120
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,093
I'll be okay with it.

121
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,597
I'll do whatever you say.

122
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,498
All right!

123
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,506
Thank you for getting here.

124
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,549
Now go back.

125
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,800
What?

126
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,139
Drop this off at the Ministry of Culture
and Public Information tomorrow.

127
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,766
It's urgent, so no detours.

128
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:40,895
But…

129
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,107
MADAME AEMA FINAL DRAFT
SHINSUNG PICTURES

130
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,527
"On this day,

131
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,114
the day of the Horse and Snake,
in the year of the White Rooster,

132
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,911
I, Kwak In-u,
director of the film Madame Aema,

133
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,247
shall make this plea."

134
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,876
"Please watch over
our entire cast and filming crew

135
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,337
for the entire duration of filming,

136
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,632
and let our film, Madame Aema,

137
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,761
be showered with love from the public

138
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,515
until the very day it leaves theaters."

139
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:22,603
"Please ensure
a smooth and peaceful production."

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,565
"Spirits of the heaven and earth,

141
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,692
please accept our offerings."

142
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,574
Fire!

143
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,575
Stomp it out.

144
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,133
-Hurry.
-Ung-bae, get over here.

145
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,342
Coming!

146
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,803
-Put it down here.
-Wouldn't it obscure the shot?

147
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,805
-Bring it here.
-I'll move that, sorry.

148
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,849
-What a view.
-Let's get going.

149
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,851
All right. Let's move it.

150
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,102
Let's go.

151
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,604
Hey, move it.

152
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,440
Here's the new script.
Memorize it. You've got 15 minutes.

153
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,399
Sorry? But…

154
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,402
There are a lot of changes,
so make sure you've checked them.

155
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,863
New script.

156
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,991
We'll be shooting in 15 minutes.

157
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,393
Scene 135, take one.

158
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,107
And go!

159
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,923
Erika.

160
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,889
Aema… are you out of your mind?

161
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,977
Have you forgotten what your husband
did to you all these years?

162
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,982
How could you even consider
going back to him?

163
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,655
You're forgetting about
the thing that matters most.

164
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,407
I'm talking about

165
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,783
you.

166
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,329
Are you really going to give up
on your life as a woman?

167
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,373
-Answer me.
-Answer her.

168
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,749
Answer me, Aema.

169
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,668
Say something!

170
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,504
I may be

171
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,923
a woman,

172
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,008
but I'm sorry, Erika.

173
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,679
Before anything else,
I'm the woman of a man.

174
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,223
I'm his…

175
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,058
his…

176
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,020
Wife! You're his wife, damn it!

177
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,402
Reshoot the part she just butchered.

178
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,987
I'm going to continue.

179
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,911
Get a grip.

180
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,707
By letting a man
control your life like that,

181
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,751
you've made a mockery of me.

182
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,668
Not just me,

183
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,421
but all of us.

184
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,309
Erika…

185
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,978
Cut!

186
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,855
Come on, what the hell was that?

187
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,816
You don't know your lines,
and your delivery was flat!

188
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,526
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,529
I haven't gotten used to my lines yet.

190
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,364
No, that's not it.

191
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,492
This isn't about
getting used to your lines.

192
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,287
You need to embody Aema and speak as her.

193
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,292
Am I good to go?

194
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,461
Yes, you were great, Hee-ran.

195
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,881
It seems she's nervous,
today being her first day and all.

196
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,133
Isn't today everyone's first day here?

197
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,969
Like I said,

198
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,932
she simply doesn't have
what it takes to make it big.

199
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,393
Use a stand-in.

200
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,071
What's a stand-in?

201
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,782
A replacement.

202
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,743
A replacement for whom?

203
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,923
Aema, are you out of your mind?

204
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,302
Have you forgotten what your husband
did to you all these years?

205
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,847
How could you even consider
going back to him?

206
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,642
You're forgetting about
the thing that matters most.

207
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,143
I'm talking about you!

208
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,814
You are really

209
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,525
going to give up on your life

210
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:20,943
as a woman?

211
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,654
Answer me. Answer me, Aema.

212
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,281
-Answer me, Aema.
-Answer her.

213
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,867
I said answer me.

214
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,594
What's this? What are we going for here?

215
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,555
I have no idea. Only Mr. Paul knows.

216
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,559
So you're telling me

217
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,561
this is what Mr. Paul wants?

218
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,338
If you're here to see Hee-ran,
you can't right now.

219
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,759
I said no, didn't I?

220
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
Oh, come on…

221
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,481
You really can't.
You really shouldn't go there.

222
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,400
You really shouldn't go up there.
You can't!

223
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,494
Didn't I say not to let just anyone up?

224
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,829
He did stop me.

225
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,707
I forced my way through.

226
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,007
You don't like me, do you, Hee-ran?

227
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,802
It can't be helped. I can deal with that.

228
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,473
But you must have had
a first day on set too.

229
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,934
For me, that was today.

230
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,312
I'm not any good yet,

231
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,606
but I'm trying my best.

232
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,901
Because I want to get good.

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,072
That's the problem.

234
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,286
The misguided notion
that hard work will make you good.

235
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,084
It's not like acting
is the New Village Movement.

236
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,337
When an actor tries too hard…

237
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,343
it's tacky.

238
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,391
Then again,

239
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,436
I guess that would suit you better.

240
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,151
Fucking bitch.

241
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,539
Head to the market now
and buy a fresh ginseng gift set.

242
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,749
FILM MODIFICATION DECLARATION

243
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,209
-The fattest, most expensive one.
-Okay.

244
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,544
Go.

245
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,384
MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND PUBLIC INFORMATION

246
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,400
Your cigarette.

247
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,194
You'll make it smell like smoke.

248
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,668
Let's see.

249
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,462
Like this…

250
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,133
Let's emphasize those curves.

251
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,137
It's Madame Aema.

252
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,765
All right.

253
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,893
Aema's here for acupuncture treatment.

254
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,605
The blind acupuncturist
starts treating her.

255
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,148
While undergoing treatment,

256
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,818
Aema feels a strange pleasure
along with the pain.

257
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,736
Erika.

258
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,904
Erika?

259
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,239
You, Erika,

260
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,368
immerse yourself in those sensations
with Aema as you watch it all unfold.

261
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,702
Did everyone get that?

262
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,745
-Let's go.
-Okay.

263
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,955
I should feel it too?

264
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,124
But I'm taking notes.

265
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,626
Okay, in that case,
just feel it on the inside.

266
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,378
Let's focus on the rehearsal!

267
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,672
All right. Ready?

268
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,340
Go!

269
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,180
Hey, Aema shouldn't be lying
like a corpse!

270
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,431
Savor every poke.

271
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,850
Savor it?

272
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,645
Don't look at me.

273
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,189
You squirm in pleasure.

274
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,026
You're getting all turned on.

275
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,493
Why are you actually turned on?

276
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,162
What do you think?

277
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,248
The breasts are staring a little too hard.

278
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,000
Can't we just put a bra on her?

279
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,461
Who wears a bra while they're getting
acupuncture? Should we flip her around?

280
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,090
Then it would seem like
we're trying to hide them.

281
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,342
That's true.

282
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,678
Don't you need to be
face down for acupuncture?

283
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,430
You don't needle chests.

284
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,725
Why not?
You can needle your chest if it hurts.

285
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,059
Hang on a minute.

286
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,312
Would showing one breast
also be a violation?

287
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,565
Maybe it's okay
as long as we don't expose both.

288
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,985
Didn't they say how many breasts
we're allowed to show?

289
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,655
What do you mean, how many breasts?
It's just no nipples.

290
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,699
Right.

291
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,492
So not a single nipple?

292
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,067
Okay, now give me ecstasy.

293
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,487
All right, love it.
Now pain, then elation!

294
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,366
Now, pain!

295
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,619
Okay, now ecstasy!

296
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,206
But I already did ecstasy.

297
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,376
Now let's go to Erika. Erika!

298
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,127
Erika.

299
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,116
Hee-ran.

300
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,750
Is something bothering you?

301
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,173
I just don't get this situation.

302
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,967
What do you mean?

303
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,594
Why is she getting so turned on
by acupuncture?

304
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,972
What is she, some acupuncture fetishist?

305
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:51,435
The scene is meant to show that pain
and pleasure are actually the same thing.

306
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,894
What are you talking about?

307
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,813
How is pain the same as pleasure?

308
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,569
You know what? Forget it.
It's not like I'm the one acting it out.

309
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,950
"Erika observes Aema
and shares her pain and pleasure."

310
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,702
Why am I feeling anything?

311
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,205
"Erika licks her lips with her tongue."

312
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,082
"She starts getting turned on."

313
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,168
Why am I getting turned on?

314
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,048
Why am I sitting around like an idiot,
watching, feeling, and getting turned on?

315
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,300
How am I meant to play this?

316
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,762
I got the idea from ero guro nansensu.

317
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,890
Stuff that's erotic and grotesque
but also nonsensical.

318
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,309
Like a blend of sweet,
salty, spicy, and sour.

319
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,020
The yin, yang,
and five elements of sex are--

320
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,229
Director.

321
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,232
You can't convince me, can you?

322
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,526
Hee-ran.

323
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,780
This scene

324
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,200
will be iconic
and come to represent Madame Aema.

325
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,951
Those are your aspirations.

326
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,747
I asked you how I should play this.
Please don't change the subject.

327
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,751
Do you know how torturous it is
for actors to play a role they don't buy?

328
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,963
Director.

329
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,510
We'll shoot this scene
when you're ready to convince me.

330
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,180
Yeong-bae, start the car.

331
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,815
Script, wallet, handkerchief…

332
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,441
Oh, the script.

333
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,244
Wait.

334
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,871
How can you just walk out like this?

335
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,634
If you hate both me and this film,

336
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,012
why are you even shooting it?

337
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,264
How bold of you.

338
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,898
Are films just a paycheck to you?

339
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,287
You're a real bitch, you know that?

340
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,559
Fine.

341
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,686
Keep working hard.

342
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,606
Tacky or not,
it suits you as you are right now.

343
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,484
Trust in the director,
trust in the script,

344
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,235
and keep doing your best.

345
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,613
But there will come a time

346
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,867
when, no matter how hard you try,
you just won't buy it.

347
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,329
A time when even the director fails
to convince you.

348
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,789
What will you do then?

349
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,836
Will you keep giving it your all
even when you don't buy it?

350
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,341
What will you even work hard at
when none of it makes sense to you?

351
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,970
Quit whining and ask yourself

352
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,848
what it is you're demanding of me.

353
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,311
And,

354
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,439
since you know I'm a bitch now,

355
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,944
stop these clumsy attempts
to look like you're a bitch.

356
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,112
Before I truly…

357
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,741
beat the shit out of you.

358
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,505
Let's wrap things up and head out.

359
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,258
I'll give you the new schedule
when it's ready.

360
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,051
Okay.

361
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,345
-Coming through.
-Good work, everyone.

362
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,848
-We need to tear this whole part down.
-Let's hurry up.

363
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,767
Director.

364
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,811
Listen,

365
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,106
I'm giving this film everything I've got.

366
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,733
I need you to know what that means.

367
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,486
In return…

368
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,619
you need to make me believe in you.

369
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,958
I'll be going now.

370
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,147
MADAME AEMA

371
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,607
MADAME AEMA
SHIN JU-AE

372
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,876
IF I'M GOING TO BE A BITCH, MIGHT AS WELL
BE A BADASS BITCH LIKE JEONG HEE-RAN

373
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,557
You came, Aema.

374
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,477
Aema?

375
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,065
Seriously!

376
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,777
I told you to take off your underwear.

377
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,822
Any underwear marks
will keep us waiting all night.

378
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,367
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,746
It just felt weird
going commando by myself.

380
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:49,876
I try not to take my underwear off
when I'm outside.

381
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,544
Ever since I was little,

382
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,589
I've been rather sensitive
to cold temperatures.

383
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,885
Make a fist for me.

384
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,969
Okay.

385
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,888
That's your genitalia.

386
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,557
Including your scrotum, okay?

387
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,478
Genitalia, including the scrotum.

388
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,688
Hand me your fist.

389
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,982
Do this.

390
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,818
Then, taking your size into account,

391
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,155
trim the parts that stick out like this
with scissors.

392
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,701
But don't cut against your skin,
or it's another all-nighter.

393
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,916
Wrap it around properly,
separating the scrotum from the body.

394
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,002
Especially down here.

395
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,840
That part's out of view,
so stick it down well or it'll come off.

396
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,425
You can do it yourself, right?

397
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,277
I guess you might have a hard time
managing by yourself.

398
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,773
Hey, I heard you wanted to see me.

399
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,696
Have you found a workaround?

400
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,614
What?

401
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,744
A way to subtly allude to my breasts
that's no different to actually showing…

402
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,954
Oh, that?

403
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,334
I've been discussing it
with the director of photography.

404
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,213
I've given it some thought, and…

405
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,175
what if it rains?

406
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,261
Rain?

407
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,262
Out of nowhere?

408
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,348
When it rains,

409
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:09,974
you get wet.

410
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,857
And what if we scrap everything else
so I'm just wearing this?

411
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,069
What? Just this?

412
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,578
When it rains,

413
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,580
you get wet.

414
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,670
It would be no different

415
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,381
to actually showing them.

416
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,853
Rain.

417
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,021
Assistant director. I need my AD!

418
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,148
Rain! I want rain!

419
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,609
Rain! Assistant director! Hey!

420
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,182
Back up.

421
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,811
Hold on. Wait!

422
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,359
-Rehearsal, go!
-A close-up of the face.

423
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,944
Let's see it from this side.

424
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,656
Lower your legs, you idiot.
As for you, stiffen your back.

425
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:49,991
Stay still.

426
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,453
The emotions are what matter here.

427
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,079
Emotions. The emotions.

428
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,205
Focus on the face.

429
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,832
-The face…
-Okay?

430
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,585
-We're all set, right? Okay.
-The face.

431
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,964
-We need more there.
-Do we have to keep going?

432
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,549
Keep going at it. Harder.

433
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,218
Don't look at me.

434
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,472
Lights! They're blinding me.
That's enough lightning.

435
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,474
-Save it for later.
-Yes. Sorry.

436
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,441
This scene is
what Aema's always dreamed of.

437
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,861
It's the moment she finally frees her body
from the shackles of the morals

438
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,947
that have bound her up until this point.

439
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,577
What matters most here is the orgasm.

440
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,248
How do you express an orgasm?

441
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,543
Don't you know what an orgasm is?

442
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:47,715
It's a burning sensation that shoots up
from the pit of your stomach,

443
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,509
travels up your spine, and makes you…

444
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,262
Right, and how am I
supposed to express that?

445
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,140
Are you still a virgin, Ju-ae?

446
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,142
Have you done it, Director?

447
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,435
How is that relevant?

448
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,521
You asked me first.

449
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,236
I've had instances

450
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,447
where my partner was trying their best,

451
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,451
and I felt as though
I should repay them somehow.

452
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,246
What do you do when that happens?

453
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,499
I hold my breath.

454
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:22,917
Your breath?

455
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,714
All right, ready!

456
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,383
Rolling.

457
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,469
Go!

458
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,440
Yun-ho.

459
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,777
Aema.

460
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,988
You came.

461
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,788
Now.

462
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,087
Oh God! Wait up!

463
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,548
Oh man, this is bad!

464
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,716
You idiot!

465
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,719
I didn't even call cut!
Are you out of your mind?

466
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,513
My apologies.

467
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,724
The cover fell off my privates.

468
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,683
Sorry.

469
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,978
He got hard.

470
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,771
Oh, to be young.

471
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,026
How was it? Was it any good?

472
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,488
It was amazing.

473
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,979
There sure are a lot of magpies
in this neighborhood.

474
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,273
What?

475
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,026
I've just noticed

476
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,238
a lot of magpies around.

477
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,615
Oh, magpies.

478
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,244
Magpies are

479
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,287
great.

480
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,257
I don't know what love is yet

481
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,969
You're the only one that I trust

482
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,936
Excuse me.

483
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,980
We're shooting a film here,

484
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,607
so thank you for not parking here.

485
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,705
Hey.

486
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,666
Yes?

487
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,919
We're here to see the director.
Is he in the middle of a shoot?

488
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,087
That's right, sir.

489
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,965
Then tell him to wrap it up
and get over here.

490
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,842
Sorry, sir. Could you repeat that?

491
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,635
Is this nutter for real?

492
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,221
You need some help understanding?

493
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,767
No, sir!

494
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,729
Get a load of that dumbass.

495
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,231
Hey, stop.

496
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,025
Cut! I mean…

497
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,821
Stop! Stop filming!

498
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,866
What the hell do you mean?
Who stopped the shoot?

499
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,326
They're from the ministry.

500
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,244
-The Ministry of Culture?
-I think so.

501
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,454
Get Seok on the phone.

502
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,539
-They were from the ministry, sir.
-Yeah?

503
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,624
-They had a ministry car and badges.
-What?

504
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,917
-Ministry suits.
-What?

505
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,545
-Were they actually ministry folk?
-The heck is going on?

506
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,796
Not at all.

507
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,008
If you would put in a call for us,
that would really help.

508
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,635
In that case, I'll give them a call.

509
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,596
-Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

510
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,390
I'll treat you
to something nice and fancy soon.

511
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,475
Thank you!

512
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,314
Hey, you're right on time. Take a seat.

513
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,622
The ministry sent people last night.

514
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,583
Apparently, they shut down the shoot

515
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,378
because we didn't make
the adjustments they demanded.

516
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,213
We did as they asked, okay?

517
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,257
We did everything they wanted
and expressed our gratitude.

518
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,301
The thing is,

519
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,846
no matter how much I reflect,
I can't tell what the problem was.

520
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,515
Could you look into it for me?

521
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,896
If filming is shut down for good,
Shinsung Pictures is as good as bust.

522
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,523
Help us out, will you?

523
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,484
What a life you've lived.

524
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,990
So the '70s were the golden days
of your life, President Ku.

525
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,661
Things are different now, aren't they?

526
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,290
Younger audiences are losing interest
in domestic films,

527
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,210
and every household has a color TV now.

528
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,964
People are forgetting about the perks
of going to the cinema to watch films.

529
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,009
Man, you must really be feeling the heat.

530
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,928
You film industry folk.

531
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,894
Such a shame, when we government men
should be looking out for you.

532
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,830
President Ku.

533
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:01,876
Where do you think
the '88 Olympics will be held?

534
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,504
Come on.

535
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,090
They're announcing it today.

536
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,342
Everyone seems so certain

537
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,305
that the honor will go to Seoul.

538
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,809
Thanks to that,
I've been working my ass off as of late.

539
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,897
A grand banquet
has been scheduled out of the blue.

540
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:29,361
The higher-ups are saying
we need some fresh meat this time.

541
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,240
That's easier said than done.
We all know the game.

542
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,785
Where can I find a fresh haul
when everything's already been tried?

543
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,291
Am I supposed to snatch people
off the streets?

544
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,463
I'm just kidding, by the way.

545
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,222
Of course Seoul's going to win
the Olympics bid.

546
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:00,893
God knows the Republic of Korea
has broken its back to host the Olympics.

547
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,436
Hard work always pays off.

548
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,564
It's as good as ours,
which is why we should prepare in advance.

549
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,692
If we just had the chance,

550
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,820
we filmmakers would love
to deliver our congratulations.

551
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,616
A while ago,

552
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,245
we held a huge press conference
for Madame Aema. Did you see it?

553
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,871
Did I

554
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,831
see it?

555
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,584
I've discovered a new actress.

556
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,587
Shin Ju-ae.

557
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,589
She may be a rookie,

558
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,635
but she's so dependable
that I felt confident casting her

559
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,512
as the lead in Madame Aema.

560
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:40,099
Highly dependable.

561
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,902
Well, she must be busy filming right now.

562
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,115
That's right.

563
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,242
Filming's on hold, isn't it?

564
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,554
Voting is underway to decide
the host city of the '88 Olympics…

565
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,808
Are you sure you submitted the documents
and script like I told you to?

566
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,520
Of course we did.
Why would we leave anything out?

567
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,732
And I slid them a little something.

568
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,026
Has it been announced?

569
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,861
Just give it some time, okay?

570
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,073
Did you skim some off the top?

571
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,453
You did, didn't you?

572
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,623
You skimmed some off the top
of the money we gave you.

573
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,207
Do you take me for some thug?

574
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,585
You fucking thief!

575
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,046
What the fuck are you going to do
about the shoot?

576
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,881
I did as told. What more do you want?

577
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,550
You're raising your voice at me?
You fucking snake!

578
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,303
-Are you kidding me?
-Wanna see me crack this bottle?

579
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,096
-You're cracking nothing!
-You fucker!

580
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,058
-Bring me soju!
-Did they just say Seoul?

581
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,603
I'll gut you from your fucking tongue
down to your belly

582
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,230
and brew snake wine out of you.

583
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,025
-You goddamn snake, you!
-The Olympics host city…

584
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,109
Seoul.

585
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,487
'88 OLYMPICS HOST CITY ANNOUNCEMENT

586
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,780
…will be Seoul.

587
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,531
The Olympics.

588
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,253
Hey.

589
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,841
They say that once we host the Olympics,

590
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,012
the Republic of Korea's GDP
will skyrocket.

591
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,808
And we will become
a fucking developed country.

592
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,144
What's GDP anyways?

593
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,606
I feel like this is my fault.

594
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,274
What do you mean?

595
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,736
I shouldn't have crossed
the ginseng's legs.

596
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,905
Maybe that jinxed us.

597
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,907
What are you even talking about?

598
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,158
Forget all that!

599
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,035
Go over there.

600
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,287
You're sober, aren't you?

601
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,042
Head across the street to Yangji Café.
Mr. Ku said he'd be there.

602
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,504
Grab him a meal if he hasn't eaten

603
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,464
and drive him around.

604
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,467
Ju-ae will be with him.

605
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,309
Welcome.

606
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,690
What are you talking about?

607
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,949
Like I said,
you've got great inherent moxie.

608
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,327
All right.
Let me break things down for you.

609
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,330
The grand banquet

610
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,042
is a great celebration held
by the most powerful people in the nation.

611
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,921
Not just anyone gets to go,
so it's a great honor

612
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,717
for a rookie like you just to be invited.

613
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,595
You've got nothing to lose.

614
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:09,475
It's to celebrate hosting the Olympics,
so it's going to be one happy party.

615
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,019
Besides,

616
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,397
one could argue
that as the lead of our film,

617
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,025
you're responsible for its success.

618
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,568
You get me, right?

619
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,362
For you to live, the film must live.

620
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,907
The fate of the film and your own

621
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,451
lies squarely in your hands. Got that?

622
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,661
GREAT FORTUNE WILL COME
IF YOU WORK WITH YOUR SENIOR

623
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,378
That's an awfully elegant way
of begging me to save your skin.

624
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,672
What?

625
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,426
Why should I bear all the responsibility
when you never shared any authority?

626
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,262
You're the boss. I simply work for you.

627
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,142
You need to take the coward's way out
but want to save face.

628
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,897
Pick one and stick to it.

629
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,276
Okay.

630
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,532
I guess I was euphemizing
to soften the blow.

631
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,120
You've got squat.

632
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,039
No authority, no nothing.

633
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,503
Just go.

634
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,899
Forget about it.

635
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,026
That's not your job.

636
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,115
You're not seriously

637
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,784
thinking about going?

638
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,791
Ju-ae.

639
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:04,172
He says I just need to impress
some higher-ups and drink with them.

640
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,508
It's no big deal.

641
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,182
So you're going?

642
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,394
You're seriously gonna go?

643
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,480
Is this an easy choice for you?

644
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,402
How can you come to a conclusion
so quickly?

645
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,532
You know what an opportunity
this film is for me

646
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:35,037
and why I'd do anything to protect it,
even if I have to get my hands dirty.

647
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,292
Should I go home and wither to death
working in yet another kitchen?

648
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,213
Would that be right?

649
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,302
I have no idea

650
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,263
what lies ahead of me.

651
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,852
I only know
that I don't want to give in or back down.

652
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,314
That's all I know right now.

653
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:29,901
Take them off.

654
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,282
Don't make me repeat myself.

655
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,271
Everything.

656
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,293
Come in.

657
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,331
From the moment

658
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,709
you step inside,

659
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,378
the things you see,

660
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,422
the things you hear,

661
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,217
the things you smell,

662
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,762
and whatever you may be put through

663
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:48,058
go with you to your grave.

664
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,061
If you so much as speak of,

665
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,938
hint at,

666
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:58,235
or even whisper to yourself
about what may happen today,

667
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,946
you're a dead woman.

668
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,459
And it won't just end with your death.

669
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,672
Everyone around you will die as well.

670
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,348
WRITTEN OATH
I AGREE NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT…

671
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:33,436
OCTOBER 1, 1981
UNDERSIGNED SHIN JU-AE

672
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,441
Now then,

673
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,318
from this moment on,

674
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,362
smile.

675
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,451
The morning rain pitter-patters on my face

676
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:34,289
Choo, choo, the sound of its horn lingers

677
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,001
As the early train goes on its way

678
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:48,636
But I still love him so

679
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:58,897
Where should my heart go now?

680
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,825
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

681
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,120
INSPIRED BY THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
IN MAKING THE 1982 FILM "MADAME AEMA"

682
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,289
ALL CHARACTERS AND STORYLINES
HAVE BEEN CREATED
