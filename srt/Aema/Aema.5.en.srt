He got hit with a higher charge since,
well, he did hit a police car. [chuckles]

00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,543
I said to write Hee-ran's character
as a "world-class bitch," didn't I?

Her character <i>is </i>a bitch, don't you think?

A badass one.

some actor do whatever she wanted?

It's your job to ensure
she fits into the mold of the character.

to make men horny,

and then you give me
this badass woman bullshit?

139
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,775
Why can't women turn people on
by being badasses?

140
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,737
I don't like feeling shitty
and horny simultaneously.

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,864
If you feel both of them at the same time,

You can't do this.

Try and stop me.

But this isn't the first time, though,
is it?

162

I don't think this is gonna work out.

163
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,249
Our notions of "hot"
are night and goddamn day.

Tonight's VIPs are all younger.

169
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:27,103
So it might be easier to connect
than with the older VIPs.

170
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,855
All that being said, I caution you,

171
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,483
don't talk their ear off
and get carried away. 'Kay?

00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,126
Or you and me could, hmm,

177
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,254
find somewhere nice and secluded, yeah?

178
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,049

going somewhere else?

You dumb fucking skank.

[Mi-na breathes shakily]

188
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,331
When I told you the VIPs were young,

189
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,877
I didn't mean they were gonna be
a bunch of easy pushovers.

190
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,588
Sheesh. What a whore.

To you, I must seem like a big joke.

194
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,981
You assume I'm just some whore, don't you?

195

[sighs]

196
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,701
I'm only trying so hard
'cause I know my place.

197
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,623
I was born a dreamer.

198
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,836
But without an ounce of talent
and complete shit for luck.

199
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,509

You're the head honcho here, huh?

211
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,887
In that case, hi.

212
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,725
I'm Mi-na.

So… this is the final version.

250
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,187
Wasn't even ten days. A week? Six days?

251
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,690
Took a year to write it, months to shoot,
but he ruined it in no time!

252
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,611
I guess I can't say
that this is surprising.

253
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,573
That bastard always managed to make
steaming heaps of crap with his edits.

254
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,576
Here's another. [chuckles]

255
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,287
What do you think we should do?

256
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,917
Maybe we could go together
and try our best to sway the president.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,795
He can try to…
to remove my name from the credits,

258
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,713
but he can't leave you uncredited.

259
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,798
Did you know…

260
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,384
not too long ago,

261
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,888
I actually had the chance
to kill that bastard?

262
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,974
But I felt bad for him
and let him off the hook.

263
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,604
Though when I think about it,
that was a mistake on my end.

264
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,113
I guess… this won't end until he's dead.

265
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,949
[In-u] What're you gonna do?

266
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,954
There's a fire raging in my heart.
I'm gonna cool off and get some air.

267
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,706
And find a solution to our problem.

268
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,294
Also, Director?

269
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,131
Stop hiding behind your excuses.

270
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,674
To protect something,

271
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,010
sometimes, you need to get some blood
on your hands.

272
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,096
Up until now,

273
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,766
as we both know,
your hands have been kept clean.

274
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,893
At least for a director.

275
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,105
[Geun-ha] It's our car.

276
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,732
A new one?

277
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,613
[Geun-ha] Well,
we live in a fucked-up world

278
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,533
that just <i>loves </i>fucking us over.

279
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,619
So I think it's time
we return that fucking favor.

280
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,247
And this sexy red car here

281
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,082

283
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,878
Get in.

284
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,214
I'll be needing an explanation for that.

285
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,759
You have no salary
and only get paid on performance.

286
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,053
How'd you get this?

287
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,514
I earned it through good performance.

288
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,183
I swear!

289
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,269
I really don't think
you're being honest right now.

290
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,480
The film's not even out yet.
What did you do to earn this?

291
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,565
Just tell me.

292
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,609
What happened?

293
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,371
What're you implying?

294
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,375
What kind of shady bullshit
did you pull to get this car?

295
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,502
Bullshit?

296
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,296
Just tell me the truth, 'kay?

297
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,506
Why are you lying?

298
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
Can you not do that?

299
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,139
Just say congratulations and trust me.

300
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,474
We're friends.

301
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,560
Or did you forget?

302
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,939
I didn't question <i>you </i>at all.

303
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,942
[voice cracks] 'Cause you have my trust.

304
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,276
[Ju-ae] So what?

305
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,114
I had to get <i>my </i>hands dirty,
and so now you're doing it as well?

306
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,243
Are you trying to even the score
or something?

307
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,705
Is that why you want me
to ride in it with you?

308
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,916
Have you lost it?

309
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,503
Just how low are you planning to go?

310

00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,927
[Hee-ran] How did you get in here?

314
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,139
Sorry, I didn't think anyone was here.

315
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,725
Not 'till <i>you </i>broke in.

316
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,893
I thought the doors were locked.

317
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,229
I climbed over the fence.

318
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,981
Why?

319
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,443
Well, I just wanted to spend the day
with a friend.

320
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,487
And the only one I could think of was…

Thunder.

There's an issue.

[Yeong-bae] Huh?

334
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,853
It's okay. She should bear witness.

[Gi] They somehow picked the locks
without setting anything off

344
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,895
and took only the <i>Madame Aema </i>footage.

345
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,232
What kinda crazy person steals a film
that hasn't even released yet?

346
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,401
It's not like they even knew

Oh my Jesus! We're in deep trouble, man!

- Huh?
- You're not supposed to actually do it!

351
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,958
You can feel it,
but how could you actually act on it?

352
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,042
What?

353
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,879
If you stole the reels,

354
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,465
where would you run to?

355
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,924
[Gi] Hong Kong.

356
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:32,095
I-- I don't know why I said that.
Hey, wait, is that an accusation?!

357
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,305
"Fire."

358
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,433
She said, um, not burning,
um, "raging in her heart."

359
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,517
- Then she told me…
- Fire?

360
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,562
She told me she needed some air.
Some air. Where would she get that? Huh?

361
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,315
- [Gi] Air?
- I'm… [sighs] Hee-ran.

362
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,025
Um, I need some air.

363
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,986
Some air, some air.
Some air, some air, some air.

364
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,200
Barn.

365
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,084
[music intensifies]

366
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,213
[music fades]

367
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,968
[Ju-ae] You're really gonna burn
all of this?

368
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,262
[Hee-ran] Mm-hmm.

369
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,681
Why?

370
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,017
Humiliation.

371
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,894
[gentle music fading in]

372
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,897
Often, working as an actress,

373
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,609
it can feel like
your efforts are overlooked.

374
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,321
As if all of your hard work
didn't even exist.

375
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,159
<i>As actors,</i>

376
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,246
<i>it's our job</i>
<i>to pour our hearts into our films.</i>

377
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,457
<i>We fully commit ourselves to the art.</i>

378
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,919
<i>We bare the most naked part of our souls,</i>

379
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:49,464
<i>which leaves us vulnerable, exposed.</i>

380
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,551
- [groaning]
- [masturbating frantically]

381
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,927
[groaning intensifies]

382
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,597
I added the additional scene
that we shot into the film

383
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,933
just like you told me to.
It was a great idea.

384
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,394
It really brings the whole scene alive,
am I right?

385
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,646
[Jung-ho] What did I say?
I'm an idea machine!

386
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,731
[both laughing]

387
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,361
[Hee-ran] <i>Ah, I see.</i>
<i>This is how they stomp on my heart.</i>

388
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,447
<i>Making a mockery</i>
<i>of my blood, sweat, and tears.</i>

389
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,743
<i>You only find out in the theater</i>
<i>with everyone else watching.</i>

390
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,662
- [sobbing]
- [men laughing]

391
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,039
That trauma isn't easy to heal.

392
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,874
You have to bury it inside.

393
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,628
I couldn't possibly go through that again.

394
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,177
Sad to see it go?

395
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,972
Of course I'm sad.

396
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,893
[sighs deeply]

397
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,331
But I still got to experience
starring in a film for the first time.

398
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,334
So I learned a lot, despite everything.

399
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,671
And besides…

400
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,968
you saved me from humiliation that night.

401
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,767
It's my turn to return the favor to you.

402
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,484
[matches rattle]

403
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,787
[somber music fades in]

404
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,338
MORGUE

405
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,506
[sighs]

406
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,346
[dramatic music playing]

407
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,307
Where is it?
I thought you were giving me directions!

408
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,518
Shut up! Let me think for a moment! Jesus!

409
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:09,979
[Gi] Uh--

410
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,066
Hey. Hey, turn around.

411
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,192
- They're behind us!
- Oh God.

412
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,444
Turn it around! Turn it!
Hurry it up, dummy!

413
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,410
[Gi] Th-- th-- there!
There's something there! There!

414
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,829
That's it, isn't it? Isn't that it?
Isn't that a wheelbarrow?

415
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,789
Yeah, there! The guy with the wheelbarrow!

416
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,998
Hey, it's that fat-ass!

417
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,542
[car door opens]

418
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,585
[music fades]

419
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,258
[wind whistling]

420
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,971
[Gi shrieking] Ya son of a bitch!

421
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,181
- [Yeong-bae] Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- C'mere!

422
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,683
[Yeong-bae groaning]

423
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,018
[Gi] You thieving fuckin' prick!

424
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,562
I was scared shitless because of you!

425
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,357
Lard-ass! Wanted it all for yourself, huh?

426
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,443
You were ready to just screw all the…

427
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,486
[Yeong-bae shouting indistinctly]

428
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,196
Hee-ran, why?

429
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,157
[Gi] Fat-ass!

430
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,453
[In-u] Despite it all…

431
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,208
even if it's terrible…

432
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,047
I gave this film my heart and my soul.

433
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,344
Even if the president
went and ruined it all!

434
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,390
But I don't care, because

435
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,478
no matter how battered
and how bruised and broken,

436
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,104
it's still my film!

437
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,524
I directed and wrote it,
and I don't care who knows!

438
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,611
No matter what anyone says!

439
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,865
It's the first film
that I have to my name, you know?!

440
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,201
It's the only one I've got.

441
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,537
[sobbing]

442
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,503
[music darkens]

443
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,891
[lighter clicks]

444
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,647
[footsteps approaching]

445
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,289
[man grunts]

446
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,461
I thought there was a chance they might
smoke some pot at most but, man…

447
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,629
Whoo, I tell ya.

448
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,340
Kids these days are outta control.

449
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,176
Think they were doing
cocaine or something.

450
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,140
I dunno if she willingly did the drugs
or if she was coerced into it,

451
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:55,019
but, as you know,
there will be no police investigation.

452
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,483
The story will be
that a young up-and-coming actress

453
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,362
suffered from depression,
wound up dead after OD'ing on drugs.

454
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,907
We'll take care of any loose ends
so they don't trace this back to you.

455
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,285
We'll handle everything. Don't worry.

456
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,537
We'll even arrange her obituary
with the papers.

457
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,330
You just carry on as you were.

458
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,833
Your big film release
is right around the corner.

459
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,669
You announcing her death
would be a bit of a buzzkill.

460
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:25,258
Oh, and word on the streets is that
they'll be lifting the curfews real soon.

461
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,136
Thirty-six years and four months
they've been goin' on.

462
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,972
Have you heard that yet? It's incredible!

463
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,516
President Ku,

464
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,604
that means establishments
can be open past midnight.

465
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,897
Places like the cinema.

466
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,816
And the "late-night movie"
is about to enter the picture.

467
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,319
Can you fucking imagine that shit?

468
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,070
I mean, picture it.

469
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,616
People watching movies past midnight,
at a theater, no less.

470
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,371
So, in order for me to make it up to you,

471
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,540
here's what I'll do for ya.

472
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:03,338
<i>Aema</i>'s gonna be the first erotic
late-night picture in Korean history.

473
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,965
In honor of your great loss.

474
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,675
[Jung-ho scoffs]

475
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,843
[music fades]

476
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,094
[cigarette hisses]

477
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,429
Appreciate it.

478
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,099
[Yeong-bae] Here.

479
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,102
- These too.
- Right.

480
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,739
The man's already
completely butchered my film.

481
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,744
So then
why am I still so hung up about it?

482
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,538
Before you even took 'em,

483
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,625
I wanted to burn it myself
after I saw what they did to it.

484
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,168
[poignant music playing]

485
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,713
I acted without thinking.

486
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,967
It's a big opportunity for you.

487
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,680
A project like this
could be life-changing for Ju-ae too.

488
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,766
I'm sorry for that.

489
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:02,897
I apologize as the director…
for failing to protect the film.

490
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,776
It's all right.

491
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,404
You did the best you could.

492
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,863
[music intensifies]

493
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,834
The movie is definitely
gonna be a smash hit.

494
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,837
Jung-ho may have ruined it,

495
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,134
but… it still offers something
that the public's never seen.

496
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,389
Your life's about to change, so get ready.

497
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,976
You'll have to be a bitch from now on.

498
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,270
'Cause bitches survive.

499
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,858
[music intensifies]

500
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,121
- [man 1] Holy crap, that's insane!
- [man 2] She's absolutely gorgeous!

501
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,831
[overlapping chatter]

502
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,501
- [man 3] Hey! Give me that!
- [man 4] She's coming with me!

503
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,385
CURFEW LIFTED AFTER 36 YEARS!

504
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,138
MADAME AEMA
KOREA'S FIRST-EVER MIDNIGHT MOVIE

505
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,765
[siren wailing]

506
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,934
[Gi laughing]

507
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,522
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, all,

508
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,358
for coming to the first-ever
late-night movie premiere,

509
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,403
as well as the first erotic film
in the Republic of Korea!

510
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,824
Now put your hands together,
and let's hear it for <i>Madame Aema</i>!

511
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,540
All right. Help me count down here.
Help me out! Let's go!

512
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,127
Five! Four!

513
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,422
Three! Two! One!

514
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,926
Open the gates,
and let the audience inside!

515
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,595
Ooh, I tell ya,
you guys are in for a treat!

516
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,181
We're gonna have a blast tonight! [laughs]

517
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,601
Have fun in there, mister.
You too, miss. Enjoy!

518
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,188
That's right, folks.
Movies are now open after midnight.

519
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,776
Hello, everyone. I'm Jeong Hee-ran.

520
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,445
I've missed you all terribly.
It's been too long.

521
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,697
What about you? Did you miss me, then?

522
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,244

I just, uh… I'd like you to know…

that I worked really hard
to make this movie.

how Jeong Hee-ran looked so pretty.

577
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,863
She did. She was so cool up there.

578
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,158
[woman 1] And Ju-ae looked pretty too.

579
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,624
Right? It's crazy!
I've never seen her make that face before.

580
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,167
I thought it was pretty cool!

581
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,961
Maybe this is what we're really into?

582
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,464

- Hey!

00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,301

It was so much fun, wasn't it?

Don't you think you're making
a big deal outta nothing here?

624
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,164
So what if she switched
the costumes around?

625
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,082
What counts is
they're Gil Shin-ae outfits!

626

I had to pour from my revenue

627

into your production?

628
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,423
Two million.

[Jung-ho] Hey there, star director!

634
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,254
Everyone's talking about <i>Aema</i>.
You're the man of the hour!

636
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,549
[In-u] I'm not sure.

637
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,094
I have pretty mixed feelings about it all.

638
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,263
Oh, man, stop thinking so dang much.

639
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,432
That's the problem with you directors,
overthinking <i>everything</i>.

640
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,393
I'm glad that people are enjoying it.

641
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,438
That being said, only men like it.
Women feel uncomfortable.

642
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,859
And that is literally the polar opposite
of what I set out to do.

643
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:56,490
Hey… if we had gone with your subtle,
pretentious, artsy-fartsy film idea,

644
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,494
your debut film would've failed, and then
you would've faded away into obscurity.

645
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,037
I saved your life.

I'm thinking five films.

649
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,756
I made you famous,
so you should return the favor.

650
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,675
It's only right, don't you think?

651
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,762
I actually have a script for Hee-ran.
That's gotta be top priority.

652
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,979
I have a proposal.

653
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,567

Before you were Madame Aema,
what were you like growing up?

663
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,346
What kind of child were you
when you were little, Ms. Shin Ju-ae?

664
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,390
I was a pretty quiet child.

665
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,227
My mother died when I was little,
so I did all the chores.

666
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,273
My elementary school days
were filled with making rice for my family

667
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,483
and doing laundry.

668
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:16,070
And then I started dreaming
of a better life in middle school.

669
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,155
<i>When I got to high school,</i>

670
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,241
<i>I was terrified there was nothing</i>
<i>I could ever look forward to.</i>

671
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,412
<i>All I wanted as a kid…</i>

672
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,957

00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:41,530
[laughs] Ah, what a sexy red swimsuit!
So hot! You're gonna give me a nosebleed!

692
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,614
[chuckles]

693
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,370
Hey, showgirl.
You're loving all this fame, aren't you?

694
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,249
Did you see my review of <i>Madame Aema</i>?

695
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,294
I'll bet no one wrote
a more flattering piece than me.

696
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,464
I took that lovely little Aema
and went to town.

697
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,467
Top to bottom, yeah,
I licked that girl all over. [laughs]

698
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:06,305
I don't know why you wanna talk right now,
'cause, listen, I'm here to work.

699
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,140
I'm in the middle of a shoot, okay?

700
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,850
I see.

701
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,105
Listen, sweetheart, you hurt my feelings.

702
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,193
[scoffs] I'm feeling neglected.
I thought we were close.

703
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,363
I came all this way 'cause I have
a bone to pick with you. What's this?

704
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,449
Y'know, I let it slide
when you were teasing me

705
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:29,244
and playing hard to get by turning down
all my requests for interviews.

706
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,499
But I can't believe you gave away
this juicy life story to someone else.

707
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,418
If you give it up to everyone but me,

708
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,047
what do you think that'll do
to my poor old reputation?

709
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,093
It wasn't intentional.

710
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,721
I was asked questions, so I answered.

711
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,848
See the news yesterday?

712
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,726
Sweetheart, you've been nominated.

713
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,270
For Best New Actress, no less.

714
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,231
Ah.

715
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,776
Looks like you haven't heard the news yet.

716
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,529
See, this bullshit is exactly why I'm sad!

717
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,198
I got you that!

718
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,618
Our news company's the one
who puts on the Daejong Awards.

719
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,411
And they ask me to decide.

720
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,789
I'm the guy. The big department head.

721
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,502
You owe me an exclusive interview.
How 'bout it, honey?

722
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,880
I'll make sure
you're all over the front page.

723
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,092
I reached out to Mr. Gi
to schedule a meeting,

724
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,302
but that fucking dick
kept stonewalling me,

725
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:31,515
so I'll just have to go schedule something
with President Ku instead.

726
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,980
I'd say we have some catching up to do.

727
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,481
Don't we?

728
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,652
[opera music playing in room]

729
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,072
[Paul] Hmm.

[clears throat]

733
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,881
Hee-ran's been my muse for how long?

734
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,259
I don't know.
Around ten years, give or take.

735
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,931
What's wrong?

736
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,853
Oh no. No, we can't do this again.
Out of the question.

737
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,773
The Daejong Awards
are right around the corner.

738
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,317
- Sir?
- [Paul sighs]

739
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,818
Hello?

740
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:35,245
So, uh, about the Best Supporting Actress,
uh, at the Daejong Awards…

741
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,541
they're saying you're likely to win.

742
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,463
And Ju-ae…
well, she's also a strong contender.

743
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:48,884
So I made the president agree…
to officially re-release the film

744
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,218
right after the awards.

745
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,138
We're going to scrap the old one.

746
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,849
Redo the edit from scratch.

747
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,900
This version of the film
will focus on the two female characters

748
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,318
and the acting chops of the leads.

749
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,780
So this version
will be the true <i>Madame Aema</i>.

750
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,699
The one we intended to make all along.

751
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,662
We'll call it <i>Madame Aema Originale.</i>

752
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,645
How do you-- you--
You like it? It's Italian. Uh…

753
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,773
[Italian accent] <i>Madame Aema Originale.</i>

754
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,525
Uh, something like that.

755
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:50,445
Or <i>Madame Aema…</i>
[Japanese accent] …<i>Eddo Originaru.</i>

756
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,157
Wait. No, no, yeah.
Koreans would not take kindly to that.

757
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,618
Maybe "Original"? Um…

758
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,829
Nah, English is boring.

759
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,207
Yeah, I think "Originale" sounds better.

760
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,960
Like an Italian auteur
or something. "Originale."

761
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,336
Despite everything,

762
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,424
<i>Madame Aema </i>was incredibly lucky

763
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,219
to have found a director like you.

764
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,611
[In-u chuckles]

765
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,240
Do you remember your audition?

766
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,784
When you asked me
to make you the next Jeong Hee-ran?

767
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,578
[quirky pop music plays in background]

768
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,496
That dream can be a reality.

769
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,793
You'll see once you go over it,

770
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,297
but this contract signs you on
for ten films over seven years

771
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,590
with you as the lead.

772
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,135
We usually go for ten years,
but we've shortened the duration for you

773
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,721
and can renegotiate
once your contract's up.

774
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,641
That's a helluva deal.

775
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,227
You gave us a smash hit
with your film debut,

776
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,897
so I owe it to you to reciprocate.

777
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,443
To be honest with you,

778
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,280
I haven't really given it
much thought at all.

779
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,368
No better time than the present.

780
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,371
I'm sure by now
it's become abundantly clear,

781
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,332
but an actress isn't safe
without an umbrella.

782
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,917
You won't last long

783
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,669
without a strong backer
like Shinsung Pictures.

784
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,132
What do you think my job is
as the president of this company?

785
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,470
Ah! My job is to keep
an umbrella over your head,

786
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,056
so the industry doesn't come pouring down
on you like it tries to.

looked just like this.

you know?

[Hee-ran] Do you remember
when you gave me that card?

813
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,743
You were worried
I'd lose what mattered to me.

814

That I'd lose my career.

815

That I might lose myself.

It's funny looking back on it.

817
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,380
There's so much that I've already lost.

818
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,176
For years,
I'd given so much of myself away.

I couldn't afford to lose anything else.

you wanted to see me… Ooh! I got chills.

Now, where did we leave off?

828
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,124
If I remember correctly,
things were getting hot.

829
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,087
Thanks to you,
I got to redo the whole interior.

Had I known the film would be such a hit,

832
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,885
I would've done way more
than just my office.

833
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,930
Hell, we could've moved
the whole company to a new building.

834
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:37,852
I'll admit, I may have underestimated
<i>Madame Aema'</i>s potential, so I'm sorry.

835
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:42,565
Oh, and since we're gonna be
putting out the director's cut,

836
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,068
while things are still hot,
we might as well milk the audience

837
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:48,363
as much as we can
and cash in on all this press. [laughs]

Have you given any thought
to <i>Hong Kong Aema</i>?

00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,001
I'm tellin' you,
we're all ready to hit the ground running,

842
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,212
so you just say the word, all right?

843
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,257
Since <i>Madame Aema </i>crushed
at the box office,

844
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,760
I'll write you a fat check
and add in a little bonus for ya, Hee-ran.

845

You killed that girl.

00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,782
[chuckling] You better watch your mouth.
Hmm?

848
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,243
Mi-na was near and dear to my heart.

849
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,413
I'm gonna make sure

850
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,791
that you pay for everything you've done.

Hee-ran!

854
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:53,303
You gotta learn to let go and just take
a victory lap wherever you can get it.

855
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,555
Otherwise, you're gonna
make life even harder.

00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,349
You're an actress.

00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:14,741
but I'm trying here, so how about
you stop being such a fucking cunt?!

861
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,827
And stop making me feel like an asshole.

862
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,455
You and your bullshit, I swear. [chuckles]

863
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,541
What can you even do?

864
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,710
Nothing, Hee-ran!

865
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,130
All you gotta do
is just sit there and be pretty.

866
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,924
It's a shame, really.

867
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,134
All that beauty is wasted on you.

868
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,725
You really think all that evidence is gone
just because you burnt the damn ledger?

869
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,144
[Hee-ran chuckles]

870
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:48,900
Of course it's not that simple,
Mr. Ku Jung-ho.

871
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,198
You left the real smoking gun…

872
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,912
completely exposed, you see.

873
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,376
Yeah.

874
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,047
I'm the evidence of your crimes.

875
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,384
Jung-ho…

876
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,470
you and I…

877
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,724
are both going to hell.

878
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,393
[music intensifies]

879
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,134
[music fades]

880
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,971
[vibrant pop music playing]

881
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,865
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
INSPIRED BY THE PEOPLE INVOLVED

882
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,033
IN THE MAKING OF THE 1982 FILM
"MADAME AEMA."

883
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,494
ALL CHARACTERS AND STORYLINES
HAVE BEEN CREATED FOR

884
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,121
DRAMATIC STORYTELLING PURPOSES

885
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,207
[music fades]
