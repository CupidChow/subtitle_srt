1
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,432
AEMA

2
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:28,028
The morning rain pitter-patters on my face

3
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:33,074
Choo, choo, the sound of its horn lingers…

4
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,494
-I need a second.
-Get over here, you bitch!

5
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,379
But I still love him so…

6
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,173
Here it comes! It's coming!

7
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:57,599
Where should my heart go now?

8
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,353
Through the rain the train chugs--

9
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,857
Wait. Who's that?

10
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,363
Well, well. Who do we have here?

11
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,744
Madame Aema!

12
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,706
Welcome.

13
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,209
I'm your number one fan, Ms. Shin Ju-ae.

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,800
Man, your face is the size of my fist!

15
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,136
You're even prettier in person, huh?

16
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,264
Just look at you. Right?

17
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,308
Now then!

18
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,895
Let's see.

19
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:49,818
Where should we seat Ms. Shin Ju-ae
for the true realization of democracy?

20
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,195
Everyone.

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,448
Where should I escort
our dear Madame Aema to?

22
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,076
How about a show of hands?

23
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,286
Isn't it obvious?

24
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,498
It's her first time joining us,

25
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,001
so of course she should sit
at the VIP table.

26
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,336
Hear, hear!

27
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,257
Hey!

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,469
Why make such distinctions
at the grand banquet?

29
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,514
When we're here drinking,

30
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,890
we're all just studs.

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,439
Why don't we just

32
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,527
let Madame Aema do the choosing instead?

33
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,988
Oh boy, I love the idea!

34
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,364
The lady's choice, it is!

35
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,909
-Let's go!
-Let's do it!

36
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,662
All right, everyone get on up here!

37
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,415
-Who will it be?
-Go on, pick someone!

38
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,667
-I'm a goddamn stallion!
-Choose!

39
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,966
-She's wet!
-I love it.

40
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,594
-Give me your hand.
-She's all wet!

41
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,345
-She's wet!
-Come on!

42
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,725
-Hey, Aema! Look at me.
-Aema, take your pick!

43
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,440
I knew physiognomy was a thing!

44
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,818
She acts just like she looks.

45
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,873
Don't be nervous.

46
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,499
You are

47
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,878
a special guest, after all.

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,839
Today,

49
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:39,719
we're celebrating a great boon
to our nation.

50
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,263
So celebrate with us.

51
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,432
Rejoicing together is,

52
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:45,850
well,

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,311
jolly and all.

54
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,033
Cheers.

55
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,923
Now then!

56
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,383
Everyone, on your feet.

57
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,510
To the '88…

58
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,637
Olympics!

59
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,605
Seoul!

60
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,274
'88!

61
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,276
Seoul!

62
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,027
'88!

63
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,988
Seoul!

64
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,656
'88!

65
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:46,077
Seoul! Let's go, '88!

66
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,386
'88!

67
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,412
Did Ku Jung-ho
personally ask you to come here?

68
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,460
Then tell me.

69
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,048
What drove you to come here?

70
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,426
Don't tell me

71
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,263
it was a sense of duty
to protect the film at all costs?

72
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,227
Wake up.

73
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,980
Duty's too big for the likes of you.

74
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,026
What you do with your life
is none of my business,

75
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,321
but you're a nobody.
Not even an actor yet.

76
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,783
Why fear losing something and risk it all

77
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,911
when you have nothing to begin with?

78
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,802
You've spent too much time in here.

79
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,888
I think it's about time
you stepped back outside.

80
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,187
"Success is a great deodorant,"

81
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,773
said Elizabeth Taylor.

82
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,153
She said that it takes away
the odors of your past.

83
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,073
I sure like that woman.

84
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,244
She's elegant

85
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,037
but firm.

86
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,707
She's determined.

87
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
That's my first impression of you.

88
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,298
You're pretty,

89
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,300
but you seem firm.

90
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,303
And you look like you've got spunk.

91
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,516
You'll be a great success.

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,976
That much,

93
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,519
I can guarantee.

94
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,529
Once that time comes, though,

95
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,991
you'll lose this innocent scent you carry.

96
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,536
That already makes me sad.

97
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,755
I'm thinking

98
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,967
of seriously becoming a fan of yours.

99
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,016
What do you say?

100
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,312
Should I? Or shouldn't I?

101
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,276
I…

102
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,281
haven't done anything yet.

103
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,122
We have filmed some scenes,
but that's all.

104
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,834
And I'm only shooting my first film.

105
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,131
I've done nothing,
yet you say you're already a fan of mine.

106
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,135
That makes me feel
as though I've done something wrong…

107
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,891
and I feel humiliated.

108
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,734
Please don't be my fan.

109
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,657
I still want…

110
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,704
to accomplish something the right way.

111
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,543
I beg this of you.

112
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,250
Ms. Shin Ju-ae, where are you going?

113
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,212
We'll inform you
when it's time for you to leave.

114
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,466
Hey. Show her back inside.

115
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,927
I've impressed the higher-ups
and poured some drinks.

116
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,221
Please tell them I've done my job.

117
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,203
Girls who are tamed on the first encounter
are rare, don't you agree?

118
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,164
I used to be just like her.

119
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,752
Remember what you told me back then?

120
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,635
Among the bitches who play hard to get,
those who survive

121
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,555
are always the ones
who are yet to put out.

122
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,065
Girls like her

123
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,360
haven't figured out
the ways of the world yet.

124
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,948
One wrong move,
and they'll vanish into the water forever.

125
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,452
If you just let her be, though,

126
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,039
she will eventually become
a fully-fledged actress.

127
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,378
That would be better, no?
A win-win for all.

128
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,950
Open it.

129
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,792
The clothes you came in
and your belongings.

130
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,838
The clothes you're wearing now
are expensive.

131
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,634
Keep them tucked away and wear them
when you're headed somewhere nice.

132
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,183
I'll return them now.

133
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,227
You probably bought them
with taxpayers' money anyway.

134
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,359
Here, take this.

135
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,909
Don't let your pride do the talking,
and take it while you still can.

136
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,078
You won't get
such a generous offer next time.

137
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,597
You filthy bastard.

138
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,350
You pimp out a girl
who hasn't even debuted yet?

139
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,559
What are you, a pimp?

140
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,103
Listen, damn it. You're not the only one.

141
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,272
I'm humiliated too.
We've all been humiliated!

142
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,858
Fine! Let's say we were all humiliated.

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,236
You should've drawn the line at us.

144
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,489
As if anyone out there has the guts
to refuse what they ask.

145
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,575
Who's got the guts to do that? You?

146
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:52,164
Pressuring a kid still wet behind the ears
into selling her dignity

147
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,459
is like saying, "Let's all crash and burn
because there's no future."

148
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,339
You didn't even have the guts
to protect one rookie actor or your film.

149
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,508
And you call yourself a producer?

150
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,178
As if anyone in the Republic of Korea
has the damn power to protect anything!

151
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,890
This is a country where you can be
dragged off and found dead by morning!

152
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,811
And yet,
you're just trying to save your life.

153
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,564
That's the problem.

154
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,359
You'd abandon all your values and causes,

155
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,320
as long as you make it out alive.

156
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,823
That's the issue.

157
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,324
So what? Damn it.

158
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,083
This film.

159
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,836
No one wanted it to flop more than I did,

160
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,463
but if we let it flop like this

161
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,633
and we're left
without a shred of dignity to stand on,

162
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,888
how will anyone dare
to make films in the future?

163
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,350
MINISTRY OF CULTURE

164
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,689
PERMISSION GRANTED FOR MADAME AEMA
TO RECOMMENCE PRODUCTION

165
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,235
PRODUCTION PERMIT
MADAME AEMA

166
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,155
PERMISSION GRANTED TO PRODUCE ABOVE FILM

167
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,116
You did well.

168
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,618
In exchange,

169
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,204
the film can't go on shooting like this.

170
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,791
I'm not half-assing anything.

171
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,878
First, we'll fix that ridiculous script,

172
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,089
since I need
the bare minimum reason to commit.

173
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,800
You stay out of it.

174
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,389
Hey, Ku Jung-ho!

175
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,517
God, that crazy bitch.

176
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:46,362
I heard there was a grand banquet
last night. Why didn't you tell me?

177
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,075
Do you cherish me or something?

178
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:55,746
Think you're my hubby now
because I let you live with me?

179
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,706
Why? Grown fond of me?

180
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,460
Wake the hell up!

181
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:06,090
You crazy bastard,
are you out of your damn mind?

182
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,676
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

183
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,804
How come you're wasted for 20 hours a day?

184
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,725
Did you go?

185
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,228
Did she go there?

186
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,817
Hey, who even are you?

187
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,194
Who the hell do you think you are?

188
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:33,659
I'm the one who was chosen
as the queen of the last banquet!

189
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,010
I pestered Mr. Yeong-bae for your address.

190
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,346
I'm sorry for showing up out of the blue.

191
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,057
Follow me.

192
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,323
MADAME AEMA
SHIN JU-AE

193
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,331
You said trying hard was tacky.

194
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,338
This is about as tacky as it gets,
isn't it?

195
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,843
…MIGHT AS WELL BE A BADASS BITCH
LIKE JEONG HEE-RAN

196
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,688
After my mom passed away,

197
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,067
I was left in a household of men.

198
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,989
I had four older brothers
who always played the victim,

199
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,658
as did my father.

200
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,789
I'd rather have killed myself

201
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,958
than grow old, hand-washing
five men's underwear every day.

202
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,922
I needed an excuse,

203
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,092
and luckily,
I managed to run away from home.

204
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,805
I was ready to do anything,
give up on anything,

205
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,391
if it meant I didn't have to return there.

206
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,812
You were right, you know.

207
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,608
I went there ready to do anything.

208
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,820
Had it not been for you,

209
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,948
I would have done so a hundred times over.

210
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,994
I guess I thought protecting the film

211
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,540
meant protecting myself.

212
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,046
Thank you.

213
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
I came here to tell you that.

214
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,267
What's with the sudden sob story

215
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,769
after acting like a total bitch
this whole time?

216
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,814
There's nothing special

217
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,568
about your story of escaping such a home
to become a lowly entertainer.

218
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,486
Millions share your story.

219
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,324
Is a bitch with a backstory
any less of a bitch?

220
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,910
Just keep being a bitch.

221
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,372
We'll be back to shooting.

222
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,583
Not because you did something,

223
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,960
but because you didn't.

224
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,465
Why do you want to be an actor?

225
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,971
I get that you needed an excuse
to live a different life,

226
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,516
and you're ready to give it your all.

227
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,560
But aside from that,

228
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,104
why?

229
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,332
You're home.

230
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,460
Bring your chopsticks if you want some.

231
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,649
I made this much money

232
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,276
in a single night.

233
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,655
I wanted to tear it to shreds,

234
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,115
but the sum was so huge

235
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,868
that I couldn't bring myself to do it.

236
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,209
What should I do with a whole million?

237
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,674
Want to chew it all up…

238
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,011
and shit it all out?

239
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,282
Wanna know how I earned this much?

240
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,661
I'm just…

241
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,792
sorry.

242
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,089
So we both feel sorry.

243
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,051
What a…

244
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,930
shame.

245
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,040

DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S VOICE HEADQUARTERS

248
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,878
Messy in here, isn't it?

249
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,802
So you made it here.

250
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,512
It's not an easy journey.

251
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,269
I came to give you this.

252
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,276
Money?

253
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,528
I'm here to launder money.

254
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,322
Sorry?

255
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,743
It's dirty money,
so I want to put it to good use.

256
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,995
Put it toward expenses.

257
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,165
If I get that kind of money again,
I'll give you more.

258
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,084
Might there be

259
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,337
anything we can help you with?

260
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,421
No.

261
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,174
There's nothing.

262
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,845
Please tell us

263
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,556
if you need any help.

264
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,617
I get that you needed an excuse
to live a different life…

265
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,622
and you're ready to give it your all.

266
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,916
But aside from that,

267
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,794
why do you want to be an actor?

268
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,506
One time in school,

269
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,592
I got to perform in a play.

270
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,271
My whole life,
I had only learned to suppress myself…

271
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,779
but for the first time ever,

272
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,241
I realized that I had a voice.

273
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,414
That I had emotions.

274
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,126
FINALLY AT THE STARTING LINE
SUMMER OF 1972

275
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,544
That this was me.

276
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,256
It felt as though

277
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,259
I had finally become myself.

278
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,982
Being here feels like being abroad.

279
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,612
I always figured
you were more of an indoorsman.

280
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,697
Director.

281
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,326
I really didn't want to do this film.

282
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,578
I know that.

283
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,914
In fact, I hated being in it so much

284
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,917
that I prayed every day for it to flop.

285
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,003
That I did not know.

286
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,672
But I've changed my mind.

287
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,718
Since I'm doing it anyway,
I've decided to commit.

288
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,016
We went this whole time

289
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,185
without discussing the script once.

290
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,940
I know I'm not playing her,
but that Aema woman…

291
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,858
Why does she masturbate so much?

292
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,363
Why are you so flustered?
You wrote her that way.

293
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,032
She does it while washing,
then while driving.

294
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,785
Even next to her sleeping husband.

295
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,412
Surely, that's got to be an illness.

296
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,373
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,792
I don't see why an apology is necessary.

298
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,211
I just wanted to know the reason.

299
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,382
What could have driven this woman
to a life of masturbation?

300
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,058
Since this is a story of desire,

301
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:03,395
I figured that the character
needed a premise like that.

302
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,690
Isn't masturbation basically
the most self-sufficient sex there is?

303
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,235
It's a non-stop race to your desire,
unbound by anyone else.

304
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,946
A universe of pleasure
that exists solely for me!

305
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,407
Masturbation? More like liberation!

306
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,745
Right, okay.

307
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,834
But instead of focusing on the act itself,
wouldn't it be better

308
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,588
to depict the feelings and emotions
of the person masturbating?

309
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,302
Not even a middle school boy
would do it this much.

310
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,096
Here. Scene 46.

311
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,390
This is the scene
I wanted to discuss first.

312
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,600
Look here, Director.

313
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:47,689
After Aema's husband goes to prison,
Aema moves into an apartment with Erika.

314
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,109
She later finds out that her first love,
Yun-ho, lives upstairs.

315
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,653
"Scene 46."

316
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,699
"It's the day Aema and Erika
move into their apartment."

317
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,328
"An ordinary afternoon
as they return from grocery shopping."

318
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,205
"Right when they thought

319
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,835
a peaceful life together
lay ahead of them…"

320
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,723
"The moment Erika sees Yun-ho,

321
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,183
her heart sinks."

322
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,147
"So imagine how Aema
must have felt at this moment."

323
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,150
Aema.

324
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,944
That's a good baby.

325
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,405
Peekaboo.

326
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,492
Are you hungry? Can you say "Mommy"?

327
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,327
Want a snack?

328
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,038
The… 11th floor?

329
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:50,251
Beautiful memories of the past come
flooding back to Yun-ho once he sees Aema.

330
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,380
Aema also recalls the memories
of her first love,

331
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,715
and then she masturbates again.

332
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,261
I'm so over all this masturbating.

333
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,600
"Erika notices that Aema's been agitated."

334
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:10,063
"Erika grabs Aema by her shoulders,
shakes her, and chastises her."

335
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,774
"Aema, snap out of it."

336
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,485
Get a hold of yourself, Aema.

337
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,280
The man you knew died in the past.

338
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,783
The moment he betrayed you,

339
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,785
your first love,

340
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,869
that man,

341
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,456
and even the old you, all died.

342
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,333
Erika.

343
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,585
Slap me across the face

344
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,422
so I can come to my senses.

345
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,507
Slap me as hard as you can!

346
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,944
Director.

347
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,197
This is where it gets really problematic.

348
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:10,165
Yun-ho is blinded by his passion for Aema.

349
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,628
Nothing and no one

350
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,214
could stop him now.

351
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,222
She's sleeping,

352
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,183
like a fool.

353
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,485
-Who…
-Hush.

354
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,945
It's me, Yun-ho.

355
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,572
Aema,

356
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,908
you were my woman.

357
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,202
What took you so long to return?

358
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,370
Yun-ho.

359
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,581
Please don't do this.

360
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,540
Please.

361
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,503
Aema.

362
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,131
Let me go, or I'll scream.

363
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,591
Aema!

364
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,643
Aema eventually caves in
to Yun-ho's advances…

365
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,606
awakening the carnal desires

366
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,943
she had kept hidden for so long.

367
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,323
Outside, Erika listens.

368
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,121
Unable to bring herself to enter…

369
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,876
she, too, feels her lust awaken.

370
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,044
Aema.

371
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,762
Why is Erika always
getting turned on by herself?

372
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,682
I'm starting to feel sorry for her.

373
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,604
"Indulging herself in Yun-ho's caresses,
Aema's breaths grow heavier."

374
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,324
At last,

375
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,743
ultimate pleasure washes over Aema,

376
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,288
just like riding a horse
across vast fields.

377
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,841
What a beautiful morning.

378
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,389
Aema.

379
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,058
Erika.

380
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,691
Yun-ho climbs down a rope

381
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,402
and has intercourse with her

382
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,237
three more times after this.

383
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,990
Do you truly

384
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,576
find this erotic?

385
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,916
I figured

386
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,502
Aema still missed
and longed for her first love.

387
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,339
However, she's now married,

388
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,924
and her first love, Yun-ho,

389
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,551
was also a married man
and the head of a household,

390
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,011
so she couldn't approach him.

391
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,929
That's why she--

392
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,473
There's not a single woman out there

393
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,517
who subconsciously wants
to be forcibly violated.

394
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,937
Didn't you tell me

395
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,148
your goal was to portray female desire
from a woman's perspective?

396
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,735
Director,

397
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,947
I think you've already failed at that.

398
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,659
You're too clueless about women.

399
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,829
Besides, there's no getting past the fact
that we've already filmed a lot.

400
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,665
I think

401
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:43,211
you wanted to do two things
with Madame Aema.

402
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,506
First, you wanted to make
a European erotic art film.

403
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:50,259
As for the other,
what was that thing you kept mentioning

404
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,512
that offers something more
than just eroticism?

405
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,556
Ero guro nansensu.

406
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,850
Yes, that's the one.

407
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,770
Let's just pick a lane.

408
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,023
I don't know
if erotic or artistic will work,

409
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,110
but if we look into grotesque
and nonsensical themes,

410
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,154
we might find our solution there,
don't you think?

411
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,400
What are you looking at, miss?

412
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,069
You should be looking here.

413
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,868
Step it up, miss.
You're here to do a good job, aren't you?

414
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,661
Sorry?

415
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,332
I'm trusting you
against my better judgment

416
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,002
since Mr. Gi sent you in his place,

417
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,255
but I will say
that you're not making it easy

418
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,799
with that face of yours and those eyes.

419
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,845
That's why you should
step it up, miss. Got that?

420
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,514
Now come here.

421
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,019
The chiffon skirt

422
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,146
goes with the tweed jacket

423
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,231
and the bucket hat.

424
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,151
These pieces make up one classy outfit.

425
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,570
The polka-dot dress

426
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,614
goes with a twilly scarf

427
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,365
and Mary Janes.

428
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,161
So that makes another outfit,
prim and proper.

429
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,706
I've grouped all the other pieces
by outfit, too,

430
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,958
so dress her up the way they come.

431
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,001
Mr. Lee?

432
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,087
Load them into her car for her.

433
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,088
-Yes, ma'am.
-Great.

434
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:54,258
Now, where did I put that envelope?

435
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,178
Where might that envelope be?

436
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,390
There's just so much
for me to take care of…

437
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:06,020
COMMEMORATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT
GIL SHIN-AE BOUTIQUE

438
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,172
Last New Year's,

439
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,925
he graced this little shop of mine.

440
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,804
He left after sharing so much
of his good energy with us.

441
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,476
I shook his hand,

442
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,479
and my, he had such great grip strength.

443
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,481
He's such a real man.

444
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,691
Seriously,

445
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,861
I thought my bones
were all getting crushed to bits.

446
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,029
You know what I'm talking about, right?

447
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,662
The nation's leader visited our shop,

448
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:09,041
and thanks to Mr. Gi,
Madame Aema will be wearing our outfits.

449
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,378
This year's just been
one blessing after another.

450
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,965
Please tell Mr. Gi that I'm sorry
for taking so long to prepare the money,

451
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:20,178
and tell him again that I'm grateful
for this wonderful opportunity.

452
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,852
GIL SHIN-AE BOUTIQUE

453
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,193
What is it? Did I leave something out?

454
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,029
The money's short.

455
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,492
Mr. Lee, give us some space.

456
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,257
A million.

457
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,468
That was the deal.

458
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,178
Two million.

459
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,306
Don't try to bullshit me, miss.

460
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,392
Two million? You know
how much we'd have to sell for that?

461
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,020
Are you sure about that?

462
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,732
Perhaps you're mistaken,
since you're just a newbie.

463
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:18,486
That, or could it be that you're trying
to skim some off the top?

464
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,820
Lady.

465
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,781
What are you, a crook?

466
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,824
I'll have you know that Ms. Shin Ju-ae…

467
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,580
exclusively wears Paul Goh's outfits.

468
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,000
We're giving your small business
a shot at big things,

469
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,377
but you don't want it?

470
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,504
Oh my! Goodness!

471
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,091
If it bugs you,
take it up with Mr. Gi yourself.

472
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:44,178
Haggle with him and ask for a discount
like a common marketplace merchant!

473
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,890
Mr. Lee, unload those outfits!

474
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:48,808
Goodness!

475
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,520
Girl, I get it, okay?

476
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,399
After all, I decided
to fork out big money for publicity,

477
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,193
so I don't want to jinx it
by holding a grudge.

478
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,987
Whatever you say.

479
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,491
Come on, don't be mad.

480
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,120
Just make sure
she wears our outfits all pretty, okay?

481
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,747
Wait right here.

482
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,380
That thieving bitch.

483
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,352
I rewrote everything again.

484
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,772
Let's reshoot everything.

485
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,946
Great job. I'll get everything ready.

486
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,459
MADAME AEMA
FINAL SCRIPT

487
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,636
Giddyap!

488
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,475
Giddyap!

489
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,822
Who…

490
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,911
Aema.

491
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,537
It's me, Yun-ho.

492
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,008
You were my woman.

493
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,511
You're a little late,
but you finally returned to me.

494
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,679
Don't do this, please.

495
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,139
No, Aema.

496
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,641
I love you.

497
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,477
I loved you yesterday,

498
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,729
and I still love you today.

499
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,494
Tell me that you love me too.

500
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,121
Spit it out.

501
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,125
Spit out those words of love!

502
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,052
Would someone care to explain
what's going on here?

503
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,888
We loved each other once

504
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,974
and love each other still.

505
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,559
Aema and I,

506
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,645
we still miss and long for each other.

507
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,690
You're wrong, Yun-ho.

508
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,775
Our past selves died back then.

509
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,074
Aema!

510
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,206
I guess that was just your dream.

511
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,334
A good whipping

512
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,587
should help wake you.

513
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,270
It's due punishment.

514
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:35,659
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

515
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,414
Aema!

516
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:46,962
Yun-ho.

517
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,964
That look

518
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,176
won't work on me anymore!

519
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,180
Let's skip our last goodbyes.

520
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,091
Erotic,

521
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,218
grotesque,

522
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,344
and nonsensical.

523
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,139
Cut.

524
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,185
Cut!

525
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,396
Okay!

526
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,273
Okay? That was an okay?

527
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,950
Ms. Shin Ju-ae.

528
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,829
You cry well.

529
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,747
You smile well too.

530
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,625
It suits you.

531
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,153
Hee-ran, wait.

532
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,365
You're not like me.

533
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,909
What I mean to say is,

534
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,786
whatever it may be,

535
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,331
I don't want you to lose a thing.

536
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,008
REPORTER YANG SEOK-WON

537
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:00,012
You're a woman of power and influence,
so I don't know if you'd ever need it,

538
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,931
but I figured that business card

539
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,061
just might come in handy

540
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,104
for you.

541
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,231
I'm sorry

542
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,984
if I've overstepped.

543
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,988
What do you think it was
that you saw that day?

544
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,535
If you don't know what something is…

545
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,123
just leave it be.

546
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,584
Yeong-bae.

547
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,179
Ju-ae seems to like you a lot, Hee-ran.

548
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:59,905
Going a week without food can kill you,
and you've already gone two.

549
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,866
Not if I drink water, it won't.

550
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,119
That's if you drink water, not alcohol.

551
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,497
What's wrong?

552
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,166
Are you afraid I might die?

553
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,876
I can see why.

554
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:17,297
There's so much of me left to indulge in.

555
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,341
Sure, you'd be scared.

556
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,602
Would you be okay
with a different banquet?

557
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,273
There will be one soon, but…

558
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,862
But?

559
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,244
There's a catch, isn't there?

560
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,790
This is a different kind of banquet.
It could be a mixed bag.

561
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,255
Baby.

562
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,174
This is me we're talking about.

563
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,677
I'm a mixed bag in the flesh.

564
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,021
Why settle for something
bland and predictable

565
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,149
over something bold with a kick?

566
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,236
That's my flavor, after all.

567
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,746
Who's the host?

568
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,543
-Giddyap!
-Giddyap!

569
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,723
Giddyap!

570
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,946
Aema.

571
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,324
I've always noticed
how beautiful your body is.

572
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,785
Even as a woman,

573
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,079
I can't help but covet its beauty.

574
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,959
Passionate, but with grace.

575
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,294
It's a body

576
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,422
with a fire raging inside.

577
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,844
Please, Erika.

578
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,054
You flatter me.

579
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,892
I'm no longer what I used to be anymore.

580
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,312
Aema.

581
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,982
It's not too late.

582
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,569
I hope you'll find a way
to live as yourself.

583
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,904
Not as someone's wife,

584
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,906
nor as someone's past,

585
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,450
but on your own name alone…

586
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,329
so that you may finally

587
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,456
learn to

588
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,793
love yourself the way you are.

589
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,172
No matter how much the world
tries to shackle you with brute force,

590
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,674
don't shrink away

591
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,385
out of pointless guilt or humiliation.

592
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,513
Whatever comes your way,

593
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,141
protect yourself.

594
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,203
Okay.

595
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:40,000
That's a wrap on filming for Madame Aema.

596
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,210
Thank you for all your hard work,
everyone.

597
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,590
Has everyone heard
about the crew dinner today?

598
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,884
-Great work.
-See you all at dinner!

599
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,844
-Great job, everyone.
-Good work.

600
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,346
Great job, everyone.

601
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,775
Thank you, Hee-ran.

602
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,488
What's there to thank me for?

603
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,573
We were simply acting our parts.

604
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,951
Get going now.

605
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,871
Make sure you all take your things.

606
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,374
-All right, let's go home!
-Leave nothing behind.

607
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,640
Everyone.

608
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,063
I'd like to thank you
for all your hard work on this film.

609
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,941
My darling couldn't make it today,

610
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,194
so I've personally put together
this humble feast

611
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,487
to commend you all

612
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,823
for your efforts.

613
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,700
Please enjoy, everyone.

614
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,286
Yes, thank you for this meal.

615
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,206
-Eat up, everyone.
-Enjoy the meal.

616
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,165
Ms. Ju-ae?

617
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,463
You probably don't know this,

618
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,425
but I was an ardent supporter of you
from the start.

619
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,301
As an actor, I can spot talent.

620
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,268
We have a lot in common, you know.

621
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,521
I see it in your eyes as well.

622
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,982
Ambition.

623
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,859
Sex.

624
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,750
Now then, why don't we all raise a glass?

625
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,045
Glasses up high, please.

626
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,463
Cheers!

627
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,923
Cheers!

628
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,426
Great work, everyone!

629
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,012
-Great job, everyone.
-Great job.

630
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,140
To the film's success!

631
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,106
This film in particular
hit a lot of snags along the way.

632
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,444
It was a struggle for both of us.

633
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,367
I guess you're sad, now that the time
has come for us to split up,

634
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,497
but let's not get dramatic and clingy now.

635
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,125
I'm starting to find all this
dramatically unpleasant.

636
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,129
Right, about us splitting up.

637
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,091
Why don't I clear that up
while we're on it?

638
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,808
I went over your contract again,

639
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,935
and man,

640
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,145
it's the darndest thing, the law.

641
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,981
Per article three, clause two,

642
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,025
you are obliged to

643
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:56,279
"star as the lead in 12 films
produced by Shinsung Pictures."

644
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,824
Did you catch that?

645
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,034
"As the lead."

646
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,621
But in this film,
you technically play a supporting role.

647
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:12,379
This hiccup means that, by law,
this film doesn't qualify as your last.

648
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,549
That's just the law.

649
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:20,137
Zero flexibility and a cruel mistress.

650
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,097
AEMA ROCKED HONG KONG

651
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,601
Let's just do one more film.

652
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,521
Then we can split up right away.

653
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,425
You crazy…

654
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,427
Holy fuck!

655
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,429
What are you, insane?

656
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,692
Use your words, you crazy bitch.
Talk to me!

657
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:30,832
Hee-ran.

658
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,502
Damn it!

659
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,133
Holy fuck! You scared the shit out of me!

660
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,049
The New Year is just moments away.

661
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,760
Let's all begin the countdown.

662
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,220
Ten.

663
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,639
Nine.

664
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:30,725
Eight.

665
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,938
-Jeong Hee-ran, you crazy bitch.
-Seven.

666
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,482
-Six.
-Cut it out!

667
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,400
-Five.
-Five!

668
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,985
I'm only getting started.

669
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,444
-Four.
-Four!

670
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,239
-Three.
-Three!

671
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,866
-Two.
-Two!

672
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,078
-One.
-One!

673
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,798
Happy New Year!

674
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,639
