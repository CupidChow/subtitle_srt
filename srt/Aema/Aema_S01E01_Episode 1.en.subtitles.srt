1
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,849
I'll take this for you.

2
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,654
Hee-ran.

3
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,449
Hee-ran?

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,870
Oh, I guess she's busy.

5
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,788
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,002
Call someone and then talk to yourself.

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,048
Ta-da.

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,008
You're on the front page of every daily.

9
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,968
It's a great photo of you too.

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,094
Yeong-bae.

11
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,012
Yes?

12
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,638
Just get to the point.

13
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,773
I really think
you should read this right now.

14
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,822

00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,716
AEMA'S SOFT BOSOM

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,884
AEMA'S LUSH BOSOM

19
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,135
AEMA'S BOSOM

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,902
-Some wine, please.
-Sure.

21
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,862
Actually, make it whiskey. A bottle.

22
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,948
Sure, I'll get you some whiskey
right away.

23
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,574
MADAME AEMA
PRODUCED BY SHINSUNG PICTURES

24
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,119
That son of a bitch.

AEMA

26
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,642
ASIA FILM FESTIVAL
BEST ACTRESS JEONG HEE-RAN

27
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,310
However, times are changing.

28
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,564
Especially so from the '70s,
now a thing of the past.

29
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,942
The '80s are a whole different beast.

30
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,736
Now, I'm sure you all know
the main themes of this new era.

31
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,406
The so-called "3S."
Screen, sex, and sports.

32
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,660
Then how should the film industry
adapt to these changing times?

33
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,997
By giving the audience

34
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,498
sex.

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,708
That's right, sex.

36
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,254
Sex will be the ace
up the Korean film industry's sleeve,

37
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,923
and sex will revitalize Chungmuro.

38
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,633
What about sports?

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,178
Sex is basically a sport, isn't it?

40
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,522
All right!

41
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,275
I've just been told that our heroine,

42
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,319
Jeong Hee-ran,
has landed at Kimpo Airport.

43
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,238
She'll be joining us soon,

44
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,700
and we'll cut the cake
as soon as our guest of honor arrives.

45
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,118
But until then,

46
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,245
why stand around?

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,999
Let's get a little buzzed
before she gets here.

48
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,168
Please raise your glasses high!

49
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,005
To the dawning of a new era!

50
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,632
Cheers!

51
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,491
Yeong-bae.

52
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,492
Right.

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,831
Boy, who do we have here?

54
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,292
Let's welcome our world star,

55
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,961
Jeong Hee-ran--

56
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,177
Jeong Hee-ran, you…

57
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,013
I'm fine, really.

58
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,474
That's just how
we show each other affection.

59
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,896
I love you too, Jeong Hee-ran.

60
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,867
MADAME AEMA

61
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,245
You crazy bitch!

62
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,455
You son of a bitch.

63
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,924
Oh my. I didn't expect
to see you here, Mr. Paul.

64
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,929
Congratulations.

65
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,432
Thank you, sir.

66
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,648
Here.

67
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,450
It's a beautiful night.

68
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,785
Thank you all for joining us.

69
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,871
Please enjoy the food

70
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,248
and have a lovely time.

71
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,762
What are we waiting for?

72
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,680
Nothing.

73
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,859
Yeong-bae.

74
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,569
Yes?

75
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,363
At daybreak,

76
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,199
call all the reporters.

77
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,118
What should I tell them?

78
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,995
Tell them lunch is on me.

79
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,664
And reserve a room at Neulbom Garden.

80
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,219
I've done some counting.

81
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,139
Since my debut in 1972 with Desire,

82
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,561
I've starred in over 30 films
as the lead actress.

83
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,731
I've tried my hand at various roles,

84
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,901
and, as I'm sure you've all seen,

85
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,404
I've stripped naked countless times.

86
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,865
That she has.

87
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,581
Thanks to all that,

88
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,417
I've received a lot of love

89
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,794
and won many awards.

90
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,005
But it's the '80s now.

91
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,842
In keeping with the new era,

92
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,760
I thought I should also

93
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,138
change with the times.

94
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,352
I'd also like to look toward the future,
toward the 1980s,

95
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,523
and show our audiences a new…

96
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,901
me.

97
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,918
ACTRESS JEONG HEE-RAN'S
BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT

98
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,003
NEW ERA, NEW ME

99
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,964
PLANS TO TURN DOWN ROLES
WITH GRATUITOUS NUDITY

100
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:50,678
JEONG HEE-RAN
TO EXPLORE NUDITY-FREE ROLES

101
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,180
Damn it.

102
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,932
-Where's Director Kwak?
-Sorry?

103
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,185
Why did I even ask?

104
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,898
Has she lost her damn mind?

105
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,649
That crazy Jeong Hee-ran.

106
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,489
SHINSUNG PICTURES

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,955
…starring Jeong Hee-ran,
the heroine of Sleepless!

108
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,917
Now playing in cinemas to rave reviews!

109
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,885
ARTISTIC, MESMERIZING DESIRE

110
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,436
You seen the papers?

111
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,396
Sorry?

112
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,441
You're a film director.
Read the papers, for Christ's sake.

113
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,446
We're recasting Aema.

114
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,784
Demote Jeong Hee-ran to a supporting role.
What was her name again?

115
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,701
Eriko?

116
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,703
-Erika?
-That's the one.

117
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,080
Make Hee-ran play her,

118
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,332
and audition rookies
for the lead role of Aema.

119
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:02,959
So suddenly?

120
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,044
What's wrong? Don't you like rookies?

121
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,922
No, it's not like that.

122
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,049
Emmanuelle drew attention

123
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,386
partly because Sylvia Kristel
was such a fresh face.

124
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,763
A fresh face can work well in this genre.

125
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,681
But…

126
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,060
will Hee-ran be okay with this?

127
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,771
Erika is a supporting role,
plain and simple.

128
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,566
What can she do?
She has a contract to fulfill.

129
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,153
Start a huge ad push for the auditions.

130
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,489
The biggest ad campaign ever, you hear?

131
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,658
Now, how will our big campaign appear?

132
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,703
Well, as a…

133
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,996
Big, that's how.

134
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,665
-Sir--
-President Ku.

135
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,835
Mr. Gi.

136
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,752
Thank you.

137
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,634
Sir, since we're recasting the character,

138
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,430
why don't we edit the screenplay
and take it in a new direction?

139
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,474
Not the mindless,
in-your-face approach we have now,

140
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,768
but something a bit more subtle.

141
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,645
A bit more artistic, you know?

142
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,647
Make it as subtly artistic as you'd like.

143
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,316
Just make people horny.

144
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,692
Right, it'll make you horny.

145
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,738
Making people horny is a given,
but when I say subtle,

146
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,365
I mean, it won't instantly make you horny.

147
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,784
It will start off faint and distant,

148
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,995
and gently seep into you.

149
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,248
The kind of thing
that slowly, almost hazily,

150
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,334
makes you totally

151
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,753
and profoundly…

152
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,756
horny.

153
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,012
I'll edit the script.

154
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,139
While you're editing it, make Eriko--

155
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,140
You mean Erika.

156
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,061
Model her after Hee-ran
and make her the ultimate bitch.

157
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,856
She'll come crawling back to us

158
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,150
once the public
and ad companies ditch her.

159
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,236
She's been put on a pedestal for so long

160
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,614
that she's lost her way.

161
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,157
She's lost, all right.

162
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,464
OPEN CASTING CALLS
FOR THE LEADING LADY OF MADAME AEMA

163
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,383
Shall I go and apologize?

164
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,510
I'll tell them you told me to.

165
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,261
Have a tomato. They're sweet.

166
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,021
Hee-ran.

167
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,023
The president says

168
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,067
he'll make you play Erika.

169
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,736
We both know how wrong that is.

170
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,363
Erika's a supporting role.

171
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,657
How could he do this to you?

172
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,620
About Director Kwon Do-il…

173
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,039
Sorry?

174
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,209
Back in spring, I heard
he was working on a new screenplay,

175
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,920
but there's still no news
of its completion.

176
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,172
INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED
KOREAN AUTEUR KWON DO-IL

177
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,061
He just left the Dongsin Inn

178
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,480
and entered Jingogae by himself.

179
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,118
Welcome…

180
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,870
Oh my!

181
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,038
It's Jeong Hee-ran!

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,293
Goodness gracious me.

183
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,138
It's been so long since we met, Director.

184
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,559
I loved Woman in the Dark, by the way.

185
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,771
You have no idea how much I cried
after watching that film.

186
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,191
That film wasn't meant to be a tearjerker.
What made you cry?

187
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,610
I couldn't help but blame myself

188
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,820
for turning down

189
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,489
a role in that film.

190
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,034
You had a wedding coming up.
It's completely reasonable.

191
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,660
I totally understand.

192
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,288
We called it off before saying "I do."

193
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,416
We still get along fine, though,

194
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,126
as business partners.

195
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,838
Since we're on the topic of business,

196
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,049
aren't you working on a new project?

197
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,469
What would you say
to producing it with Shinsung Pictures?

198
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,430
If you make it with Shinsung Pictures,

199
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,891
you could cast me, you know.

200
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,602
Shinsung Pictures?

201
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,812
Sounds good to me.

202
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,315
That lad Ku Jung-ho
is a high school alumnus of mine.

203
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,402
Might there be a role for me
in that film of yours?

204
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,114
I'm a half-decent actor now,
if I do say so myself.

205
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,834
I'm a long way off though.

206
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,002
The screenplay needs extensive revision.

207
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,964
A bottle of soju, please.

208
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,217
Actually, I think
I'm done drinking for the day.

209
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,178
I need to write once I get back.

210
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,223
I'll just have another glass myself.

211
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,685
I'm just so delighted to see you.

212
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,728
It brings back so many old memories.

213
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,234
Yeong-bae.

214
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,735
Yes.

215
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,780
Didn't you say you know the head
of Director Kwon's production department?

216
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,324
I actually don't know him that well.

217
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,659
Then get to know him.

218
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,995
Become friendly. Blood brothers, even.

219
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,081
Do whatever it takes

220
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,750
to get me the script
Director Kwon Do-il's working on.

221
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,420
What are you planning?

222
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:45,050
That bastard, Ku Jung-ho, knows I have
one film left on my exclusivity agreement,

223
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,802
so he thinks he can mess with me.

224
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,556
If I can just convince
Director Kwon Do-il,

225
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,727
I could part with Shinsung Pictures
on good terms with a great film.

226
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,772
We are faced with two tasks right now.

227
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,190
The first

228
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,402
is to snag Director Kwon Do-il,
no matter what.

229
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,987
The other

230
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,574
is to prevent the Madame Aema auditions

231
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,492
at all costs.

232
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,585
Remember the hostess films
that were all the rage in the '70s?

233
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,087
Sure, they had the actresses strip
for a pretty penny,

234
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,881
but they weren't true erotic films.

235
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,883
All that eroticism was a front

236
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,928
for the tear-jerking dramas
they actually were.

237
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,347
Not that they could strip freely
back then.

238
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,350
But things are going to be different
with Madame Aema.

239
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,143
A new era has dawned upon us,

240
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,562
and this will be an adult film,
through and through.

241
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,939
-Please look here!
-Sure.

242
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,028
Besides, sexual desire
is the subject of our film.

243
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,365
-Female sexual desire, to be exact.
-Cut it out!

244
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,158
That and horses.

245
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,660
You get my drift?

246
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,412
Horses!

247
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,875
You follow me, right?

248
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,794
Shall we do fist pumps?

249
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,711
You got it.

250
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:08,133
This will be a groundbreaking film
that pioneers an unexplored genre.

251
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,345
Let's just say you won't be disappointed

252
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,972
in your investments.

253
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:14,932
Say cheese.

254
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,351
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

255
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,480
Come on. Female sexual desire
and horses aside,

256
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,401
we need to think about
the scale of the film.

257
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,029
How could you cast a totally new face
as the lead character?

258
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,664
I'm sure people in Honam
will call that a sack of shit.

259
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,167
President Wang.

260
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,378
Who do you think I am?

261
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,716
I'm the man who discovered Jeong Hee-ran.

262
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,389
The first film I did with her
sold over 50,000 tickets in Honam.

263
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,850
And thanks to that, President Wang,

264
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,477
you built five more theaters
in Mokpo alone, no?

265
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,855
Trust my gut.

266
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,233
Ku Jung-ho's

267
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,194
still got it!

268
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,789
CASTING CALL FOR MADAME AEMA

269
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,922
JUDGES

270
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,425
What? Am I meant to stay standing?

271
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,012
-Don't just stand there. Get her a chair.
-Right. Sure.

272
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,314
DIRECTOR KWAK IN-U

273
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,362
Director Kwak, when did we first meet?

274
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,990
Was it during The Rose
or Yeong-ja's Heydays?

275
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,409
It was during Seong Chun-hyang.

276
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,917
You were such a naive
assistant director back in the day.

277
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,462
You could barely look me in the eye.

278
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,048
Messy hair and rosy cheeks.

279
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,926
You were like a cute little potato.

280
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,427
So,

281
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,013
I'm to play Erika?

282
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,264
Hee-ran--

283
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,603
I'd been meaning to fill you in on that.
You see…

284
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:26,980
Director.

285
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,651
Have more sex.

286
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,860
Yes.

287
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,661
Not with your scripts,
but with a person for once.

288
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,874
I'm talking about real sex.

289
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,668
That'll make you happy.

290
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,504
Aren't we all in this to be happy?

291
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,674
JUDGE
ACTOR JEONG HEE-RAN

292
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,425
At the end of the day,

293
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,719
this film is still my baby.

294
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,973
I'm here to pick someone
who fits the bill for me.

295
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,518
Director.

296
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,521
That's only fair, right?

297
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,065
Right you are.

298
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,441
Without a doubt. Yup.

299
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,903
Shall we get started?

300
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,035
I'm the kind of woman

301
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,914
who wants to rot away and die
as soon as possible.

302
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,215
I'm the kind of woman who wants to…

303
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,135
Rot away and die as soon as possible.

304
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,389
Come here to play

305
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,183
I'll give you a piggyback ride

306
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,561
I'm the kind of woman
who wants to rot away and die as soon…

307
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:52,733
The mountain ranges of Gyeongsang-do
Are known for being grand…

308
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,713
No, wait. Hold on…

309
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,765
That's it for today.

310
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,937
How entertaining.

311
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,117
What were you thinking,
agreeing to cast a rookie actor?

312
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,912
Just cut your tongue off.
Think you're some auteur? Huh?

313
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,146
You there.

314
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,115
Do you work for this film studio?

315
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,700
I do.

316
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,621
I'm here for the audition,
but I'm a bit late.

317
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,958
Well, that won't do. You snooze, you lose.

318
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,377
I just got here from the countryside.

319
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,213
I live in Seoul,
but I was there for a show.

320
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,465
Not that I'm a singer or anything.

321
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,056
I don't work at this factory either.

322
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,685
That makes me sound strange,

323
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,395
doesn't it?

324
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,358
That it does. Quite strange.

325
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,404
I'm late, strange, and a total mess.

326
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,244
What are you good at?

327
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,913
There's the stuff I practiced,

328
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,499
then there's the stuff I'm good at.

329
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,836
Not what you practiced,
but what you're good at.

330
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,301
Wait, I…

331
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,811
Rad clothes, no?

332
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,731
I came straight from work.

333
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,827
All right. Eat up, everyone.

334
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,663
Whoa, hey. Eat.

335
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,125
Eat up, everyone.

336
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,796
Here. Eat.

337
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,100
How can you just take
someone else's jacket like that?

338
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,895
People would think
you're one of us factory girls.

339
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,021
Even I get confused

340
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,815
and wonder why
you're not at work sometimes.

341
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,443
You haven't eaten, have you?

342
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,321
Sheesh, that's cold.

343
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,325
Perfect for a snowball fight.

344
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,203
How was the casting call?
Did you get to audition?

345
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,207
No idea. I got there late.

346
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,000
So you missed it?

347
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,920
That's the part I don't get.

348
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,507
I'm not sure if I auditioned or not.

349
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,429
What are you talking about?

350
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,646
Hold up.

351
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,482
You slid in just before curfew again?

352
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,735
We made it!

353
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,403
Oh, I'm dying.

354
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,823
I made it all the way back
only to die here.

355
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,202
Seriously, our shifts end
way too close to the curfew.

356
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,496
Someone make them work things out.

357
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,540
You made it back alive,

358
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,250
so have some dinner.

359
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,836
-God, that's cold.
-So cold.

360
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,380
Slow down.

361
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,342
-Tell me if you need more.
-We're just living life one day at a time.

362
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,763
I don't get why it has to be so tough.

363
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,212
SECOND FLOOR, 61-2 CHO-DONG, JUNG-GU
SATURDAY AT 3:00 P.M.

364
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,561
YEONG-JA'S HEYDAYS

365
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,779
All right, face the camera.
I love it. One, two.

366
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,364
Your side profile now.

367
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,949
One, two.

368
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,576
Now look at my hands.

369
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,202
Imagine you're a flower

370
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,663
and you're coming into bloom like this.

371
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,374
You're blooming. Go on, try that.

372
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,668
Wow, I love it. Let's go with that.

373
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,503
Just like that. Eyes on the camera.

374
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,006
One, two.

375
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,675
Okay, perfect. Now stay still. Here we go.

376
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,137
Hang in there. One, two, okay!

377
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,556
You look great. Let's do this. One, two.

378
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,724
That's it!

379
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,893
All right, this is going great!

380
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,729
Hey, wrap it up. We've got it.

381
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,105
Director Kwak.

382
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,233
You know what matters more to me
than anything else, right?

383
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,778
The plausibility of the breasts.

384
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,404
Wow. Just look at that.

385
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,700
One look is enough
to know that they're just…

386
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,951
You made the first cut.

387
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,412
We just need to know if you can act,

388
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,872
but this is a sex film.

389
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,335
You done some fucking?

390
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:54,506
Think you've got what it takes to strip
for the camera and perform a sex scene?

391
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,766
Why does it sound like you're trying
to get me to strip and have sex on camera?

392
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,685
What's this now?

393
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,728
I like what you've got going on.

394
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,147
I might start clapping again.

395
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,109
All right, now.

396
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,821
Let's get her in costume and makeup
to see how she looks.

397
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,197
-Show her the way.
-Yes.

398
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,408
-You can come with me.
-Go on now.

399
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,409
Go with him.

400
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,576
Okay.

401
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,663
She's outstanding.

402
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,625
The more I look at her face,
the more I see the stories it holds.

403
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,128
She doesn't instantly strike me as pretty.

404
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,090
And she has zero acting experience.
What if she's just a waste of film?

405
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,008
You know how it is with acting.

406
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,761
It's not something you can just learn.

407
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,471
It's all to do with inherent moxie.

408
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,433
Moxie's all an actor needs.
I know she's got it.

409
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,188
Damn it.

410
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,278
I think someone owes me

411
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:03,241
an explanation as to what's going on here,
or at least some excuses.

412
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,243
Director Kwak?

413
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,256
Hello.

414
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,143
Who did you sleep with?

415
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,314
Whether it was the producer or director,

416
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,109
I don't know who you had to sleep with
for this opportunity,

417
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,862
but you'll have better luck
at other places

418
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,739
more accepting of girls like you.

419
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,991
Try Seoul Station

420
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,076
or the bus terminal.

421
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,204
Places like that.

422
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,626
Go home, everyone.

423
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,925
You're much prettier in person.

424
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,138
I've been a fan ever since I was little.

425
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,976
Watching you,
I always dreamed of becoming an actress.

426
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,145
Well, thanks.

427
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,147
Good luck out there.

428
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,537
But may I ask,

429
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,248
between the producer and the director,

430
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,666
who has the bigger cock?

431
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,213
I haven't slept with either one yet,
you see.

432
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,051
I just thought

433
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,929
that you, of all people, might know.

434
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,850
Now that you've brought it up,
I'll consider which one to sleep with.

435
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,644
It was an honor to meet you.

436
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,174
Have you gotten your hands
on Director Kwon's screenplay yet?

437
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,176
We'll finally meet tomorrow.

438
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,346
You set up a meeting?

439
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,183
We don't have a meeting as such,
but I'll be meeting him.

440
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,644
Tomorrow is

441
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,271
Sunday, after all.

442
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,566
And on Sundays…

443
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,483
Korea?

444
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,485
Sings!

445
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,744
All right.

446
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,876
Oh my, hello!

447
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,340
Aren't you the one and only Ra Byeong-su,

448
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,301
the head of Director Kwon's
production department?

449
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,429
That's right. And who might you be?

450
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,351
I'm Park Yeong-bae,
assistant to the actress Jeong Hee-ran.

451
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,357
I've heard so much about you, you know.

452
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,276
You're from Namsongri
in Pohang, aren't you?

453
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,279
My mother is also from Pohang.

454
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,949
So technically, I'm half-Pohangese.

455
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,325
Go Gyeongsang-do!

456
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,330
I moved to Seoul when I was eight,
so I'm actually a half-Seoulite.

457
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,709
As am I. My other half, that is.

458
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,214
What are the odds of meeting
a hometown friend so far from home?

459
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,131
Isn't this great?

460
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,008
Allow me to serve you

461
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,094
to the best of my abilities from now on.

462
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,765
Man, look at all that dead skin
peeling off.

463
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,603
Her name is Shin Ju-ae.

464
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,939
Don't know if that's her real name.

465
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,985
She wears a Guro Industrial Complex jacket
but doesn't seem to be a factory worker.

466
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,279
I think she might be a backup dancer,

467
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,074
but I'm not sure who she dances for.

468
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,660
Can you find her?

469
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,120
Uh-huh.

470
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,330
Huh?

471
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,877
Nope.

472
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,172
Not you, either.

473
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,842
Have you seen her before?

474
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,387
No?

475
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,227
You know the dance
where you do this with your feet?

476
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,815
She's in her twenties,
with slightly tanned skin, and…

477
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,828
NAMI'S SPECIAL SHOW

478
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:04,500
STARRING THE POP SENSATION NAMI
AT CLUB MOONRISE

479
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,762
CLUB MOONRISE

480
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,265
Oh, here's to lasting friendships

481
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,061
Oh, here's to happy hearts

482
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,647
Oh, here's to a good life

483
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,399
Yeah!

484
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,447
Oh, here's to lasting friendships

485
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,992
Oh, here's to happy hearts

486
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,121
Oh, here's to a good life

487
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,623
Yeah!

488
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,339
Hey, aren't you coming?

489
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,431
Hold up.

490
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,809
It's Ms. Lasting Friendships.

491
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,022
You put on a great show.

492
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,745
Thank you, esteemed customer.

493
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,330
Please come again.

494
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,959
Come again?

495
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,878
Come again?

496
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,846
Oh, here's to lasting breasts!

497
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,933
Oh, here's to happy breasts!

498
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,064
I'll come again!

499
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,828
Excuse me.

500
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,456
Excuse me.

501
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,584
Hey, let go.

502
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,419
Wait, just let go. Hey!

503
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,504
Let me go, damn it!

504
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,680
Ms. Shin Ju-ae, wait.
Just hold on a minute!

505
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,269
Fucking hell, that's an insane bite.
What are you, a dog?

506
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,107
I am the head of Shinsung Pictures'
production department.

507
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,737
Gi Seok.

508
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,239
Family name Gi, given name Seok.

509
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,325
Ms. Shin Ju-ae,

510
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,785
you should audition for Madame Aema again.

511
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,622
I think

512
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,041
I'm done with all that.

513
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,172
Whoa, hold it, you.

514
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,886
The director and the president
both want you as the lead in Madame Aema.

515
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,555
Do you have any idea what that means?

516
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,102
So what?

517
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,188
Should I sleep with them?

518
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,856
What?

519
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,484
Guess a struggling actress
seemed like easy pickings.

520
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,946
Did you think I'd be at your beck and call

521
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,865
as long as you keep dangling
a lead role in my face?

522
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,536
I showed up as asked
and pissed off when told to.

523
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,415
So now it's your turn to piss off.

524
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:34,961
Hey.

525
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,337
Hey!

526
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,798
You crazy bitch!

527
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,992
You almost broke curfew again.

528
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,036
You've got guts,
coming back reeking of booze.

529
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,297
I saw Jeong Hee-ran last weekend.

530
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,259
Jeong Hee-ran?

531
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,803
The Jeong Hee-ran?

532
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,598
She was hella pretty.

533
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,437
I guess it's meant for people like her.

534
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,982
The actress life.

535
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,653
Should I start learning factory work?

536
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,032
You what?

537
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,284
Is this drunk talk?

538
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,131
Did you find her?

539
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,096
I did.

540
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:12,808
You found her?

541
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,313
Then why the sour face?

542
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,856
What is it?

543
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,899
What went wrong?

544
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,692
She told me to piss off.

545
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,820
Turns out she's one crazy bitch.

546
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,451
Wait. She told you to piss off,
so you did?

547
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,536
Dang it.

548
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,040
You crazy bastard.
Dealing with crazy bitches is your forte.

549
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,502
Well, this crazy bitch
was completely rabid.

550
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,172
Let's proceed with the second round
of auditions as planned,

551
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,175
and as for this one,
I'll try to figure something out.

552
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,302
Maybe I can duke it out with her.

553
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,345
Or…

554
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,100
I'll duke it out with her.

555
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,440
Ghana.

556
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,276
Ghana Chocolate.

557
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,571
It was as soft as a dream

558
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,908
and as sweet as love.

559
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,620
The sliver of a dream,

560
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,831
dipped in our memories.

561
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,130
Fucking bitch.

562
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,054
Ghana Chocolate.

563
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,162
The sliver of a dream…

564
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,999
dipped in my memories.

565
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,134
CASTING CALL FOR MADAME AEMA

566
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,844
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

567
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,661
Hello. Allow me
to formally introduce myself.

568
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,582
My name is Shin Ju-ae.

569
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:48,172
Last time, I wasn't able to answer
the producer's question properly.

570
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,508
Let me start off today

571
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,636
by answering that question.

572
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,326
I can strip in front of a camera.

573
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,579
If it means I can act…

574
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,001
I'll strip a hundred times.

575
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,847
And I won't just strip if you cast me.

576
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,186
I'll put everything on the line,

577
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,189
as if my life depends on it.

578
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,820
In return,

579
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,992
for putting everything on the line,
I'd like you to promise me something.

580
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,622
If you're really going to cast me,

581
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,467
please make me the next Jeong Hee-ran.

582
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,895
