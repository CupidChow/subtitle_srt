1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,680
That was fun.

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,349
I guess you're having fun too.

3
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,062
You must be feeling pretty proud
of yourself right now,

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,523
thinking you've landed a nice blow.

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,862
It's been about ten years, give or take.

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,698
You're far from the first.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,994
A hundred girls show up every year,
wanting to become the next me.

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,579
And yet,

9
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,749
here I still stand, ten years later.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,669
Makes you wonder where they all went.

11
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,674
There's nothing special
or amazing about you.

12
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,428
You'll also sink into obscurity,
never knowing why.

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,265
Just like the countless girls
who faded away.

14
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,025
Take a good hard look.

15
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
I'm Jeong Hee-ran.

16
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,325
Try as you might,

17
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,913
you'll never find out
what it takes to be me.

18
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,547
You can leave.

19
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,305
Hey.

20
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,225
I told you to leave.

21
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,230
I'd…

22
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,028
like to hear
the other judges' thoughts as well.

23
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,285
There's that inherent moxie!

24
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,246
That's what it looks like, right?

25
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,164
She's got spunk. I love it!

26
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,999
One thing's for certain.

27
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,503
She's going to devour the silver screen.

28
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,052
I spent the past few weeks

29
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,763
looking for that girl.

30
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,100
Even if you kick her out now,

31
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,352
I'm sure I'll do the same

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,522
and seek her out once again.

33
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,076
Tacky jerks.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,878
Nice. That looks great.

35
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,465
Director Kwak,
come get in this shot, will you?

36
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,260
This is the stuff that makes history.
Get in here.

37
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,221
-Now, for the final shot.
-Our director.

38
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,764
Show me those pearly whites!

39
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,142
And say, "Madame Aema"!

40
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,437
Madame Aema!

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,945
AEMA

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,003
Now that you've signed with us,

43
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,005
you need to live in a place like this.

44
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,924
A place that suits your status.

45
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,342
Don't forget,

46
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,594
you're an actress now.

47
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,599
Are there

48
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,018
any other job openings?

49
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,563
LET US LIVE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS!
LABORERS DESERVE RESPECT TOO

50
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,191
WE ARE NOT MACHINES!
LET'S MAKE A NATION FOR THE WORKERS

51
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,109
OUR DEMANDS
1. REASONABLE WORK HOURS

52
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,110
Geun-ha.

53
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,876
I signed a contract today,

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,128
and the studio
even gave me a place to stay.

55
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,882
You should come with me.

56
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,304
I already asked. They need an assistant
for the head of the production department.

57
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,559
But down there,

58
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,521
everyone is hard at work.

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,362
Did you know that Chungmuro
is a den of vipers and cutthroats?

60
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,698
I can't do this alone.

61
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,867
Everyone says a new era is dawning,

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,120
and it will dawn on us too.

63
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,163
Geun-ha.

64
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,417
I'm doing this to fight as well.

65
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,016
The early termination fee.

66
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,936
And a little extra for good measure.

67
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,690
Let's terminate the contract and split up.

68
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,946
This again? It's like clockwork with you.

69
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,326
Besides, I already obliged
the last time you asked.

70
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,995
Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

71
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,123
If contracts were so fickle
and could be broken on a whim,

72
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,417
no one would get any business done
to begin with.

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,793
The law's a thing, you know.

74
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,545
If, despite everything,

75
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,591
a time comes when we are forced
to terminate your contract early,

76
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,387
I'll be taking more from you
than just an early termination fee.

77
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,308
So stop trying to pick a fight with me.

78
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,561
There's only one film left.

79
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,939
Just close your eyes
and ride it out till the end.

80
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,691
Once that's over with,

81
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,529
I'll toss you aside real good, okay?

82
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,744
Let me…

83
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,956
correct you on one thing.

84
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,211
Millions have turned up at theaters
to see my films,

85
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,048
and I've won more trophies
than I can count.

86
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,760
Every month,
I shoot yet another ad campaign.

87
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,182
Do you get what I'm saying?

88
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,937
The public adores me.

89
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,939
They want me.

90
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,112
Whatever comes to pass,

91
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,448
I won't be the one who gets tossed aside.

92
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,827
You will.

93
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:03,965
Are you

94
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,175
tight-lipped?

95
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,344
Yes.

96
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,721
I like that.

97
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,558
You can start tomorrow.

98
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,185
Sorry?

99
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,771
Just remember this.

100
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,984
Everything you see and hear
from now on is top secret.

101
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,194
That's the only condition.

102
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,864
There's no salary,

103
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,617
but you'll be making good dough.

104
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:49,135
SEOUL TEXTILE COMPANY

YEONG-JA'S HEYDAYS

106
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,319
Don't get sick,
and try not to get injured.

107
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,781
-And don't go hungry.
-Don't skip meals, okay?

108
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,284
Please get in touch
if you ever need my help.

109
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,334
I'm someone who helps people.

DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S VOICE
REPORTER YANG SEOK-WON

111
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,384
Don't forget
that we're fighting our battle here,

112
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,094
and…

113
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,851
keep fighting the good fight,

114
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,977
just like us.

115
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,857
-Have a safe trip, Ju-ae.
-Look after yourself.

116
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,275
Come visit us, okay?

117
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,625
Up there.

118
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,502
The third one from the top.

119
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,254
The third floor.

120
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,340
If it's on the third floor,
the view must be great.

121
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,969
Maybe we can see the river.

122
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,023
SHINSUNG PICTURES
PRESIDENT KU JUNG-HO

123
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,127
MADAME AEMA
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY KWAK IN-U

124
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,218
Damn it.

125
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,433
What the heck?

126
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,060
What even is this? What the hell?

127
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,773
Come on.

128
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,109
Do we have to do this
first thing in the morning?

129
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,612
Mi-na, let's do this at night, okay?

130
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,072
I need to get going, so undo these.

131
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,449
Hey.

132
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,659
Have you forgotten who I am?

133
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,164
-What?
-I don't know if you remember.

134
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,042
But I'm an actress.

135
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,046
-I'm still here, alive and kicking.
-Damn it.

136
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,674
How could you cast Aema

137
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,551
without even telling me?

138
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,847
That's what makes you a son of a bitch,
you fucking piece of shit.

139
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,057
Mi-na.

140
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,393
Every film and every role

141
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,438
has this thing called a perfect match.

142
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,608
Match, my ass.

143
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,237
Whoa, hey now.

144
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,906
Hey, Mr. Ku Jung-ho.

145
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,117
Did you really think
your living arrangement

146
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,578
with a 20-year-old starlet
who'd just moved to Seoul

147
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,915
came with no strings attached?

148
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,715
I get it, okay?

149
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,759
Let's get this over with. Come on.

150
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,345
Ta-da!

151
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,848
What the hell is this?

152
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,434
Hey!

153
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,690
What the hell are you doing?

154
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,108
I'm blackmailing you.

155
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
What?

156
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,737
Keep neglecting me like this,
and this photo I just took?

157
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,824
I'll hang it up for all to see
in Gwanghwamun Intersection.

158
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,909
-Bloody hell.
-Now…

159
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,411
-Hey!
-Sweetie.

160
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,578
Say cheese!

161
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,997
Cut it out, you crazy bitch!
Let me out of these.

162
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,124
Oh God, sweetie.

163
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,458
Uncuff me now!

164
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,376
Peekaboo!

165
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,961
Hey!

166
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,630
Uncuff me, damn it! I'm warning you!

167
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,674
Pull it back up now!

168
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,218
You fucking bitch!

169
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,972
Go!

170
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,434
Go!

171
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,023
Hee-ran!

172
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,112
Hee-ran.

173
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,905
I finally have it.

174
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,747
What?

175
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,331
That's right!

176
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,417
What is?

177
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,716
The screenplay
for Director Kwon Do-il's new film.

178
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,302
PREDATION NIGHT

179
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,518
MADAME AEMA

180
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,855
You went through all of it already?

181
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,650
But it's only been three minutes.

182
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,572
Why does Aema tie a guy up
and pick up a whip all of a sudden?

183
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,034
After all that Japanese smut,
is that what makes you horny now?

184
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,746
Isn't wanting to be chastised
by a stunning woman a universal fetish?

185
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,665
Haven't you ever wanted
to be chastised by Mi-na?

186
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,171
It's been a rough day,
so let's keep this short.

187
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,382
Just keep it vanilla, okay?

188
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,676
The guy strips woman down,

189
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,055
inserts, bangs, and cums, okay?

190
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,015
Come on.

191
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,852
The film aims to depict female desire
from a female perspective.

192
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,938
Then let the woman cum as well!

193
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,564
Besides,

194
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,317
why'd you cut the three boob flashes?

195
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,444
I went over this with you before.

196
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,404
-There's a subtle--
-Subtle?

197
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,447
Screw subtle.

198
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,365
Hey.

199
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,993
The new era is calling for sex in films,
so forget all this subtlety crap.

200
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,789
You want to be subtle after casting a girl
with such promising breasts?

201
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,706
Are you nuts?

202
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,919
You're acting naive
because you've never tasted the money.

203
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,463
Flash some tits once,
and you get a new car.

204
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,507
Flash them twice? You get a new house.

205
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,634
Three times, you get a new life.

206
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,638
Scrap this version

207
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,473
and go with the last draft.

208
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,560
Things were going great.
Why would you go off track?

209
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,572
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

210
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,156
Oh, really?

211
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,577
As for that, Mr. Choi,
you decide, and I'll follow.

212
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,703
I'll be on my way.

213
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,954
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

214
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm the director!

215
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,378
How do you expect me to direct a film
I don't even agree with?

216
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,298
When I reworked
Hee-ran and Ju-ae's characters,

217
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,718
I did so in a way
I was confident would work.

218
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,972
I, too, have a vision as a director!

219
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,974
You need to believe in your director!

220
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,228
Now you sound like a director, don't you?

221
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,897
I do believe in you.

222
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,858
Why else would I let you direct the film?

223
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,943
But I think the real problem here

224
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,195
is your lack of faith in me.

225
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:11,243
If you really can't come to terms with it,
you'll have to work on something else.

226
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,624
We'll find a new director for Madame Aema.

227
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,001
Such a shame.

228
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:40,314
PREDATION NIGHT

229
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,531
Hee-ran.

230
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,327
Word is that Director Kwon is revising
the script at his villa right now.

231
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,328
The address is…

232
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,703
Not many people know about this place.

233
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,581
How did you find me here?

234
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,626
Director.

235
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,461
First,

236
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,422
allow me to apologize.

237
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,258
I'm sorry,

238
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,094
but I got my hands on
a draft of Predation Night.

239
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,596
Sorry?

240
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,557
After reading it…

241
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,602
I don't know why,

242
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,230
but I just had to see you right away.

243
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,109
Director. Please cast me in the film.

244
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,653
I can really do this.

245
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,614
About that, Hee-ran,

246
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,117
I'm still not done making edits.

247
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,578
Besides,

248
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,914
I'm not quite ready
to let anyone in on it yet.

249
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,501
Let me in
whenever you feel like you're ready.

250
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,212
I can wait for as long as it takes.

251
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,303
Didn't you recently announce publicly
you were done with nudity in your films?

252
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,931
If you've read the script,

253
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,226
you must know that nudity
is a crucial part of this film.

254
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,146
Director.

255
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,025
When I ask you to use me,

256
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,029
it means you can use
every last inch of me.

257
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,783
The year I turned 20,

258
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,203
I started acting without a clue.

259
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,458
I got too famous
before I could truly understand acting,

260
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,087
and I kept acting nonstop
simply because I was famous.

261
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,506
To this day,

262
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,258
I've had a successful acting career,

263
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,095
focusing purely on box office success

264
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,349
and calculating
how to boost my public image.

265
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,725
But now,

266
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,522
for the first time ever,
I find myself truly yearning for a role.

267
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,506
After staring at the fireplace
for a long time,

268
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,301
she slowly raises herself.

269
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,221
Heavy rain will drum on the window.

270
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,351
A raging storm outside
would be even better.

271
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,440
Let us first follow her drenched feet
as she walks across the rug.

272
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,735
SEEMINGLY DETERMINED,
SHE WALKS UP THE STAIRS

273
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,737
She walks up the stairs…

274
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,866
THE SOUND OF HER BEATING HEART
ENCROACHES LIKE A SHADOW

275
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,161
…and as the distance between us
draws closer,

276
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,583
I am overcome with a sense of dread.

277
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:35,174
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR…

278
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,136
She is

279
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,054
right outside the door.

280
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,144
Ms. Su-jeong.

281
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,025
This

282
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,652
is a tale of love.

283
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,532
Ms. Su-jeong.

284
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,284
No, Ms. Su-jeong. No!

285
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,293
Can you hear my heart?

286
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,379
When I ask you to use me,

287
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,717
it means you can use
every last inch of me.

288
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,971
Her hands are cold…

289
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,268
but her heart burns.

290
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,655
HER HANDS MOVE
TO THE DEEPER PLACE…

291
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,283
This is a tale of love
driven by desperation.

292
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,662
No, Ms. Su-jeong.

293
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,579
No!

294
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,834
I was the one

295
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,920
who loved her first.

296
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,132
I was also the one

297
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,801
who turned away first.

298
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,324
At the end of the day,

299
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,952
this is a tale of love.

300
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,961
It is a tale

301
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,173
about the predation night,
which marked the end of that love.

302
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,550
PREDATION NIGHT

303
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,933
THE END

304
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,440
Mr. Ku.

305
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,828
Mr. Ku!

306
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,168
Do we just need some boob flashes?

307
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,879
Leave everything else to me.

308
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,380
Sure!

309
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,758
As long as it makes us horny!

310
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,345
What was that about?

311
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,221
How vulgar.

312
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,724
-Goodness me.
-He must not be right in the head.

313
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,440
You're here, Director.

314
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,358
Yes, hello.

315
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,736
Oh my, forgive my manners
for not checking in with you sooner.

316
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,613
It's been a while, Director.

317
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,031
Please sit.

318
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,159
Have you been well?

319
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,042
Let's make a film together.

320
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:58,752
Whoa!

321
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,213
No way!

322
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,173
PREDATION NIGHT
REVISED DRAFT

323
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,384
Wow, Predation Night.

324
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,386
Director.

325
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,806
I'd be so honored.

326
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,309
I guess I'm a half-decent producer now,

327
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,395
seeing as you entrusted me
with your script.

328
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,313
It's not because of you.

329
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,273
Sorry?

330
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,608
It's because of Hee-ran.

331
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,151
I see.

332
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,279
I heard she's still tied to you.

333
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,740
That's right. Hee-ran's still mine, yes.

334
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,035
I'd like to work with Jeong Hee-ran
this time.

335
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,287
You're just a side dish.

336
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:42,045
Well, side dish or not,
I'm honored just to be a part of all this.

337
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,931
PREDATION NIGHT
REVISED DRAFT

338
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:53,849
Director.

339
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,393
How about we increase the budget?

340
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,688
As they say, the bigger you make it,
the bigger it'll seem.

341
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,108
I'll make all the right arrangements.
What do you say?

342
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,697
A bigger budget only raises the stakes.
Let's keep things the way they are.

343
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,031
Here's the thing though.

344
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,661
Hee-ran's great and all,

345
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,456
but have you considered
using a rookie actress?

346
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,669
Why are you asking me that?

347
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:28,383
You should never underestimate
the spark a fresh face can bring.

348
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,095
The audience always craves
something new, after all.

349
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,305
Besides, who knows?

350
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,892
A rookie might serve as a source
of inspiration for you as well.

351
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,394
Sounds like you have someone in mind.

352
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,191
As I was reading the script,

353
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:49,488
there was this one actress
who popped right into my mind.

354
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,825
I told her to drop in to introduce herself
since she was passing by.

355
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,577
That's okay, right?

356
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,664
Excuse me, miss.

357
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,794
All right, looking great.

358
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,505
You look beautiful.

359
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,715
Now, you miss stuff.

360
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,425
You miss all sorts of things.

361
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,052
Good.

362
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,345
You look great.

363
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,680
This time, give me wistful.

364
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,141
You have a story. All sorts of stories.

365
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,894
Your dreams are inflating like a balloon.

366
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,145
What is this feeling?

367
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,688
CODE RED!

368
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,317
Now you're yellow.
You're crazy for yellow.

369
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,818
Oh my.

370
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,322
You look like a skylark today, Mi-na.
Isn't she adorable?

371
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,491
This is Hwang Mi-na.

372
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:38,578
Oh my, I'm so parched.
I should get something to drink as well.

373
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,621
What would you like?

374
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,747
A cider.

375
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,792
We'd like a cider with ice.

376
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,503
You slept together, didn't you?

377
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,004
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

378
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,298
You're sleeping together.

379
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,470
I don't know if it's love,
but you're definitely sleeping together.

380
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,222
So…

381
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,809
you want me to cast
the girl you're sleeping with

382
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,727
instead of Jeong Hee-ran?

383
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,645
And that's her?

384
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,983
She's an upcoming actress I discovered.
Please treat her with respect.

385
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,444
How dare you bang on
about spark and inspiration

386
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,407
when I've told you already
that I want to cast Jeong Hee-ran.

387
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,452
After all that time in Chungmuro,
can't you tell your ass from your elbow?

388
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,206
Director, please. I'm Ku Jung-ho,
the president of Shinsung Pictures.

389
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,124
And, miss.

390
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,543
Mi-na, was it?

391
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,796
You're just over 20 by the looks of it.

392
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,550
Why sleep with this prick?
Did he promise to make you an actress?

393
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,634
Yes.

394
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,014
I'm just a gullible bitch
who thought jerking off the producer

395
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,724
would shoot me right to stardom!

396
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,100
Hey, that's enough!

397
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,894
How the hell do you think
you're talking to the director?

398
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,938
You should be on my side, you bastard!

399
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,191
Just shut the hell up for once,
you crazy bitch.

400
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,236
Good God, you punk.

401
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,406
When are you going to grow up
and get a grip?

402
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,241
Act your age for once

403
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,619
and stop thinking with your dick,
you brainless idiot.

404
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,537
Director!

405
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,749
Man, I can't deal with these insults!

406
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:10,211
We're meeting as a producer and director,
not as high school alumni.

407
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,671
There are lines, you know!

408
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,300
That's rich, coming from you,
considering the shit show you've caused.

409
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,428
Let's stick to the facts.
This is a shit show of your own making.

410
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,722
-What?
-You should grow up and get a grip.

411
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,433
You're over 60.
Drop the foul-mouthed oddball act already!

412
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,101
Why, you little…

413
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,436
You little punk!

414
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,562
What?

415
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,149
Did you just hit me?

416
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,442
You actually hit me!

417
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,861
-You little bastard!
-Damn it!

418
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,154
I'll kill you!

419
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,161
Damn it, I swear I might just…

420
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,497
Hey, Mi-na, sit down.
Don't try to stop me.

421
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,333
-I'm not stopping you, dumbass.
-You bastard!

422
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,923
-You insolent bastard!
-For fuck's sake!

423
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,302
You just had to wake the dragon,
didn't you?

424
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,688
Hee-ran, this way.

425
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,197
Fucking hell.

426
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,786
Fuck me.

427
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,081
What the…

428
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,838
Goddamn it.

429
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,884
LUCKY SEOUL

430
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,827
What's got you down, Director Kwak?

431
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,456
Do you think I'll be happy
if I do what you do?

432
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,166
What?

433
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,878
How long does it take
to get good at this stuff?

434
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,797
This isn't something you can just learn.

435
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,007
You're born with it.

436
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,889
I actually picked this up
while playing a bartender in Lucky Seoul.

437
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:30,018
The film totally tanked,
but this bar gig earned me a lot of fans.

438
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,729
Check this out.

439
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,692
Director Kwak.

440
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,235
Heard of this one?

441
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,613
One button undone implies brightness.

442
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,406
Two, uniqueness.

443
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,658
Three, ruggedness.

444
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,660
And four buttons undone?

445
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,828
Madness.

446
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,381
Hyeok, about Madame Aema.

447
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,717
Madame…

448
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,096
About Madame Aema.

449
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,475
-We're done casting it.
-Right.

450
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,812
You should know
that production's about to ramp up.

451
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,313
I'll be in touch

452
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,775
very shortly through Gi Seok!

453
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,209
Ditch her bargain-bin look

454
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,211
and make a movie star out of her.

455
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,042
Who's that?

456
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,379
A rookie actress
who just signed with Shinsung Pictures.

457
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,839
My first time seeing her too.

458
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,144
Perfection.

459
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,948
Those are for Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

460
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,454
Mr. Goh always designs
exclusive outfits for Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

461
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,215
MADAME AEMA
PRODUCTION PRESS CONFERENCE

462
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,216
Everyone.

463
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,511
What lies beyond passion?

464
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,764
Well, it's more passion.

465
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,099
Always passion.

466
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,149
For 20 years, my passionate acting career

467
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,319
has been fueled by your love.

468
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,988
Now I, Heo Hyeok,

469
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:14,575
offer you my own love letter,
one bursting with passion.

470
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,869
Rest assured,

471
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,288
for Heo Hyeok, the stallion,

472
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,333
will take charge of Madame Aema
and lead it to success.

473
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,253
Now,

474
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,925
let me pass the mic to the goddess
I worship above everything else.

475
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,427
Ms. Hee-ran.

476
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,596
Ça va?

477
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,491
Can you give us a "Madame Aema, let's go"?

478
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,118
Madame Aema.

479
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,786
Let's go!

480
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,706
Please smile, Ms. Jeong Hee-ran.

481
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,082
All right.

482
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,170
Ms. Shin Ju-ae, please look this way.

483
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,464
-A big smile.
-You crazy bitch.

484
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,090
Please back up, Mr. Heo Hyeok.

485
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,301
Right, please look this way as well.

486
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,261
The hell are you doing, you bitch?

487
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,179
All right.

488
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,599
This time, we'd like a shot
of just the two actresses.

489
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,415
You did great up there…

490
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,097
I really didn't want

491
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,809
to waste a single breath
speaking to the likes of you…

492
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,689
But this?

493
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,234
Did you cut it lower?

494
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,573
I'm sure it's Mr. Paul's outfit,

495
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,993
but there's no way
he'd design such a tacky neckline.

496
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,037
Did you cut it yourself?

497
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:24,956
Why?

498
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,709
Were you just dying to show your breasts
to rise to stardom right away?

499
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,629
Is that why you did all this?

500
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,343
Are you worried the world won't notice
what a slut you are?

501
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,929
It's not like that.

502
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,181
I just wasn't making it work.

503
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,602
And this is your idea of making it work?

504
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,025
Paul Goh is a national treasure.

505
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,612
Do you have any idea
what it means to sully his work like this?

506
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,827
I didn't know I was sullying it.

507
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,205
I apologize.

508
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,502
But showing more cleavage
doesn't mean I'm a slut.

509
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,715
Great work. Are you headed to the office?

510
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,512
Follow me outside.

511
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,109
Goodness.

512
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,865
Get a load of this bitch.

513
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,453
Was it your doing?

514
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:48,956
Sorry?

515
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,709
Did you take that bitch
to Paul Goh's atelier?

516
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,377
Oh, you mean Ju-ae?

517
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,546
Yes, Mr. Ku told me to--

518
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,173
Get your head out of your ass.

519
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,384
Use that brain of yours
to think about who you work with.

520
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,262
You can't style her like me
and call it done.

521
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,932
Get your acts together.
You think she could pull that off?

522
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,350
Yes.

523
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,729
That bumpkin girl went
and desecrated a Paul Goh outfit

524
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,565
because you put her in clothes
way out of her league.

525
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,785
Goodness!

526
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,506
Good lord.

527
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,008
Am I the only sane one around here?

528
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,763
Jeong Hee-ran looked

529
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,140
super pretty today.

530
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,771
She's pretty.

531
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,691
She's a super pretty…

532
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,406
bitch.

533
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,701
Maybe she's pretty
because she's such a bitch.

534
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,958
Ms. Lasting Friendships!

535
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,543
Bummer.

536
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,587
You wound me.

537
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,676
Come on, don't you recognize me?
I used to be a regular.

538
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,139
Oh, here's to lasting…

539
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,765
You know?

540
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,062
I thought you were too good
to waste away on nighttime gigs,

541
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,565
and I was right!

542
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,699
Looks like I'll be sticking around
as a regular.

543
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,411
See you around,

544
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,079
Ms. Madame Aema.

545
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,667
Oh my.

546
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,007
And this guy? Is he your boyfriend?

547
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,594
Oh, here's to lasting Aema

548
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,723
Oh, here's to a happy madame…

549
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,017
Who the hell was that asshole?

550
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,061
Oh, here's to a good life

551
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,271
Yeah!

552
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,648
YEONBANG SPORTS
ENTERTAINMENT DEPT. LEAD, LEE JAE-GEON

553
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,779
MADAME AEMA
PRODUCTION PRESS CONFERENCE

554
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,947
ROOKIE ACTRESS SHIN JU-AE
TO STRIP DOWN FOR ROLE

555
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,240
What on earth did she do

556
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,993
to my clothes?

557
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,705
I have no idea. Maybe this is her way
of making a statement.

558
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,136
Climbing on a horse
is a fight to assert your dominance.

559
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,680
If the horse senses weakness,

560
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,058
it's going to try its damnedest
to get you off its back

561
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,977
the moment you hop on.

562
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,771
I've got bigger battles to fight.

563
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,773
I'm not fighting a horse as well.

564
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,194
What's its name?

565
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:48,737
Thunder.

566
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,577
We'll work things out between ourselves.

567
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,871
I thought you'd never ridden
a horse before.

568
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,788
I haven't.

569
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,461
But we need to get to know each other,

570
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,672
so we should break the ice first.

571
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,230
Did you know?

572
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,151
Sharing good food brings people together.

573
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,445
That's what family's all about.

574
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,077
Hello.

575
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,960
Let's go, Thunder!

576
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,547
Giddyap!

577
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,591
Giddyap!

578
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,509
REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS

579
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,677
-What is this?
-What do you think?

580
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,264
It means they've butchered our script
before we've even started filming.

581
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,518
We need to send a memorandum
agreeing to the script edits they require.

582
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,186
Come over here and stamp it.

583
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,358
For fuck's sake.
It's not like we're students.

584
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,487
"Upon reviewing the contents of the script
submitted for Madame Aema,

585
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,990
we have concluded
the following issues need to be revised…"

586
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,662
INAPPROPRIATE SUBJECT MATTERS
FOUND IN SCRIPT, TOTAL 36

587
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,830
They want us to fix 36 things?

588
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,667
I said we'll submit
the revised script later.

589
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,710
Filming is right around the corner.

590
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,464
Start by filming the scenes
they're not making us fix.

591
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,050
What's this about
starting with certain scenes?

592
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,513
They want us to make
a whopping 36 changes to the script.

593
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,645
I thought the new government was fostering
the film industry in this new age.

594
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,814
3S, my ass. Goddamn it.

595
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,316
How is this any different
from the Fourth Republic?

596
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,028
For fuck's sake!

597
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,323
None of this would have happened
if we had just gone with my draft!

598
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,409
Take a good hard look.

599
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,246
About half the stuff they pointed out
came from the parts you wrote.

600
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,257
I mean, what's wrong with a sausage?

601
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,968
How is having a sausage in a film
too vulgar?

602
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,138
Are they, what,
afraid she might do it with a sausage?

603
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,139
I mean, come on!

604
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,975
What's wrong with a horse? A damn horse!

605
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,728
She loves horses.
What's inappropriate about that?

606
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,731
What's so obscene
about a madame who simply loves horses?

607
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,190
If that's obscene,

608
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,320
one could argue bald heads are obscene
since they look like the tip of a penis.

609
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,404
Mr. President,

610
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,281
your noggin is too obscene!

611
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,241
What the hell is wrong with people?

612
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,036
Do they think she'll do it with a sausage
and then a horse?

613
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,665
Horse cocks are a tad big.
Maybe that's what they're getting at.

614
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,627
What are you even saying?

615
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,839
I'm trying to make sense of this,
just like you!

616
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,842
Then what do you want to do?
Rally against unjust censorship?

617
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,304
Wanna be dragged to the Namsan CIA?
You're not the only one who's mad.

618
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,806
I'm just as humiliated
and angry as you are.

619
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,642
Did you read the last line?

620
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,102
"No direct exposure
of breasts or naked flesh."

621
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,313
We can't film the breasts!
No tits, damn it!

622
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,111
"The direct exposure

623
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,031
of a woman's breasts is forbidden."

624
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,580
No way in hell.

625
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,707
Oh no.

626
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,084
I'm going to

627
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,294
have us bare breasts.

628
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:37,341
I'm going to flash breasts in every scene
and turn my life around.

629
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,177
Let's not go there, okay?

630
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,013
We're in the same boat now.

631
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,141
You know what? Think positively.

632
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,144
You wanted to do something subtle.

633
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,814
You can make it as subtle as you want now.

634
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:55,943
You could have
no breasts exposed directly,

635
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,904
but instead, just like you wanted,
imply their exposure subtly.

636
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,531
Make it as good as

637
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,367
having them exposed directly.

638
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,462
Breasts this, breasts that.
You and your breasts!

639
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:20,092
That's what you get for turning my script
into an absolute tit-fest! Happy now?

640
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,387
I'm out!

641
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,305
I really

642
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,558
can't work like this.

643
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,476
Find yourself another director.

644
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,707
They can take everything else from me,
but I won't change the title.

645
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,300
Maybe instead,

646
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,844
we use an alternate meaning of "ma."

647
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:07,890
"Ma" meaning "to add," not "horse"?
At least it sounds the same.

648
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,727
Then again, that doesn't fit
the premise of our film.

649
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,271
Personally, I like this version.

650
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,149
I'm a fan of this "ma."

651
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,110
Madame Aema,
she who loves while using profanities.

652
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,197
In English, she would be
Madame "I Love You, Fuck You."

653
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,283
Fuck yeah! Madame "I Love You, Fuck You!"

654
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,078
Not this.

655
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,497
Okay.

656
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,230
Okay, so that's the character "ma"
for "hemp"

657
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,732
and "ae" as in "to love."

658
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,070
So what does this even mean?

659
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,822
A married woman

660
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,281
who loves marijuana?

661
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,828
Madame Weed?

662
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,122
Mrs. Weed.

663
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,794
At least it looks like
we can keep the title.

664
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,630
MADAME AEMA

665
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,764
God.

666
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,650
All right!

667
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,704
Hee-ran, it's Yeong-bae.

668
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,831
Don't hang up, please! Please don't--

669
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,677
Hee-ran, please.

670
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,679
This is really bad, okay?

671
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:14,016
This better be serious news,
or I'm going to kill you.

672
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,601
Last night, Heo Hyeok

673
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:19,938
drove his motorcycle into
an oncoming vehicle and flew 50 meters.

674
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,441
And filming is right around the corner!

675
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,483
By the looks of it,

676
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,821
Madame Aema might not even
be able to start filming!

677
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,576
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION

678
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,954
INSPIRED BY THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
IN MAKING THE 1982 FILM "MADAME AEMA"

00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,415
ALL CHARACTERS AND STORYLINES
HAVE BEEN CREATED

00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,626
