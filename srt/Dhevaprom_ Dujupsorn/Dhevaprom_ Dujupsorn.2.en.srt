1
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,720
We only have interviews
with PR candidates.

2
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,240
You're not required to be there.

3
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Hello, I'm Dujupsorn Trinathy.

4
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,639
And you are?

5
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,040
Asira.

6
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,480
Asira Jutathep.

7
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,880
Jutathep.

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,720
I visited Great-Grandma Orn.

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,920
I heard she wasn't doing well.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,240
Why did she suddenly fall sick?

11
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,880
I think it's time
we take care of this properly.

12
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
It's strange

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,560
that we haven't been able to locate Rumpa.

14
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,480
If finding Rumpa will make things better.

15
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,160
Petch, bring Vilairumpa to me, all right?

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
Perfect.

17
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,880
This is the first year
we've had our own PR team.

18
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,120
We previously used an agency.

19
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,880
I think PR is as important as marketing.

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,560
Dujupsorn, you'll have Nuengruetai

21
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,760
and Pichaya on your team.

22
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm Nueng, a PR graduate.
I worked at reception previously.

23
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm Prissy, a journalism graduate,
but I have a passion for PR work.

24
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,480
Nice to meet you both.

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

26
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,600
By the way,

27
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,080
I'll put the PR Department
close to my office.

28
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,280
You see, we'll be working
on new projects this year,

29
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,840
so I want to have your team close by

30
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,360
as my source of comfort.

31
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,400
That sounds a little weird.

32
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,960
Doesn't it?

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
I didn't see that coming.

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,680
Anyway, I hope you all

35
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,800
enjoy working here.

36
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,960
Thank you.

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,280
Thank you so much, sir.

38
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
You are free to go now.

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Thank you.

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,760
-Fah, let's go. Come on.
-Okay.

41
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
Fah.

42
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,280
Listen.

43
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm telling you.

44
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,400
There were sparks flying

45
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
all over the room just now.

46
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,240
Not only that,

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,440
the smell of flowers was everywhere.

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Is there something wrong with that?

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,760
Fah.

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,040
Of course it's wrong.
It's completely wrong.

51
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,800
I can confirm that

52
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,800
our boss is into you.

53
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,280
-No doubt.
-Definitely.

54
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,920
What are these folders, Kanlaya?

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
They're empty folders.

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,560
-I'm giving them to you because--
-They're for the materials

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,120
you'll be presenting
the day after tomorrow.

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
This is urgent because--

59
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,360
We're delivering the project
in Sukhumvit 24 soon.

60
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,080
Looksorn.

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm sorry, ma'am. I wanted to help.

62
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,040
Why did you schedule
the presentation so early?

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
No problem.

64
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,040
See you at the presentation.

65
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,720
-Good--
-Great, Dujupsorn.

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,440
Let's go, ma'am. We're done here.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,040
-I'll leave--
-We'll leave this to you.

68
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,960
I hope that you, with your degree
from overseas, won't disappoint us.

69
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,840
Keep your expectations high.
We'll meet them.

70
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
Let's go.

71
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
They're obviously messing with us.

72
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,720
Exactly. They're like
the villains in a soap opera.

73
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,640
Hey.

74
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
That means I'm the female lead then.

75
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
-My gosh.
-My gosh. Fah.

76
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,240
Which character are you then?

77
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,680
Well, I'm Photchaman.

78
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,760
-My gosh!
-Photchaman.

79
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,200
-You're so pretty.
-That suits you.

80
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,480
And given my look, I'm definitely…

81
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,720
Justice Pao, right? You have his eyes.

82
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,840
You do.

83
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,520
The character suits her,
right, Fah? Photchaman.

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,200
-You need something here too.
-Exactly.

85
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,720
-Prissy.
-Yes, Fah?

86
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,920
-This one.
-This one, right?

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,280
Okay, thank you.

88
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,880
All set?

89
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,800
-Yes.
-All right.

90
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,240
How may I help you, sir?

91
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to visit our site in Sukhumvit.

92
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,040
I see. I hope you have a safe trip, sir.

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,880
Do you want to come?

94
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,560
What?

95
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,600
You won't have a clear picture of it
just by reading the plans.

96
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,480
You should visit the actual site.

97
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,840
You're right.

98
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,240
In that case, I'll go with you.

99
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,440
Okay.

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Thank you.

101
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,360
As I said, you needn't waste your time
reading all the blurb.

102
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't forget you're with the owner.

103
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,680
I've overseen this project from the start.

104
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,160
Ask me if you have any questions.

105
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
How can I bother you with my questions?

106
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,080
Don't ask too many questions then.

107
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,960
If you're not sure about anything,
frown, and I'll explain it.

108
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,120
There we go.

109
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,400
I'll explain as soon as you frown.

110
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,760
How will you know
what I want to ask about?

111
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,400
Well, I think I know.

112
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,680
We've only met twice.

113
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,880
Three times.

114
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,240
We also met two years ago.

115
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,520
This way.

116
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,400
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

117
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,160
-Hello.
-I want to look at a show unit.

118
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,760
-Sure. This way, please.
-No, it's okay.

119
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,200
You can continue with your work.
I'll check it out myself.

120
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,520
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

121
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,400
Goodness.

122
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,440
It's beautiful, sir.

123
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,760
There's no one else here.
Just call me Petch.

124
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,160
Be my guest.
If you're not sure about anything,

125
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,160
just frown

126
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,720
and I'll explain it.

127
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,640
Based on the plans and documents,
I knew it was going to be spacious,

128
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,160
but seeing it in person,
it seems so much bigger.

129
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,040
Actually, it's not that big,

130
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,320
but we make sure it's airy.

131
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,200
We also install mirrors in some places
to make it appear bigger.

132
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,560
This is the small bedroom.

133
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,280
Okay.

134
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,560
And this room

135
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,720
is the master bedroom
with an ensuite bathroom.

136
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,080
It's suitable…

137
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
for a married couple.

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
We consulted a feng shui master

139
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
and have the bed facing
an auspicious direction.

140
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Are you interested in this too?

141
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,760
My interest doesn't matter,
but believe me,

142
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,840
our customers are more interested in this
than the direction of sunlight.

143
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,040
It's so beautiful.

144
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,320
You can see the communal area from here.

145
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,280
It's so green.

146
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,760
I made the communal area bigger
to accommodate more trees.

147
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,720
We want to make JT a model
for green real estate companies,

148
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,600
as we make a profit
at the expense of the environment

149
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,360
with pollution from construction
and transportation of materials.

150
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,880
We have benefitted from society,

151
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
so we should do something in return.

152
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,640
So cool.

153
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,040
How do you feel after seeing this room?

154
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
I want it.

155
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,600
How many do you want?

156
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,560
Why don't you spend
some time here as if it's your own?

157
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
What?

158
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,440
I believe you must know
something well to be able to sell it.

159
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,840
Why don't you spend some time here?

160
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,320
Imagine it's your own place.

161
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,960
Feel free to do whatever you want
or touch whatever you want.

162
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,960
And what about you?

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,120
I'll be here, but I won't bother you.

164
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,840
Think of me as part of the furniture.

165
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,320
Or if you don't mind,

166
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,960
you could think of me
as the co-owner of this apartment.

167
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,840
Make yourself at home.

168
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,560
Act as if I live here?

169
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,080
Which character should I be then?

170
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,280
I should be a beautiful
and fabulous female lead.

171
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm coming for you, Mr. Leading Man.

172
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,520
Oh, you're home, are you?

173
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Have some water.

174
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,920
The weather is nice today, isn't it?

175
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Did you sleep well last night?

176
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
What?

177
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I mean, did you sleep well

178
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,640
after we spoke last night?

179
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,280
I always sleep well

180
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,200
if it doesn't rain.

181
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,240
Are you scared of it?

182
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Yes.

183
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,480
I don't like it at all.

184
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
Aren't they pretty?

185
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,200
You like flowers.

186
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,520
I bet you have vases of flowers
all over your house.

187
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,320
I don't.

188
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,320
It's a little extravagant for me.

189
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,560
If you're not in a hurry,
would you mind if I--

190
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,520
I'm not. Please take your time.

191
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,560
Dad.

192
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,040
Please don't die.

193
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,440
Dad.

194
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,320
Mom!

195
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,680
Mom, please help Dad!

196
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,600
Please take him to a doctor!

197
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,800
Mom! Please help Dad!

198
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,200
Mom, don't go yet! Please help him!

199
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,400
No!

200
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,320
Are you okay?

201
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes, I'm okay.

202
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,760
You've been quiet
since we were in the apartment.

203
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,680
Are you sure you're all right?

204
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,360
I was just thinking

205
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,040
about how I should promote the place.

206
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
So what did
the owner of the apartment say?

207
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,080
The house owner.

208
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,280
It might be a condo,

209
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,040
but it felt like home.

210
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Spacious yet warm.

211
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,840
Convenient yet peaceful.

212
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,320
It's very close to the city.

213
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,120
I also felt peaceful there
as if I were home.

214
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,160
I like this.

215
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
Mr. Petch, do you need
to stop anywhere on the way

216
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,920
to the office tomorrow?

217
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,720
Let's leave at the usual time, Suchart.

218
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm done for today.
You can go get some rest.

219
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,000
Thank you, sir.

220
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,480
You look very cheerful today.

221
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,400
Really?

222
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,080
But I'm always like this.

223
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,840
No, you're not, sir.

224
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,400
It has been a long while
since I've seen you smile like this.

225
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,360
I guess something good happened.

226
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,320
Dad.

227
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,760
Well…

228
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,200
Well, excuse me.

229
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,000
So?

230
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,680
What is it

231
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,440
that made a serious guy like you smile?

232
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,680
Well?

233
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,320
Do you want to tell me about it

234
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,240
or should your mom look into it?

235
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,720
Is Mom aware of this?

236
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,160
She must be making plans
with Ked right now.

237
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,600
So? Who did you meet?

238
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,360
Who?

239
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,280
Petch.

240
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,080
I want you both to give me time.

241
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll tell you
as soon as I'm sure about it.

242
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,040
This means you found someone
you like, right? Is it serious?

243
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,840
Can I ask you something?

244
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,080
You're not answering my question.

245
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,880
So what do you want to ask me?

246
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,480
Did you fall for Mom

247
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,840
at first sight?

248
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,200
Of course.

249
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,400
Were you serious about her?

250
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Of course.

251
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,880
So why did you almost give up on her?

252
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,240
Petch.

253
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,120
I'm really curious, Dad.

254
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,160
I don't understand why you would let go

255
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,400
of the person you really liked.

256
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,360
This means

257
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,800
this person could be the one.

258
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,960
My gut tells me so.

259
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
I really want to know

260
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,160
what made you willing
to sacrifice so much.

261
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,400
There was a promise
made to the Dhevaproms.

262
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,720
This promise again.

263
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,720
You all seem to take it very seriously.

264
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,360
People of your great-grandma's generation
value promises over all else.

265
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,160
But actually,

266
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
the elders only asked

267
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,160
just one from each
of our families to marry each other.

268
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,800
And it shouldn't have been a problem
because there were five of us.

269
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,600
Besides…

270
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,760
Besides?

271
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,920
Ked was very nice

272
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
and kind.

273
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,200
But…

274
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,120
I didn't think of her that way.

275
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,920
But why did you agree?

276
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,400
Back then,

277
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,320
your uncles and I didn't agree
with the promise at all.

278
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,520
We were completely opposed to it,

279
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,920
especially your Uncle Phee.

280
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,080
But I thought

281
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,640
things would be over
if I married a Dhevaprom.

282
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,680
But in the end,

283
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
love worked its magic.

284
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,400
I don't think it was love.

285
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,840
It was Mr. Chinnakorn.

286
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,880
And if you were me,
what would you have done?

287
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,160
If I were you,

288
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,200
I'd never have let go
of the person I loved.

289
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,680
Be careful.

290
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,960
You might have to go through
what I went through,

291
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,440
as you're also the eldest son.

292
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,400
I'll never fall for the same woman
as my cousins, Dad.

293
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,480
So,

294
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,840
how is the person
you have eyes for right now?

295
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,840
She's an angel.

296
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,680
And she's still a secret.

297
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,760
No, it's not okay, Petch.

298
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,440
Cheers.

299
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
You sure are tight-lipped.

300
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,280
-My gosh!
-Goodness gracious.

301
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,840
-Hello, Nus.
-Hi, dear.

302
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,640
This is from our boss.

303
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,360
-Thank you.
-No worries.

304
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,520
Is today a special day?

305
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,120
Well, it's very special

306
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,600
because he suddenly wanted

307
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,120
to give flowers to all of us.

308
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,200
I predict

309
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,600
it will rain cats and dogs today,
so make sure you go home right after work.

310
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,160
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

311
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
-Nus.
-Yes?

312
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
You know what?

313
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,600
This…

314
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,280
Oh dear.

315
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,240
-This is my first bouquet ever.
-Okay.

316
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,600
-Really? Goodness.
-Yes.

317
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
-Poor you.
-It's true.

318
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,200
We should take a picture and frame it.

319
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,160
-Absolutely. Do you have a camera?
-Yes.

320
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,760
-Hurry up.
-Just a second.

321
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,480
-Come on.
-Hey, are you serious?

322
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Goodness.

323
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,000
What about yours, Nus?

324
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,840
I don't get one.

325
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,040
It was me who had to order them.

326
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,880
That's right.

327
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,840
Yesterday afternoon,
the boss called me and said,

328
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,640
"Nus, I want to give everyone flowers."

329
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,480
And he got into all the details

330
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,480
about the kinds of flowers

331
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,000
and the color

332
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,160
and arrangement. What's he like?

333
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,440
I wonder what happened to him.

334
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,680
Nus.

335
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,680
I need your help with something.

336
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,480
-Vit!
-Hey!

337
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Dad.

338
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,160
You scared me to death.

339
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,560
Aren't you going to work today?

340
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,440
-Of course I am.
-What time?

341
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,840
I'll leave once I've finished my coffee.

342
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
Gosh, you brat.

343
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,920
Dad,

344
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,880
please talk to me nicely.

345
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,600
Parents' words are children's blessings.

346
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,480
I already gave my blessings
to Lisa this morning,

347
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
because she left for work on time.

348
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,200
She deserved them.

349
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,680
Dad, even though I'm late for work,

350
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
I'll still fulfill my duties,

351
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,200
which are to maintain good relations
with our partners.

352
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,960
Or would you rather send Lisa?

353
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,760
Partners or sex partners?

354
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
You always look put together.

355
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,920
Hello, Mr. Chavit.

356
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Thank you.

357
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,720
He's here alone tonight.

358
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,840
My gosh.

359
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,800
Hello, Chavit.

360
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,720
-Are you here alone?
-Hello.

361
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,960
That's right.

362
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,080
Can we join you?

363
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,200
We don't have a table yet.

364
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,520
Gosh, Dad.

365
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,480
It's a bit early for that kind of talk.

366
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,760
Dad!

367
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,320
There's no need to flinch.

368
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,360
I won't hurt my hand by hitting you.

369
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,280
I have made a decision.

370
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,160
About what?

371
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm going to step down

372
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,160
and leave everything
to Lisa and Cheewa to take care of.

373
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,600
Dad.

374
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,160
I think you missed a name.

375
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
No, I got everyone.

376
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,320
Dad, you can't do this to me.
I've also helped with our business.

377
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,800
How can I trust someone
who isn't honest in his relationships

378
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,400
to watch over my business?

379
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,480
What does that have to do with anything?

380
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
A lot.

381
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,200
Honesty can be easily challenged.

382
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,160
You go out with many women at once.

383
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,880
This shows you lack integrity.

384
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,680
I can't trust

385
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,160
someone like you.

386
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,120
Dad, I'm not that kind of person.

387
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,040
I go out with many at once
because I haven't met the right person.

388
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,680
How greedy.

389
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,240
Dad, you can't do this to me.

390
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,280
Fine.

391
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,160
Since you're my son,

392
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,960
I'll give you a chance.

393
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,440
But on one condition.

394
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,960
Please tell me.

395
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,680
This year.

396
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,760
This year?

397
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,160
Sure, just tell me
how much sales so you want.

398
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
You must get married this year.

399
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,840
Dad!

400
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,320
Hold on, Dad.

401
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,480
It's an inheritance renunciation contract.

402
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,840
CONTRACT

403
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,280
If you don't get married this year,

404
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,640
you'll get absolutely nothing.

405
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
All right.

406
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,280
Sign it.

407
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,280
Are you kidding me?

408
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,520
Well, get married

409
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,120
if you want the inheritance. Sign it.

410
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,840
-Dad.
-Hey.

411
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,520
Will you sign it or not?

412
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,920
Or don't you want anything?

413
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,600
Do you want it or not?

414
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm signing it now.

415
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,040
Mr. Korn.

416
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,880
He's so cool.

417
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,040
Cool, my ass.

418
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,920
He's obviously henpecked by his wife.

419
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,960
Isn't his wife your mom?

420
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,080
You're right.

421
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,440
He only loves Mom.

422
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Even when she's just
a little sad or worried,

423
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,920
he does anything she wants.

424
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,120
If you were just a little faithful
like your dad,

425
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
you wouldn't have to worry about this.

426
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,080
I am,

427
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,000
but I just…

428
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,160
Just what?

429
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,480
Just haven't found the right person?

430
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,080
You've gone out
with half of the women in Bangkok.

431
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,880
Not to mention Boston and London.
If you still can't find one,

432
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,000
then just give up.

433
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,520
It's not that I haven't found one,

434
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,080
but the person is…

435
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,120
Don't tell me it's Ploy.

436
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,840
What do you think, brother?

437
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,720
No. Stay away.

438
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,680
-Petch.
-What's with you?

439
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,920
Petch.

440
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,640
-Hey.
-Go away.

441
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
If you could,

442
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,600
-who would you choose?
-Mr. Chavit.

443
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,560
-Why?
-Well,

444
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,240
the boss might make me work on holidays.

445
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Are you crazy?

446
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,400
-Petch, brother.
-Go away.

447
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,320
I'm not your brother.

448
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,200
Okay, Mr. Chavit it is.

449
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,320
I'm serious, Petch.

450
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,920
Ploy

451
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,360
was my first love
and has always been the only one.

452
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,320
If I imagine myself getting married,

453
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,880
I can only see her as my bride.

454
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
But you're a player.

455
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,280
Ploy will surely refuse you.

456
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,560
Why are you so protective over her?

457
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
I'm not.

458
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm just telling you
that my sister is smart.

459
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,440
You…

460
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,840
Hold on.

461
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,120
Are you really not protective?

462
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,680
It's up to Ploy.

463
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
If she chooses you,
that means she has thought it through.

464
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,720
Petch.

465
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,880
No. Go away.

466
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,720
You must help me.

467
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,480
First of all, you must improve yourself.

468
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,040
If you hurt Ploy,

469
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,000
I'll buy your family's company
and kick you out.

470
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,199
Got it?

471
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,400
You have my word.

472
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
For Ploy,

473
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,719
I'm prepared to give it all up.

474
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,679
Okay.

475
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,560
See? If we picked Mr. Chavit,

476
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,679
we'd have power over our boss
as his brother-in-law.

477
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
-You're right.
-Yes.

478
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,159
What do you mean?

479
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Ms. Chalisa,

480
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,080
Mr. Chavit's sister,

481
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,520
is rumored to be paired up

482
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,200
with our boss by their families.

483
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
He's also very good-looking.

484
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,320
He looked good the other day.

485
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,200
Saruch.

486
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,360
Hey, Lisa.

487
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,160
Hello.

488
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,880
Hello.

489
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,840
Are you here to see Petch?

490
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,320
Yes, I'm here to discuss
more ideas with him

491
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,920
and show him my past projects.

492
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,520
I know your work is awesome.

493
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,080
He'll definitely like it. I like it too.

494
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,920
Do you like my work?

495
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
Yes.

496
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
I like your work.

497
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,600
If you design Petch's condos,
I'm sure they'll sell well.

498
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,840
Thank you for your encouragement.

499
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,480
So, is your office also in this building?

500
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
Yes, but on a different floor to Petch.

501
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,360
That's great. We can meet often.

502
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,800
Shall we go upstairs together?

503
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,840
Yes.

504
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay, after you.

505
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
Mr. Saruch is here, sir.

506
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,840
Please show him in.

507
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,080
This way, sir.

508
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,840
Hello.

509
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,400
Hey.

510
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,320
Who's that? You look kind of familiar.

511
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
Hold on. Could it be that

512
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,280
you sneaked in here to see
this bastard without telling me?

513
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,160
Come on. Are you calling me a bastard?

514
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
Don't change the subject.

515
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,120
There's something going on
between you two, isn't there?

516
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,760
Lisa came to see Ploy.

517
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,160
Really?

518
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,560
That's great. Let's go together.

519
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,000
Didn't you tell Ploy you were coming?

520
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,880
Is she not here?

521
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,920
No.

522
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,240
What? I must have misunderstood.
In that case,

523
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,120
I'll get going.

524
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,040
Lisa.

525
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,280
Why don't you stay
and help me look at Saruch's work?

526
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,320
Won't I bother you?

527
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,040
Not at all.

528
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,600
You're so well-mannered,

529
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,360
unlike your brother.

530
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm so sorry, Petch.

531
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,480
Our parents taught us well,

532
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,040
but Vit didn't listen.

533
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,160
What?

534
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,440
Where is your work, Saruch?

535
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,320
-Come, let's have a look at it now.
-Okay.

536
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,680
Come on.

537
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,480
-Take a seat.
-Thank you.

538
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,720
See? She came to see him.

539
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,480
Gosh, they're smiling at each other.

540
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,960
Gosh, Vit.

541
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,440
That's enough. I'm begging you.

542
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,160
What do we do?

543
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,440
Let's take the elevator.

544
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,520
It's not a downspout.

545
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,200
Really, it's a downspout.

546
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,440
Sir.

547
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,960
I think you should go home, Fah.

548
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,080
It's dangerous to be here alone.

549
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,040
Don't you trust
your company's security system?

550
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,840
I don't trust anything completely.

551
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,000
But even if it's safe here,

552
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
you still have to travel far to get home.

553
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,960
Let's go. I'll take you home.

554
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,320
It's okay.

555
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,160
You took me home yesterday.

556
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,360
I don't want to put you out.

557
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,200
It's long past office hours.

558
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,440
You can drop the formalities.

559
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,600
Thank you for your kindness, sir,

560
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,000
but please let me go home by myself.

561
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,280
Okay,

562
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,920
but you must leave now.

563
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,080
I'm worried about you.

564
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Yes, sir.

565
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,320
Okay.

566
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,840
I'll get going then.

567
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,880
PORN THAI DESSERTS

568
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
-Take one, sir.
-Okay.

569
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,440
I'm home.

570
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,400
Oh, Ms. Fah is back.

571
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,960
Mr. Petch has been having desserts
waiting for you.

572
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,520
Come sit and talk to him.

573
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,440
I need to check the oven.

574
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,480
You're so stubborn.

575
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,720
You're the most stubborn person
I have ever met.

576
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,000
How am I stubborn?

577
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,080
I let you come back home
by yourself as you wanted.

578
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,400
How am I stubborn?

579
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,440
But you came to wait for me here?

580
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That's not true.

581
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,880
For your information, I'm a regular here.

582
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
What?

583
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,840
Is this true, Cham?

584
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,920
That's right. Mr. Petch
has been coming to eat our cha mongkut

585
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,440
for about two years already.

586
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,280
But I just learned today
that he's your boss.

587
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,680
Oh dear, let me check the stove

588
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,920
before things burn.

589
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,560
Would you like some?
It can freshen you up.

590
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,840
Why are you being so obedient now?

591
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,160
I'm too lazy to argue with you.

592
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,960
I won't win anyway.

593
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,520
Okay.

594
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,480
Have some water.

595
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,240
Thank you.

596
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,960
When I was small,
whenever I was surprised or worried,

597
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,760
my mom would make me drink water.

598
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,160
Does it help?

599
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Actually, no.
But it helps divert your attention.

600
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,760
You seemed worried
about something just now.

601
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,160
Why don't you have some water?

602
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,240
Can I hide anything from you?

603
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,680
Please don't do that.

604
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,960
I don't like secrecy.

605
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,560
Things will be easier if we're honest.

606
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,560
But you lied about being
a regular customer at our shop.

607
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,160
I didn't.

608
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,040
I was waiting
for the right time to tell you.

609
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,480
I really like your cha mongkut.

610
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,480
But you were right.

611
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,880
I came here to see you.

612
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,320
But I went to study abroad,
so we didn't meet.

613
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,920
It's just like a soap opera, isn't it?

614
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,120
In soap operas,

615
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,040
the male and female protagonists
end up together.

616
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,720
But male protagonists do die sometimes.

617
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,480
It's not easy to get
a happy ending in real life.

618
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,640
Someone told me we'll get it eventually.

619
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,680
I really can't argue with you.

620
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,240
All right.

621
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,800
Let's try this.

622
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,760
What year is it?

623
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,240
It's 1994.

624
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,800
Well then, in 2024, or 30 years from now,

625
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,560
let's see if we're happy then.

626
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,040
You can argue with me if we're not.

627
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,240
Are we going to argue
with each other for another 30 years?

628
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,560
I wouldn't mind that.

629
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,560
Are you going to employ me
as a PR for another 30 years?

630
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,920
Well, we should have become

631
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,360
something else by then.

632
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,360
Saved by the bell.

633
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,640
Hello, Porn Thai Desserts.

634
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,680
You would like to make an order?
Sure, please wait a second.

635
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,960
Yes, what would you like?

636
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,960
Sure. All right. Okay.

637
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,520
Get home safely.

638
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,520
Okay.

639
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,640
I wanted to ask you something.

640
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,360
Besides a home phone number,

641
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,480
do you have any other number?
A pager number, for example.

642
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,640
I do.

643
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,280
My work number.
I thought you were aware of that.

644
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,960
Okay.

645
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,640
See you tomorrow.

646
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,440
Okay.

647
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,920
You should go inside.

648
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,600
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

649
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,720
Good night.

650
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,400
Thank you.

651
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,560
I'll get going.

652
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,440
Mom.

653
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,880
Mom.

654
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,400
Let's start with this room.

655
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,600
-The material.
-Fah, I think we should add some flowers

656
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,480
-to make it
-Fresh.

657
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,840
-more lively.
-Sure.

658
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,960
Fah, this is the material
for the bathroom.

659
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,040
I hope you're ready for tomorrow.

660
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,080
We are. Please don't worry.

661
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,920
You see, you keep visiting us.

662
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,480
Are you afraid we're lonely?

663
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,440
Hey, I'm not your friend.

664
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,960
I'm here

665
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,920
to warn you that
the executives won't be there tomorrow.

666
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,920
The person who will decide
whether to give you a pass or not

667
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,640
is me.

668
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,920
You won't be as lucky
as you were in the interview.

669
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,480
Noted.

670
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,400
Thank you for the warning.

671
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,840
He may favor you, but that doesn't mean
you can do anything you want.

672
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,160
Please make way.

673
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,120
Hey, please make way.

674
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,720
Hold on.

675
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,640
Why are you gathering here?

676
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,720
Why are you not standing around
in your own department?

677
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,160
-You're right.
-Right?

678
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,360
All right, here are your pagers.

679
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,760
The boss asked me
to buy them for your team.

680
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,640
-Really? We got a pager!
-My gosh.

681
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,800
-My gosh! Hey, it's the latest model.
-My goodness!

682
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,080
-The latest model!
-My gosh!

683
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,560
A pager!

684
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,080
It'll make it easier for us
to contact you.

685
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,000
Otherwise, we won't be able
to get hold of you.

686
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,680
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

687
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,400
He's so kind.

688
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,560
Look.

689
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,560
It's the latest model.

690
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,920
It's for the PR team only.

691
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,040
Too much.

692
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,160
He doesn't just favor her,

693
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,440
he favors her very much.

694
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,880
Gosh, look at you smiling from ear to ear.

695
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,480
Let's go.

696
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,120
Looksorn.

697
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,920
-Not for you.
-Ma'am, I want one too.

698
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,720
Besides a home phone number,

699
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,000
do you have any other number?
A pager number, for example.

700
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,040
Your coffee, sir.

701
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,320
Thank you so much, Nus.

702
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,920
I have to say
that was quite an investment.

703
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,280
Can you tell?

704
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,200
I could tell since the flowers.

705
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,960
That's why you've been with me so long.

706
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,840
And I'll be here for a long time to come.

707
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,680
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

708
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,040
All right, you can come in.

709
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,760
Gosh.

710
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,040
I…

711
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,360
My team and I would like
to thank you for these pagers

712
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,960
that will facilitate our work.

713
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,160
No worries.

714
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,240
And I would like

715
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,240
to thank you for the pager, sir.

716
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,640
I promise that I'll make JT

717
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,000
famous,

718
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,080
great,

719
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,520
and mighty! Thank you!

720
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,840
As for me,

721
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,280
I promise to do my very best for JT.

722
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,560
Thank you.

723
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,320
Goodness.

724
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,400
I hope they can help you with your work.

725
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,880
I believe presenting
the positive aspects of our company

726
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,760
or handling news strategically

727
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,720
are just as important
as building quality residences.

728
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,360
So, from now on,

729
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,640
I'm counting on you all.

730
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,880
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

731
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,520
Thank you, sir.

732
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,800
Fah,

733
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,000
please stay.

734
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,560
Please excuse me.

735
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,080
Who is calling?

736
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,400
So, how is everything?

737
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,800
Are you all set
for tomorrow's presentation?

738
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,520
Almost, sir. Would you like
to have a look at it first?

739
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,840
It's okay. I trust your team.

740
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,120
But I want you to be prepared,

741
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,360
because I won't be
at the meeting tomorrow.

742
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,840
I'll only get to see it
at the board meeting.

743
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,280
I hope it'll get to the board meeting.

744
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
It will.

745
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,040
I believe in you.

746
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,280
Thank you once again for the pager.

747
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,480
Actually, it's too much.

748
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,840
I knew you would feel bad.

749
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,480
I even thought about what I would do
if you didn't accept it.

750
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,200
What would you do?

751
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,960
I'd give you a mobile phone instead.

752
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,800
A pager is good enough, sir.

753
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,240
Well then…

754
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
Sir, something urgent has come up.

755
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,760
What is it?

756
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,640
Well…

757
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,920
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

758
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,800
Sir, M.R. Tharathorn's secretary
informed me

759
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,680
that he's on his way here.

760
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,320
-Dad?
-Yes, sir.

761
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,880
He's coming with M.R. Ronnaphee.

762
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,480
Fah, your family called and said
something urgent came up.

763
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,280
I'm putting you through.

764
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,800
It's Fah speaking.

765
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,320
Mom has gone missing?

766
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,680
Fah.

767
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,440
I'm sorry.

768
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,840
MAY THOSE WHO BROKE THE PROMISE

769
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,440
MADE TO US, THE DHEVAPROMS,
BE DOOMED.

770
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,760
Is anyone there? Get the car ready.

771
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,760
Get the car ready.
I'm going to see Vilairumpa.

772
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,520
The sender seems to be playing
mind games with your great-grandma

773
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,760
to confuse her, scare her,
and make her paranoid.

774
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,000
Did she send another letter?

775
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,280
Did it get to Great-Grandma?

776
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,040
No,

777
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,760
Jaew received it and gave it to me first.

778
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,000
It was sent from Bangkok
this time, not Chiang Mai.

779
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,440
Jak told me you wanted
to handle this yourself.

780
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,360
Have you thought this through?

781
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,320
Yes.

782
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,720
Once I have found Ms. Vilairumpa,
I will decide

783
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,760
whether we should let her see
Great-Grandma Orn.

784
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,640
If we find Rumpa,

785
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,720
let me talk to her.

786
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,640
Given this letter,

787
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,560
Rumpa may be in Bangkok

788
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,440
and not far from us.

789
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,720
Who is it?

790
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,200
Vilairumpa.

791
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,560
I'm back, Dad.

792
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
This place is rather run down.

793
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,960
Rumpa,

794
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,800
have you come back to be with me?

795
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,840
Rumpa,

796
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,200
you have forgiven me, right?

797
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,680
Didn't Maratee just return?

798
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,240
Did you ask her

799
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,560
to come back and live with you?

800
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,920
Who would want to stay here?

801
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,560
Look.

802
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,840
It's in such a state.

803
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,920
Oh, right.

804
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,080
I heard Maratee's daughter

805
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,920
is marrying Pat's son. Isn't that right?

806
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,960
When I heard about it,

807
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,120
I wanted to throw up.

808
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,760
Rumpa.

809
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,760
Back then,

810
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,440
she acted as if she was so mad at them.

811
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,160
That family ruined her reputation.

812
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,640
But deep down,

813
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,600
she still hoped to be with Pat.

814
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,120
Fate works in strange ways, doesn't it?

815
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,000
We tried so hard to get them,
but we could never manage it.

816
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,040
But look at them now.

817
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,840
Look at them now, Dad.

818
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,200
We barely had to lift a finger,

819
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,640
but the Jutatheps

820
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,840
have come crawling to us.

821
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,960
Rumpa.

822
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,520
Come here.

823
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,840
Let me hug you. Come.

824
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,520
Rumpa.

825
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,360
Come here, dear.

826
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,320
I wish to return and take my title
as M.L. Vilairumpa Dhevaprom.

827
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Rumpa, come and live with me.

828
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,240
I have missed…

829
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,960
I have missed you the most.

830
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,640
I won't come back here

831
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,120
until…

832
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,720
the Jutatheps have been completely ruined,

833
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,880
just as they did to me!

834
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,160
Rumpa.

835
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,240
Listen to me.

836
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,520
The Jutatheps

837
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,760
did nothing wrong.

838
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,960
They actually helped you.

839
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,120
They also paid off all our debts.

840
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,160
They didn't do anything wrong?

841
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,440
Are you saying they weren't wrong?
So who was wrong?

842
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,080
If not them, then who? Who?

843
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,360
Was it me?

844
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,800
I was wrong, right?
I was the only one in the wrong!

845
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,160
Was I the only one in the wrong?

846
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,440
-That's right!
-Rumpa.

847
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,120
-Rumpa!
-I was wrong, was I?

848
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,680
-Rumpa! No, Rumpa!
-Was I wrong?

849
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,320
-That's not true!
-Mom! I'm here!

850
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,280
-Mom.
-I wasn't wrong!

851
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,840
I'm here now, Mom.

852
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,120
I'm here now. It's okay, Mom.

853
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,680
I'm here now.

854
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,840
I'm here now.

855
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,520
I'm here now, Mom.

856
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,400
It's okay, Mom. I'm here now.

857
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,440
Don't be scared.

858
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,320
I'm here with you.

859
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,200
I'm here.

860
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,560
-I'm here.
-Fah.

861
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,600
Fah, listen. I wasn't in the wrong.

862
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,960
I wasn't.

863
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,440
Do you hear me?

864
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,200
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-You didn't.

865
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,040
I understand you.

866
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,760
I understand everything.

867
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,280
I love you, Mom.

868
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,560
I understand.

869
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:01,960
I'm so sorry, Grandpa,
for never coming to see you.

870
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,360
I just returned from Australia.

871
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,920
Mom and I have moved to Bangkok.

872
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,360
So,

873
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,360
where are you two living, dear?

874
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,680
Do you want to come and stay with me?

875
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,440
We're staying with my aunt.
She's my dad's sister.

876
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,320
I promise I'll bring Mom
to visit you often.

877
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,800
I'm sorry.

878
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,000
I'm really sorry

879
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,120
for not taking care of you

880
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,080
and your mom.

881
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,240
It's all right.

882
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,600
We're completely fine.

883
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,960
Sir.

884
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,720
Mrs. Ked called
saying she would be here soon.

885
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,280
I see.

886
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,440
Fah, let's go home.

887
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,640
Rumpa,

888
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,840
why don't you wait to see Ked?

889
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,360
Why would I want to see her?

890
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,840
She's useless to me

891
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,560
and she was never on my side.

892
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,400
She sided with those liars.

893
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,800
I should take Mom home, Grandpa.

894
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,080
Let me say something.

895
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,560
Don't tell anyone I came to see you

896
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,360
or where I live.

897
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,760
If Ked or anyone else
finds out about this,

898
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,000
you might never get to see me
and your granddaughter again.

899
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,560
You too.

900
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,160
Don't you dare

901
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,880
tell anyone I came here or where I live.

902
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,560
Otherwise, I'll tell the police

903
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,360
you gamble.

904
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,080
Yes, ma'am. I'll never tell anyone, ma'am.

905
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,320
Please do this for us.

906
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,440
We'll tell them when the time is right.

907
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,560
Hold on.

908
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,120
Fah.

909
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,000
Let me ask you something.

910
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,480
What's wrong with your mom?

911
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,240
She's just stressed,
but please don't worry.

912
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,920
Leave her to me.

913
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,200
I'd also like to ask you a favor.

914
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,160
If Mom comes here,

915
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,640
please don't mention the Jutatheps

916
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,360
or anything about M.R. Ronnaphee
and Mrs. Peangkwan to her.

917
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,640
Let's go out for lunch.

918
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,319
Is there anything you want to ask me?

919
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,000
About Lisa, for example.

920
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,479
I'm your employee.

921
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,920
I don't think I need to know
about your private life.

922
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,600
I thought you knew

923
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,359
how I feel about you.

924
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,200
Remember this, Fah.

925
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:54,000
This damned family hurt me.

926
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,520
They took everything from me.

927
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
