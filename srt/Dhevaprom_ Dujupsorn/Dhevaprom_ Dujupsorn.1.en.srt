Are you all right?

11
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,600
I came from that way.

12
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,880
I don't know where to go.

13
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,360
Come to my house then.
It's nearby. Let's go.

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,560
Excuse me.
Could you also help my boyfriend?

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,720
I don't know where to go.
All the roads are closed.

-In that case, follow me.
-Thank you.

I'll tell you later.

soldiers from other units

Can you stop them?

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
I think you should leave this area now.

-Yes, sir.

You're like Kobori

I think we can go now.

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,640

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,280
You're not hurt, are you?

66
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm fine.

Dujupsorn.

71
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,040
It means angel-like.

72
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,800
The name really suits you.

73
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,480
And you are?

Hello, Nus.

80
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,120
Good morning, sir.
Did you sleep well last night?

81
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,960
How's the project in Sukhumvit 24 going?

82
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,480
Is the delivery on schedule?

83
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
The contractor informed me

84
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
that it will be delivered as scheduled.

85
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
Right now, vendors have started
setting up their stalls.

86
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,000
It's packed with people, sir.

87
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,400
They sell incredible pork hocks there.

88
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,280
Would you like to have some for lunch?

89
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,480
Are you trying to get me drinking, Nus?

90
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,920
Well, I just tried my luck.

91
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,280
I want to buy some land in Sukhumvit 55
for my new condo projects.

92
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,160
Thong Lo. That's marvelous, sir.

93
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Three plots.

94
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,320
I'll build three condos at once.

95
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,320
Please set up appointments
with the brokers.

96
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,840
I want the middle section of the street

97
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,640
and the area next to Phetchaburi Road.

98
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,120
Sir, I don't think Phetchaburi Road is--

99
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,240
No, Nus.

100
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,480
Everything is possible.

101
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
Yes, sir.

102
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,160
Now, it's your turn, Nus.

103
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,720
Sure.

104
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,760
Your schedule isn't full at all today.

105
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,440
We only have interviews
with PR candidates.

106
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,960
Their resumes

107
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,080
are already in your car.

108
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,000
You're not required to be there

109
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,720
because Ju,

110
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,760
Kan, and I will be there.

111
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,520
Since you all will be there…

112

116
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,240
Your coffee, sir.

117
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,680
Well…

118
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,080
Sir, about the projects in Thong Lo.

119
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,040
-Any problems?
-Well--

120
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,200
Mr. Asira.

121
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,640
This, sir.

122
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,840
Gosh, you used my full name.

123
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,840
This must be serious.

124
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,520
Nus told me you're buying
three plots of land in Thong Lo.

125
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,680
Actually, I wanted five,
but I didn't think you'd like the idea.

126
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,320
-Mr. Asira.
-My dear sister, listen.

127
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,280
Those plots won't be available
in the future.

128
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Believe me. If we're slow,
we won't get a good deal.

129
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,800
But why build three condos at once?

130
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,680
Because we're targeting three groups.

131
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,440
Look out there
and picture what I tell you.

132
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,800
For the one next to Phetchaburi Road,

133
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I'm targeting old-money buyers,

134
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,080
who may want to buy
units for their families.

135
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,360
As for the size,

136
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,640
the units will be quite large,
and with fewer units.

137
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,600
The one in the middle section…

138
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,520
Bend down a bit.

139
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
For the middle section of the street,

140
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,680
my target group is the younger generation

141
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,360
and working people
who like to go out eating and drinking.

142
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
The rooms don't have to be big,

143
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,720
but they must have good facilities
to give it a good name in Thong Lo.

144
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,520
We can have a few penthouses on top.
That should be enough.

145
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,080
But about half of the units here
will be for rent.

146
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,480
As for the one next to Sukhumvit Road,

147
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm targeting the Japanese.

148
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,400
This means the layout
may look a little weird, such as

149
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
having two bedrooms and one bathroom.

150
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
Why?

151
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,520
Well, they like to get in the tub.

152
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,520
The bathroom may have
to be a little bigger.

153
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,320
The second bedroom doesn't have
to be very big,

154
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,640
but it could be converted into an office.

155
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
A great communal area
with plenty of trees.

156
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,800
We may attract both the new rich

157
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,440
and the Japanese expats.

158
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,240
What do you think?

159
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,720
What can I say

160
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,600
when you've done such thorough research?

161
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,720
I need you to help me
with the land purchases and I promise

162
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,440
we'll sell all the units
as soon as we open for bookings.

163
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,840
Please keep two penthouses
of the middle one for me and Lisa.

164
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,880
There you go. I've sold two already.

165
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,960
I don't even have the land yet.

166
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,280
Awesome.

167
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,840
Well then, sir,

168
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,080
I'll go get ready
for the PR interviews. It's time.

169
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,600
Okay.

170
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,960
-Here she comes.
-She's here.

171
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,360
Our Miss Thailand,
Areeya Sirisopa, or Pop,

172
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,760
has now arrived for a TV show shoot.

173
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,760
Gosh, she's so gorgeous.

174
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,520
There's no doubt she got the title.

175
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,880
And her English accent is

176
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,760
-just so beautiful!
-Yes.

177
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,320
Hey, I think

178
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,880
a Miss Universe crown

179
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
is well within her reach.

180
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,640
-She'll definitely get it. What?
-Of course. Who is coughing?

181
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm sorry.
Do you know where the toilet is?

182
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,920
-What?
-What did she say?

183
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
Toilet. Go straight and turn left.

184
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,240
I see. Thank you.

185
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,880
-I see.
-I guess

186
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
-she studied abroad. Right?
-Yes.

187
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,080
-Who's this?
-Hello.

188
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
I'm Dujupsorn.

189
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
-I see.
-I see. Ms. Dujupsorn.

190
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,800
-Please wait over there.
-Sure.

191
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,000
Can I have your documents, please?

192
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,960
They have already picked someone.
Do you know that?

193
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,400
Yes?

194
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,680
Well, they have picked someone
for the position,

195
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,320
but they're holding interviews
just to make it seem proper.

196
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,480
Who is it?

197
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,840
To be honest,

198
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,640
you can go home.

199
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,440
You'll have more time
to look for another job.

200
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,120
Hello, Auntie Kanlaya.

201
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,720
You're Meena, right?

202
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,720
Yes.

203
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,320
Oh my, you've become so pretty
I didn't recognize you.

204
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,280
Listen, don't mind me
if I don't recognize you again later.

205
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,520
Today, the president

206
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,480
has allocated his time,
especially for the interviews.

207
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,920
Especially.

208
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,600
By the way,

209
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,200
you sorted it for me, right?

210
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,240
Just do your best
and don't get too excited.

211
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,600
Okay.

212
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,320
Let's go.

213
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,760
Ms. Meena!

214
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,920
Yes.

215
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
This candidate has a great profile, sir.

216
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,720
She also has some experience.

217
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,560
I see.

218
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Why are you interested
in working in real estate?

219
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,800
I've always worked
in the fashion industry,

220
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,200
but now I'd like to venture

221
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,920
into a different field

222
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,880
and apply my skills and knowledge

223
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,840
to make the real estate business

224
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,160
more colorful.

225
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,000
Well then, suppose
we had the plan to build condos

226
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,040
in Sukhumvit 55.

227
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,440
How would you promote them
in a more colorful way?

228
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,440
Thong Lo?

229
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,040
Oh my, why there? The traffic is terrible
and there are no expressways.

230
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,640
Okay.

231
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,920
Hello.

232
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,320
Are you here to see Ms. Ploy or Mr. Petch?

233
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
Lisa.

234
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,160
When did you get here?

235
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,880
Just a second ago.

236
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,240
Let's go find something to eat.

237
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,920
But it'll be just the two of us.

238
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,680
Petch is conducting job interviews.

239
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,040
-Okay.
-Let's go.

240
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,400
Ms. Dujupsorn? It's your turn.

241
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,480
Hello, I'm Dujupsorn Trinathy.

242
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,960
I hope to get the chance
to apply my knowledge

243
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,760
in promoting JT Property
in the best way possible.

244
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,480
You have knowledge but zero experience.

245
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,360
Yes,

246
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,920
I may not have it now,

247
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,680
but I can gain it.

248
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,560
And I believe

249
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,440
my vision aligns with JT's.

250
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,720
Ms. Dujupsorn, what do you think
about building condominiums

251
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,040
in Sukhumvit 55?

252
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,280
Sukhumvit 55? Do you mean Thong Lo?

253
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,160
That's a great idea.

254
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,600
There are many
Japanese people living there

255
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,520
and it'll likely become a place
where young people hang out.

256
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,000
The market there is expanding,

257
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,480
so you'll have the edge over competitors

258
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,200
if you can get a hold of it before them.

259
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,640
Thank you, Ms. Dujupsorn.

260
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,040
Sir, do you have any questions for her?

261
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,160
I do.

262
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,680
Do you have a boyfriend?

263
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,640
Do you have a boyfriend?

264
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,920
No, I don't.

265
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,880
I have been focusing on my studies

266
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,400
and I had to graduate on time
because of my scholarship,

267
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,880
so I haven't had time for love.

268
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,720
I'll think about it
when it's more convenient for me.

269
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,760
When do you think that will be?

270
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,480
When I'm ready.

271
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,160
That means having a good job and income

272
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,440
that allows me to provide for my family
without it taking a toll on me.

273
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,560
I'll open myself up when that happens.

274
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
We'll contact you--

275
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,120
You're hired, Ms. Dujupsorn.

276
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,040
Yes?

277
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,640
Already?

278
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,360
-Aren't you going to consult…
-What for?

279
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,240
Isn't this my decision to make?

280
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,840
I didn't mean that, but…

281
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,840
we normally follow the official procedure.

282
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,880
That's a waste of time.

283
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,680
Anyway, I'll leave this to you, Jurairat.
She can start the day after tomorrow.

284
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,520
That's all for today.
Thank you so much, everyone.

285
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,920
You're free to go now.

286
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,280
Please make your way out.

287
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,280
But Ms. Fah,

288
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,880
please stay behind.

289
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,240
Yes, sir.

290
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
All right, Kanlaya, come on.

291
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,520
Ju, Kanlaya, please come.

292
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
Please.

293
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,840
Please come.

294
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,440
Do you remember me?

295
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Have we met before?

296
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,360
Oh dear.

297
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,120
How could you forget your Kobori?

298
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,880
Shoot.

299
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,400
Well, your face was all black.

300
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,280
I remember you now.

301
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,040
They have a nice coffee in this building.

302
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,600
Really?

303
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,840
Let's get some coffee. I'm so sleepy.

304
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,680
We can discuss work over coffee.

305
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,040
Shall we?

306
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,960
Auntie.

307
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,400
It's all good, right? Let's go celebrate.

308
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,480
My mom has booked
a Chinese restaurant for us. Let's go.

309
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,440
Meena.

310
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
Maybe next time.

311
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,080
Next time?

312
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,560
Have some cake.

313
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,040
It's all right, sir.
I don't really like sweets.

314
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,920
You can drop the formalities.

315
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,160
So you continued your studies
in Australia after that?

316
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,160
Yes. How did you…

317
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,680
How did you know that, Mr. Asira?
Both my nickname and where I studied.

318
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,800
It's on your application form.

319
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,920
And when will you stop
being so formal with me?

320
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,320
You're my boss

321
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,520
and you're a Mom Rajawongse.

322
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,400
My dad is. I'm just an ordinary person.

323
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,440
Let's do this.

324
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,280
Call me Petch.

325
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,800
Both Asira and Petch mean diamond.

326
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,320
I thought it meant the sun.

327
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,320
Actually, you're right, but…

328
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,360
my mom is already the sun of my family.

329
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,880
It'd be too hot

330
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,880
if there were two suns.

331
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,640
Why don't you try calling me that?

332
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,800
Mr. Petch.

333
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,440
Right, and one more thing.

334
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,360
Don't call me Mom.

335
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
It's so wrong.

336
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,360
Sure.

337
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,800
Very well,

338
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,400
Ms. Angel.

339
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,240
There he goes again.
Is he a flirting machine or what?

340
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,120
May I ask you something?

341
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Sure.

342
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,800
Have you left the army?

343
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,120
Yes.

344
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,800
I served the nation,
so it's now time to serve my family.

345
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,520
I thought you liked being a soldier.

346
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,840
I liked it,

347
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,040
but I also had
my family's business to take care of.

348
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
They let me do what I wanted for years,

349
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,040
so it was time for me
to come back and help them.

350
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,280
Why do you think I liked being a soldier?

351
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,400
You still act like one.

352
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,120
Take when you decided to hire me,
for example.

353
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,520
Me?

354
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,560
Well…

355
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,720
Well, if…

356
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,640
-Well…
-I'm kidding.

357
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,320
You're straightforward, clear,

358
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,440
and you don't take orders from others.

359
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,920
Fah, you got me there.

360
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,480
Actually, it depends
on who gives the order.

361
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
I listen to those I want to listen to.

362
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Please have some cake, Mr. Petch.

363
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,360
Yes, ma'am.

364
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,480
So would it be a problem
to start the day after tomorrow?

365
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,240
No.

366
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm free all day, so I should have
enough time to prepare.

367
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,240
And what about this evening?

368
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,720
This evening?

369
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,480
My gosh, what time is it now?

370
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Petch.
I need to be somewhere.

371
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,520
Okay. Wait, Fah.

372
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,560
Here is my name card.

373
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,200
My personal mobile number is on there.

374
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,760
Thank you, but I don't have a mobile.
Just a landline.

375
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,160
I already have that number.

376
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,880
Anyway, thank you so much.

377
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,800
And the coffee is good, as you said.

378
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,400
If there's a chance,
please let me return the treat.

379
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Do you want to have
a coffee with me again?

380
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,360
I'm joking.
You should go or you'll be late.

381
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,719
-Thank you.
-No worries.

382
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,600
NUM

383
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,440
Tang!

384
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,080
-Tang!
-My gosh!

385
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,199
-Tang!
-My gosh!

386
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
-Tang!
-My gosh, Fah!

387
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,280
Tang.

388
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,040
I thought you weren't coming.

389
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,080
Come on, how could I miss it?

390
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,960
-It's Sornram. Gosh.
-My gosh!

391
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,440
Sornram!

392
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,560
Fah, since we're in Bangkok,

393
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,640
let's just speak in standard Thai,
so we blend in.

394
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,760
Don't you find it cringe?

395
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,880
Why? You can tell from my face
I've spoken it since I was born.

396
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I speak it so fluently.

397
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,960
Hey, I've prepared tons of song lists.

398
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
I also made some notes.

399
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,440
You made some notes.

400
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,760
I really miss that song.
If Sornram does this,

401
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,680
we do this.

402
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,640
My gosh.

403
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,000
Please come inside, everyone.

404
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,600
-My gosh!
-Let's go.

405
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,560
Let's go. Come on.

406
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,360
-Num!
-My gosh!

407
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,560
And how do you feel about this album, Num?

408
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,320
-Num is so handsome.
-Yes.

409
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,480
I want him by my side.

410
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,440
How can he be so handsome?

411
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,000
Since you're here with us,
please teach us a dance move.

412
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,920
Everybody, let's dance with him.

413
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,440
Definitely!

414
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,360
NUM

415
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,600
When are you going home?

416
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,880
Tomorrow. Oh no.

417
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,280
I have to speak like Bangkok people.

418
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,640
Tomorrow, because I have
a program to host.

419
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,960
Right, Ms. New-faced DJ. Congratulations.

420
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,000
Why are you congratulating me now?

421
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,680
Save that for when I become
a DJ at Hotwave Bangkok.

422
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,120
Or I must be like

423
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,440
VJ Tangaew first before you tell me that.

424
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,520
Isn't that Tangaew's hairstyle?

425
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,720
My gosh, you can tell.

426
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,600
-Yes, I'm Tangaew.
-Yes, right.

427
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,560
I'm sad. I thought we'd get
to watch a soap opera together.

428
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,960
-Would we get to watch it?
-What?

429
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,200
Wouldn't your mom get mad over it?

430
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,840
I still remember when we secretly watched
one together back then.

431
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,760
-My goodness. All hell broke loose.
-Come on.

432
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,800
We would. Cham also loves them.

433
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,120
-I see.
-Also, Mom doesn't come downstairs much.

434
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,040
I see.

435
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,680
By the way, have you taken
your mom to see a doctor?

436
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,880
Duj.

437
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Didn't you come to work here
because you wanted her to see a doctor?

438
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,800
There, there.

439
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,760
Take her to see a doctor if you have time,

440
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,720
so you can live your life.

441
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,440
Got it?

442
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,120
Thank you, Tang.

443
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,200
Don't forget to remind me, okay?

444
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,440
Okay.

445
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,640
Hey, don't be sad.

446
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,160
Here is a reward for a good girl.

447
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,720
Eat up so you have energy.

448
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,280
Just pretend this is all a soap opera.
It'll be over soon.

449
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,920
Good girl.

450
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,920
Eat up.

451
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,480
MS. DUJUPSORN TRINATHY
BORN: JANUARY 7, 1970, 25 YEARS OLD

452
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
Who are you calling, Petch?

453
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,000
No one.

454
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,600
What do you mean?
You were about to call someone.

455
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,400
Why are you home today?

456
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,040
I thought you would stay at your condo.

457
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,920
I miss Mom.

458
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,480
I also miss you.

459
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,120
We haven't talked much lately.

460
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,440
Any updates for me?

461
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,440
It's not about work, okay?

462
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,720
Tell me about your private life.

463
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,600
What?

464
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,320
No updates.

465
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,920
Good night.

466
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,400
Petch.

467
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,920
You forgot your jacket.

468
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,080
-Stop it.
-Gosh.

469
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,520
Good night.

470
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,760
Ms. Fah.

471
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,200
How was the interview?

472
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,520
There were many great candidates.

473
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,440
Poor you.

474
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,240
It's okay if you don't get it.

475
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,360
But…

476
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
I got the job!

477
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,400
What? Really?

478
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,400
Oh my gosh! I'm so happy for you.

479
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm so happy.

480
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,760
Hey, why did they accept you
right away though?

481
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,480
-Don't they normally call to inform you?
-Right.

482
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,360
Maybe they needed someone urgently.

483
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,960
But it's good I got the job.
I can take Mom to see a doctor now.

484
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,400
Listen, before you do that,

485
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,240
you'll have to get her
out of the room first.

486
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,240
She hasn't come out for days now.

487
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,200
If she hadn't run rampant this morning,

488
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,240
I wouldn't have seen her this whole week.

489
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,120
But are you sure about working there?

490
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,240
Yes, I'm sure.

491
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,560
It's one of the top real estate companies
in the country.

492
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,240
I'll have a bright future.

493
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,840
I heard the owner is Mom Rajawongse.

494
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,240
Beware.

495
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,720
You might get royal in-laws.

496
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,720
Don't be silly, Cham.

497
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,760
-Royal in-laws.
-Come, let's get something to celebrate.

498
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,760
-Let's have desserts.
-Sure, but make sure

499
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,600
-they can fill us up.
-Let's have sweets.

500
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,000
Petch, do you want some porridge?

501
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,040
Yes.

502
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,040
You look cheerful today.

503
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,720
Did something good happen?

504
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,360
Is something stuck in your throat, Ploy?

505
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,560
What's with you two?

506
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,280
Tell me now. What are you hiding from me?

507
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,760
I want to tell you, Mom,

508
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,320
but I'm not sure

509
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,000
what good thing happened to Petch either.

510
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,800
Is it about Lisa?

511
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,120
I saw the newspaper printed
another story about you two.

512
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,080
The Cattleya Jaja column mentioned

513
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,680
they saw Lisa at your office yesterday.

514
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,240
That's right, but she came to see me.

515
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,160
Petch wasn't available.

516
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,520
You said you wanted a new purse.
I'll buy one for you.

517
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,840
But please help me.

518
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,240
Okay.

519
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,920
Petch,

520
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,160
Lisa is adorable.
Why aren't you interested in her?

521
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,800
Mom, I can't force my feelings.

522
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,200
Right, Dad?

523
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,240
Why are you asking me?

524
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,760
Well, you didn't do
what was expected of you.

525
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,240
Well, Dad couldn't control his love

526
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,480
for Mom, Petch.

527
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,840
Stop it, you two.

528
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,000
This is why

529
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,680
your mom wants to pair you up with Lisa.
She wants to make it up to Ked.

530
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,920
Chai Yai.

531
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,560
Why do you have to make it up to her?

532
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,920
You two got together, and so did
Mrs. Ked and Mr. Chinnakorn.

533
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,320
You didn't do anything wrong.

534
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,320
You're good, Petch.

535
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,560
I asked about you,

536
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,880
but you diverted it to us.

537
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,280
You're as slippery as an eel.

538
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Who taught you to be this way?

539
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,160
Dad did.

540
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,320
Mr. Asira.

541
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,160
Mom.

542
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,560
Lisa is more like a sister to me.
We can't be anything else.

543
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,200
But if you feel you have wronged Ked,

544
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,200
I suggest you pair Ploy up with Chavit.

545
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,680
They are more likely to work.

546
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,360
Petch.

547
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,880
Stop it.

548
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,560
That's impossible. Just thinking about it

549
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,360
makes me want to throw up.

550
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,800
Really?

551
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,960
But Chavit is so good-looking.

552
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,120
That makes no difference

553
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,760
if he's a player, so I'll pass.

554
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,800
Gosh.

555
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,640
Hey, it's Chavit.

556
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,440
-Chavit.
-Let's go.

557
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,760
See you.

558
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,320
-Okay, see you.
-Chavit.

559
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
-See you.
-See you.

560
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,840
Bye.

561
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,720
Sir, the monk is here.

562
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,400
-What?
-The monk is here.

563
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,040
May you live a long life
filled with happiness and good health.

564
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,360
Refrain from drinking alcohol,
if possible.

565
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,480
Amen.

566
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,280
BOONCHU

567
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,760
My hair is driving me crazy.
I need to get it washed.

568
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,560
By the way, you're free
this afternoon, right?

569
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,920
Come with me.

570
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,960
Well, I have nothing scheduled
this afternoon,

571
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,960
but I just got my hair washed,
so I'll just wait for you.

572
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,080
What are you doing this afternoon?
Why do you need me?

573
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,760
Well, I've set up a meeting
for Saruch for Petch.

574
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,280
Do you remember Saruch?

575
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,880
He was our senior
back when we studied in London.

576
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,280
I remember

577
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,040
that you said he was good-looking.

578
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,760
I remember him,

579
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,160
but did I ever compliment him?
I don't remember that at all.

580
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,440
Let's go.

581
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,880
Hello, Ms. Ploy. How many today?

582
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,200
-Just one.
-No, two.

583
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,680
Hair wash and styling, please.

584
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,360
Sure. Please come this way.
Gosh, you both look pretty today.

585
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
Thank you.

586
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,120
What's wrong with you?

587
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,520
Nothing.

588
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,960
That's not true.

589
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
So, I can come with you, right?

590
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,440
No, you can't.

591
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,440
I'm wondering
if gold prices are stable today

592
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,160
since both of you are here.

593
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,080
Am I not welcome here, my friend?

594
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,560
I think someone else is glad
that I'm here.

595
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,800
I think you should say that to your women.

596
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,320
-Gosh, Vit.
-Move.

597
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,640
Are you jealous? Well?

598
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,480
I told you, didn't I,

599
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,960
that I'll stop seeing all of them
if you accept my love.

600
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,400
I'm only playing the field
while I wait for you.

601
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,920
Please don't wait for me. I feel bad.

602
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,600
Please be considerate of me
when you do something.

603
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,920
I'm possessive of my sister.

604
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,440
What about you being in the news
with my sister every day, Mom?

605
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,640
She's the one bearing the brunt.
When are you going to ask for her hand?

606
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,680
Don't do it, Petch.

607
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
My parents would definitely agree to it.

608
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,640
Isn't that good?

609
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,280
I don't think so.

610
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,280
If we were going to fall in love,

611
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,840
it would have happened a long time ago.

612
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,040
Are you turning me down just like this?

613
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,640
This is very A-S-T-O-N-I-S-H-I-N-G.

614
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,360
M.L. Asira got turned down.

615
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,160
You're very cool, Lisa.

616
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,680
Hold on. What are you saying?

617
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,280
A-S-T-O-N-I-S-H-I-N-G. That's astonishing.

618
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,000
You're a Mom. Don't you know how to spell?

619
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,600
-Ploy.
-Yes?

620
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,640
Will your architect be here soon?

621
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,360
Casanova is giving me a terrible headache.

622
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,520
He's here. Shall I ask him to come in?

623
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,960
That'd be great.

624
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,000
-Hello, Mr. Asira.
-Hello.

625
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,160
Hello, Mr. Chavit.

626
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,400
Hello, Lisa.

627
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,000
Saruch was Lisa's and my senior
when we studied in London.

628
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,440
I see.

629
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,400
But he majored in architecture.

630
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,240
Saruch.

631
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,040
As I told you,
Petch is planning to build condos

632
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,520
in Thong Lo
and many other places in Bangkok,

633
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,000
so he needs a team.

634
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,200
I'd be very glad to help,

635
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,400
but I'm not sure if I'm qualified
for big projects like these.

636
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,280
You're too humble.

637
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,400
If Ploy gave the green light,
then you're up to it.

638
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,160
Yes, sir.

639
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,600
I saved Saruch's portfolio
on this floppy disk for you.

640
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,200
When did you return to Thailand?

641
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,880
Many months ago, but my mom asked me
to help her with the family business.

642
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,880
We run a jewelry company.

643
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,840
What?

644
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,240
We're in the same industry then.

645
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,480
Let's be more casual with each other.

646
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,360
We can be friends.

647
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,040
Yes, sir.

648
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,480
Well, I might seek

649
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,240
your and Lisa's advice sometime.

650
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,240
Sure, we'd be glad to help.

651
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,160
Right, Lisa?

652
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,800
Yes,

653
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,120
I'd be glad to help you, Saruch.

654
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,720
Well then,

655
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,480
let's hold you a welcoming party

656
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,320
since you're becoming one of us.

657
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,880
Sure, it's up to you all.

658
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,360
Hey, my friend.

659
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,920
Let's welcome him now.

660
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,080
Not today. I have a family gathering.

661
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,400
Uncle Ruj and Saruj are both in Thailand.

662
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,120
It's very A-S-T-O-N-I-S-H-I-N-G.

663
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,160
So, are the five lions
and five monkeys all gathering tonight?

664
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,400
Yes.

665
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,800
Your blood pressure was low.
That's why you felt faint.

666
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,120
Would you like to go upstairs
to rest, Grandma?

667
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,360
I'll ask Joom to take you.

668
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,680
It's okay. I'm fine.

669
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,800
Don't worry about me, dear.

670
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,080
I'll sit here for a bit.

671
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,240
How is she?

672
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,960
Her blood pressure is low.

673
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,600
Why did it just drop all of a sudden?

674
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,840
It's probably stress.

675
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,760
What is she stressed about?

676
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,800
Did she get another letter?

677
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,600
It's probably that.

678
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,960
She should get better after some rest.

679
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,520
Please don't worry.

680
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,640
I think you should go to dinner.

681
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,560
You don't get to gather often.
Let's leave Great-Grandma with Joom.

682
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,840
Let's go.

683
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,680
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

684
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,640
Congratulations, and welcome, Jak,

685
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,400
to this association
of grooms-to-be, unofficially.

686
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,480
It's good to be in love, isn't it?

687
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,080
But there are two among us

688
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,760
who are still single.

689
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,000
The two oldest ones, right?

690
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
I'm not making a toast with you.

691
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,400
Won't you hurry?

692
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,040
Or are they waiting for a Dhevaprom
to please Great-Grandma Orn?

693
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,280
Good idea.

694
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,040
I think three is enough.

695
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,560
But the person in the news with Petch
is a Dhevaprom.

696
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,840
A direct descendant.

697
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,320
Yes, Petch.

698
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,240
Lisa is a pure-blooded Dhevaprom.

699
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,960
As Saruj said,

700
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,200
this match-up game
between our families must stop.

701
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,760
Are you blushing, Petch?

702
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,960
-Hey, Saruj.
-Just be honest.

703
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,760
I need you on my side.
It's just the two of us now.

704
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
Come on.

705
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,240
Hey, Poom. Come in.

706
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,360
Greetings, Master.
Is your spiritual academy closed today?

707
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,840
Excuse me.

708
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,960
Am I disturbing the five Jutathep monkeys?

709
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,880
You're going to get it.

710
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,800
Aren't you the sixth monkey?

711
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,760
I'm not.

712
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,760
Then who is it?

713
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,200
It's Chavit,

714
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,560
Petch's future brother-in-law.

715
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,680
Come on, Saruj.

716
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,120
I don't know who I can depend
on anymore if not you.

717
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,200
Seriously, Chavit isn't a monkey.

718
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,160
He's more of a wolf.

719
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,280
I don't mind that.
I just hope he doesn't test positive.

720
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,760
Where have you been, Poom?

721
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,440
I visited Great-Grandma Orn.

722
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,800
I heard she wasn't doing well.

723
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,120
Why did she suddenly fall sick?

724
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,000
I think it's time
we take care of this properly.

725
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,480
It's strange

726
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,600
that we haven't been able to locate Rumpa.

727
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,040
Not to mention that we have access

728
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,680
to most of the armed forces.

729
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,240
What about you, Chai Yai?

730
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,280
Did you find anything?

731
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,960
To be honest,

732
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,800
I haven't

733
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,920
really been looking for Rumpa.

734
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,360
-What?
-What?

735
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,240
I don't trust her

736
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,080
and I'm not sure

737
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,480
if finding Rumpa will make things better.

738
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,200
Why do you think that?

739
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,520
The last time I saw Vilairumpa,

740
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,560
I learned not to trust that woman again.

741
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,960
Your actions

742
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,640
show just how thoughtless

743
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,480
and twisted you are.

744
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,120
Not a single drop of Dhevaprom blood
is left in your veins!

745
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,600
I'm not sure

746
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,360
what she will do

747
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,560
if we let her see Grandma Orn.

748
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,280
All of this

749
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,560
is my fault.

750
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,480
Phee.

751
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,040
You can't take all the blame.

752
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,240
All of us Jutatheps and Dhevaproms

753
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,960
are responsible for what has happened.

754
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,600
It also happened years ago.

755
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,360
I'm just worried
about Grandma Orn's health.

756
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,920
I used to think

757
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,560
it would be better
if we never saw Rumpa again,

758
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,800
but I'm not sure anymore.

759
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,680
So I want to ask all of you

760
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,880
if you still want Vilairumpa

761
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,120
to set foot in the Jutathep Palace again.

762
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,440
Petch.

763
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,960
Do you really want that woman
to meet with Great-Grandma?

764
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Do you think Great-Grandma
will be able to handle it?

765
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,480
People of Grandma Orn's generation

766
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,960
value forgiveness greatly.

767
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,840
She might be worrying about this.

768
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,640
But if we just bring

769
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,880
Rumpa here

770
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,840
and ask her to forgive Grandma,
I don't think she will.

771
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,680
But I think

772
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,120
we're just sweeping
the problem under the rug.

773
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,760
We're not solving it.

774
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,360
Yes.

775
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,960
We would also be there.
I don't think she would be a problem.

776
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,200
If this will make
Great-Grandma feel better,

777
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,440
then I want to do it.

778
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,640
I just want to say,

779
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,880
we should think carefully

780
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,840
about whether Vilairumpa's appearance

781
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,840
will make Grandma Orn's condition better

782
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,840
or worse.

783
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,560
Are we prepared to risk it?

784
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,400
I want to settle this for Great-Grandma.

785
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,840
Guilt affects people
more deeply than you'd expect.

786
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,760
Yes.

787
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,640
That's exactly how I feel, Petch.

788
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,840
Great-Grandma.

789
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,840
Hey.

790
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,040
How are you all?

791
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,240
Do you still feel dizzy?

792
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,160
Not anymore.

793
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,760
But all of you being here
is making me dizzy again.

794
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,920
I always feel dizzy
when all of you are present.

795
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,360
Is your breathing normal?

796
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,680
Yes, dear.

797
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:15,320
-Petch, bring Vilairumpa to me, all right?
-Yes?

798
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,560
Are you still worried about the promise?

799
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,040
No.

800
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,600
I'm worried about her.

801
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,880
She has been on her own.

802
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,920
Who knows where she has been
or who she has been with.

803
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,320
And lately,

804
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,040
I have been dreaming of her

805
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,120
almost every day.

806
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,840
If I don't get to apologize

807
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,960
and ask for forgiveness before I die,

808
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,120
I won't be able to rest in peace.

809
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,320
How are you so sure she will forgive you?

810
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,000
It's fine if she doesn't.

811
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,920
I can't force her.

812
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,880
But I will

813
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,520
forgive her.

814
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,200
At least

815
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,560
it'll relieve some of her suffering.

816
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,280
But it happened decades ago.

817
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,960
Time has probably healed the wound.

818
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,280
I used to think the same.

819
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,360
I thought that, given time,

820
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,440
she would be relieved of the pain.

821
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,960
But when I saw the letter,

822
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,680
I knew she had held a grudge

823
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,160
all this time.

824
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,320
I pity her

825
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,560
as I'm also a woman.

826
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:05,360
I used to look after her
when she was small.

827
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,880
I'll find Ms. Vilairumpa

828
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,440
and bring her to you.

829
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,280
Thank you, dear.

830
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,720
I'll help.

831
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,960
Thank you, dear.

832
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,600
I also want to help,

833
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,480
but I'll be sent to Europe soon.

834
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,360
It's okay, dear.

835
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,240
It's okay, Saruj.

836
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,880
And don't worry, guys.

837
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,800
Just get prepared for your weddings.

838
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,400
You never miss a chance to win
Great-Grandma's affection.

839
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,640
Of course.

840
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,440
So, can't you do anything,
Master Ronnapoom?

841
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,360
Can't you locate her?

842
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,080
It's a special power, not a radar.

843
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,040
Listen, don't worry about it

844
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,200
if you can't help.

845
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,440
Come, I'll take Great-Grandma to bed.

846
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,360
Visiting hours are over.

847
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,400
-Please go.
-Chat.

848
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,800
-Okay, go. I'm going to bed.
-Okay.

849
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,720
-Go, dear.
-Great-Grandma.

850
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,360
There, there.

851
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,680
-Great-Grandma, we love you.
-We love you.

852
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,880
Thank you, dear.

853
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,840
Are you serious this time, Petch?

854
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,040
I think so.

855
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:31,040
By the way, you said
two of us would bump into her.

856
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,480
How do we know when that will happen?
And who are those two?

857
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,360
Soon, Petch.

858
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,160
We'll get to meet her soon.

859
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,160
And the two people

860
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,680
should be

861
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,480
among us here.

MS. DUJUPSORN TRINATHY
PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER

864
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,440
Hello, Porn Thai Desserts.

865
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,720
Hello.

866
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,880
May I speak to Fah, please?

867
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,760
May I know who is calling?

868
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,000
It's Petch.

869
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,160
A moment, please.

870
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,640
Fah, you have a call, dear.

871
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,320
I'm coming.

872
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,040
Who is it?

873
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,960
It's Petch.

874
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,240
What's wrong with you?
Can't you even hold the phone?

875
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,320
Hello, Mr. Petch.

876
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,680
Has something urgent come up?

877
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,200
Hello, Fah.

878
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,800
I just wanted to ask
if you are ready for tomorrow

879
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,560
and if you have everything prepared.

880
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,440
Goodness, did you have to call
and check on this yourself?

881
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,480
Your company sure takes care
of its employees well.

882
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,400
I only do this
for those who I want to take care of.

883
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,400
It's nothing.

884
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,800
I just wanted to check
if you gave me the correct number.

885
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,760
Of course. I repeated it many times.

886
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,560
So when are you going to bed?

887
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,280
Very soon.

888
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,360
What was that noise?

889
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,000
Are you okay?

890
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,120
I'm fine.

891
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,160
I just need to take care of something.
See you tomorrow.

892
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,640
Okay.

893
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,600
Did she send another letter?

894
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,080
It was sent from Bangkok
this time, not Chiang Mai.

895
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,960
Fah, your family called and said
something urgent came up.

896
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,399
Given this letter,

897
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,319
Rumpa may be in Bangkok

898
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,479
and not far from us.

899
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,800
