1
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,640
Saruch.

2
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,160
That's his car, right?

3
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,480
Petch!

4
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
-Please make way.
-Fah!

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,920
-Please make way.
-Open the door.

6
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,000
What is it?

7
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
Ma'am.

8
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,680
I need to tell you something about Fah.

9
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,800
Fah! Where is my daughter?

10
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,720
Where is my daughter?

11
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,360
Just wait and see.
If anything happens to my daughter,

12
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,760
I'll kill all of you!

13
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
Vilairumpa.

14
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,200
Fah! Where is my daughter?

15
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,720
Where is my daughter?

16
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
Give me back my daughter!

17
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,680
You.

18
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,640
What kind of man are you?

19
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,000
How could you let a woman
take a bullet for you?

20
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,640
What kind of man are you?
You're so shameless!

21
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,560
You bastard! Just wait and see.
If anything happens to my daughter,

22
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,480
I'll kill all of you!

23
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,040
I'll kill all of you! Do you hear me?

24
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,960
It was out of his control.

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,000
What do you mean out of his control?

26
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,360
Just listen to me.

27
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,360
Enough.

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,400
Ma'am.

29
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
Are you sorry?

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,320
My daughter almost died because of you,
you bastard!

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,760
You must take responsibility
if anything happens to her.

33
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,640
It's your fault! Do you hear me?

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,960
You bastard!

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Fah.

36
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,920
How will I live without you?

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,280
I can't live without you.

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
Fah.

39
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
I can't live without you.

40
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,520
I can't live without you.

41
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Fah.

42
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Ma'am.

43
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,880
Ma'am.

44
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,560
Fah is safe now.

45
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,200
You've just regained consciousness.

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,040
Why don't you go and rest?

47
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Let's go. I'll help you get up. Slowly.

48
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,960
Please drink some water, Aunt Rumpa.

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
What did you call me?

50
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,960
My name isn't Rumpa.

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,040
My name isn't Rumpa. Do you hear me?

52
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
Vilairumpa.

53
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
Phee.

54
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,320
We're here to take you home.

55
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,240
Don't be scared, Rumpa.

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,480
Are you really here to take me home?

57
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,880
Why are you here now?

58
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,440
Well?

59
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,640
Why are you here now?

60
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,280
Weren't you the ones
who destroyed my life?

61
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,080
Weren't you?

62
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Rumpa.

63
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,920
We never chased you away.

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,080
Shut up!

65
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,120
You were the worst.

66
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,240
You sided with that bitch, Peangkwan,
and put the blame on me.

67
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,840
Your son isn't any better.

68
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
He made Fah fall in love with him

69
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,520
and let her take a bullet for him.

70
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,400
Right?

71
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,920
You want her to die, don't you?

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,080
Rumpa.

73
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,640
Why is it always us?

74
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,120
Why is it always me and my daughter
who get hurt?

75
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,240
It should be you lying
on the bed in that room, not her!

76
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,960
All of you!

77
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,680
Ma'am.

78
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,640
Please give us a chance.

79
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,520
I promise I'll do my best
to take care of you and Fah.

80
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,680
I won't let you.

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,000
But they love each other.

82
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,360
Love?

83
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Love?

84
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,160
Why is their love so important?

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
What about my love?

86
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,240
Does my love for you mean nothing?

87
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,960
That was a long time ago, Rumpa.

88
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
That day,

89
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
you chased me away like a dog
when you no longer wanted me.

90
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,400
But now, you want my daughter,

91
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,320
so you're being nice to me.

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,800
This is it.

93
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,520
This is the true face of you Jutatheps.

94
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,200
You're liars.

95
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
It's disgusting.

96
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,160
All of you led me on,
saying I'd get to marry Phee.

97
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
But what happened?

98
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,200
You went back on your word.

99
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,760
No one kept their promise.

100
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,880
Did any of you ever think

101
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,800
about my feelings?

102
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,560
Did any of you care that I would get hurt?

103
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,840
You're not the only one who suffered.

104
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,360
Us Jutatheps were also hurt.

105
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,440
Please let it go, Rumpa.

106
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,240
Let it go?

107
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
Let it go?

108
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,240
A winner like you can do that,

109
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,240
not someone
who has been completely crushed like me.

110
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
Do you love my daughter?

111
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,440
If you love her, why did you let her
take a bullet for you?

112
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,680
-Rumpa!
-Don't raise your voice at me.

113
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
You have no right.

114
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,600
If you want my daughter,

115
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
then talk to me nicely.

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Beg me.

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
I might change my mind if you do that.

118
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,000
Your dignity won't let you, will it?

119
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,160
Dignity has nothing to do with it, Rumpa.

120
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
I want you to have a good life

121
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,440
and my good wishes for you
are worth more than my dignity.

122
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,920
Phee is right, Rumpa.

123
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
We don't care about dignity.

124
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,440
All we want is to see you
and our children happy.

125
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,920
I should have taken better care of you.

126
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,520
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,800
If you were hurt
by what we did in the past,

128
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,640
then let me
take sole responsibility for it.

129
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,680
Ma'am.

130
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,000
Fah loves you so much.

131
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,800
She has sacrificed everything,
including her happiness, for you.

132
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,960
I'm begging you to let this go

133
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,320
and forgive us.

134
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,800
Get treatment for your illness
and be a mom to Fah.

135
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,760
Please be happy.

136
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,840
On behalf of the entire Jutathep family,

137
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,480
I'd like to apologize to you.

138
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,800
Ma'am.

139
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,080
The patient is awake.

140
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,400
Fah.

141
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,680
-Fah.
-Fah!

142
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
Fah.

143
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Fah.

144
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,920
All this time,

145
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,120
you have always loved someone else.

146
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,600
Did you ever love Dad?

147
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
That must be why,

148
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,640
on the day Dad died,

149
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
you…

150
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,440
You left us behind

151
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,520
when I was begging you

152
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,240
to take him to the hospital.

153
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,200
I heard you say just now

154
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,480
that you

155
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,840
love him,

156
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,840
but…

157
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,720
I never once heard

158
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,760
you tell Dad that you love him.

159
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,240
-Dad and I were your mistakes, right?
-No.

160
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,120
That's not true.

161
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,640
That's not true, Fah.

162
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,080
-That's not true.
-If you don't tell me the truth,

163
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,640
then I don't have a reason
to live anymore.

164
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
Fah, calm down.

165
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,560
No, Fah.

166
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,280
Fah.

167
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,880
Don't leave me.

168
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,160
Please?

169
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,800
Excuse me.

170
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,360
Everybody, please leave the room.
This isn't good for the patient.

171
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
She shouldn't be stressed.

172
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,080
No.

173
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
We've given her medicine.

174
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,800
She should sleep soon.

175
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,840
She needs a lot of rest
and she should avoid getting worked up.

176
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,720
-Okay.
-All right.

177
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,320
-Thank you.
-No worries.

178
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm worried about you.

179
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,520
I've been worried about you
ever since you disappeared.

180
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,160
All the Jutatheps and Dhevaproms
were also worried about you.

181
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,280
Wasn't it good

182
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,160
that I disappeared?

183
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
It would have been better if I'd died.

184
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,320
The promise between the elders
has hurt us enough, Rumpa.

185
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Let bygones be bygones.

186
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
It's not that easy.

187
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,560
You can always start over, Rumpa.

188
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,200
I'm not sure about that.

189
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,200
I couldn't even tell my daughter or Pong

190
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,400
that I love them.

191
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,120
And now,

192
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,240
Fah hates me.

193
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,319
ROOM 3033

194
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,480
It's evident that
an influential person was behind it.

195
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,119
But what's worse is that
he fabricated evidence

196
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,960
to incriminate Kosol…

197
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
and make it look as if he was involved.

198
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,160
The illegal gun

199
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
and the bike were registered
in Kosol's name.

200
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,600
He said Wiboon's man asked to borrow them,

201
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
and he let him.

202
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,760
The problem is Wiboon.

203
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,160
We have no evidence.

204
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,560
There were no witnesses.

205
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,640
We can't charge him without evidence.

206
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
Are you worried he won't stop?

207
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,880
Yes.

208
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,920
Don't worry.

209
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,680
I'll take care of it.

210
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,560
Hello, Mr. Nakhon.

211
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,520
This way, sir. Please come in.

212
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,280
Please come in.

213
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,760
I won't sit at the head today.

214
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,200
Aren't you going to sit?

215
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,280
Not yet. He's not here yet.

216
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Mr. Asira.

217
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,560
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

218
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,600
Mr. Wiboon,

219
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,960
pull up a chair for him.

220
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
Yes, sir.

221
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,680
Please take a seat, sir.

222
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Please sit down.

223
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,040
Where are you going, Mr. Wiboon?

224
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,960
Why don't you sit down?

225
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,640
I have a lot to discuss with you.

226
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Is that so?

227
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,360
It concerns your future

228
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,280
in Chiang Mai.

229
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,840
What did you say?

230
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,680
Does it hurt?

231
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,880
Do you hate me too?

232
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,480
If you hate me,

233
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,400
then I have no one left.

234
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,480
Do you know what?

235
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
When you were born,

236
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,840
I was terrified.

237
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,240
I didn't even know how to hold you.

238
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,920
I didn't know…

239
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,760
Just bathing you,

240
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,240
I was scared.

241
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,960
My head was filled
with the mistakes I had made.

242
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,960
I was always making mistakes.

243
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,840
Maybe it's because

244
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,480
I never had a mom.

245
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,440
I didn't know
what a good mom was supposed to do.

246
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,200
I'm sorry, dear.

247
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,960
I'm sorry that I wasn't a good mom to you.

248
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
I want to answer your question

249
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,360
about whether I ever loved your dad.

250
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,280
I did love him.

251
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,960
But…

252
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,760
I only realized after it was too late.

253
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm home.

254
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,040
Right.

255
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,160
I was too scared to say it.

256
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,240
I…

257
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
I have something to tell you.

258
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
I'll tell you while we eat.

259
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
There's one more dish to come.

260
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,880
The day I decided to tell him
what he had been waiting to hear,

261
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,240
the doctor told me

262
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,720
he had less than a year to live.

263
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,040
I was angry.

264
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,720
I felt I had been betrayed again.

265
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,880
Whenever I loved someone,

266
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,880
things always turned out this way.

267
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,840
I couldn't handle it.

268
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
It was really too much for me.

269
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,920
I know that
I should have been stronger than this.

270
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,160
Everyone told me

271
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,680
that a mom should be strong
for her children

272
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,560
so she can protect them.

273
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,640
But did they ever think
that a mom is also a human?

274
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,360
I was weak.

275
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,160
I was scared.

276
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,280
Every time I hugged you,

277
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,200
I always wondered

278
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,320
if anyone would hug me.

279
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,000
I also wanted someone

280
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,520
to hug me,

281
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
protect me,

282
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,400
and tell me

283
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,520
everything would be fine.

284
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
But why

285
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,680
did everyone leave me?

286
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,880
The people I loved all left me.

287
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,240
They all left me.

288
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,600
Don't worry that I'll leave you.

289
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I'll be here for you
even if you don't love me.

290
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,760
How could I not love you?

291
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,560
I love you.

292
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,760
You know what?

293
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,840
If I lost you too,

294
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,880
I wouldn't have a reason
to live any longer.

295
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,840
Mom.

296
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,040
Fah.

297
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,400
You really love him, don't you?

298
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,360
Please come in.

299
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,760
What is this about?

300
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,880
Please sit down.

301
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,880
We've been waiting for you, Auntie.

302
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,800
I, Asira Jutathep,

303
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,360
on behalf of the Jutathep family

304
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
would like to invite you
to return to the Dhevaprom Palace.

305
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,960
Please let us Jutatheps take care
of the Dhevaproms like we always have.

306
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,560
And I'd like to ask your permission

307
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,440
to take care of your daughter
and have her be part of my life.

308
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,000
And from now on, I promise--

309
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,960
Don't promise.

310
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,600
There will be no more promises

311
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,560
between the Jutatheps and Dhevaproms.

312
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,640
From now on, you must prove

313
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,960
your feelings with appropriate action.

314
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,280
Don't make worthless promises
to tie each other down.

315
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,920
You love my daughter, right?

316
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,320
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,240
I never believed in requited love
because I never experienced it.

318
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,800
And I don't trust any man's word.

319
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,520
But my daughter loves you.

320
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,120
You will make her happy, won't you?

321
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
I won't make any promises.

322
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,040
I'll show you that you can trust me.

323
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,600
Take care of her well.

324
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,440
She's suffered a lot
having a weak mom like me.

325
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,920
Be kind to her

326
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,120
and most importantly,

327
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,840
take care of yourself well.

328
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,800
Don't let yourself get sick.

329
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
And don't die before her.

330
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
It's nothing but distress

331
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,840
for the one who is left behind.

332
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,480
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,080
I'll take care of Fah as best as I can.

334
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,200
And as soon as she is discharged,

335
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,040
we'll go to the Dhevaprom Palace
to ask for her hand right away.

336
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Please accept this.

337
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,960
Hey,

338
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,560
let's give them a round of applause.

339
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,560
I love you, Fah.

340
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,640
DHEVAPROM PALACE

341
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,880
Rumpa.

342
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,080
Is your room like it used to be?

343
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,640
I've prepared everything for you.

344
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,960
Fah's room is next to yours.

345
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,520
I'm happy

346
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,400
that we're reunited again.

347
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,800
I didn't think
we would get to do this again.

348
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,800
Our lives aren't as blessed as yours, Ked.

349
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,840
I should have listened to you that day.

350
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,760
Well, you didn't know
what would happen then.

351
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,600
Besides, we were still young and thought
the world would be on our side.

352
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,480
But we ended up learning the hard way.

353
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,480
So why did you give in to them?

354
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,240
They were so mean to you.

355
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,480
Why did you let your daughter
get together with Pat's son?

356
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,320
What about you?
Why did you give in to them?

357
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,440
Fah got together with Chai Yai's son.

358
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,720
If it were the son of Phee and that woman,

359
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,920
I don't know if I'd be able to accept it.

360
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,000
In the end, we have to accept it.

361
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,480
If we want our children to be happy.

362
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,560
At the very least,

363
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,400
we should learn something

364
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,080
from our past mistakes.

365
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,920
Rumpa.

366
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,040
Do you still hold a grudge
against Phee and Peangkwan?

367
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,560
I'm not sure when I stopped hating them.

368
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,520
But I can't say I don't feel anything.

369
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,040
If I have to smile at her…

370
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,440
I don't know if I…

371
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,800
if I can do it.

372
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,280
It's okay, Rumpa.

373
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,400
It's okay if you still can't do that.

374
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,720
Give yourself time.

375
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,120
Let time heal you.

376
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,920
I'll always be here for you.

377
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,480
The only person I feel I've wronged

378
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,200
and who I want to apologize to

379
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,280
is you, Rumpa.

380
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,720
Your life was ruined

381
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,920
because of me.

382
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,840
I was also in the wrong.

383
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,040
Due to my wrath and vengeance,

384
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,520
I persuaded you to do it.

385
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,960
I made you do something terrible.

386
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
And in the end,

387
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,040
the person who was hurt the most by it

388
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,040
was you.

389
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
I'm sorry.

390
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,920
I'm sorry.

391
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,720
I'm sorry, Rumpa.

392
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,360
Maratee.

393
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,240
We have suffered enough over this.

394
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,760
It's time for us to be happy.

395
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,080
All right, Rumpa, Maratee?

396
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,360
Yes, Ked.

397
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,080
I'm happy to hear this.

398
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,800
Please forgive me.

399
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Oh my.

400
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,400
What a strange sight to see you at home.

401
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm not going anywhere today.

402
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,760
No one can move me off this sofa.

403
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,600
Is that so?

404
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,640
I'll leave then.

405
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,640
Ploy.

406
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,600
You'll never get married
looking like that.

407
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,040
It has been quite exhausting, hasn't it?

408
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,040
Yes.

409
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,120
I feel like I've been to war.

410
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,280
Since I found out
that Fah is Aunt Rumpa's daughter,

411
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
I haven't been able to sleep.

412
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,720
And I got the wrong end of the stick.

413
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm sorry.

414
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,400
It wasn't your fault.

415
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,040
It was my fault for not telling you.

416
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,600
I panicked.

417
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,120
I didn't know how to handle it.

418
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,520
Well then, let's not keep anything
from each other from now on.

419
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,680
Definitely.

420
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,520
You can trust me.

421
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,360
I think you did a great job

422
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,240
handling all this.

423
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,160
You took care of your sister and cousin

424
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,960
while being the pillar
of the Dhevaprom family.

425
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,720
You're so cool.

426
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,720
Ploy, you're making me blush.

427
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,120
Can't I compliment my future husband?

428
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,720
You can.

429
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,000
What?

430
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,520
What did you say again?
Your future husband?

431
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,120
Hey,

432
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,160
are you serious?

433
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,960
Vit.

434
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,320
Keep it down.

435
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,760
You'll startle Mrs. Ked.

436
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,800
Didn't you say you weren't ready?

437
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,200
Didn't you say

438
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,960
there were still many things
for you to take care of?

439
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,320
I think I was just scared.

440
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,160
But now,

441
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,080
you have changed yourself
just as you promised me.

442
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,520
I can see that you're serious about us.

443
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,720
It makes me want to take it seriously too.

444
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Whatever I do,

445
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,200
let's do it together.

446
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Ploy.

447
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,040
I'm so happy.

448
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,400
You can't change your mind now.

449
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,680
Dad! Mom!

450
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,920
-Lisa!
-Vit.

451
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,960
I think they heard you, Vit.

452
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,720
Me too.

453
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,160
Were you so excited
you forgot about your other sister?

454
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,000
What is that, Dad?

455
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,720
This is our family jewelry box

456
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,000
and the engagement ring we got for Ploy.

457
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,280
Hey, Dad and Mom have been polishing it
every day waiting for this moment.

458
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,560
Yes.

459
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,120
Before you say anything,
put the ring on her.

460
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,000
I'll ask for her hand from Chai Yai later.

461
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,440
Aren't you supposed to ask
for her hand before I put on the ring?

462
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,480
-Gosh.
-It might be too late.

463
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,400
What if Ploy changes her mind?

464
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,400
I won't change my mind.

465
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,320
My gosh.

466
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,040
Let's enjoy our life together from now on.

467
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,560
-Lisa.
-Oh, right.

468
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,440
Let's finish it.

469
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,200
Kwan.

470
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,520
I can't take Rumpa into my care

471
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,000
without asking you first
if you're okay with it.

472
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,760
It's true that Vilairumpa and I
didn't use to get on.

473
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,720
And to be honest,

474
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,920
if it weren't for the Jutathep family,

475
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,640
I'd never want to be friends with her.

476
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,840
In the past,

477
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,480
she tried to kill Grandma Eied
and blame me.

478
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,960
And now,

479
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,960
she's tried to harm our kids.

480
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Personally, I can't make myself
friends with someone like that.

481
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,160
However,

482
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,720
I can't cut the Jutathep family
out of my life.

483
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,240
Over the years,

484
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,640
I've realized that

485
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,840
I'd have been hurt too

486
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,720
if I were Vilairumpa.

487
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,920
And from what I've heard,

488
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,400
she has suffered enough.

489
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,040
Does this mean

490
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,840
you can accept her now?

491
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,480
I'm old enough

492
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,760
not to get jealous of my husband anymore.

493
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,520
I'm more worried
about her behavior and her illness.

494
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,920
Are you sure you're not jealous?

495
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,120
These days,

496
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,280
I still get jealous
when people stare at you.

497
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,680
You two are too much.

498
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
Congratulations, Petch.

499
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,720
Everything ended perfectly.

500
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,640
You got us all a new cousin.

501
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,960
-Gosh.
-Right.

502
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,240
I really appreciate your help.

503
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,480
-No worries.
-It was nothing.

504
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,160
We're always ready to help you,

505
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,480
apart from one person.

506
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,720
What? I helped him the most.

507
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,120
If it weren't for me,

508
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,040
you and Fah wouldn't be together.

509
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,360
I see.

510
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,280
If you hadn't helped me…

511
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,760
You wouldn't have got together
with Fah, right?

512
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,760
I'd have two kids by now.

513
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,680
Come on.

514
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,960
So will our dads let Ms. Rumpa
meet Great-Grandma Orn?

515
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,720
I think we'll have to wait for her
to get a little better.

516
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,520
But she's a lot better already.

517
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,440
What do you think, Chat?

518
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,680
I'm concerned about Ms. Rumpa's condition.

519
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,120
I thought everybody said
she was a lot better.

520
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,440
Psychiatric patients
don't recover just like that.

521
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,320
Wouldn't you agree, Chat?

522
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,240
Yes.

523
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,680
Ms. Rumpa seemed to be hiding
her symptoms to put everyone at ease.

524
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,360
I noticed that too.

525
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:22,800
She seemed tense
as if she was trying to hide her stress.

526
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,840
But she already
talked things out with Phee.

527
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,080
Why would she get worse?

528
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,040
I can only think of one reason.

529
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,000
Uncle Phee

530
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,080
isn't the true cause of her condition.

531
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,160
Haven't you eaten anything, Mom?

532
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,560
Can't you sleep?

533
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,200
How many days has it been?

534
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,720
I'm going to prescribe her
an anxiolytic and sleeping pills.

535
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,440
But I want you to keep them

536
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,320
and administer them to her

537
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,720
because they're quite strong.

538
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,200
I brought the medicine
you take before bed.

539
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,720
Please take them.

540
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,240
I'll go to the toilet first

541
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,840
and take them myself before bed.

542
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,320
Mom.

543
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,760
Are you really okay?

544
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,080
Yes.

545
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,160
Okay.

546
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,720
This way, please.

547
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,120
Let's go.

548
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,240
Welcome home, Rumpa.

549
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,880
Vilairumpa.

550
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,280
Madam Orn is here.

551
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,840
Rumpa.

552
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,960
My dear Rumpa.

553
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,440
If it's not Ronnaphee,

554
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,160
then who is it?

555
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,640
Grandma Orn.

556
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,160
Rumpa.

557
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,080
My dear Rumpa.

558
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,400
Please come back to me, dear.

559
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,640
Mom!

560
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,840
Rumpa.

561
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,640
Rumpa.

562
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,240
-Mom.
-Rumpa.

563
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,520
-Rumpa.
-Rumpa.

564
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,480
Petch, take Fah out for tea.

565
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,280
You shouldn't be moping around
on a nice day like this.

566
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,240
It's all right.

567
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,880
I'll stay and watch over my mom.

568
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,040
Just do what I tell you.

569
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,440
I'll watch over her for you.

570
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,680
I want to look at her face
as I haven't done that for so long.

571
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,840
-Okay. We'll be right back.
-Okay.

572
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,640
Look after Great-Grandma.

573
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,960
Yes, sir.

574
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,480
It's time for your medicine, ma'am.
I'll get it for you.

575
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,520
Does that mean Rumpa is like this,
not because of Phee,

576
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,600
but because of Grandma Orn?

577
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,600
I can't confirm that.

578
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,000
It's just my assumption.

579
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,880
But Chat and Kwan noticed

580
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,240
that Rumpa's condition hadn't improved

581
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,040
even after talking to Phee.

582
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,520
When I spoke to her, she seemed as though
she had almost fully recovered.

583
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,960
The atmosphere might have made
her that way.

584
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,600
Maybe Rumpa wants to believe
that she's fine,

585
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,520
which might have made her more stressed.

586
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,160
I see.

587
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,880
You're right.

588
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,840
And where is Grandma Orn?

589
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,800
Don't worry.
She's with Joom at the moment.

590
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,000
Okay.

591
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,400
-Here is your medicine.
-Put it on the table.

592
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,400
Take me to the toilet now
so I can be back here

593
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,000
before Rumpa wakes up.

594
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,520
Sure.

595
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm going to prescribe her
an anxiolytic and sleeping pills.

596
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,400
But I want you to keep them

597
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,320
and administer them to her

598
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,840
because they're quite strong.

599
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,320
If your mom takes too many,

600
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,200
they could be dangerous.

601
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,520
No.

602
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,760
I won't do this again.

603
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,560
I…

604
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,720
I didn't…

605
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,440
No.

606
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,920
Joom, leave us. I want to talk to her.

607
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,880
But…

608
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,600
Just do as I say.

609
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,640
But I've been told to--

610
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,040
Get out.

611
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,880
I've missed you so much, dear.

612
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,040
I dream of you every night.

613
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,400
I was worried about you.

614
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,360
My dear.

615
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,880
How have you been all these years?

616
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,840
I'm very sorry.

617
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,760
Then why did you abandon me?

618
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,000
What did you say?

619
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,960
Why did you abandon me?

620
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,720
If you were worried about me
and missed me,

621
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,680
why did you abandon me that day?

622
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,080
I didn't abandon you, dear.

623
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,600
You did!

624
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,680
You're too old to remember.

625
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,200
But I remember everything
that happened that day.

626
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,080
You and Lady Eied turned your backs on me

627
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,360
and hugged that bitch, Peangkwan.

628
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,240
You pampered her and said

629
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,000
that she would join the Jutatheps

630
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,760
when I was standing right there.

631
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,640
Rumpa.

632
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,360
You all were staring at me.

633
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,440
I never forgot those eyes.

634
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,360
And what was more painful was

635
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,240
you insulted me in front of everyone.

636
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,680
You said I was pitiful

637
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,000
and that I was evil, thoughtless, and mad!

638
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,080
I… Rumpa.

639
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,480
Who raised me?

640
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,280
Who made me this way?

641
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,960
Who was it that raised me? Who?

642
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,640
I… Rumpa.

643
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,160
I never had a mom.

644
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,840
You were all I had.

645
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,640
You were like my mom.

646
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,680
You…

647
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,360
You hugged me to sleep

648
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,400
when I had bad dreams.

649
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,520
And you said I'd get to marry Phee.

650
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,880
And I'd get to stay
in this palace with you.

651
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,760
I'd get to be here with you forever.

652
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,960
Rumpa.

653
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,440
Rumpa.

654
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,480
Rumpa.

655
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,520
When someone came to replace me,

656
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,840
you abandoned me right away.

657
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,720
You never gave me a chance to explain

658
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,640
why I did what I did.

659
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,040
Rumpa.

660
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,200
Madam Orn,

661
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,520
do you even love me?

662
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,120
Yes, I love you. I'm sorry.

663
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,520
You're lying.

664
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,040
Stop lying already.

665
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,160
You…

666
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,440
never loved me for who I am.

667
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,800
You only love the ones
who marry into the Jutatheps.

668
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,560
I do. I love you.

669
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,400
I love you, dear.

670
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,440
When I couldn't be your in-law anymore,

671
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,760
you chased me out like a dog.

672
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,720
Did you ever love me?

673
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,520
I'm sorry.

674
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,120
I'm sorry.

675
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,600
You were the only one I had.

676
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,480
I'm sorry.

677
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,160
I'm sorry.

678
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,320
I'm sorry.

679
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,400
I'm sorry, dear.

680
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,040
You abandoned me.

681
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,560
Why?

682
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,640
Why did you abandon me?

683
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,840
I didn't abandon you.

684
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,640
Rumpa, I'm sorry.

685
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,280
I have never been happy
since you disappeared.

686
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,240
I've missed you.

687
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,880
I've missed my little girl.

688
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,400
I love you.

689
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,800
Come back and stay with me, dear.

690
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,040
Come back and stay with me.

691
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,840
I'm sorry.

692
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,320
Take good care of my daughter, Petch.

693
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,480
Yes, ma'am.

694
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,320
A big brother…

695
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,840
doesn't have to sacrifice all the time.

696
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,960
I want to thank all of you

697
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,960
and apologize for what I did.

698
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,720
Especially you two, Mr. Poom and Mr. Jak.

699
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,080
It's all right.

700
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,080
It's okay.

701
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,960
Aunt Maprang asked me
to give you something, Petch.

702
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,800
Gosh.

703
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,880
Here you go, Petch.

704
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,200
-Propose!
-Propose!

705
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,120
-Propose!
-Propose!

706
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,440
-Propose!
-Enough.

707
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,360
Can't I do it in private?

708
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,520
-Come on.
-No, Petch. That's a waste of time.

709
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,320
Get up. You're already behind us.

710
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,840
-Come on, get up.
-Come on, Fah.

711
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,680
-This way, Fah.
-Hurry up, Petch. Get up.

712
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,800
Come on.

713
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,720
Come here.

714
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,960
If you propose to her now,

715
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,960
I'll let you get married before me.

716
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,760
But once your wedding is over,

717
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,360
don't forget to help me with my wedding.

718
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,040
I'm sorry.

719
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,279
-What is it this time?
-What?

720
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,600
I'm sorry for approaching you
with bad intentions.

721
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,120
I'm sorry for being tight-lipped

722
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,120
when you asked if I loved you.

723
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:48,640
I love you.

724
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,760
You're the only one I love
and it's always been you.

725
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,040
And I'll love you forever.

726
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,080
I love you too.

727
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,880
-Look at them.
-My gosh.

728
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,160
Hey, give them a clap.
What are you waiting for?

729
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,600
What are you thinking?

730
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,920
I was thinking that life is strange.

731
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,760
It's strange that
I ended up at Jutathep Palace.

732
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,600
In my head, it was always like

733
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,560
an evil witch's castle.

734
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,240
But the princess in this tale

735
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,400
didn't come to fall in love
with the prince.

736
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,480
She came for revenge.

737
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,720
-Fah.
-Fah.

738
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,240
Finally.

739
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,000
You're part of the Jutathep family.

740
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,640
-Please stand here.
-Move back a little.

741
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,280
-Okay.
-That's it.

742
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,760
Here are some flowers.

743
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,880
Okay.

744
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,080
One, two, three.

745
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,560
THE END

746
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,560
DUJUPSORN DONE FILMING IN CHIANG MAI

747
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,680
DONE FILMING

748
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,880
