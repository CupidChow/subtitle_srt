3
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,451
Yes, chief. It's definitely suicide.

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,951
We'll secure the evidence
and wrap up the investigation.

5
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:16,185
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

6
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,518
This isn't suicide.

7
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,585
This isn't suicide. It's a murder.

8
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,251
It's a homicide case.

9
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:31,985
Yes, I understand. Have a nice day.

10
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:34,818
Detective, sir, I'm serious.

11
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:38,151
Last night, some man
lit the charcoal briquette in that car...

12
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:39,951
Did you witness it yourself?

13
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,051
No.

14
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,385
Sir.

15
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:53,418
This isn't like the detective dramas
you were in.

16
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:56,485
This isn't a joke. It's reality.

17
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:59,551
You can't even distinguish it
from reality.

18
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:03,318
He says it's nonsense.

(Homicide Team One)

21
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:15,318
I heard you argued with YouTuber Jjumi
at a cafe last night.

22
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:19,551
According to a witness,
it even got physical.

23
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:23,185
Well, we said a few words...

24
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:26,118
and got emotional in the process.

25
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:29,751
There was some pushing and tugging,
but it wasn't that serious.

26
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:32,851
There was a message on Jjumi's cell phone,
which seemed to be a will.

27
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,318
It read that she suddenly grew afraid
of the world and hated everything...

28
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:38,018
after arguing with Kim Yong Gun.

29
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:43,251
She felt skeptical about her job
as the Mocking Burd.

30
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:48,985
What did you do and where were you
after the argument at the cafe?

31
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,985
I went home and had drinks
with my colleagues...

32
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:54,451
who were at the cafe with me.

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:57,185
You can check with them.

34
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,651
Yes, I understand.

35
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,785
Don't blame yourself too much for it.

36
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:05,151
You are the only person...

37
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:07,118
on the list of potential suspects,

38
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:09,351
but there doesn't seem to be anything
to be held accountable.

39
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:13,185
Yes, but still...

40
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:17,218
I feel bad to hear that such
a young person has died.

41
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,118
Jjumi.

42
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:28,151
You should've lived shamelessly
like the way you increased subscribers...

43
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,085
by mocking people on YouTube.

44
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,085
How did such a young person
take her own life...

45
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:36,185
You startled me!

46
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,418
Darn it.

47
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,385
I'm sorry. I thought you saw me.

48
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:45,551
Hey, I have poor visibility
when I'm preoccupied.

49
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,351
Anyway, what brings...

50
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:49,618
a precinct officer to the headquarters?

51
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:55,251
Detective Yuk, I was thinking through...

52
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:56,385
the Jjumi case.

53
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,451
And I have a feeling
it might not have been suicide...

54
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:01,651
Hey, on what grounds
are you saying such things?

55
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:06,618
I watched Jjumi's videos on YouTube
from time to time.

56
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:09,118
And Jjumi was the type to kill someone,

57
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:10,918
but never someone who would kill herself.

58
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,585
Return to the precinct.

59
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,585
Why don't we listen
to Mr. Lee Soon Jae a bit more?

60
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,485
He lives within our jurisdiction.

61
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:23,118
His testimony included,
"Last night, man, charcoal briquette."

62
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,651
Isn't it a little specific?

63
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:27,918
Mr. Lee Soon Jae said he didn't
witness the case in person.

64
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,751
I asked him who told him about it
and he couldn't answer.

65
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:32,485
What do you think this means?

66
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:35,351
A testimony based on assumption?

67
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,618
No. He's in the early phase of dementia.

68
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,318
Haven't you read the articles
of his urine terror incident?

69
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:43,785
Return to the precinct right now!

How annoying.

89

- Hold on.
- Give this to me.

90

91
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:57,518

Why won't this work?

96
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,485
Is it discriminating against
the elderly or what?

97
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,385
- Forget it. Let's just go.
- What?

98
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:13,451
We need to give Yong Gun tofu
when he returns from the police station.

99

and drive off.

107
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,451
Hold on. Is that Aunt Su Jeong?

108
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,818
Aunt Su Jeong?

109
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:56,318

- Stop!

119
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:39,085
The pumpkin...

120
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:41,251
- He got away.
- What?

121
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,651
I missed him.

122
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:45,785
My knees...

123
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,118
That rotten punk!

124
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:51,951
We must catch that guy and crush his head
just like this pumpkin.

125
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:54,885
Did you see his license plate number?
I've become farsighted with old age.

126

- But I forgot it.
- My gosh.

129
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,785
Hold on. That vehicle has a dashcam.

130
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:10,351
A dashcam!

131
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,951
It must have caught the scene
from this angle.

132
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,185
You're right.

133
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,151

feel great when you get out of it.

I'm starving.

138
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:33,818
What's the matter? Move out of the way.

139
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:38,351
There's a phone number here.

140
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:39,651
The phone number!

141
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:42,218
Hey...

142
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:43,918
Get out of the way.

143
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,018
You might scratch the vehicle
while lingering around it.

144
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,551
Hey, do you know how much
this vehicle costs?

145
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,485
No, forget it.

146
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:53,851
Why am I asking a man who can't even pay
for a 30-dollar membership fee?

147
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:56,851
The number is here,
but I can't see it clearly.

148
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,918
What?

149
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:04,518
In this case, take a picture and zoom in.

150
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,751
- Hold on. It's zero, one, zero.
- It always starts with zero, one, zero.

151
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:11,818
- Zero, six, four, eight.
- Okay, zero, six, four, eight.

152
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:13,085
Nine, two, four, eight.

153
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:17,551
My cell phone.

154
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,618
- It's Kim Yong Gun!
- Kim Yong Gun!

155
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:39,318
Excuse me! Move quickly!

156
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,685
It's Kim Yong Gun, the murderer!

157
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:42,885
Everyone, shameless Kim Yong Gun,

158
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:44,451
who led YouTuber Jjumi
to commit suicide, is here.

159
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,585
You murderer!

160
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:46,918
What? A murderer?

161
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,885
What did I do?

162
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:51,318
Kim Yong Gun,
our Jjumi died because of you!

163
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,085
- Murderer!
- Save Jjumi!

164
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,451
Murderer Kim Yong Gun should retire!

165
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,851
- Retire!
- Retire!

166
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:58,318
- Wait...
- Retire!

167
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,018
- Retire!
- Retire!

168
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:05,751
- What?
- He's running away!

169
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,085
Save her!

170
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,151
He's running away!

171
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,918
Did she really die because of me?

172
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:28,985
Soon Jae, what should I do if she did?

173
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,418
How can I deal with that guilt?

174
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:34,185
This is so frustrating.

175
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:35,685
It isn't suicide.

176
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,151
No.

177
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:42,018
You weren't the reason for her suicide,
so don't be bothered by it.

178
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:46,851
You're talking like a witness.

179
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,851
Anyway, thank you.

180
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,818
I need to visit somewhere,

181
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:00,885
so follow the GPS.

182
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,085
Soon Jae, wait.

183
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:12,251
Seriously,

184
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:17,051
that man really seems crazy at times.

185
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,051
(Eun Ha Noodles)

186
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:26,051
(Break Time, 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.)

187
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:28,551
My goodness!

188
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,685
You startle me every time.

189
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,451
You should know that it's break time.

190
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,885
You must be here to see me.

191
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,685
Hey, you said that YouTuber lady
was murdered earlier.

192
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,085
What was that about?

193
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,185
Tell me about it in detail.

194
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,518
Do I have to answer your questions?

195
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,751
What?

196
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,318
And it's past my snack time,
but where have these people gone?

197
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,451
Talk about having no manners.

198
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:51,585
This is why I bite their slippers.

199
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,751
And I'm always the bad dog.

200
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,385
Isn't that right?

201
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:56,251
I can't believe this.

202
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,051
I was a little feisty earlier, right?

203
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:15,518
As I get older,

204
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:18,118
I get moody when my sugar levels drop.

205
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:21,518
Yes, I know that very well.

206
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:23,385
Young people wouldn't have a clue.

207
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:25,851
Yes, it's nice to meet a person
I can communicate with.

208
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,918
This feels nice.

209
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:30,885
By the way, you asked me why
that woman's death wasn't suicide, right?

210
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:33,785
Can you tell me about it now?

211
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:35,851
The fact that I've shown
my belly to you like this...

212
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,085
means I'm all open to you.

213
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,551
Do you remember Gussi
from earlier this morning?

214
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,418
Gussi is a dog from Chungcheong-do...

215
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,951
and it's been a year since
he was abandoned in Geoje.

216
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:48,318
Gussi witnessed the murder that night.

217
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:55,551
What's happening to our neighborhood?

218
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,551
I know, right?

219
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:07,851
(Gussi)

220
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:10,251
Hey, Gussi.

221
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:11,785
Hey, Sophie!

222
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:13,818
What's going on?

223
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,485
This is outrageous.

224
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,085
There was a murder.

225
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,118
I think it's undoubtedly suicide.

226
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,785
She lit a charcoal briquette.

227
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,285
Identify the body first.

228
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:26,551
Why is that cop blabbing such nonsense?

229
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:29,485
It was an evident homicide. I saw it.

230
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:41,085
Honestly, that night,

231
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:43,885
I went to the lighthouse
to feast my eyes yet again.

232
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:47,718
That's the spot where lovers get intimate
in their cars.

233
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,485
Just in time, a car pulled over.

234
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,451
But they didn't do
what I had been anticipating.

235
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:58,051
All they did was drink and chat
for two hours.

236
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:01,785
I thought there was nothing to see,
so I was about to go home.

237
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,418
But then, it happened.

238
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:21,351
(Charcoal briquette)

239
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,118
That means Gussi is the only witness.

240
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:46,651
Let's meet Gussi to find out more details.

241
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:47,518
Where does Gussi live?

242
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:50,051
He doesn't reside in a designated place.

243
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:53,318
He'd be a wanderer if he were a person.

244
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:55,651
But there must be areas
where he frequently appears.

245
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,318
Now take the lead.

246
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,651
You have arrived at your destination.

247
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,585
The guide will end.

248
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:12,151
Why did Soon Jae ask me to come here?

249
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:26,651
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,085
It's okay.

251
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:36,918
Dad!

252
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,151
Se Gyeong, what brings you here?

253
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:42,685
Did Mr. Lee send you here?

254
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:45,518
Then have you been
staying in contact with Soon Jae...

255
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,985
when you've been ignoring me?

256
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,218
It can't be helped.
I find Mr. Lee more comfortable.

257
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:55,518
(Eun Ha Noodles)

258
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,351
Here are your anchovy noodles.

259
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:58,985
- Yes.
- Yes.

260
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:00,351
Thank you.

261
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,385
- Yes.
- Thank you.

262
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:04,651
- Enjoy.
- Yes. Thank you.

263
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:06,218
This looks good.

264
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:07,785
Let's eat, Se Gyeong.

265
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:13,385
- But Dad, are you okay?
- Yes?

266
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:15,818
People are blaming you
for the Mocking Burd incident.

267
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:18,051
It's all over the internet.

268
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,385
That's not true, so don't worry.

269
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:26,051
By the way, you never called me.
How can you do this to me?

270
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,485
You never told me that you changed
your phone number either.

271
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:32,018
I mean, that's because
you kept avoiding my calls...

272
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,418
and refused to talk to me.

273
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,718
Have you been eating well?

274
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:38,585
Yes.

275
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:41,518
You're a dermatologist,
yet your face looks terrible.

276
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:43,218
Does it?

277
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:46,651
Se Gyeong, save my number.

278
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:47,751
I'll save it after I finish eating.

279
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,118
Save it first and continue eating.

280
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,718
Why do you have that picture
on your cell phone?

281
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,518
I couldn't be bothered to change it.

282
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:04,718
Give it to me. I'll change it for you.

283
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,551
Are you a fool?

284
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,551
Why have you saved a photo
of a runaway groom...

285
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,018
on your cell phone?

286
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:14,151
This is why I'm only staying in touch
with Mr. Lee!

287
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,685
He doesn't bother me like this!

288
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,685
He simply watches.

289
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,185
So just give it to me!

290
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,985
I'll change it myself.

291
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,685
I'll change it.

292
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:53,451
Cho Won, you're not sleeping yet, right?

293
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:54,685
Yes, Mom.

294
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,018
Where are you going
after working all night?

295
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:09,918
I was thinking of going to a cafe
for some coffee.

296
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:16,251
What?

297
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:17,951
Are you dating someone?

298
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:21,385
No.

299
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:23,618
Not yet.

300
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:25,251
"Not yet?"

301
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:28,018
Does that mean you'll soon be dating?

302
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:30,918
Picking at words to investigate...

303
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,551
and asking leading questions
are forbidden.

304
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,718
Hey, you shouldn't choose a man
just by his looks.

305
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:39,018
Then what else can I judge a man with?

306
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,251
Seriously...

307
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,951
Earlier on at the restaurant,
you know actor Kim Yong Gun, right?

308
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:46,585
He came with his daughter.

309
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:47,451
Really?

310
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:50,318
But his daughter looks so pretty.

311
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:55,185
Anyway, the groom ran off...

312
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:56,385
on that daughter's wedding day.

313
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:59,418
The groom didn't come to the wedding?

314
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:01,551
No way.

315
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:05,018
So a man is all about responsibility
and loyalty, okay?

316
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,518
These are what you must regard
when making a decision.

317
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,451
Or else it needs to be canceled
or returned.

318
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:12,351
Yes, Mom.
Let's keep that in mind together.

319
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,285
I'll be back.

320
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:16,851
Keep what in mind together?

321
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:18,685
Why should I? What do you mean?

322
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,818
The older she gets,

323
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:27,051
the more she takes after that man.

324
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:33,051
Customer number ten, your coffee is ready.

325
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,318
Enjoy.

326
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,018
Thank you.

327
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:27,585
What's this?

328
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:28,985
Is he coming to me?

329
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,918
What is this?

330
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,085
My goodness, what should I do?

331
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:39,651
What?

332
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,551
Excuse me.

333
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,785
What were you doing just now?

334
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:51,185
What do you mean? What? Why?

335
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:52,951
I was taking pictures, I mean...

336
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:56,318
I think I was reading this book. Yes.

337
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,618
You seemed to be filming that woman
over there without her consent.

338
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,285
Hey! What do you think...

339
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,918
It's no big deal.

340
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:05,418
What do you mean I filmed her?

341
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,151
Is this how you treat your customers?

342
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,018
It's no big deal.

343
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:13,318
Do you want your business to close down?

344
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,251
May I check your cell phone?

345
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,818
I'll give you my sincere apology
if I was mistaken.

346
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:19,318
Have you seriously gone crazy?

347
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,951
Can you take responsibility
for your words?

348
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:25,285
I'll sue you.

349
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,618
Let me check your cell phone.

350
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:30,218
You're a strange man!

351
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,451
Why are you trying to look
at someone else's cell phone?

352
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:34,151
Seriously, what a strange man!

353
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,385
What's wrong with him?

354
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,118
Nothing happened.

355
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,051
Excuse me!

356
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:51,251
(Surveillance camera in operation)

357
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:19,018
By any chance, do you know the man
who rushed out just now?

358
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:21,451
No, not at all.

359
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:25,418
That man was secretly taking photos
of you. Didn't you notice?

360
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:30,985
He must be the perverted stalker
from yesterday.

361
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:34,885
Did he just unlawfully take pictures of me
without my consent?

362
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:42,051
That's a violation of the Special Act on
the Punishment of Sexual Violence Crimes.

363
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,551
I should have caught him in the action.

364
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:49,051
I'm sorry. I asked
to see his cell phone...

365
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,251
and he suddenly ran off.

366
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:54,718
No. That's not what I meant.

367
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:57,118
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,951
I see.

369
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,151
You should be careful
because he might show up again.

370
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:05,251
Good day.

371
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:11,585
I must have been too eager
about work again.

372
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:14,051
I'll have a cup of iced Americano...

373
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:16,585
I guess he wouldn't be interested...

374
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:20,318
in a woman with fierce eyes
who catches criminals, would he?

375
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:23,051
- Three orders, right?
- Yes.

376
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:41,218
How adorable.

377
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:49,385
(Rest in peace.)

378
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:12,551
Thank you.

379
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,518
This is Jeong Ha Yun,
a YouTube content producer...

380
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,851
and Jjumi's boyfriend.

381
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:19,285
He was in Jeju-do...

382
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:21,651
and rushed to Geoje-do this morning
after hearing the news.

383
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:25,885
Thank you for paying tribute to Jjumi.

384
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:31,718
Something like this
must never happen again.

385
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:35,451
We plan to visit Kim Yong Gun
to receive an apology...

386
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:37,585
and live stream this on YouTube.

387
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:39,418
Would you like to join us?

388
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,918
I'm sorry,

389
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,051
but I'd prefer to spend the day quietly.

390
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:51,385
Is anyone here?

391
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:55,051
What? Has it not opened yet?

392
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:57,885
We came here because we're craving
a greasy cheeseburger.

393
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:00,485
Where is everyone?

394
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,785
That's the boy we met
at the ice cream store earlier.

395
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:11,985
Please choose the items to order.

396
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:13,318
(Bulgogi Burger)

397
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,685
After selecting the items,
please press the complete button.

398
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:19,785
Will the order be for takeout?

399
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:26,385
Please insert the credit card
into the card reader.

400
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:30,351
The payment is complete.

401
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:31,751
Please take your receipt.

402
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:37,851
Kid, you can't eat hamburgers
because there's no staff here.

403
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,518
- This place is normally unmanned.
- What?

404
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:42,618
(Cooking, 201)

405
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:43,985
(Pickup Box, 201)

406
00:24:48,985 --> 00:24:50,185
(Box Five,
your delicious meal is ready.)

407
00:24:52,385 --> 00:24:54,918
(Pickup Box Five)

408
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,218
I think we've lived for too long.

409
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:07,018
You're so smart.

410
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:09,551
How are you so good
at such complicated things?

411
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,051
- This is easy.
- What?

412
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,418
Yes. Since this granny is about
to starve to death,

413
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:15,118
can you teach us how to buy the burger?

414
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:18,951
No. I'm late for my academy.

415
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:22,751
That kid...

416
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:26,518
That rascal is ignoring us, isn't he?

417
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:29,485
We now live in a world
where old people like us...

418
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:32,585
can't even buy ice cream to eat
or order hamburgers.

419
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:35,085
I've only just learned
how to use a smartphone.

420
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:37,751
Forget it. Let's stick to our usual diet.

421
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:39,251
Let's go. I'll cook scorched rice for you.

422
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:42,051
Scorched rice...

423
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:51,185
He said he was going to the academy,
but why is he sitting over there crying?

424
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:56,818
Why are you crying?

425
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:57,851
Did someone hit you?

426
00:25:58,351 --> 00:25:59,518
Or was your money stolen?

427
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,751
I forgot to do my homework.

428
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:08,085
You acted like such a smart kid,

429
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,585
but why did you forget
to do your homework?

430
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:11,718
Because I have too much homework.

431
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:13,518
I got confused because I had so much.

432
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:18,051
Then you can be honest with your teacher.

433
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:19,485
Why are you sitting here crying?

434
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:21,785
If I don't do my homework,
I must stay behind till 10 p.m...

435
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:24,051
to finish the rest of my studies.

436
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:26,051
Then I can't go to my English academy,

437
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,551
so I'll get into twice as much trouble
with my mom.

438
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:31,185
My goodness.

439
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:34,718
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

440
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:38,818
Yes, teacher.

441
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:42,551
Yong Bin has a fever,
so he won't be able to attend class today.

442
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:45,751
I'll let him rest at home today.

443
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:49,351
Yes, thank you.

444
00:26:51,718 --> 00:26:53,785
It's all sorted, right?

445
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:54,951
Yes.

446
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,918
You better keep your promise
to study harder at home...

447
00:26:56,918 --> 00:27:00,151
instead of going to the academy.

448
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,218
Yes, thank you.

449
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:07,351
The payment is complete.

450
00:27:07,851 --> 00:27:09,718
Please take your receipt.

451
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:11,751
Now you know how to place an order, right?

452
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:12,885
- Yes.
- Yes.

453
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:16,751
Now try doing it as I taught you.

454
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:18,785
Please choose the items to order.

455
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:23,551
After selecting the items,
please press the complete button.

456
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:24,051
(Chicken Burger)

457
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,018
Will the order be for takeout?

458
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:25,618
(Cheeseburger)

459
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:28,685
Please insert the credit card
into the card reader.

460
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,718
The payment is complete.

461
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,618
Mine has been ordered!

462
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:38,118
Place the barcode here?

463
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:39,251
(Box Five,
Knock on the box.)

464
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:43,751
Okay, I find the number that matches...

465
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:44,951
and knock on it.

466
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:48,185
- It really is being served!
- Yes!

467
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:50,785
Look at this.

468
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,285
It's delicious.

469
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:56,618
It tastes much better than scorched rice.

470
00:27:57,318 --> 00:27:59,051
It's delicious.

471
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:02,751
Did you order more?

472
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,451
I come across him at least
once daily when I roam around,

473
00:28:09,451 --> 00:28:10,618
but I don't see him today.

474
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:13,951
I'm sorry for not being able to help
after receiving snacks from you.

475
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:16,618
What did you say Gussi looks like?

476
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:20,551
A smelly mop that had been
left unwashed for about a year.

477
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:23,251
There he is.

478
00:28:33,818 --> 00:28:36,018
- What did he say?
- He said the culprit was in there.

479
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:43,651
The man wearing glasses
among the people over there...

480
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:47,218
is the man who ran off
after lighting the charcoal briquette.

481
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:57,551
I enjoyed the drinks.

482
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:01,485
Excuse me.

483
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:06,885
Yes?

484
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:10,485
Take your coffee coupon.

485
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:13,685
You received all ten stamps today.

486
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:17,451
Yes, thank you.

487
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,551
Please come again.

488
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:19,851
Okay.

489
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,385
Mr. Lee?

490
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:34,485
Hey, it's Lee Soon Jae.

491
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:38,618
Hey, turn yourself in
while I'm speaking nicely.

492
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:42,185
You're the one who killed YouTuber Jjumi.

493
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:45,651
What are you talking about?

494
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,885
What? No way.

495
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:51,785
Is Lee Soon Jae causing a fuss
as a means to take Kim Yong Gun's side?

496
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:53,885
Wait a minute.

497
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:56,785
Let's turn our cameras off
on a day like this.

498
00:29:56,785 --> 00:29:58,351
Mr. Lee Soon Jae,

499
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:00,951
quit talking nonsense and please leave.

500
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:03,151
Is that all you can say to the victim?

501
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:06,085
Are you taking it out on him after being
kicked out of the entertainment industry?

502
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:08,451
What a bunch of rude rascals!

503
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:11,418
You were with Jjumi
at the lighthouse last night!

504
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,585
You made Jjumi drink.

505
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:19,118
And when she fell asleep,

506
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:21,151
you pulled a charcoal briquette
from your backpack,

507
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:23,385
lit it with a lighter,
and placed it in the car.

508
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:26,151
And you lost the lighter you used
to light the fire. Am I right?

509
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,385
What's wrong with you?

510
00:30:28,385 --> 00:30:30,051
I'll call the police if you keep this up.

511
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:31,785
Yes, call the police.

512
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:33,251
Call the police and turn yourself in.

513
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:36,918
Tell them Kim Yong Gun
isn't behind Jjumi's death.

514
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,851
How can someone in Jeju-do
murder someone in Geoje last night?

515
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,451
This man took the morning flight
from Jeju-do...

516
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:46,551
to Geoje with me when he heard the news.

517
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:50,151
How on earth would he have
murdered someone last night?

518
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:51,118
Have you gone crazy?

519
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,918
He came to Geoje this morning?

520
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:56,418
If you don't believe me,
check his record with the airlines.

521
00:30:56,418 --> 00:30:57,485
I'm so angry.

522
00:30:57,485 --> 00:30:58,951
Do you think that makes sense?

523
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:00,551
Stop talking nonsense!

524
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,485
Mr. Lee.

525
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,918
Officer Hong.

526
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:07,985
I'm Officer Hong Cho Won
from Yeondeok Precinct.

527
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,585
Mr. Lee Soon Jae,

528
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,618
you mentioned the lighter
and charcoal briquette just now.

529
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:14,951
Did you witness these yourself?

530
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:20,051
Well, I didn't witness it myself.

531
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:25,351
Then you should be mindful
of what you say.

532
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:28,185
You could get charged for defamation
by spreading false information.

533
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:31,051
Kim Yong Gun and Lee Soon Jae,
we'll never forgive you.

534
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,351
Apologize right now!

535
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:33,585
Apologize!

536
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:34,985
Apologize right now!

537
00:31:34,985 --> 00:31:36,018
Go ahead and apologize!

538
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:38,318
- Hurry and apologize!
- Seriously.

539
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:55,285
We had hamburgers and ice cream.

540
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:57,751
We're capable of buying
and eating everything.

541
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:03,418
As human beings, I guess we're destined
to continue learning till we die.

542
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:06,585
How refreshing.

543
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:08,018
My goodness, it's refreshing.

544
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:10,285
Is it that refreshing
to just eat ice cream?

545
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:14,518
No, not this.
I'm talking about this massage chair.

546
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,685
The vibration is different.

547
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,285
It's so refreshing.

548
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:21,785
By the way,

549
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:25,551
that vehicle parked in front of
the ice cream store...

550
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:27,818
Have you heard from its owner yet?

551
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:29,918
We need to catch that delivery guy.

552
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:32,651
You're right. I even left a message
but haven't received a reply.

553
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,218
Should I call again since I'm bored?

554
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:45,051
Hey, Makeup.

555
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:46,885
- Yes?
- Stop calling.

556
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:50,885
The owner must have reasons
for not answering.

557
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,385
You can't keep calling someone
just because you're bored.

558
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:53,985
What's wrong with you?

559
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,751
I didn't call.

560
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:59,185
And even if I do, how is it
any of your business?

561
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,385
What's with you?

562
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:05,951
You didn't call?

563
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:19,151
(Son)

564
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:21,318
Okay.

565
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:23,018
Yes, I understand.

566
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:24,718
Yes, let's hang up.

567
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:17,318
My goodness.

568
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:19,151
What is this?

569
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:05,651
My goodness, you kept saying
that you didn't have money, too.

570
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:06,718
So you were rich.

571
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,151
How did you get such an expensive car?

572
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:10,851
Were you scared we'd ask you for money?

573
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:13,451
Tell us what's going on.

574
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:18,451
My son, his wife, and his children...

575
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,585
went to Hawaii on vacation without me.

576
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:26,818
I lived with them,
but they left without a word.

577
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,951
I sold my apartment in Gyeonggi-do...

578
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:36,185
for my son because he wanted
to run a vacation house business...

579
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:37,618
in Jeju-do.

580
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:43,018
So I no longer have a house
or car under my name.

581
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:46,718
I don't have a son...

582
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,485
or money either. I have nothing.

583
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:51,251
Goodness gracious.

584
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:54,285
But then, Yong Gun called me...

585
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,851
and asked me to come to Geoje.

586
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:58,118
That's why I came over.

587
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:02,518
With my son's favorite expensive car...

588
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:04,318
and a photo of myself.

589
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:10,985
I know he's your son, but I can't
help myself from cursing him.

590
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,885
That rude bastard.

591
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:15,418
He's such a rotten son.

592
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:18,651
My goodness, I'm so upset.
What a rotten kid.

593
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,918
I'll find the punk
who crushed my pumpkin...

594
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,918
and crush his pumpkin.

595
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:29,985
Hurry and look him up.

596
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:33,785
You even know how to open up
image files on a dashcam.

597
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,685
Soon Jae, you're great
at using the computer, too.

598
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:38,051
- Hey.
- Yes?

599
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:40,518
Soon Jae has watched a lot of porn
since he was young.

600
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:42,018
That's why he's adept with computers.

601
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:48,151
But there are no photos from today.

602
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,418
I guess it wasn't recorded on the dashcam.

603
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:51,385
Are you serious?

604
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:53,185
Does that mean
we can't find that pumpkin punk?

605
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:57,318
Hold on. Is the dashcam malfunctioning?

606
00:36:57,318 --> 00:36:59,485
It'll probably be expensive
to buy a new one.

607
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,851
I mean, I don't know where it was crushed,

608
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:03,951
but there are no files from today.

609
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:09,318
Why is this guy here?

610
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:16,818
(Video File 2299)

611
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:22,918
(Jeju)

612
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:29,618
Don't be too grief-stricken
and contact me when you come to Jeju.

613
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:31,051
Thank you.

614
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:32,718
Get home safe.

615
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:33,985
Cheer up, Producer Jeong.

616
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,218
Thank you.

617
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:48,785
(Jjumi)

618
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:51,585
(Jjumi)

619
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:55,518
Just a moment.

620
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:12,385
What's this?

621
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:14,918
Who's calling with Jjumi's number?

622
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:18,185
(Jjumi)

623
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,051
Jjumi.

624
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:44,885
Were you surprised?

625
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:46,351
That I'm alive?

626
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:49,418
Jjumi, what happened?

627
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:53,385
I've lost my voice...

628
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:55,218
because of you.

629
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:57,185
Because I inhaled the smoke
from the charcoal briquette you lit.

630
00:38:57,185 --> 00:39:00,185
Hey, wasn't using charcoal briquette
a bit extreme?

631
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:02,185
What are you talking about?

632
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:03,351
Are you playing innocent?

633
00:39:03,351 --> 00:39:06,318
You lit the charcoal briquette in the car
that night to kill me.

634
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:11,551
The police checked
all of my flight records.

635
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:14,785
It's been confirmed I came to Gimhae
from Jeju Airport yesterday morning.

636
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,951
So how would I, who had been in Jeju
the night before, kill you in Geoje?

637
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,385
Who would believe you?

638
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,185
Then would you believe this?

639
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,151
This face is obviously yours.

640
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:25,918
You sneaked in on a car ferry...

641
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:27,818
to create an alibi.

642
00:40:27,818 --> 00:40:31,685
Hey, do you think that can prove I came
to Geoje last night and murdered you?

643
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:36,418
This is the lighter that I gave you.

644
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:40,818
You thought you lost it, didn't you?

645
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:43,351
Things were so sweet
when I gave this to you.

646
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:45,085
I even engraved your initials on it.

647
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:48,885
But how can you light
a charcoal briquette with this?

648
00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:50,351
Isn't that just messed up?

649
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:53,818
But Jjumi, you're alive.

650
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,718
You survived anyway.

651
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:57,651
That's such a relief.

652
00:40:57,651 --> 00:41:01,685
That night, I must have been out of it.

653
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:02,885
What are you barking about?

654
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:06,085
You planned a perfect crime.

655
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:08,251
You even prepared
that charcoal briquette in advance.

656
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:09,451
Hey, you witch!

657
00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:15,251
You abandoned me for another punk.

658
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,451
And you're doing so well with him
on YouTube by using my ideas.

659
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:20,585
Did you think I'd just sit back
and watch, you crazy witch?

660
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:24,251
Is that a justifiable reason
to murder someone?

661
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:29,451
Okay, then let's tell the detectives that.

662
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:35,851
Jjumi, let's talk this through in person.

663
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:38,651
I'll apologize and do everything
you tell me.

664
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:40,251
Let's meet, Jjumi.

665
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:43,218
Kill me if you want to. Kill me in person.

666
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:08,685
Jjumi.

667
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:14,118
I apologize for trying to kill you,

668
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:18,085
so please forgive me just this once.

669
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:20,985
I'll do whatever you want.
How much should I give you?

670
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:22,118
How much do you want?

671
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:36,185
What is this?

672
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:54,985
Who are you?

673
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:06,751
Who are you people?

674
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,551
Move out of the way!

675
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:09,785
Mr. Jeong Ha Yun.

676
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:15,751
Unfortunately, Jjumi has died.

677
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:17,018
As you have just confessed,

678
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:21,351
we have two kinds of physical evidence,
including the dashcam footage and lighter.

679
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:25,285
And even the video call with me
where you confessed your crime.

680
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:28,818
And we've also recorded you
apologizing for the murder here.

681
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:46,585
What's going on, Officer Hong?

682
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,685
Hey, how big of a deal is it...

683
00:43:48,685 --> 00:43:52,085
for a precinct officer to demand
homicide detectives to come over?

684
00:43:52,085 --> 00:43:53,351
Well...

685
00:43:53,351 --> 00:43:56,185
This man has something
to tell you detectives.

686
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,485
Go ahead, Mr. Jeong Ha Yun.

687
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:04,585
I killed Jjumi.

688
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:08,585
I killed her.

689
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:13,318
Right?

690
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,885
My presumptions were correct.

691
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:19,685
I had a hunch it wasn't suicide
and that her boyfriend had murdered her.

692
00:44:20,585 --> 00:44:21,418
- Park Yeong Chun.
- Yes?

693
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:23,018
- Arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

694
00:44:40,518 --> 00:44:43,385
We really caught the culprit.

695
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:47,818
I'm sure Jjumi will also appreciate this.

696
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,151
It's all thanks to you.

697
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:52,418
We caught the culprit.

698
00:44:52,418 --> 00:44:55,885
My goodness, I don't even remember
when my heart...

699
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:57,151
last raced this hard.

700
00:45:01,218 --> 00:45:03,785
Look at that sunset.

701
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,151
It's awfully beautiful.

702
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,451
It looks nice.

703
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:11,085
Ta-da!

704
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:25,718
Why is this guy here?

705
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:32,418
Where is this place?

706
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:34,351
When was this filmed?

707
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:40,085
This was when I loaded my car on the
car ferry bound for Geoje from Jeju-do.

708
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:10,185
Get ready for shipment! Let's go!

709
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:25,818
That sneaky punk.

710
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:29,451
He sneaked into Geoje from Jeju-do
on a boat that night.

711
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:31,018
That's how he was able to have an alibi.

712
00:46:40,685 --> 00:46:41,885
Hey.

713
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:44,451
Does that even make sense?

714
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:45,985
What is this?

715
00:46:52,618 --> 00:46:53,685
It's working.

716
00:46:57,385 --> 00:47:00,651
Hey, those makeup skills of yours
haven't gone rusty.

717
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,751
He wouldn't be able to tell from afar.

718
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:04,851
Right?

719
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:07,218
This is so fascinating.

720
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:09,451
Hold on.

721
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:13,351
And if you reflect light on this area,

722
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:15,018
it looks more plausible, right?

723
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:20,818
Can you read this as it is later?

724
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:21,818
Okay.

725
00:47:25,918 --> 00:47:26,718
Were you surprised?

726
00:47:27,618 --> 00:47:28,585
That I'm alive?

727
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:32,851
"Were you surprised? That I'm alive?"

728
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:35,318
Officer Hong, you're a good actress.

729
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:41,818
This is splendid.

730
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:49,351
But Mr. Lee, how did you know
Jeong Ha Yun was the culprit...

731
00:47:49,351 --> 00:47:51,118
when you saw him on the dashcam footage?

732
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:55,785
Well, the thing is...

733
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:03,251
Go away!

734
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:05,151
Go over there and play.

735
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:20,585
(Box Five,
Knock on the box.)

736
00:48:24,118 --> 00:48:26,151
You're now an expert!

737
00:48:28,518 --> 00:48:31,951
The food is here.

738
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,818
My goodness, you're...

739
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:37,818
You're Yong Bin, right?

740
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:38,918
Is it them?

741
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,118
I said I had to go...

742
00:48:45,118 --> 00:48:46,851
to the academy.

743
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:49,818
But these elderly people...

744
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:53,618
told me not to go.

745
00:48:53,985 --> 00:48:55,218
- Hey...
- Kid...

746
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:57,185
You can't stop a child
from going to the academy...

747
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,718
to learn how to buy a hamburger.

748
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,118
- Pardon?
- Wait, that's...

749
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,285
- That's...
- No...

750
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:04,685
You should be ashamed as grown-ups.

751
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:08,118
I hope this never happens again.

752
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:10,885
Yong Bin, let's go to the math academy.

753
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,918
That smarty-pants of a kid...

754
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:21,485
He's lying to save himself
from trouble, isn't he?

755
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:24,685
That little brat is playing with us,
isn't he?

756
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:25,985
What's this?

757
00:49:30,585 --> 00:49:34,085
I'm so sorry.

758
00:49:34,085 --> 00:49:36,318
I got caught red-handed
for skipping the academy yesterday.

759
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:38,651
I had to save myself first, so I lied.

760
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:44,051
I'll install games that prevent dementia
on your smartphones next time.

761
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,085
Yours sincerely, Yong Bin.

762
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,985
"Games that prevent dementia?"

763
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:49,218
He's teasing us right till the end.

764
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:52,618
But still,

765
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:55,351
it's nice that we now have
a little friend.

766
00:49:55,351 --> 00:49:57,851
Okay, let's eat the burgers.

767
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:01,051
I heard kids are quite something
these days.

768
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:02,251
My goodness.

769
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:06,152
My goodness.

770
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:41,547
(Dog Knows Everything)

771
00:50:41,828 --> 00:50:43,981
Don't they look so beautiful?

772
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:45,475
I'm your fan.

773
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:47,935
Is it true that the webcomic artist
has died?

774
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:50,505
Always the first to rush
to a homicide site.

775
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:51,519
Carrot.

776
00:50:52,012 --> 00:50:54,765
- Hey.
- My 230 dollars!

777
00:50:54,899 --> 00:50:57,627
But why is he loitering around
before my eyes, after all these years?

778
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:01,282
There was a murder just like your script?
That's ridiculous.

779
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:04,388
And the scene is very bizarre.

780
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:07,165
He was dead inside the gift box.

781
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:08,672
It's a copycat crime.

782
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,233
What was the tool used in the crime?

783
00:51:10,306 --> 00:51:12,753
You said you lost your hatchet
at the inn, right?

784
00:51:12,813 --> 00:51:14,666
Yes, a composite portrait.

785
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:17,108
Rose Bridge?
The culprit turned up to the police?

786
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:21,011
Who was the culprit in the drama
"Bizarre Gift?"

787
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,020
