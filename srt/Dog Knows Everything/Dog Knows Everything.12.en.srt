(Last Episode)

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,566
How much fuel do you need?

5
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,233
- Fill it up, please.
- Okay.

6
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:48,466
I only valued myself,

7
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:53,566
so I made three mothers for Se Gyeong...

8
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,100
but didn't worry about her.

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,766
She always smiled,

10
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,333
so I thought she was fine.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,366
I raised Se Gyeong to endure...

12
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,900
everything alone,

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,600
regardless of the hardships.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,700
And I feel terrible about it now.

15
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,866
I shouldn't have done
such a thing to Se Gyeong.

16
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,900
I'm so sorry, Mr. Kim.

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,700
- Gi Dong.
- Yes?

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,600
I'm thirsty, so can you get me some water?

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Yes, of course. But I came out in a rush,

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,833
so I left my wallet and cell phone behind.

21
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,800
Mr. Kim, the door is locked.

22
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,000
- Lee Gi Dong.
- Yes?

23
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:08,766
I think of you as my own son,
and I like you,

24
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:11,000
but I can't help but feel angry
when I think of Se Gyeong.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,566
And so, I can't forgive you.

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,600
So I thought about
what I should do with you.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,900
Should I just drag you
to the middle of nowhere...

28
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,900
and kill you?

29
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,233
I contemplated this throughout the drive,

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,333
and I've decided to just abandon you.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,766
Abandon me?

32
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,666
I'm going to leave you here.

33
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,800
Mr. Kim!

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,100
Don't call me that anymore.

35
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,033
Mr. Kim! Excuse me!

36
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:47,600
Mr. Kim! Wait, Mr. Kim!

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,166
Mr. Kim!

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,233
Abandoning me like this,
I can't dare to imagine...

39
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,366
how terrible he must feel.

40
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,133
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

41
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,600
Where are we?

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,700
We're in Andong.

43
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,200
I see. Thank you.

44
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,000
You can have these.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,466
Have a good day.

46
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,266
What? Andong?

47
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,300
Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do?

48
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,133
I'm sorry!

49
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,300
I'm sorry. I didn't know
I had come this far.

50
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,200
If you don't mind,

51
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,866
can I get a refund?

52
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,766
I'm not in charge of the vending machine.

53
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:32,533
Sorry.

54
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:36,033
Can you buy these from me then?
They're two for two dollars.

55
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,066
But I'll give them to you
for 1.50 dollars.

56
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,333
I'll give you a 50-cent discount.

57
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,733
We have a water purifier in our office.

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,833
(Two Men)

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Congratulations, Su Jeong.

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,266
You've finally completed your script...

62
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,533
after all those sleepless nights.

63
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,333
Congratulations, Su Jeong.

64
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,400
So is it called "Two Men?"

65
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,400
I can't believe you wrote a script
with me in mind.

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,900
It's an honor, Su Jeong.

67
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,500
But may I ask what it's about?

68
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:13,466
The drama "Two Men" is as follows.

69
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:20,400
(Gyeongseong, 1935)

70
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,833
(Dumpling Restaurant)

71
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,666
I'm Eom Gu Bong.

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,666
Welcome.

73
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,733
You weren't trailed, were you?

74
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,100
I wasn't. Are you ready?

75
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,666
Yes, let's go.

76
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:50,700
Greet them.

77
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,400
These are our comrades
who will share the same fate as us.

78
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,966
I'm Lee Dol San.

79
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,233
I'm Kim Chun Yeong.

80
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:03,266
My goodness,
it's such a pleasure to meet you.

81
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:06,800
Let's devote our lives for the sake
of our country's liberation.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,966
If I die tomorrow,
I'll enjoy the nation's liberation...

83
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:11,200
with a pair of ghost eyes.

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,233
I'll bite off the heads
of all of our nation's enemies...

85
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,700
and take my own life.

86
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,833
Tomorrow, at the emperor's
birthday celebration,

87
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,400
bring this lunchbox bomb...

88
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,500
You bring this lunchbox over
to the celebration...

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,100
and just hand it over to Eom Gu Bong.

90
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,966
What?

91
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,033
Aren't I the one throwing
the lunchbox bomb?

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,733
What are you saying?
Am I not detonating it?

93
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,100
Don't move.

94
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,366
Don't even move your eyes.

95
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,166
What's wrong with you?

96
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:49,433
We'll detonate the bomb tomorrow,
so sleep tight until tomorrow.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,666
This is how the story unfolds.

98
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,533
Su Jeong, this script is terrific.

99
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,000
An imaginary historical drama?

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,433
It's so novel.

101
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,166
Really?

102
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,600
Am I his comrade?

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,766
Must we hug each other tightly?

104
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,033
When did you come home?

105
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,666
Can't we just appear as enemies?

106
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,200
I just want to curse at him
and grab him by the collar.

107
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,166
My goodness.

108
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,833
As a professional, you should distinguish
between your private and public life.

109
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,466
"Two Men."

110
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:33,200
I smell a huge hit.

111
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,533
Your struggles have paid off.

112
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,600
Thank you, Chae Moo.

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,100
I didn't struggle at all.

114
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,666
It's been a while since I had so much fun.

115
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,466
But what did the broadcasters say?

116
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,200
They have been eagerly waiting
for my script,

117
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,066
so they want to hurry and film it.

118
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:45,600
They asked me to visit Seoul...

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,733
to have a meeting.

120
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,066
Ms. Ye, we thoroughly enjoyed your script.

121
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,533
Thank you for writing
such an excellent piece.

122
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,000
You're going to invest in it
and make it big, right?

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Of course. Director Choi will do
a great job, so don't worry.

124
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,633
But Ms. Ye.

125
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,700
Everything is great, but why don't we
lower the ages of the two men?

126
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,266
How about men in their 30s?

127
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,133
Why?

128
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,033
Lee Soon Jae and Kim Yong Gun
aren't as popular as they used to be.

129
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,933
So let's go with popular young actors.

130
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,400
Two famous actors have already
agreed to work with us.

131
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,133
The script was fantastic,
so they agreed immediately.

132
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,233
Wait, Mr. Choi.

133
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,633
The concept will change drastically then.

134
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,000
There was a lunchbox bombing...

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,066
and two old men were behind it.

136
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,500
That's the plot.

137
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,766
What's with this nonsense?

138
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,533
Please try to understand.

139
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,300
The production environment
is pretty rough these days.

140
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,600
We don't have any money.

141
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,933
It isn't easy to produce a drama
without a popular actor.

142
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,900
Mr. Park.

143
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,400
Are you telling me you won't produce it
if I don't accept the changes now?

144
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:55,333
Yes. It isn't easy for us
to produce it while in a deficit.

145
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,000
If we change the two men to young men,
it'll be beneficial to you, too.

146
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,866
But I can't give up on the two old men.

147
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,233
Lee Soon Jae and Kim Yong Gun.

148
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,333
Those two inspired me
to write this script.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
If you're going to keep this up,
let's just end it here.

150
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,833
Se Gyeong.

151
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,533
What brings you here?

152
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,166
It's nothing.

153
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,433
When did you come here?

154
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:22,366
Fish-shaped buns.

155
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:25,966
Did you remove the red beans?

156
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,966
Of course.

157
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:31,600
How hilarious.

158
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,666
You scared me so much that day.

159
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,666
What went into your mouth
was only a cup of soju,

160
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,766
but what came out of it was endless.

161
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,200
Don't you remember coming across
Daniel Henney at the ER that day?

162
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,633
That's right.

163
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,833
You were sick, but I left you
to see Daniel Henney...

164
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,133
and you were upset about it.

165
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,733
I think we even have a photo
from that day.

166
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,400
- Did you even take a picture?
- Yes.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,300
Here it is. Take a look.

168
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,533
You look so intimate with him.

169
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,600
He's good-looking.

170
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,166
Interestingly, so many fun things
happened when I was with you.

171
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,866
You filed a report on a wanted person...

172
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,633
and there was a time when it was just
someone who looked similar.

173
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,000
And the person on the wanted list
was a man,

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
but I filed a report on a woman.

175
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,833
You're right.

176
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,966
What an idiot.

177
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,133
Thank you, Gi Dong,

178
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,366
for making memories that make me smile
when they come to mind.

179
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,833
In the meantime, I've been thinking.

180
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:33,833
And I think what I had been
waiting and looking for...

181
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:37,933
wasn't you,

182
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:41,000
but my memories with you.

183
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:43,800
Se Gyeong.

184
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,600
I'm going to Mongolia next month.

185
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,633
I applied for medical volunteer work.

186
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,766
For now, I'm planning to stay for a year,

187
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,366
so I came to see you before I left.

188
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,900
Let me ask you for one last favor.

189
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:03,733
I hope to not see you again
before I leave.

190
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,000
Can you do that for me?

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,966
I beg you.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,666
Okay, I understand. Don't worry.

193
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you.

194
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:19,933
Then I'll get going first.

195
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,500
From this moment on,

196
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,233
I had a frightening presentiment
that I'd never see Se Gyeong again.

197
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:37,333
Chae Moo, you did a great job
marinating this bracken.

198
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,033
Thank you.

199
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,233
Your cooking skills are improving.

200
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,966
You should continue to cook in the future.

201
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:45,966
It's good.

202
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,033
Thank you.

203
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,366
Su Jeong, you came home
without even calling.

204
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,800
Su Jeong.

205
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,300
I thought you would spend the night
in Seoul while you were there.

206
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,333
Did you have dinner?

207
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,966
Yes, I briefly did. I don't need to eat.

208
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:05,466
Everything worked out well
at the broadcasting station, right?

209
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,100
I just decided not to work on this drama.

210
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:11,433
Soon Jae, Yong Gun, I'm sorry.

211
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,966
I'm exhausted,
so I'll head upstairs first.

212
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,433
She must have had a huge argument
over the script with the broadcasters.

213
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,966
But it's been a while since
she was this excited about working.

214
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,900
She should've just flattered them
and progressed with it.

215
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,666
You're right. She told me
she was too excited to sleep.

216
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,833
She even tormented me
by preventing me from sleeping.

217
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,966
It's the pride of an artist.

218
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,833
The drama was destined to be a bust.

219
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,666
Soon Jae and I
can't possibly become comrades.

220
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,466
We're enemies.

221
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,033
Why would you say such a thing?

222
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,433
I'm saying so because I'm right.

223
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,866
Thinking of Se Gyeong going to Mongolia...

224
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,600
Seriously...

225
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,133
My goodness.

226
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:03,000
If there really is a lunchbox bomb,

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,300
I wanted to throw it.

228
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,100
Cut it out.

229
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,366
Wait, Soon Jae...

230
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,000
Thank you for the meal.

231
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,700
It was so good.

232
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,600
I think this will come to mind the most
when I go to Mongolia.

233
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,300
Thank you...

234
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:36,766
and I'm sorry, Se Gyeong.

235
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,733
But can you please rethink this?

236
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,800
Can you try discussing this
with Gi Dong just one more time?

237
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,700
We promised not to meet each other again.

238
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,033
I'm only going to think of myself now.

239
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:59,900
Ten new things awaited me...

240
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,200
when I gave up on one thing.

241
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,300
I'm really content right now.

242
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,470
I better get going now.

243
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,933
Take care, Cho Won.

244
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,666
Make sure to stay healthy...

245
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,933
both in body and mind.

246
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:30,966
Thank you.

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,400
I'll get going.

248
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,066
Goodbye.

249
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,066
Stay healthy.

250
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,766
She really must have
no feelings for him anymore.

251
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,600
No, it's the opposite.

252
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,666
It's because she thinks she'll change
her mind if she sees him again.

253
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:11,100
This is so refreshing.

254
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,366
Did something go in my eye? What is this?

255
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:21,133
- Give it to me here.
- Yes.

256
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,366
- It's okay. I'll do it.
- Yes, thank you.

257
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,666
What is this?

258
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,733
He promised he would stay out of my sight.

259
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,800
My goodness.

260
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,066
You'll hurt your back.

261
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,566
I'll do it for you.

262
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,733
Yes, you can give it to me.

263
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,266
What's going on? Why did you ask us...

264
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,966
to come here instead of
talking to us at home?

265
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:00,466
Why did you ask to see us?

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,666
It's about Su Jeong's drama, "Two Men."

267
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,633
Why are you talking about a drama
that has been scrapped?

268
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,500
It got scrapped because of you and me.

269
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,366
Because of me?

270
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,166
What did we do wrong?

271
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,833
We're old.

272
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,766
Come on, what are you talking about?

273
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,000
The broadcasting station said
they would only work on the drama...

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,666
if Su Jeong changed the lead roles
to younger men.

275
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Then did Su Jeong give up
on her drama because of us?

276
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,366
Yes.

277
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,433
We're to blame then.

278
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,933
I feel so sorry for Su Jeong.

279
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,833
Those broadcasters are so annoying.

280
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,833
Lower the ages of the lead roles?

281
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,500
Then "A Man Called Ove"
should be "A Young Man Called Ove."

282
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,666
And "The Old Man and the Sea"
should be "The Young Man and the Sea."

283
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,566
This is really upsetting.

284
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,900
You know what?
Let's just produce it ourselves.

285
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,133
It's not like we can't.

286
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,233
Let's make it ourselves...

287
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,266
and make the broadcasters feel sorry.

288
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:00,066
Yes. There are independent productions
these days, so we can do it, too.

289
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,466
Let's just do this ourselves.

290
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,066
I know many people in this field, too.

291
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,533
We have a great script...

292
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,200
and two incredible actors.

293
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,033
We can receive investments.

294
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,900
Let's do it.

295
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:19,600
(Two weeks later)

296
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:23,766
("Two Men" Production Team)

297
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:27,366
I think we can start filming now.

298
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:30,966
If we go with investments, pre-orders,
sponsorships, and product placements,

299
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,566
we'll have enough
for the estimated production fee.

300
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:34,066
It's truly amazing.

301
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,833
I didn't know this would work, but it did.

302
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:43,666
But they'll only sign the contract
once they see the script...

303
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,166
and all their conditions are fulfilled.

304
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:50,333
Su Jeong will have made
all the necessary adjustments.

305
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,800
She's here just in time, too.

306
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:53,933
Well done, Su Jeong.

307
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,666
Has the script been modified nicely?

308
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,500
Yes, of course.

309
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:01,366
Here's the modified script.

310
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:04,566
("Two Men")

311
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:07,880
(Gyeongseong, 1935)

312
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,433
This is Na Yeong Cheol, an actor
requested by the investor.

313
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:25,233
(Wattari Pizza)

314
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:28,733
It's a pizza place for product placement
instead of the Chinese dumpling shop.

315
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm Eom Gu Bong, you know.

316
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,633
Cut! Let's do it again.

317
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,866
I said I'm Eom Gu Bong.

318
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:42,800
Again!

319
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm Eom Gu Bong, yes.

320
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,600
(Wattari Pizza)

321
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:00,400
Greet them.

322
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,266
These are our comrades,
who will share the same fate as us.

323
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,333
This is rich with fresh mozzarella.

324
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,033
The bread is also savory and delicious.

325
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,566
I'm Lee Dol San.

326
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,833
This must be fresh out of the oven.

327
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,433
It'll be great to enjoy this
with the family,

328
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,333
with a lover, or with friends.

329
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,766
I'm Kim Chun Yeong.

330
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,200
Don't move.

331
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,500
Don't even move your eyes.

332
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,100
We're detonating the bomb,

333
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,333
so sleep tight until tomorrow!

334
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,133
- My arm hurts.
- Hold on.

335
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,433
Why, this is warm and refreshing.

336
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,133
Crayons for babies.

337
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,700
And cry-no-more
pain relief patches for us.

338
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:54,900
Pain relief patch.

339
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,200
I tried my best,

341
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,433
but I couldn't negotiate
for the ads smoothly.

342
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,866
Let's call it quits.

343
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,033
At this rate, we'll ruin
Su Jeong's script.

344
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,400
Su Jeong, go to
the broadcasting station...

345
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,500
and tell them you'll lower the ages
of the two leading roles.

346
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,733
I can't allow that.

347
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:28,833
Let's just wait until
another investor appears.

348
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,066
We need to pay for the office rent...

349
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,666
and the salary of the employees we hired.

350
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,800
We're in a sticky situation.
And we can't just sit here and wait.

351
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:41,833
First, I'll try to retrieve
the rental deposit.

352
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,400
Let's start by dealing with things
that are urgent.

353
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,866
Ok Sook, don't you even dare to chip in.

354
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:50,233
Yong Gun, that house in Geoje
that is under joint tenancy...

355
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,400
Do you want to sell that?

356
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,366
This happened because of us,

357
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:55,700
so we should take the responsibility.

358
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,366
But we'll lose the house
if the drama flops.

359
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,366
Hyeon Ta is here.

360
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:07,333
I just had a reality check, too.

361
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,466
Hello. It's me, Hyeon Ta.

362
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:11,533
Hyeon Ta.

363
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,733
Hello, Grandpa.

364
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,366
Hyeon Ta, what brings you here?

365
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:23,166
I heard you established
a drama production company,

366
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,133
so of course, I should visit.

367
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,766
Hey, Hyeon Ta.

368
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:28,666
So did you bring these walking sticks
as a gift?

369
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,300
Yes. These even light up.

370
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,200
Hey, my eyes! Hurry and turn it off!

371
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,533
It's great, isn't it?

372
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,166
This is a walking stick, but you can
also use it as an umbrella.

373
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,666
You startled me.

374
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,566
But our legs are still fine.

375
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:46,633
We don't need such things yet.

376
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:51,233
I actually came here...

377
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:52,866
wondering if I could invest in your drama.

378
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,700
- Invest?
- Invest?

379
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,300
Yes. Our agency wants to invest
in all the costs.

380
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,433
What do you mean?

381
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:02,200
Why?

382
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,933
I said I'd repay my gratitude to you...

383
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,766
for saving me from the murder case.

384
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,633
Is that all?

385
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:12,433
Surely, there are other conditions.

386
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:13,900
Yes. I do have a condition.

387
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,733
You must cast me on "Two Men."

388
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,866
You can't have the lead role.
Is that okay?

389
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,333
What more could I ask for...

390
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,600
when I can work with Lee Soon Jae
and Kim Yong Gun?

391
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:28,800
Am I not allowed because
I'm terrible at acting?

392
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,066
I'll do my best. Please trust me.

393
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,233
- Yes!
- Let's go!

394
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,233
Ready, action!

395
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:09,066
I'm Eom Gu Bong.

396
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,233
You should've been careful.

397
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:29,033
My goodness.

398
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,833
They should deal with the accident
after moving the car aside.

399
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:32,833
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,000
I tried following the shortest route
to the restaurant.

401
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,033
It's okay. I'm not in a rush.

402
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,133
What is this?

403
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,400
Gi Dong.

404
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,066
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,566
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

406
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,900
No.

407
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,233
I must not be shaken.

408
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:08,700
That's it.

409
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,766
I better lock myself up in the hotel
until I depart tomorrow.

410
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:15,900
Hello, everyone.
I'm attorney Han Moon Chul.

411
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,633
This video will warm our hearts...

412
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:24,500
Yes. Let's stay here and be safe.

413
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,366
I won't have to see Gi Dong
if I stay here.

414
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:32,533
A righteous hero has emerged.

415
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:36,200
So he jumped into that mud...

416
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,966
and rescued all five children...

417
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:41,333
to safety.

418
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,700
Gi Dong?

419
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,133
A fine hero who rescued all five children.

420
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:52,000
He's truly amazing, isn't he?

421
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,466
Let's all give him
a massive round of applause...

422
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,733
Manager Lee, take it easy.

423
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:07,466
Why are you working so hard
without sleep these days?

424
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,666
I'm seeing things now.

425
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,433
Just why aren't you keeping your promise?

426
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:41,666
Se Gyeong.

427
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,166
Why do you keep appearing
and shaking me up?

428
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,800
What do you mean?

429
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,500
I tried really hard
to stay out of your sight.

430
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,766
You keep appearing before me,

431
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,966
so I can't possibly hate you.

432
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,333
You keep following me like a leech.

433
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:00,666
To me, it's a thousand times harder...

434
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,400
to hate you than to love you.

435
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:07,366
So...

436
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:10,000
take responsibility for me.

437
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,133
Se Gyeong.

438
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:14,766
I will...

439
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,300
become your leech forever.

440
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,600
My presumption that I'd never
see Se Gyeong again...

441
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,766
was wrong.

442
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:38,700
But come to think of it,

443
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,433
none of my presumptions were correct.

444
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,533
Hey, Sophie.

445
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:00,800
What is it?

446
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,100
You're always lying around here.

447
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,966
Are you waiting for the old man
who abandoned you?

448
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:07,000
It's already been over a month.

449
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,766
Don't grow attached to people.

450
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:09,933
It's all useless.

451
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,833
You're annoying me. Get lost.

452
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,533
He's not coming.

453
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,666
A dog is a dog and a human is a human.

454
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,966
We can never be friends.

455
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,966
I'm going to the salon to see Beau...

456
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:21,933
for a date.

457
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:22,900
Good luck.

458
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,900
Crazy punk.

459
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,766
I hope his girlfriend catches him
eating his own poop.

460
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,600
- Comrade Kim.
- Yes?

461
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,000
Listen to me.

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,366
I'll stop those darned punks,
so get going first.

463
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,433
How can I possibly leave you behind,
Comrade Lee?

464
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:54,200
Just go. Hurry and go.

465
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,666
Liberate our country on my behalf.
That's all I can ask for.

466
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:09,295
Drop the gun!

467
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm Lee Dol San!

468
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,000
Long live Korean independence!

469
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,900
Cut! Okay!

470
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,400
Let's move on to the next scene!

471
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,733
Soon Jae.

472
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:44,900
Hey, Soon Jae is excellent at acting dead.

473
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,366
Hurry and get up.

474
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:48,666
Soon Jae.

475
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,133
Did someone fire an actual bullet at him?

476
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,966
It's a prop.

477
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:56,600
Soon Jae, hurry and get up.
We need to move.

478
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:01,466
Soon Jae.

479
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:02,600
Soon Jae?

480
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,900
Get up.

481
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,066
- What?
- What's the matter?

482
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:06,333
- Over here!
- Someone call the ambulance!

483
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,900
Somebody call the ambulance!

484
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,866
Soon Jae!

485
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,333
Wake up, Soon Jae!

486
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,700
Sophie.

487
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,233
Are you waiting for Grandpa again?

488
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:35,733
I told you he won't be visiting
for a while because he's working.

489
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,766
Let's go home.

490
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,033
Sophie, I'll get really upset
if you keep this up.

491
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:50,200
Let's go, Sophie.

492
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Cho Won!

493
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:53,500
Mom?

494
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,266
Why aren't you answering your phone?

495
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,933
I must have left my phone at the precinct.
What's wrong?

496
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,600
Your grandpa collapsed.
He's in critical condition.

497
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,633
- What?
- We need to hurry to Seoul.

498
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,533
What's the matter?
What happened to Grandpa?

499
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,300
He had a heart attack.

500
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,733
He collapsed from a heart attack
and was sent to the hospital.

501
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,333
A heart attack?

502
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,833
The precinct's captain also passed away
from a heart attack.

503
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,300
I'll head home first
to fetch our belongings.

504
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,600
Your dad isn't answering either.

505
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,633
Find your dad and tell him to go
to Seoul Hospital right now...

506
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:26,533
and you come home.

507
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,266
Seoul Hospital? I got it, Mom.

508
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,366
- Hurry.
- Okay.

509
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,500
Sophie, we need to go. Let's go.

510
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,666
Sophie.

511
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:52,066
The owner of this restaurant
will feed you.

512
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,766
Please take good care of him.

513
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:56,533
- Yes, don't worry.
- Okay.

514
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:59,566
Even if it's a little frustrating,
please hang in there and wait.

515
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,100
Cho Won, we have to go.

516
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,266
I'll be back.

517
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,900
(Operating Room)

518
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,233
Dad!

519
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,733
- Yes.
- Mr. Kim.

520
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:33,233
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

521
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,666
Of course, he'll be fine. Don't worry.

522
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,166
Master.

523
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,900
Aren't you Sophie?

524
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,433
You saved me from the agony of snacks.

525
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,433
What brings you here at night?

526
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,333
Master, you know how to read, right?

527
00:32:56,333 --> 00:33:00,300
This year marks the 13th year
I've lived in this hermitage.

528
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,866
Please help me.

529
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:04,200
I must go to Seoul.

530
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,566
Seoul?

531
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,633
It isn't nearby.

532
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,433
I know.

533
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,433
But I must go to Seoul.

534
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:12,433
Amitabha.

535
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,333
For what reason?

536
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:20,200

00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,066
I'm on my way to Seoul,

- Shall we?

571
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,500
I'm asking because I'm bored
to drive alone.

572
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,533
Hop in if you're headed to Seoul.

573
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,200
Hey, but how can we ride
in a stranger's car?

574
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,300
It's dangerous.

575
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,366
It should be fine as long as
we don't accept his drinks.

576
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,966

586
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:22,900

00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,400

Have you regained consciousness?

590
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:41,933
- I'll bring the doctor.
- Okay.

591
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:47,100
Soon Jae, do you remember
passing out on the set?

592
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,133
The surgery went well,

593
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,400
so your heart will be sound
for another 50 years.

Grandpa, I'm here.

597
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:06,766
Seeing that you're all here,

598
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:09,000
Geoje must be quiet.

599
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:12,400

600
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,866

is looking after him.

601

come home again.

602

What did he say?

616
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:28,566
Detective Yuk sent Sophie's photo
to every police station across the nation.

617

He said not to worry because
they're all looking for him.

Sophie is intelligent,

619
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,166
so he's bound to return home.

620
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,633

- Exactly.
- Sophie!

00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:24,333
When I was yet to gain consciousness
after the surgery,

724
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,633
I woke up at your voice.

725
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,900
I made it alive, thanks to you. Thank you.

726
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:32,633
Sophie, stop it. Grandpa is feeling weak.

727
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:33,700
Sophie.

728
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,933
My gosh.

729
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,933
I didn't want to say this,

730
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:39,366
but Cho Won,
you tend to be really hard on me.

731
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:42,433
Hey, it's upsetting for you to say that.

732
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,166
I was so nice to you.

733
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,466
Grandpa,

734
00:46:48,466 --> 00:46:49,800
I also understand what Sophie is saying.

735
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,400
I guess it's a hidden talent
that runs in your family.

736
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,266
I finally know
how you found the culprit...

737
00:46:57,266 --> 00:47:00,166
and how you have given me hints all along.

738
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,900
All of my frustrations and questions
are now resolved.

739
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,866
Do you hear him, too?

740
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:06,566
Do you also understand
what Sophie is saying?

741
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:07,933
Yes.

742
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:09,100
My goodness.

743
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,766
Mom!

744
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:29,533
Cho Won, I'll be at
the neighborhood meeting.

745
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:31,966
Give Sophie a shower. He smells.

746
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:33,700
Mom went to a neighborhood meeting again.

747
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:44,366
What? Mom went on a blind date...

748
00:47:44,366 --> 00:47:46,033
and not a neighborhood meeting?

749
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,866
There's no such thing
as a neighborhood meeting.

750
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,166
It's a regular blind date.

751
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,300
And what else have you heard?

752
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,200
What kind of man is he?

753
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,700
Let's just cut it there.

754
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,333
Even family members should know
when to stop.

755
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,433
Yes, you're right.

756
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,966
It's great that I can understand
what you're saying.

757
00:48:03,366 --> 00:48:06,166
Anyway, let's wash up nice and clean.

758
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,500
Mom says you smell.

759
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,566
It hasn't been that long
since I last had a shower.

760
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:13,433
Being cute isn't enough.
You need to be clean.

761
00:48:14,466 --> 00:48:16,900
Okay, if I do it like this,

762
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,766
you'll be nice and clean all the way,
even if I don't shampoo you.

763
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,433
How does it feel?
It's refreshing, isn't it?

764
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,533
It feels like I'm being massaged gently.

765
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:27,466
This feels nice.

766
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:28,433
Really?

767
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,233
All the grit has been removed.

768
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,300
Sophie.

769
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,733
Well done for coming all the way
to look for Grandpa.

770
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:56,400
(Lee Soon Jae, Kim Yong Gun)

771
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:00,933
(Written by Ye Su Jeong)

772
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,683
(Special appearance, Hyeon Ta)

773
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:05,533
(Produced by Chae Moo and Ok Sook
of Real Hit)

774
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,700
(Thank you for watching "Two Men.")

775
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,333
It was such a touching drama.

776
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,466
I'm so proud of you all.

777
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:19,066
Good job, everyone.

778
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:21,166
You did a great job, Yong Gun.

779
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,866
Yes, thank you.

780
00:49:22,866 --> 00:49:24,300
The ratings were good, too.

781
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,500
Soon Jae was also nominated
for the Grand Prize at the Drama Awards.

782
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,333
This is incredible.

783
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,200
Chae Moo and Ok Sook's production
is also enjoying good income.

784
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,966
Why are you not mentioning that I didn't
win the award for best screenplay?

785
00:49:38,966 --> 00:49:40,400
I said I'm fine.

786
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,933
Then for screenwriter Ye Su Jeong,
who is fine with not winning...

787
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:48,300
the Best Screenplay Award,

788
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,600
and ourselves, who don't care,

789
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,300
let's make a toast.

790
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,700
Raise your glasses.

791
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,766
- Mr. Kim...
- What is it?

792
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:57,733
Se Gyeong can't drink.

793
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,933
Come on.
She drank perfectly fine last time.

794
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,833
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

795
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,400
- Dad.
- Yes?

796
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,066
Honey.

797
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:08,166
The two of you...

798
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,200
have become grandfathers.

799
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,572
- What?
- What?

800
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:16,000
Congratulations!

801
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,566
My goodness, Se Gyeong,
you must be pregnant.

802
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,366
Congratulations.

803
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:23,233
Congratulations to both of you.

804
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,600
The "Two Men" are in luck.

805
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:27,500
My goodness, thank you.
Okay, let's drink up.

806
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,366
- I'll just toast. Cheers.
- Just toast.

807
00:50:29,366 --> 00:50:30,900
Seriously, congratulations!

808
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,966
Thank you.

809
00:50:32,966 --> 00:50:34,866
- Yes.
- Thank you.

810
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,200
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

811
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,266
Just give birth to quadruplets.

812
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:54,400
I can't believe Soon Jae
has fallen asleep drunk.

813
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,600
What a rare sight.

814
00:50:56,566 --> 00:50:58,133
The drama was a hit.

815
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:59,766
He became a grandfather.

816
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,933
And if he even receives
the Grand Prize for acting,

817
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,133
he'll achieve the triple crown.

818
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:07,400
Everyone in the comments
is predicting that Soon Jae will win.

819
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,000
No.

820
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,466
Soon Jae said he wasn't expecting
a Grand Prize this time.

821
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,566
My goodness, Soon Jae also saves...

822
00:51:15,566 --> 00:51:17,266
lettuce in his pocket when he's drunk.

823
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:19,400
What's this?

824
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,833
He's not expecting an award?

825
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,700
He wrote an extensive acceptance speech.

826
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,633
What?

827
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:34,333
"I was Lee Soon Jae in my 20s..."

828
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:37,800
"in last night's dream."

829
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,300
Lee Soon Jae, in his 20s,

830
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,666
was a happy actor, who didn't
have to fall to his feet...

831
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:46,566
with back pains while acting
or feel embarrassed...

832
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:48,966
about forgetting his lines.

833
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:52,733
However, I wanted to wake up
from this dream as soon as possible.

834
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:56,033
I wanted to meet my colleague,
who helped me to continue acting...

835
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,733
even after I had aged.

836
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:03,233
Screenwriter Ye Su Jeong, who wrote a fine
script with her blood, sweat, and tears.

837
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:05,100
Witty Song Ok Sook,
who would always rush over...

838
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,200
to pop a candy in my mouth...

839
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,766
when I was low on sugar during the shoot.

840
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:15,133
And adorable Lim Chae Moo,
who makes me laugh with his presence.

841
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:18,733
My forever colleague, Kim Yong Gun.

842
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:21,500
Thank you to you all.

843
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,866
And last but not least, Sophie,
who gave me a new life.

844
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:27,866
Thank you.

845
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:53,000
(Drama Awards 2024)

846
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,066
My goodness.

847
00:53:16,066 --> 00:53:18,733
You look terrific as expected.

848
00:53:20,933 --> 00:53:23,766
Thanks to "Two Men,"
I'm attending an awards ceremony.

849
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:25,800
This is great. Thank you.

850
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,066
There's no need to thank us.

851
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,533
We should thank you.

852
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:31,200
- Ok Sook.
- Yes?

853
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,700
I got Lee Byung Hun's autograph.

854
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,433
My goodness, has Lee Byung Hun
come to the ceremony?

855
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:36,533
He's the presenter for the Grand Prize.

856
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:38,666
He must be presenting
Soon Jae's award later.

857
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:40,566
What Grand Prize?

858
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:43,133
I'm just happy that I'm here.

859
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:44,733
But why are you twitching your lips?

860
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:45,666
Wait.

861
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,066
You seem to be smiling.

862
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:48,333
Quit fooling around and go away.

863
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,166
Soon Jae, where are you going?

864
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:52,000
Are you in a tricky situation again?

865
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,966
Are you going to the bathroom?

866
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,833
Officer Hong.

867
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:02,766
You're here.

868
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:04,633
Here you go.

869
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,366
Min U, you should give this to my grandpa
in person during the ceremony.

870
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:11,366
No. These are for you.

871
00:54:11,366 --> 00:54:14,300
These flowers are for me? Why?

872
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,500
I'm turning my feelings in.

873
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,500
I'll see you at the ceremony later.

874
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,300
What do you mean?

875
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,300
Lee Soon Jae isn't the Grand Prize winner?

876
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,533
Yun Ma Ru is winning the Grand Prize?

877
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,533
This isn't good.

878
00:54:40,533 --> 00:54:42,000
Everyone is in a festive mood here.

879
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,666
I better play innocent for now.

880
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:46,800
You should also keep your lips sealed.

881
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:50,933
Okay.

882
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:52,966
Cheol Seok, what did you just say?

883
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,566
Pardon? Well, that's...

884
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:03,066
Soon Jae and Yong Gun!

885
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:08,100
What do you mean Soon Jae
isn't the Grand Prize winner?

886
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,000
Are you serious?

887
00:55:10,966 --> 00:55:11,966
What do you mean?

888
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:14,933
My goodness.

889
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:16,200
(Su Jeong, Ok Sook, Chae Moo,
it's thanks to all of you. Thank you.)

890
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,433
You must have been planning
to throw a surprise party for us.

891
00:55:19,866 --> 00:55:21,766
You two are the best.

892
00:55:21,766 --> 00:55:23,000
Thank you.

893
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,066
Soon Jae and Yong Gun, you're the best.

894
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,400
Why are you crying, Se Gyeong?

895
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,466
I'm sorry. It's the hormones.

896
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:34,933
Is the baby okay?

897
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:38,866
Se Gyeong,

898
00:55:38,866 --> 00:55:40,900
a Grand Prize isn't everything.
It's fine even if he doesn't win it.

899
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,833
Isn't that right, Dad?

900
00:55:43,033 --> 00:55:44,133
Right?

901
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,400
If Lee Soon Jae isn't the winner,
is it Yun Ma Ru?

902
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,366
That's ridiculous.

903
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:52,166
That's enough. You can stop.

904
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,000
Award Ceremony Personnel, wake up!

905
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,733
This is ridiculous!

906
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:22,200
Lee Soon Jae clearly deserves
the Grand Prize!

907
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:25,666
Lee Soon Jae is obviously
the Grand Prize winner!

908
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,033
Lee Soon Jae is the Grand Prize winner!

909
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:30,266
Grand Prize winner Lee Soon Jae!

910
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:31,866
The Grand Prize winner is Lee Soon Jae!

911
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:34,633
Lee Soon Jae is the Grand Prize winner!

912
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:37,166
Grand Prize winner Lee Soon Jae!

913
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,166
Lee Soon Jae!

914
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:54,366
It was a wig!

915
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:56,200
Of course, it isn't a human being.

916
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,766
It was a wig.

917
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:02,733
I knew it. My assumption was correct.

918
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:04,866
Someone must have discarded trash.

919
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,400
Hey, it's Sophie.

920
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:11,600
Hello, Mr. Lee.

921
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,733
You must be out for a walk.

922
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,866
But this isn't a murder scene.

923
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:19,000
Hey, shoo.

924
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,300
- Hey.
- What's wrong with him?

925
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,866
Grandpa!

926
00:57:21,866 --> 00:57:23,466
- Yes?
- Grandpa.

927
00:57:26,266 --> 00:57:29,200
I'm Officer Hong Cho Won and I've been
appointed to the homicide team.

928
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,933
I know. And we just explained it.

929
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:33,500
This isn't a homicide case.

930
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,133
This is a serial murder case.

931
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,366
What?

932
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,233
Let's start investigating right away.

933
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,628
(Thank you for supporting and watching
Dog Knows Everything.)

934
