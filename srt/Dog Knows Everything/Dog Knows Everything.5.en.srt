- Is that all we've found?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:02,182
Those black shoes on the cliff,

5
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:04,715
do they belong to Yang Won Hui, the diver?

6
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:05,749
Yes, that's right.

7
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:10,149
Anyway, thanks for checking.

8
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,049
You may go home...

9
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,449
What's with that dog again?

10
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:15,215
Hey, keep that dog off-limits.

11
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,015
Send the dog out!

12
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,582
Don't let the dog come inside.

13
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:37,015
What's going on?

14
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,149
She must have committed suicide.

15
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,482
What?

16
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:44,649
Why would she come to
the beautiful waters of Geoje...

17
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:46,515
and take her own life?

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,182
But it's abnormal for a diver...

19
00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:53,715
to throw herself into the sea
to take her own life.

20
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,482
Was she a diver?

25
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,949
Have you moved to Geoje?

26
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,182
I haven't moved here.

27
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,549
I'm just residing for the time being.

28
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:43,749
Have you played table tennis before?

29
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:47,082
Yes, I've played in a club
in Gangnam, Seoul,

30
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,915
for about ten years.

31
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,182
Then you must be amazing at it.

32
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,815
Not everyone from Gangnam is good.

33
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:56,482
She said she's been playing
for over ten years.

34
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,415
Anyway, it's great that you're here.

35
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:00,049
There she comes.

36
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,415
Say hello to our chairman.

37
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,482
Hello, I'm Song Ok Sook.

38
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:14,882
Do you have a husband?

39
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:17,915
Pardon?

40
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,149
I don't.

41
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:21,949
I mean, he's alive.

42
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:24,882
You've separated from him.
Then do you have a boyfriend?

43
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,182
Why are you asking such things?

44
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:30,482
Then can I ask these things?

45
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:31,882
Do you have children?

46
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,449
I have a son and a daughter.

47
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,415
My daughter is in Seoul
and my son works in the U.S.

48
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,182
We need to assess your level,

49
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,882
so let's check your table tennis skills.

50
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,682
Then let's double up
and play a practice game.

51
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:53,449
- Okay.
- Okay.

52
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,482
Wait...

53
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:27,449
Ji Su!

54
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:29,582
Hello!

55
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:31,782
Yes. Did you catch a lot?

56
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:33,849
Yes, I got a lot of oysters.

57
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:35,249
Good for you.

58
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:36,282
Well done.

59
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,315
- Good luck.
- Well done.

(Table Tennis Class)

61
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:10,115
I'm sorry. Did I startle you?

62
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:14,282
No. I'm allergic to cats.

63
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:21,749
My goodness. Mong Dol is here.

64
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:25,315
Some woman startled you.

65
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:28,482
Her sneeze startled you.

66
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:33,282
How annoying. I shouldn't have signed up.

67
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:36,215
Mom,

68
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:38,615
you bullied the newcomer again,
didn't you?

69
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,449
I told you not to do that.

70
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,182
I didn't do anything.

71
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:46,049
I'm sorry. My mom is a little grumpy.

72
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:46,949
I apologize on her behalf.

73
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:51,449
I packed some snacks. You should
eat them and work out, too.

74
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:54,449
I hope you feel better.

75
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,682
Ji Su, you're here!

76
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,882
Yes.

77
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:03,015
Let's check out my daughter's
cooking skills.

78
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,682
Okay, let's eat up.

79
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:08,182
My goodness, Ji Su is so commendable.

80
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,315
Diving itself is tough work, too.

81
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:11,715
When did she pack lunch like this?

82
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,115
If Ji Su hadn't become a diver,

83
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:15,882
all of us would've been done for.

84
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,415
Thank you so much.

85
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,182
My goodness, this looks really good!

86
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:25,349
Hey there, newcomer. Come and try some.

87
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:26,382
Even if you plan to leave.

88
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,282
You should try some.

89
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,449
I added sea urchin roe
to the fried tofu rice balls.

90
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:35,182
Come on over. It's just an initiation.

91
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:36,715
Come and take a seat.

92
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:38,549
You should eat with them.

93
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:39,982
Eat before you leave.

94
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,982
Dad loves glutinous rice cakes.

95
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:10,782
(I'm your fan, Lee Soon Jae. I love you)

96
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,615
As an unfilial son,
I leave this behind like a thief.

97
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,815
I hope you enjoy it, Dad.

98
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,415
I'll be back.

99
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,649
Sophie?

100
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,415
Are you bored?

101
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:43,949
Are you here for a friendly chat?

102
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,115
What's this?

103
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:54,615
"I'm your fan, Lee Soon Jae. I love you."

104
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:56,682
What kind of fan comes all the way here?

105
00:08:57,582 --> 00:08:59,915
And how did they know
I like glutinous rice cakes?

106
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:02,549
My goodness, I'm so grateful.

107
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:04,249
Do you have a son?

108
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,615
I do.

109
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,215
But why are you asking about him
all of a sudden?

110
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,615
It was your son who left that there,
not your fan.

111
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,815
And what do you know about Gi Dong
to say such things?

112
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,782
Follow me if you don't believe me.

113
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:44,715
Fire!

114
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,349
Wait, that's...

115
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:58,382
Fire!

116
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,515
Fire!

117
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,082
Fire!

118
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:04,982
Fire!

119
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:08,649
Fire!

120
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,482
I'm in the middle of a game.

121
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,115
Fire!

122
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:14,949
I'm not done yet. I said to wait.

123
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,482
You're one impatient young person.

124
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,282
That temper...

125
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:23,982
Dad!

126
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,715
You crazy punk.

127
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:28,615
You're playing games on the street
after running away from your wedding?

128
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:29,282
My gosh, Dad!

129
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,982
My gosh, Dad!

130
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,082
That will be 23 dollars.

131
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:39,715
(Trainee)

132
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,649
I'd like to use my discount coupon...

133
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,915
and have membership points added.

134
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,349
Discount coupon?

135
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:48,582
This must be the discount coupon.

136
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,282
And then...

137
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,049
And the points...

138
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,515
- The points... Hold on.
- Wrong!

139
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:55,349
Pardon?

140
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:58,982
You're too slow
and you're making me feel so uneasy.

141
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,715
You're disqualified.

142
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:02,282
Go and find an easier part-time job.

143
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:05,682
There isn't a easier part-time job
than this.

144
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:08,182
Yes, and you're incapable of it.

145
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:11,582
I... Welcome.

146
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:12,715
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

147
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,215
Welcome.

148
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,182
Mister, get out of here.

149
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:17,882
- We have customers.
- Get out.

150
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:20,115
- What are you doing? We have customers.
- I said get out.

151
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,582
But we have customers...

152
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,715
- Mister.
- What are you looking for?

153
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:27,149
Mister, I said get out.

154
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,115
My credit card has been suspended...

155
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:46,082
and I only have a ten-dollar bill.

156
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,249
Where should I earn money?

157
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,049
If only I could earn
ten dollars an hour...

158
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,215
I'm dead.

159
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,549
I must be dead.

160
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:42,449
How vain it is.

161
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:47,949
So this is how it ends.

162
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,582
How vain it is.

163
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,715
Get up!

164
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,182
- Get up!
- Get up!

165
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,582
- Get up!
- Get up!

166
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:07,782
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

167
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:08,582
Wake up!

168
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:09,982
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

169
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:14,982
Excuse me?

170
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:16,982
Please wake up. Hello?

171
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:18,982
- Hello?
- Hello?

172
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,115
Wake up.

173
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,149
- Hello? Wake up.
- Get up.

174
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,882
Wake up.

175
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:33,615
I'm dead, aren't I?

176
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,582
You almost died.

177
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,682
You passed out because you were startled,

178
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:41,715
thinking you'd die from
getting hit by a truck.

179
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,782
Congratulations.

180
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,915
You almost died, so you have been
given a second chance at life.

181
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,715
Okay, let's get up.

182
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:05,415
By the way, have you seen
my ten-dollar bill?

183
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:10,282
You were clutching onto this bill
even as you passed out.

184
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:15,482
Must we risk our lives...

185
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:17,049
for ten dollars?

186
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:21,615
Who are you, gentlemen?

187
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,682
Are you from a religious group?

188
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,282
No.

189
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,382
We're members of the YOLO club, GAO.

190
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:33,449
"GAO?"

191
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:34,182
YOLO.

192
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,849
Y, O, L, O.

193
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:38,315
"You only live once."

194
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:39,549
You only live once,

195
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,915
so let's "go all out" until we're poor.

196
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:43,949
- G!
- A!

197
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:44,715
- O!

198
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,615
- Yes!
- Yes!

199
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:55,249
Yes.

200
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:59,415
It seemed to be such in vain after dying.

201
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:03,615
GAO!

202
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,882
Hey, you crazy girl! Shut up.

203
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:19,749
Do you want me to beat you up?

204
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,515
Hey, are you going to keep up
that nonsense?

205
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:29,949
I'll go to Seoul to catch you.

206
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:34,449
If you make a fuss again,
I'll rip out your hair.

207
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:38,115
Wait a minute.

208
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,515
Excuse me, ma'am!

209
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:49,149
I didn't recognize you.

210
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,315
Thank you so much for earlier.

211
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,982
I'm a diver,
so I'd get scolded for smoking.

212
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:57,715
You'll keep it a secret
from my mom, will you?

213
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:02,215
Of course.

214
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,349
She's not my biological mother.

215
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:09,182
I see.

216
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:10,715
Have a nice day.

217
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:11,349
Yes.

218
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,949
That's right. This is more like it.

219
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,349
A time for myself.

220
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,149
Enjoyment only for myself.

221
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,982
This moment will never return
once it passes.

222
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:03,982
- Mr. Lim.
- Yes?

223
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,915
Are you enjoying yourself right now?

224
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:07,849
Yes.

225
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,649
I'm so happy and this is so much fun!

226
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,449
YOLO, GAO.

227
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:16,115
YOLO, GAO.

228
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,449
Cheers!

229
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,782
(Diver's Snack Bar)

230
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:37,449
Enjoy.

231
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:38,782
- Yes.
- Thank you.

232
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:46,582
Mom, I told you to leave it there.
Why do you keep working?

233
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,549
I'll wrap this place up,

234
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:51,215
so you should hurry home with Mong Dol
and rest.

235
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:53,782
People would think I'm making
my daughter do all the work!

236
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,382
You should.

237
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:56,882
What's the point of having a daughter?

238
00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:58,949
You can head home.

239
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,515
How sweet of you.

240
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,115
That's what a parent and child
should be like.

241
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:13,782
Are you really not going to tell me?

242
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:15,049
Why did you run away on your wedding day?

243
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:19,182
Shall we just kill ourselves today?

244
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,182
I have a child!

245
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:22,349
What?

246
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:24,882
I have a daughter, Dad.

247
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,915
A few days before the wedding,

248
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:33,382
I realized that I had a daughter.

249
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,182
I had dated a girl briefly in the past...

250
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,615
and somehow broke up with her.

251
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:42,815
But I swear I didn't know
she was pregnant back then.

252
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,449
So how could I possibly...

253
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:50,549
marry Se Gyeong in that situation?

254
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:00,182
I'm sorry, Dad.

255
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,615
My daughter still doesn't know
that I'm her father.

256
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:04,515
How old is your daughter?

257
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,915
She wouldn't be a kindergartner
or an elementary student.

258
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,382
My goodness. She grew up
without a father all along.

259
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:15,482
You committed a great sin.

260
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:20,149
It's so big that you won't even
be able to say that you're her father.

261
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:23,549
Where does she live?

262
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,749
I don't know.
I can't tell you any further.

263
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,115
I guess she lives here in Geoje.

264
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:29,582
Even if I know, I don't know.

265
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:36,149
You'll let me hold hands
with my granddaughter before I die, right?

266
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:41,382
Dad, I changed my phone number.

267
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:42,415
Can I have your phone? I'll...

268
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,082
You ran off from your wedding
and you're asking for my number in Geoje?

269
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,282
What must be done must be done.

270
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:49,482
What must be done must be done.

271
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,549
I'll save my number for you.

272
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:56,849
Let's go home.

273
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:01,115
Ji Su, I'm going home.

274
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:02,082
Yes, Mom.

275
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:05,615
Are you heading home?

276
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:08,049
My goodness. Mong Dol, how have you been?

277
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:12,415
Mong Dol was planning to
visit the salon soon, Ms. Yun.

278
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,015
Call me whenever you're available.

279
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:16,249
I'll make time for Mong Dol.

280
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,515
Our Mong Dol will look even prettier
after a shave.

281
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,382
See you next time, Mong Dol.

282
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,915
Ji Su, give them a plate
of sea cucumbers on the house.

283
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:28,182
- It's okay.
- Yes, Mom.

284
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:29,449
Thank you.

285
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:31,015
Let's go.

286
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:48,615
Dad, did you have a good night's sleep?

287
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:03,149
Dad, I hope you enjoy your breakfast.

288
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,349
What a good son.

289
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,449
What a pathetic guy.

290
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:22,415
What are you staring at?

291
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,182
Is this your first time
seeing someone play golf?

292
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,649
Hey, Chae Moo,

293
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:28,349
you're not even paying for the living
expenses because you have no money.

294
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,149
Your clothes and bags are all new.

295
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,549
I canceled my installment savings.

296
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:36,849
I'll deposit the living expenses soon.

297
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,215
You said you wouldn't lay a hand
on that installment savings...

298
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,315
because it's for your granddaughter
when she goes to college.

299
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:42,982
Did you cancel it to play golf?

300
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:43,982
Hey.

301
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:46,482
What's so important
about my granddaughter?

302
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,949
My life is more important.

303
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:49,849
YOLO.

304
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,382
YOLO, GAO.

305
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:54,282
"GAO?"

306
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:55,749
What's wrong with him?

307
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,382
Has he gone crazy?

308
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:00,515
Everyone, don't give your all
to your children.

309
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,615
Don't waste your lives
and enjoy the present.

310
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,982
Then I shall get going.

311
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:07,715
YOLO.

312
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:15,782
What's wrong with him?

313
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,082
Is he feeling sick?

314
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:34,949
Aren't you going to play?

315
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:37,349
Let's just say I did and go.

316
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:41,382
Don't live life according to
others' standards.

317
00:22:42,615 --> 00:22:45,115
We're not here to play golf.

318
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,315
We're here to cause trouble.

319
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,349
What? Trouble?

320
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:50,649
Wait...

321
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:08,182
My goodness.

322
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:12,082
My dear Mong Dol.

323
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:14,882
Have you been waiting for Mommy?

324
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:16,715
What a good boy.

325
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,982
Have you found someone
to collect the sea urchin roe?

326
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:29,215
Ji Su has already found someone
and has sorted everything.

327
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:32,415
What would we do without Ji Su?

328
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:34,349
- That's right.
- That's right.

329
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:35,882
Let's work on it at the joint market.

330
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:36,915
Yes, Mom.

331
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,515
My dear Mong Dol, let's go home.

332
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:46,315
My dear Mong Dol is so cute.

333
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,982
(Diver's Snack Bar)

334
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:10,982
I didn't know they had
a diver's snack bar in Geoje!

335
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,215
These places are the real thing.

336
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,315
Let's see.

337
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:17,282
This looks good. Let's go inside.

338
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:20,615
That's enough!

339
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:23,515
Mom, this is really the last time.

340
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:26,349
We're not coming to Geoje anymore.

341
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:28,415
Mom, we're all busy, too.

342
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:30,082
Your grandchildren are all in high school.

343
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,449
They'll be going to college soon.

344
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:34,415
If you sell your property at the current
market price, it'll be 18 million dollars.

345
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:37,749
We're at the peak right now.
Soon, it'll plummet.

346
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:39,982
It'll all be sorted once you sell it.
Take three million dollars for yourself...

347
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:42,149
and give us five million dollars each
and it'll all be resolved.

348
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,282
Why are you being so stubborn?

349
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,849
What a load of nonsense.

350
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:52,549
Why are you pestering me
with such nonsense to sell my property?

351
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,582
But it'll be nice to see
your grandchildren study in the U.S.

352
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:58,282
It'll be great if you can afford a house
for them when they get married.

353
00:24:58,282 --> 00:24:59,849
Why are you being so greedy?

354
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:02,682
- What? Greedy?
- Greedy?

355
00:25:02,682 --> 00:25:06,315
My goodness, what a load of garbage!

356
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:07,149
What's wrong with you?

357
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:10,149
Hey, you pieces of unrecyclable trash!

358
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:12,782
Have you let your brains
go crazy for money?

359
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:14,015
Hurry and apologize to your mother.

360
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:17,615
Hurry and apologize to her!

361
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:19,682
I'm sorry. We'll come again next time.

362
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,282
My goodness!

363
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:25,949
- Why are you being so nosy?
- This is ridiculous.

364
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:27,182
Let's go.

365
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:32,682
We're cutting ties with you as of today.

366
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:34,649
Of course, you won't be able
to see your grandchildren either.

367
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:36,549
Do you think that'll scare me?

368
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:40,015
I don't want to either. I don't need
children who'll only see me for money.

369
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:42,615
I can't stand seeing you anymore,
so get out right now!

370
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:46,215
We'll legally inherit everything anyway
if you pass away!

371
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:47,749
It'll only take time.

372
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:51,949
My goodness,
you might as well pray for me to die!

373
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:53,549
You ungrateful bastards!

374
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:56,182
You ungrateful bastards!

375
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:58,815
You ungrateful bastards!

376
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:36,615
Mom, I heard everything...

377
00:26:37,015 --> 00:26:38,815
your sons and daughter from Seoul
said yesterday.

378
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:46,049
It's because they have a safe spot.

379
00:26:47,949 --> 00:26:49,515
They believe...

380
00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:53,215
they'll become the legal inheritors
when you pass away.

381
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:54,815
It's true.

382
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,315
Mom, why don't we do this?

383
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:03,149
You should commit a fake suicide...

384
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:08,782
and leave a will stating that your cat
Mong Dol will inherit your entire fortune.

385
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:10,382
A fake suicide?

386
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:13,949
They will only come to your senses...

387
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:16,182
once they realize they won't inherit
a single penny even after you pass away.

388
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:19,015
Can Mong Dol really inherit everything?

389
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:22,915
Of course.
It's common in Europe and in the U.S.

390
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:29,949
(Yang Won Hui, nine
Song Ok Sook, ten)

391
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:52,015
Yes!

392
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,149
(Yang Won Hui, nine
Song Ok Sook, eleven)

393
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:30,515
Okay, open your eyes.

394
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:35,882
Ma'am, I wouldn't be able
to recognize you.

395
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,282
You look so pretty.

396
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,182
She does, right?

397
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:42,815
You said you were a makeup artist
at a broadcasting station, right?

398
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:44,115
That's right.

399
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:47,649
You must have powdered
celebrities' faces and whatnot.

400
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:49,282
You had an elegant job.

401
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:51,915
A diver is even more admirable.

402
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,749
You're pretty, but you don't
seem to pamper yourself.

403
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:58,749
So I even brought my own makeup.

404
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:02,049
Do a good job so that I can
seduce a man today.

405
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:07,915
My goodness, this is so adorable.

406
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,982
Did you decorate this yourself, too?

407
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,682
No way. My daughter decorated it for me.

408
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:14,749
- You know Ji Su, right?
- Of course.

409
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:19,115
She knitted this herself, too.
She's very good with her hands.

410
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:21,615
My goodness, it's pretty.

411
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:25,549
Let's see...

412
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:28,782
I'll also do your eyelashes, too.

413
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:29,815
Please give me a moment.

414
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,115
My goodness, it looks lovely.

415
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:05,149
- Mom, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

416
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:26,682
Old people who take naps
have good cognitive abilities.

417
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:28,149
Try taking a nap, Dad.

418
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:31,615
I'm having pufferfish soup right now,
and you came to mind.

419
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,782
You must try it. It's delicious.

420
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:37,282
He's woken me up...

421
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:40,615
and won't even buy me pufferfish soup,
so why is he texting me?

422
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:45,515
Why does my chest feel so stuffy?

423
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,582
Pufferfish soup?

424
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:54,582
(Pufferfish soup)

425
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:57,649
That was good.

426
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:03,582
Dad would like it if I brought him here.

427
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:05,115
That was good.

428
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:13,082
What's going on?

429
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,115
Girl, why are you crying?

430
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:26,515
Teddy.

431
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:30,249
Teddy must have fallen down.

432
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:32,649
But where's your mommy and daddy?

433
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:37,015
Mommy went to work
and I don't have a daddy.

434
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:38,415
You don't have a daddy? My goodness.

435
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:43,682
I'll go and rescue Teddy, so stay here.

436
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,182
Don't cry, okay?

437
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:55,949
I'll fetch Teddy for you. Okay?

438
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:12,782
I rescued Teddy...

439
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:29,349
Thank you.

440
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,315
We received a report that a girl
was crying alone.

441
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:35,515
I see.

442
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:37,882
Is your wound okay?

443
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:39,482
Yes.

444
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:41,582
But I'm not a pervert...

445
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:43,615
or whatever you might think, Officer Hong.

446
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:47,982
I don't think any pervert would tumble
on rocks to rescue a teddy bear.

447
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:51,482
Make sure to get that wound
treated at a hospital.

448
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:54,849
Yes. Then I shall get going...

449
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,249
That must be the place.

450
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:10,215
Min Ji, do you know
your mommy's phone number?

451
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,749
Then can I check your necklace
to see if there's a number on it?

452
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:18,615
Thank you. Just a moment.

453
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:19,782
Here it is.

454
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:22,949
Zero, one, zero...

455
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,415
What is he doing there?

456
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:49,549
I have a daughter, Dad.

457
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:52,149
I had dated a girl briefly in the past...

458
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:54,982
and somehow broke up with her.

459
00:33:54,982 --> 00:33:57,915
But I swear I didn't know
she was pregnant back then.

460
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:00,382
My daughter doesn't know
that I'm her father.

461
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,682
That girl must be Gi Dong's daughter.

462
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:05,715
She's my granddaughter.

463
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:07,215
Do you want to go to the precinct with me?

464
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:09,282
Okay, let's go.

465
00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:22,982
That idiot.

466
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:26,182
He can't even stand in front of
his own child. What should I do?

467
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:30,515
What are you doing at the precinct
this early in the day?

468
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:31,382
Seriously!

469
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:34,949
Then just go!

470
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,949
How dare you?

471
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,549
Min Ji, let's go outside.

472
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,682
There was a burglary report,

473
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:47,515
so I can't take you with me.
What should I do?

474
00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:50,082
I'll look after her, Officer Hong.

475
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,015
Sir!

476
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:54,249
Then can you please look after her
for just 30 minutes?

477
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:58,066
Min Ji, I'll be right back.
Just wait for 30 minutes.

478
00:34:58,486 --> 00:34:59,970
- Okay
- Thank you.

479
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:05,715
My goodness, what's your name?

480
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:06,982
I'm Lee Min Ji.

481
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,082
Min Ji?

482
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:10,682
Where's your mom?

483
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:14,449
Mommy went to work
and I don't have a daddy.

484
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,449
I'm sorry.

485
00:35:29,282 --> 00:35:30,515
Can I have this?

486
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:34,249
Yes. Buy whatever you want.

487
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:35,282
I'll buy everything for you.

488
00:35:35,282 --> 00:35:37,782
Thank you, grandpa.

489
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,082
Grandpa?

490
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:48,849
Why are you crying, grandpa?

491
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:06,649
Sir.

492
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,382
Where have you been?

493
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:11,849
I wanted to buy something for Min Ji.

494
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:13,249
My goodness, what is this?

495
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:14,549
Min Ji!

496
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:15,649
Mommy!

497
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:17,649
Min Ji.

498
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,715
Do you know how much
I've been looking for you?

499
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:25,849
If only that lady
was my daughter-in-law...

500
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:28,549
Daddy!

501
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:31,582
- Min Ji!
- Daddy!

502
00:36:31,582 --> 00:36:32,649
Are you okay?

503
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,182
Daddy, that grandpa bought me this!

504
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,449
She said she didn't have a daddy.

505
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:40,649
Min Ji's father came home...

506
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,282
after a month-long business trip
to Canada.

507
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:46,315
Is Min Ji your biological daughter?

508
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:51,615
Excuse me, Mr. Lee Soon Jae. Why are you
offending me with such nonsense?

509
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:02,982
Ma'am, these are gifts for Min Ji.

510
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:04,882
Get home safely.

511
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:07,915
My goodness.

512
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,615
I just had citron ice cream for dessert.

513
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:18,082
You should also try it. It's really good.

514
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:19,982
This fool...

515
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:22,049
What's the matter, sir? Are you okay?

516
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:40,915
Is that all we've found?

517
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:41,882
Yes, just now.

518
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:50,615
Ms. Hong Ji Su?

519
00:38:50,615 --> 00:38:52,015
Yes.

520
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:55,049
See those black shoes on the cliff?

521
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:57,215
Do they belong to Yang Won Hui, the diver?

522
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:58,615
Yes, that's right.

523
00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:01,682
I decorated them with accessories.

524
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:04,215
No, not the accessories.
I'm talking about those shoes.

525
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:07,615
You can decorate those shoes
with accessories...

526
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,115
Anyway, there's something like that.

527
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:14,349
Anyway, the initial witness recognized
those shoes and filed a report.

528
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:16,015
She recognized them because she is also
a member of the table tennis club.

529
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:18,382
What on earth has happened?

530
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:20,715
Ms. Yang Won Hui's children in Seoul...

531
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:23,049
filed a report after receiving
a text message from Ms. Yang last night.

532
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:27,315
Apparently, she messaged them
that she would commit suicide.

533
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:30,649
- Mom committed suicide?
- Yes.

534
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:33,615
No. She wouldn't do such a thing.

535
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:36,382
There must be a misunderstanding.

536
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:39,949
We're investigating with the Coast Guards.

537
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,815
Anyway, thank you for checking.

538
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:42,915
You may go home...

539
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:45,015
What's with that dog again?

540
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,682
Hey, keep that dog off-limits.

541
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,282
Hey, don't come over here!

542
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:51,249
Catch him and take him away!

543
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:56,149
Don't let the dog come inside.

544
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:16,382
My goodness!

545
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:17,915
She must have gone senile.

546
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,115
How can she give
her entire fortune to her cat?

547
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:21,482
To her cat?

548
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:24,882
Hey, is that ridiculous will really valid?

549
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:27,849
I mean, what would a cat know?

550
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,949
The one looking after the cat...

551
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,149
has the right to manage
the inherited fortune.

552
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:35,649
The right to manage?

553
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:37,449
Are you saying that she's taking
the 18 million dollars?

554
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,649
Hey, don't you even dare.

555
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:42,915
Who do you think you're staring at,
you classless wench?

556
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:44,482
And you still call yourselves human?

557
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:47,049
We've yet to find Mom.

558
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:49,782
You're the classless ones!

559
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,949
How can you raise your children
being so ill-natured?

560
00:40:53,382 --> 00:40:55,015
That crazy wench...

561
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:05,749
Darn it.

562
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:07,482
Seriously!

563
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:09,415
Hey!

564
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,282
What could be the psychology...

565
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:24,282
behind ignoring one's own children
and giving their entire fortune to a cat?

566
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:29,915
Just how terrible must the children be...

567
00:41:29,915 --> 00:41:32,615
for her to wish them only the worst
even as she died?

568
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:37,515
I mean, I find that daughter
of the diver a little suspicious.

569
00:41:37,515 --> 00:41:39,015
She's not even the biological daughter,

570
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:41,015
but they've lived together for two years.

571
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,649
What's suspicious about that?

572
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:45,182
I also saw her working at that snack bar,

573
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:47,215
and she was kind and commendable.

574
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:50,915
She has a completely different persona.

575
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:53,682
I don't know. I feel a little uneasy.

576
00:41:53,682 --> 00:41:56,749
I think the eel soup I had for dinner
was a little salty.

577
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,482
I can't stop drinking water.

578
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:00,682
Isn't that a tuxedo?

579
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:06,015
I'm attending a party on a yacht tomorrow,
so I bought one.

580
00:42:06,782 --> 00:42:08,049
You really are something.

581
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:12,415
I agree.
I think this is a little over the top.

582
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:14,182
Don't say such things.

583
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:17,549
I've found my peace of mind,
thanks to YOLO.

584
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:21,015
Hey, haven't you heard YOLO
brings you down low?

585
00:42:24,582 --> 00:42:26,715
Then I'll head upstairs first.

586
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:27,882
YOLO.

587
00:42:45,915 --> 00:42:48,415
Mong Dol, hang in there a little.

588
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:49,449
We're on our way to see Mommy.

589
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,215
Mom, it's me.

590
00:43:12,282 --> 00:43:14,149
My goodness, Ji Su.

591
00:43:14,149 --> 00:43:17,382
I was frustrated and bored to death.

592
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:20,082
You went through a lot.

593
00:43:20,082 --> 00:43:22,115
Okay, Mong Dol. Go to Mommy.

594
00:43:22,115 --> 00:43:25,115
My dear Mong Dol is here.

595
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:28,682
Did you miss Mommy?

596
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:32,949
How did my stuck-up children react?

597
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:37,382
What?

598
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:38,582
Did those brats do this to you?

599
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:43,249
They've gone out of their minds.

600
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:46,215
Once they heard Mong Dol
will inherit your entire fortune...

601
00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:50,249
I'm sorry, but it was like
they were foaming at the mouth.

602
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:52,049
It must be driving them insane.

603
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:54,315
Those crazy brats should've known better.

604
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:59,215
But Ji Su, you came up
with such a brilliant idea.

605
00:43:59,215 --> 00:44:02,082
How are you so pretty, smart, and kind?

606
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,149
Ji Su, can you bring some
red bean buns tomorrow night?

607
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:08,815
You know the bakery across
the table tennis court, right?

608
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,049
Yes, Mom.

609
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:11,149
Just hang in there until tomorrow night.

610
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,315
Yes. I'm fine.

611
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:24,815
Let's go to the beach
where the stars shower down

612
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:28,715
Let's go to the beach,
let's go to the beach

613
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:35,415
You have a nice car.

614
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,515
Feel free to let me know
if you need a car.

615
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:40,815
I'll be at your service.

616
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:44,349
You always had that YOLO spirit.

617
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,515
A born-to-be YOLO spirit.

618
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:49,315
I guess so.

619
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:53,149
(Samstar Electronics)

620
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,315
Look at this.

621
00:44:57,049 --> 00:44:59,815
My son is the section chief
at Samstar Electronics.

622
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:02,482
You can take it if you like it.

623
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:04,282
No. It's okay.

624
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:06,682
My goodness, it's okay.

625
00:45:06,682 --> 00:45:08,049
This is nothing. You can take it.

626
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:13,049
It's okay, but thanks.

627
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:17,415
I tossed and turned last night
out of excitement about wearing a tuxedo.

628
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:20,315
An aristocrat-exclusive yacht party.

629
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:22,649
I can't wait.

630
00:45:42,882 --> 00:45:47,082
I guess wearing a tuxedo
was a little over the top.

631
00:45:47,082 --> 00:45:48,849
I'll hurry and get changed.

632
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,149
No, it's okay.

633
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:53,115
Something came up,
so I need to hurry and return to Seoul.

634
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:55,015
All of a sudden?

635
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:56,549
There are slight issues
with the semiconductors.

636
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:58,482
- I'm sorry.
- I mean...

637
00:45:58,482 --> 00:46:01,515
There was an accident at the hospital,
so I need to get it sorted.

638
00:46:02,482 --> 00:46:04,649
I got a call from the secretary's office
in Yongsan.

639
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:06,815
Wait a minute...

640
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:11,449
(Samstar Electronics,
Vice Chairman Park Ho Cheol)

641
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:14,615

(Asam Hospital,
Hospital Director Kwak Chang Hun)

643
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:21,582
"Asam Hospital Director."

Kim and Jung Law Firm CEO?

646
00:46:31,182 --> 00:46:33,282
The YOLO spirit bids farewell
without regret.

647
00:46:33,282 --> 00:46:36,482
Let's "go all out" until we're poor.

648

- G.
- A.

G...

651
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,515
Wait.

652
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:50,882
Excuse me.

653
00:46:52,115 --> 00:46:54,415
I have many ballpoint pens
from our company, so here you go.

654
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:55,249
No.

655
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:58,882
No...

656
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:01,215
Wait...

657
00:47:22,149 --> 00:47:25,715
Hey, Chae Moo.
Why are you walking like that?

658
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:27,582
Do you get a hernia?

659
00:47:27,582 --> 00:47:29,649
My crotch ripped.

660
00:47:29,649 --> 00:47:32,149
You're so clumsy.

661
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,249
Did you rip your pants?

662
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:36,682
My crotch really got ripped.

663
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:37,615
What?

664
00:47:38,415 --> 00:47:41,649
Are you saying you got injured?

665
00:47:41,649 --> 00:47:43,115
How?

666
00:47:44,515 --> 00:47:47,149
I strained myself from running.

667
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:54,815
You crazy lad.

668
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:02,582
No way!

669
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:03,749
That's insane!

670
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:06,949
Wait, isn't she Ji Su?

671
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:08,682
That's so hilarious.

672
00:48:08,682 --> 00:48:10,115
My goodness.

673
00:48:10,115 --> 00:48:12,082
How can she burst out laughing...

674
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:14,315
in front of a bakery when her mother
has committed suicide?

675
00:48:14,315 --> 00:48:16,182
Yes, let's have drinks soon.

676
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:17,215
I'll go to Seoul.

677
00:48:17,215 --> 00:48:18,349
Yes.

678
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:23,715
Can I have five red bean buns?

679
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:24,582
Okay.

680
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:26,615
- And two twisted doughnuts, too.
- Okay.

681
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:33,315
Wait, isn't that her mother's bag?

682
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:35,615
Thank you.

683
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:07,249
Did I get caught?

684
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,849

685
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:49,182
Mong Dol.

686
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:54,882

Mong Dol.

690
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:05,515
Mong Dol?

691
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:08,849
Mong Dol? Where did Mong Dol go?

692
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:11,382
It's so dark I can't see a thing.

693
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,282
Mong Dol.

694
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:15,549
Let's see.

695
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:18,415
Mong Dol?

(Dog Knows Everything)

697
00:51:19,222 --> 00:51:20,804
You're the one who killed
our mother, right?

698
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,351
We'll look after our mother's cat.

699
00:51:23,609 --> 00:51:26,097
I couldn't stand her children,
so I brought her cat instead.

700
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:27,924
I guess they haven't found any clues yet.

701
00:51:28,366 --> 00:51:31,041
Ask about the situation in detail.

702
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,285
I swear I didn't do it, detective, sir.

703
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:35,595
Only Hong Ji Su's fingerprints were found.

704
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:36,722
They're the worst.

705
00:51:36,818 --> 00:51:39,693
Why am I listening to a precinct officer
and her dog?

706
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,160
Why don't you spill everything
to Officer Hong?

707
00:51:42,305 --> 00:51:43,712
That I can communicate with dogs?

708
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:46,169
Who's this puppy detective?

709
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,501
Sophie!

710
00:51:47,827 --> 00:51:48,792
I let my guard down.

711
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:51,147
We need to find Sophie soon.

712
00:51:51,764 --> 00:51:53,315
Did you catch the pet kidnapper?

713
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,264
I heard there are no coincidences
in crimes.

714
00:51:56,762 --> 00:51:58,382
We better catch them right away.
