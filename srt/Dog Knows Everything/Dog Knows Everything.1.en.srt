You're here.

6
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:24,364
What's happening to our neighborhood?

7
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:25,664
I know, right?

8
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:27,564
Please step back.

9
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:29,364
Park Yeong Chun! You should look at this.

10
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:30,964
- What is it?
- Look inside.

11
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:32,664
She must have had a hard time.

12
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,464
What are these dogs?

13
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,797
Hey! Get rid of the dogs.

14
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,531
What are you all doing?

15
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,531
Do your jobs.

16
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,264
Sophie, come over here.

17
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:52,997
What were you up to?

18
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,297
Park Yeong Chun!

19
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:56,697
Yes, I'm over here. Just a moment.

20
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:58,064
Did you find anything?

21
00:02:58,064 --> 00:02:59,831
Yes.

22
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,031
The deceased has been identified.

23
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,264
She's a YouTuber named Jjumi.

24
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:04,531
Jjumi?

25
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,497
- Yes, it's Jjumi.
- Jjumi...

26
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:08,164
She's 27 years old.

27
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,097
It's been confirmed
that she sent a suicidal message...

28
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:14,031
to her acquaintance last night.

29
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,731
There were two bottles of soju, snacks,
and a charcoal briquette in her car.

30
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,431
It looks like a typical suicide scene.

31
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:23,697
It does look like suicide, right?

32
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,097
It's an evident suicide.

33
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:27,864
That startled me.

34
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:29,664
Sophie, be quiet.

35
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,531
Hey, dog! Go!

36
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,097
Go.

37
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:38,864
Let's wrap up and get going.

38
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:40,164
Is it not suicide?

39
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,831
A man killed her?

40
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,397
Yes, chief. It's definitely suicide.

41
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,164
We'll secure the evidence
and wrap up the investigation.

42
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:50,997
Excuse me.

43
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,097
This isn't suicide.

44
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:55,297
You're Lee Soon Jae.

45
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,231
This isn't suicide. It's a murder.

46
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,697
It's a homicide case.

or are you acting insane?"

I'm sorry.

63
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:09,764
Okay.

64
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:29,064
Are you in good condition?

65
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,964
Hyeon Ta!

66
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,731
That little squirt.

67
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,531
Who does he think he is
to make others clean up after his mess?

68
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,931
I'll film this again.

69
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,264
Director!

70
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,131
Yes, Hyeon Ta?

71
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:55,797
Why is Mr. Lee Soon Jae
on the set of this drama?

72
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:59,197
Because we're filming him today. Why?

73
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:02,364
I thought I made myself clear.

74
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:03,931
I can't act with Mr. Lee Soon Jae.

75
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,897
What? Why?

76
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:08,897
Why can't you act with Mr. Lee?

77
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,831
I can't do it. It's impossible.

78
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,564
Or I'll just withdraw from this.

79
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:20,097
What on earth has Mr. Lee Soon Jae
done to you, Hyeon Ta?

80
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:21,464
I'll resolve everything for you.

81
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:26,131
It's just that his presence itself
makes me so uncomfortable.

82

(KMS Weekend Series,

84
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,597

88

"It's so sweet and savory..."

89
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:42,031
"that I can't stop eating them."

90
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:45,531
Is this a rap? Are you going to sing?

91
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,364
Shall I beatbox for you?

92
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,597
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.
We set out early, but...

93
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:57,331
How late are we?

94
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,264
We're here ten minutes early.

95
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,497
What's with him? He arrives way too early.

96
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:07,631
This is for you, Mr. Lee.

97
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:11,131
If I were you,
I'd read through the script again...

98
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,464
instead of spending time taking pictures.

99
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:22,097
I can't work with Lee Soon Jae anymore.

100
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:23,931
I won't do it!

101
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,264
What? Are you asking me to leave?

102
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:32,497
I'm so sorry.

103
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:33,964
It's him, isn't it?

104
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:35,497
It's Hyeon Ta, right?

105
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,031
Did that young lad who's still wet
behind the ears tell you to fire me?

106
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:40,364
- I ask for your forgiveness.
- Forgiveness?

107
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:43,797
A lousy idol who can't even act asked me
to leave and you want forgiveness?

108
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,664
That little squirt.

109
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:48,164
I ought to go and wring his neck.

110
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:49,864
Sir!

111
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:52,831
Thanks to Hyeon Ta, our drama
received a great time slot,

112
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,164
sold out all of our commercials,

113
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:55,931
and even made it big in overseas sales.

114
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,097
Please have mercy.

115
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:01,964
So are you telling me you don't need
an unworthy old man?

116
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:06,231
And only popular people who make
a lot of money for you are allowed to act?

117
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,531
Is that it?

118
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:11,197
Sir, I have three children, too.

119
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:12,531
Please cut me some slack.

120
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:14,464
If you will excuse me.

121
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,397
Sir, you don't have any scenes
to film from now on.

122
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:22,397
Darn it!

123
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:35,131
Hey, what kind of a manager are you?

124
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,464
How can you let a callow guy fire me?

125
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:40,197
Hurry and get this sorted, Cheol Seok.

126
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:42,097
And where are you right now?

127
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:43,197
My goodness.

128
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:44,797
Hey, I'll call you back.

129
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,497
My goodness...

130
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:53,397
This isn't good. I'm in a hurry.

131
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,531
Hey!

132
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,731
Hyeon Ta wrapped up his shoot today.

133
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:27,897

the heavens if you're here?)

but a comedy from far away.)

He's peeing!

140
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,331
Go away!

141
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,397
- Don't film me!
- Lee Soon Jae is peeing!

142
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,264

145
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:27,797
Mr. Lee,

146
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:30,297
why did you urinate there?

147
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,364
Then should I have wet my pants?

148
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,864
So why did you ignore me when I suggested
you should go to the hospital?

149
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:38,064
If I had known that car
belonged to that fool,

150
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,464
I would've squeezed out more on it.

151
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:44,931
Why are you turning nastier by the day?

152
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:48,797
I told you that you'll have
no one by your side.

153
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,964
That's why even your only son
can't be reached.

154
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:52,397
Pull over! I said to pull over!

155
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:02,464
If you don't like it, you can leave, too.
I never asked you to stay.

156
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,631
It's my life-long regret
that I promised your wife...

157
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:08,397
that I'd be with you
for the rest of your life.

158
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:10,097
Your wife fooled me.

159
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,664
First, let's get the urine issue sorted...

160
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,497

the malicious comments on the internet.

Okay.

165

Well done.

166
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,697
It's not severe enough for surgery.

167

If you take the prescribed medication,
the symptoms...

168
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:35,897
of frequent, sudden,
and residual urination will improve.

169

- Okay.

00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,464
Tomorrow is the meeting
with the film company.

181
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:18,231
I need to play that novelist role.

182
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:21,397
It's all over the internet right now.

183
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:22,897
Lee Soon Jae...

184
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:25,064
The news that Lee Soon Jae
urinated on Hyeon Ta!

185
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:27,631
Look, I'm Lee Soon Jae.

186
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:28,731
I've been through worse.

187
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,031
My goodness.

188
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:40,997
- Is it a ring?
- Of course.

189
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,297
Hey, it's the urine terrorist.

190
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,331
He looked at us. Let's stop.

191
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:00,697
It's Lee Soon Jae.

192
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:08,597
Mister, the bathroom is over there.

193
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,064
What's going on?

194
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,397
Go away!

195
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,231
Don't film me!

196
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,431
Go away!

197
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,231
I said don't film me!

198
00:13:58,564 --> 00:13:59,697
Can you believe this?

199
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:00,997
Doesn't he smell?

200
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,731
My goodness.

201
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:28,297
What?

202
00:14:29,897 --> 00:14:30,964
This is a problem.

203
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:35,097
Is the casting going smoothly?

204
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,497
Yes, it's going smoothly.

205
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:38,631
Sir!

206
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,964
Ms. Yun!

207
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,464
Stay there! Don't come closer!

208
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,597
Go! Don't come closer and just go!

209
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:44,897
Pardon?

210
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:46,697
I said to go! Get lost!

211
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:48,464
I don't want to see you, so get lost!

212
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,631
Get lost when I'm being nice! Get lost!

213
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:53,497
That man must have gone senile,
just like the rumors.

214
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:56,497
We would have been in trouble
if we had not checked.

215
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:57,997
Darn it. Let's go.

216
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,964
Cheol Seok, hurry over.

217
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:11,997
Hurry up and get me out of here.

218
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:26,897
Stop. It's a yellow light.

219
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:40,197
(Two days later)

220
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:49,897
Mr. Lee, forget about everything here.

221
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:52,164
People aren't as interested in you
as you think.

222
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,664
They're very interested in my misfortune.

223
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:00,064
Apparently, the seashore
right here is full of fish.

224
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:01,231
You have fishing rods here.

225
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:03,331
Forget it. I'm not fishing.

226
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:05,431
I filled the refrigerator with food.

227
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:06,931
And a housekeeper will come
to help you starting tomorrow.

228
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,797
Hurry and go. You're annoying.

229
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:12,064
I have to go anyway
for a meeting in Seoul.

230
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,231
I'll get going. Rest well.

231
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,164
My goodness, you scared me!

232
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,931
You darned mutt.

233
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:29,197
That was foul. I'm sorry, man.

234
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,531
What?

235
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:40,731
Sophie!

236
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:42,731
Where has he gone?

237
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:44,631
Sophie!

238
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:46,431
Sophie!

239
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:50,064
Who was that?

240
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,397
Wait...

241
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,331
Have I gone crazy?

242
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,031
It can't be.

243
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:05,964
Hold on...

244
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:10,731
George Washington, John Adams,

245
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:14,631
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison,

246
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,397
James Monroe.

247
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:18,064
Sophie!

248
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:23,264
Sophie, are you going to keep running off?

249
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:24,864
Are you?

250
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:38,331
Who just peeped at us unpleasantly?

251
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,264
Is it a pervert?

252
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:41,797
Sophie, let's go.

253
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:47,231
(Come Again Ocean Inn)

254
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,331
Manager Lee.

255
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:50,831
Yes, boss.

256
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:51,564
Where have you been?

257
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:56,797
You see...
The traffic was heavily backed up.

258
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,897
But our truck is here.
What are you talking about?

259
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:02,797
I mean, the traffic was so congested,
so I rushed over.

260
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:06,031
And there were kiwis rolling around
on the ground!

261
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:07,897
So I picked up all the kiwis...

262
00:20:07,897 --> 00:20:10,064
and resolved the traffic congestion.

263
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:14,164
Then I came here
with the few kiwis I had earned.

264
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,364
- Manager Lee Gi Dong.
- Yes?

265
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:20,297
Stop worrying about
the congested traffic...

266
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,897
and deal with the congested toilet
at our inn.

267
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:26,531
I'll do my best.

268
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:27,564
By the way, Manager Lee,

269
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:30,397
you said you were a fan
of actor Lee Soon Jae, right?

270
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:30,864
Yes.

271
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:31,997
He must be in Geoje.

272
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,364
Someone saw him on the beach.

273
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:39,397
Lee Soon Jae is in Geoje?

274
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:40,264
Yes.

275
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:45,831
Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush,

276
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:48,831
Bill Clinton, George W. Bush,

277
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,397
Barack Obama, Donald Trump,

278
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,931
Joe Biden.

279
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:55,531
I'm perfectly fine.

280
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,731
Are you telling me
you're from the Goryeo Dynasty?

281
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,797
Are you telling to me believe that?
A bodyguard?

282
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,564
Then where's my grandson?

283
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:09,464
What are all these?

284
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:10,931
It's so sweet and savory...

285
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,597
that I can't stop eating them.

286
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:16,631
Yong Pal, are you doing this
because you're scared...

287
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:18,264
of being scolded for traveling
to Europe with the tuition?

288
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:20,431
What's Yong Gun doing there?

289
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:21,497
I would have cut your neck on the spot!

290
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:24,097
Hey, why is he playing my role?

291
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,364
Please turn that off.

292
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:27,497
Turn the TV off.

293
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:29,731
Why? Kim Yong Gun is on it
and it's entertaining.

294
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:30,764
I said hurry and turn it off!

295
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:33,864
A bodyguard serving His Majesty.

296
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:37,831
I quit.

297
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,431
Honestly, I've only been here for a day,

298
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,131
but it's so tough.

299
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:46,164
My goodness.

300
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,997
What will she possibly accomplish
with such a lack of responsibility?

301
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,597
Why did you leave
if you are going to return so soon?

302
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:02,931
Get out.

303
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:03,864
What?

304
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:08,831
Why? Should I leave?

305
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,497
What brings you here?

306
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,297
You haven't changed, Soon Jae.

307
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:15,331
Am I not allowed here?

308
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:17,231
Half of this place is mine.

309
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:18,731
My goodness.

310
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:25,964
It's a lot more spacious
and nicer than I had expected.

311
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:29,097
It's facing the south, so it's sunlit.

312
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:36,631
Don't stand there and take a seat.
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

313
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:52,064
This is going to be a comfortable stay.

314
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:04,331
(One year ago)

315
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,797
(Host: Lee Soon Jae, Groom: Lee Gi Dong,
Host: Kim Yong Gun, Bride: Kim Se Gyeong)

316
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:15,197
I wouldn't have come if I had known this.

317
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,397
Mr. Lee, why isn't Gi Dong coming?

318
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:29,597
Was there an accident?

319
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:30,897
I don't know.

320
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:33,597
He's not answering his phone
and I can't reach him at all.

321
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:34,764
What's going on?

322
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:37,297
He's not answering my calls either.

323
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:40,131
I just received a call from Gi Dong.

324
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:43,297
He said he's calling this wedding off.

325
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,164
What?

326
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:47,164
He said not to look for him. I'm sorry.

327
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,731
What do you mean
he's calling the wedding off?

328
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,564
This punk...

329
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,797
Where are you, Gi Dong?

330
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:57,331
Just what is going on here?

331
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,597
Raise your son decently!

332
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,064
Se Gyeong, let's go.

333
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,431
Dad...

334
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:18,231
That wretched punk. I ought to just...

335
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,397
Seriously, you're also...

336
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:21,664
Hold on.

337
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:24,331
Why is this punk smiling?

338
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:25,964
Why do you look so happy, you punk?

339
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,331
You bastard!

340
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:31,597
Let's go.

341
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:43,131
My goodness.

342
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:52,331
You startled me.

343
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,064
I thought you were getting revenge
with the water.

344
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:00,464
I'm not uneducated like you.

345
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:01,931
Seriously.

346
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:04,231
Seriously, that man...

347
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:26,564
Yes, Mr. Lee?

348
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:27,331
Where are you right now?

349
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,464
I'm on the filming set.

350
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:32,964
Are you really going to do this?

351
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,031
How can you make Yong Gun my substitute?

352
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,364
And you even sent him to my house?

353
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:41,597
Se Gyeong and Gi Dong
bought the house together,

354
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:44,897
so half of the house is Mr. Kim's share.

355
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:46,231
How can I possibly stop him?

356
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,131
I'm not asking you
for a copy of the register!

357
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,031
Don't you know I can't live with Yong Gun?

358
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:53,264
Why don't you take this opportunity...

359
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:55,464
and get along with him
under the same roof?

360
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:58,597
Be quiet. I'm leaving if you don't
chase Yong Gun out of here right now.

361
00:25:58,597 --> 00:25:59,597
Mr. Lee.

362
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:00,731
I made myself clear.

363
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,797
For crying out loud,
I can't do this anymore.

364
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:09,664
It's all soggy now.

365
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:19,664
I'm suddenly getting fatigued.

366
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:34,497
Welcome.

367
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:35,964
Have a seat at your convenience.

368
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,997
I'm here because of a theft report.

369
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:43,097
Pardon? At our cafe?

370
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:45,264
Officer Hong, update the situation.

371
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:47,497
Yes, I've arrived at Pacific Cafe.

372
00:26:47,497 --> 00:26:49,931
Make sure to record everything
when arresting the culprit in the act.

373
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:50,931
Yes, captain.

374
00:26:51,964 --> 00:26:54,464
Has any of your customers
filed a theft report?

375
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:56,197
No.

376
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:58,031
I filed the report.

377
00:26:58,031 --> 00:26:59,064
I see.

378
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:03,664
What was the item that had been stolen?

379
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,064
Was it a cell phone or a laptop?

380
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:08,031
It's not a physical object.

381
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:08,964
Hey, cut it out.

382
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,397
This man over here stole my heart.

383
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:15,664
You're so embarrassing.

384
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:18,497
Excuse me.

385
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:19,897
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:23,164
We're college students from Seoul
and we're traveling.

387
00:27:23,164 --> 00:27:26,397
My friend has completely fallen
head over heels for that man.

388
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:27,897
I'm so sorry.

389
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,197
Now you'll remember me, right?

390
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:34,464
What do you think you're doing?

391
00:27:34,464 --> 00:27:36,597
You could be punished
for making a false report.

392
00:27:36,597 --> 00:27:38,464
Does our line of duty
look like a joke to you?

393
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:39,764
Present your ID card.

394
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:42,797
Show me your ID!

395
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:51,497
If you gave her a warning,
wrap up and return to the station.

396
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:54,497
Yes, I'll get going, captain.

397
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:57,964
I'm sorry about what happened at our cafe.

398
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:02,531
No wonder there was a report of theft.

399
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:08,097
I need to investigate a few things
for reference.

400
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:09,497
Will that be okay?

401
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:10,297
Yes, of course.

402
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,164
What's your name and how old are you?

403
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:16,931
I'm Kang Min Woo and I was born in 1997.

404
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:18,964
Kang Min Woo...

405
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:21,097
He's older than me.

406
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:25,897
Then are you working part-time
at this cafe?

407
00:28:25,897 --> 00:28:28,664
Yes. I started working here a month ago.

408
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:33,431
I should come to cafes like these.

409
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:36,531
Is that all?

410
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:37,831
I need to go.

411
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:41,197
Yes. If you're stalked again,

412
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,431
please report it to me immediately.

413
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:43,864
Yes, I understand.

414
00:28:45,464 --> 00:28:47,097
Thank you. Have a nice day.

415
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,897
That college student from earlier...

416
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:56,331
isn't guilty.

417
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:15,464
What's going on?

418
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:23,364
I couldn't even go to the opening,

419
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:24,097
so just how much...

420
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,097
No. You're lying.

421
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,031
He's definitely lying.

422
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:30,097
No, I'm serious.

423
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:31,597
My goodness!

424
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:32,897
My goodness, Soon Jae!

425
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,597
We must have been too loud
and have woken you up.

426
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:37,397
It's been a long time.

427
00:29:38,597 --> 00:29:41,331
You must have had a hard time.

428
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:43,697
You look terrible.

429
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:47,964
So why did you meddle with OTT's Hyeon Ta?

430
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:49,697
Long time no see.

431
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,297
How have you been, Soon Jae?

432
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:53,764
I'm glad to see you.

433
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:56,564
We get to see each other
because we're alive.

434
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:58,364
I thought you'd have walked into
your cave like a loser...

435
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,764
after becoming the nation's
most hated urine terrorist,

436
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:03,164
but you look disturbingly normal.

437
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:06,831
That mouth of yours is still foul.

438
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:10,097
But why have you all flocked in...

439
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:11,964
without the homeowner's consent?

440
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:12,964
My goodness.

441
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:16,031
Half of this house is mine.
Can't I invite guests?

442
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:19,764
If it bothers you,
why don't we just build a border?

443
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,064
Catch and kill whoever crosses the border.

444
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:26,264
My goodness,
you're still so childish and adorable.

445
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:27,931
Whatever.

446
00:30:28,797 --> 00:30:32,097
Seriously, how can you all just run off...

447
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:35,764
after telling me to go and buy rice wine?

448
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:39,297
Soon Jae!

449
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,831
Greetings from the lighting engineer.

450
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:42,264
Victory!

451
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,231
It's been a long time. How have you been?

452
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:48,931
I mean, you're all over the internet,
so I know how you have been.

453
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:52,831
Was it OTT's Hyeon Ta or something?
How can such a young punk...

454
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:56,364
play dirty tricks on
a senior actor like you?

455
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:58,964
I mean, it's only natural...

456
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:01,031
to leak here and there at your age...

457
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:04,031
Cut it out.

458
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,331
We've already gone through it all.

459
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,697
He's always a step behind
with the lighting.

460
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:12,864
Okay, let's drink rice wine.

461
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,931
We're counting the days until our death,
so don't hesitate.

462
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:20,231
The rice wine will be 4.40 dollars each.

463
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:22,431
Why are we splitting the bill
over something so petty?

464
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:23,331
Just leave it.

465
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:25,264
Are you saying 4.40 dollars is worthless?

466
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:27,197
Chae Moo came to Geoje
from Jeju-do on a boat...

467
00:31:27,197 --> 00:31:29,664
and bought these
with considerable difficulty.

468
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:32,931
Here you go. Take it.

469
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:37,197
It's a ten-dollar bill!

470
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:40,064
Thank you.

471
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,231
Hey...

472
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:43,164
What's wrong with you? Why are you crying?

473
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,997
I don't know.
I must be going through menopause.

474
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:46,797
I keep crying for no reason.

475
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:52,731
Darn it.

476
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:55,097
Where are you going, Soon Jae?
Are we embarrassing you?

477
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:57,997
Soon Jae, let's drink
since it's been a while.

478
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:01,964
How disgusting.

479
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,264
He's so full of himself.

480
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:07,097
He graduated from
Seoul National University 50 years ago.

481
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:08,797
But he still thinks he's so smart.

482
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:11,997
Why do I always crave drinks
whenever I see Soon Jae?

483
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:15,697
Chae Moo, pop open the rice wine
so we can catch up.

484
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:17,231
Okay.

485
00:32:18,031 --> 00:32:19,897
<i>Here you go</i>

486
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:23,897
Hold on.

487
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:26,897
Since you've all been invited,
I have nothing to say about that,

488
00:32:26,897 --> 00:32:28,264
but don't drink inside the house.

489
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:31,264
Yong Gun, you've gotten wasted
countless times after drinking.

490
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:32,764
What? Wasted?

491
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:34,397
Seriously, that man...

492
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:38,364
Come on.
You should admit that you get wasted.

493
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:39,364
Whatever.

494
00:32:39,364 --> 00:32:42,964
Okay, Let's go out
and have a cup of coffee instead.

495
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,931
That man sleeps at 10 p.m.

496
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,197
Let's put him to bed
and drink our hearts out.

497
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:50,931
Soon Jae, we're leaving.

498
00:32:52,164 --> 00:32:54,797
Okay, let's go.

499
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:56,097
Yes, let's go.

500
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:01,397
Let's go.

501
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:12,464
This is so annoying.

502
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,664
There's a ton.

503
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,731
- It must have been stunning.
- Of course.

504
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:25,931
Customer number 32.

505
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:27,464
I called your number over ten times.

506
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:31,097
Are we number 32?

507
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:32,631
- Why?
- I know.

508
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:33,831
It's this number.

509
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:37,131
I'm sorry. We didn't know.

510
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:38,697
We'll remember
to retrieve it promptly next time.

511
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,797
Okay.

512
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:44,864
- But who is she?
- Who?

513
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:46,897
Hello!

514
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:50,497
Mocking this and that,
this is Jjumi, the Mocking Burd!

515
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:54,331
This is my third day traveling
around the southern coast.

516
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:58,364
Yesterday morning, I mocked
at sunrise from Ongnyeobong.

517
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:01,764
And tonight, I've come to a nice cafe...

518
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:05,164
with a refreshing view of the Pacific
in Geoje.

519
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:06,597
She's Jjumi.

520
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:07,531
- What?
- Jjumi?

521
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:08,531
Who is she? Is she a celebrity?

522
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:12,464
Seeing that she has lighting,
a microphone, and a cell phone stand,

523
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:15,064
she must be a YouTuber.

524
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:18,231
That's right. She's a famous YouTuber.

525
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:20,397
She has a channel
called "The Mocking Burd!"

526
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:21,397
Isn't it "Mocking Bird?"

527
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:24,464
I mean, she mocks anything and everything.

528
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:26,264
So she follows the concept of,
"The Mocking Burd," a girl who mocks.

529
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,697
What a great concept.

530
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:30,497
- Okay!
- A Mocking Burd?

531
00:34:30,497 --> 00:34:32,764
Mocking Burd!

532
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:34,731
What should I mock today?

533
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:39,331
Recently, senior actor Mr. Lee Something
Soon Something Jae Something...

534
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:42,131
became a fast-rising curmudgeon
with the urine terror incident.

535
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:44,697
We mocked him endlessly
and put him on hiatus, right?

536
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,264
This time, I'll mock the Mad Hitter,
who can't keep his hands...

537
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:51,664
and his things to himself.

538
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:54,031
The Mad Hitter I'll be introducing
to you today is...

539
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:55,831
Drumroll!

540
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:59,031
Recently, actor Kim Something
Yong Something Gun Something

541
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:03,164
did a poor job by giving
an outdated performance...

542
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:06,864
in the drama, "The Bodyguard."

543
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,931
- Why I...
- How did this old man...

544
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,697
hit on actresses when he was young?

545
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:12,931
I mean, she's talking about me...

546
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:15,464
Whenever there was a love scene
in his movies,

547
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:19,331
he would approach the actresses
and wheedle them...

548
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:22,564
ever so persistently...

549
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,797
I'll leave the rest to your imagination.

550
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:29,431
Hence the name, Kim Yong Gone.

551
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:31,797
I'll mock everything on him.

552
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,731
How dare she?

553
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,164
I'll mock everything about Kim Yong Gun.

554
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:35,264
Hey.

555
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:36,397
What? The Mad Hitter?

556
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:37,331
No way.

557
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:39,164
Who do you think you are to lie?

558
00:35:39,164 --> 00:35:40,164
Have you seen me do such things?

559
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,764
Yong Gone? What Yong Gone?

560
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,864
Who do you think you are
to talk such nonsense?

561
00:35:43,864 --> 00:35:46,064
Do you think if you talk like this,
it'll all sound worthwhile?

562
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,197
How dare you?

563
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,131
My goodness.

564
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:51,397
- No way.
- Wasn't that a bit extreme?

565
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,031
This is why you're mocked.

566
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:55,697
He's the definition of a violent boomer.
Don't you all agree?

567
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:56,731
Excuse me.

568
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,464
Watch your mouth.
You're crossing the line!

569
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:03,497
Hey, even if I'm ridiculously insulted,
I endure it because I'm a celebrity,

570
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:05,697
but you're too ill-natured.

571
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:08,597
If you release this footage,
you'll pay for it!

572
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:11,697
What are you going to do about it?

573
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:13,164
Are you going to meddle with me?

574
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:14,064
You can't meddle with me.

575
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:16,864
If you release this footage,
I'll seriously kill you.

576
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:18,131
How dare you...

577
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:22,831
I'll mock Mr. Kim Yong Gun
for a year as of today.

578
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:24,564
Okay? Let's see how things turn out.

579
00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:25,364
Seriously, why you...

580
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:28,597
- Mr. Kim Yong Gun actually grabbed me.
- What's wrong with you? Put that away!

581
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:30,597
- Let go of this!
- Seriously, this man...

582
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,064
This is crazy.

583
00:36:35,064 --> 00:36:39,164
- The real Kim Yong Gun is here.
- She hit me! Hey, put that away!

584
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,964
- Don't stop me.
- It's incredible, right?

585
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,431
- I'm going to mock Kim Yong Gun!
- Hey!

586
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:46,097
- What's wrong with this man?
- Why have you...

587
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,631
My gosh, look at yourselves.

588
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:07,864
My goodness.

589
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:13,831
My head hurts.

590
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,164
It smells terrible.

591
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:25,697
Soon Jae, where are you going
in the morning?

592
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:29,064
How can I eat breakfast in this trash?

593
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:32,431
Wake them up and take them to Seoul.

594
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:33,464
I beg you.

595
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:43,597
- Cho Won, the food is ready.
- Okay.

596
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:49,464
Here are your noodles.

597
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:57,331
Enjoy your food.

598
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:02,564
Honey.

599
00:38:03,997 --> 00:38:05,464
What's that man saying?

600
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:07,597
Pardon?

601
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:11,131
It's nothing.

602
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,564
- Go on delivery.
- Okay, I'm going on delivery.

603
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:23,464
- Watch out for cars.
- Okay.

604
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:29,597
Why are you glimpsing at my daughter?

605
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:31,797
"Honey?"

606
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:33,597
You must have gone senile.

607
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,097
What?

608
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:36,231
What's wrong with this woman?

609
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,164
You kept staring at my daughter
up and down with your gaze.

610
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:41,397
What a perverted old man.

611
00:38:42,764 --> 00:38:44,897
My goodness! Lee Soon Jae?

612
00:38:44,897 --> 00:38:46,131
You're Lee Soon Jae, right?

613
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:47,597
I frequently hear that I resemble him.

614
00:38:48,264 --> 00:38:51,264
I suddenly lost my appetite. Darn it.

615
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:53,431
What do you mean you resemble him?
It is you.

616
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,797
That will be 12 dollars.

617
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,064
You're paying by credit card.

618
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:06,397
You are Lee Soon Jae.

619
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:08,231
My goodness.

620
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,031
Why are you running away
if you're not Lee Soon Jae?

621
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,397
I thought you were a gentleman.

622
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:15,864
Why can't you say you're Lee Soon Jae
when you're Lee Soon Jae?

623
00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:20,697
It was because she resembled my late wife.

624
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:23,464
You startled me!

625
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:26,331
Since yesterday, this darned mutt...

626
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,297
Why do you keep jumping
and making me feel bad?

627
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:31,064
Wouldn't you be startled, too?

628
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:34,897
What?

629
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:37,597
Did I just talk with this mutt?

630
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:39,431
My goodness.

631
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:41,031
Stop! Watch out behind you.

632
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,264
Are you a dog or a ghost?

633
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:50,597
Seriously...

634
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,397
A talking dog.

635
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:07,197
What a good-looking dog.

636
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:09,697
Hey, do you also know how to talk?

637
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:12,664
Okay, go ahead and talk to me.

638
00:40:12,664 --> 00:40:13,997
Talk to me.

639
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:15,964
I said talk to me.

640
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:30,297
I'm back.

641
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,931
You must be exhausted.

642
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:32,731
I'm going home.

643
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,197
Okay, hurry home and rest.

644
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,297
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

645
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:38,397
Cho Won, can you call the police?

646
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,031
Why? I'm the police.

647
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,064
I received 1,200 dollars...

648
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:46,431
for a bowl of noodles.

649
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:47,531
What should I do?

650
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:00,364
Thanks for your hard work, Chae Moo.

651
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:01,464
Yes.

652
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:05,164
Having meat for breakfast is the best
for a hangover.

653
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:06,431
Can I start grilling now?

654
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,597
I'm all done.

655
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:14,631
- What is it?
- I should go and bring the pork belly.

656
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:15,931
Welcome.

657
00:41:17,464 --> 00:41:19,097
- Yong Gun.
- Yes.

658
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,164
This is like a garden party, isn't it?

659
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:21,964
That's right.

660
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,797
It's wonderful.
It would be nice if Soon Jae joined us.

661
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,331
He's always wandering out on his own.

662
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:30,364
That's why people say he's an outsider.

663
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,331
An outsider who's outside.

664
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:33,364
It's chilly.

665
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:35,264
Why? Isn't it funny?

666
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,264
I think it's funny.

667
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:39,364
No, this place is a little cold.

668
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,197
- Are you cold? Do you need the heater?
- Yes.

669
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:42,497
Okay.

670
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:44,164
- My goodness.
- Okay.

671
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:51,264
The electricity is out.

672
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:52,831
Hold on.

673
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:53,797
Has the fuse box gone out?

674
00:41:56,064 --> 00:41:59,331
Okay, here's the pork belly.

675
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:03,731
Doesn't it feel like we're partying
at a lodge or something?

676
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:07,664
But the air is a little chilly.

677
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:08,897
Let me turn the heater on slightly.

678
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,564
Has the fuse box gone out?

679
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,131
Wait here. I'll be right back.

680
00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:19,297
How is he always a step behind things?

681
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:21,864
And he's always a step behind
in the correct order.

682
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:24,331
He could pass as a genius.

683
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:25,031
Or maybe he's just incurable.

684
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:26,364
He's incurable.

685
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:27,697
But still, he's cute.

686
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,464
Those guys...

687
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:42,631
It was so hilarious.

688
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:44,464
I can't even say it.

689
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:45,831
Soon Jae.

690
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,164
Welcome, Soon Jae.

691
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,531
Soon Jae, have meat with us.

692
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:52,364
Why are you only thinking of eating
and pooping instead of packing?

693
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:55,531
You're seriously too much.

694
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,564
Are we beggars or something?

695
00:42:57,564 --> 00:43:00,164
If you don't want to hear such things,
pack up and leave quickly.

696
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:03,531
Sophie.

697
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:06,164
Is this the place?

698
00:43:12,997 --> 00:43:14,264
Sophie!

699
00:43:15,397 --> 00:43:17,731
Soon Jae, you have a guest.

700
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:19,897
Sir!

701
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:27,631
What brings you here?

702
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:30,231
Sir, there's a mistake in the bill
for the noodles you had...

703
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:31,931
this morning at our restaurant.

704
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:34,731
You were charged 1,200 dollars
instead of 12 dollars.

705
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,364
My goodness, is that so?

706
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,564
I didn't know because I hadn't checked.

707
00:43:38,564 --> 00:43:39,764
I'm so sorry.

708
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:42,664
If you give me your credit card,
I'll cancel and reissue the bill.

709
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:43,864
Okay.

710
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,264
Yes. It'll take a moment.

711
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,431
Here you go.

712
00:43:55,831 --> 00:43:56,931
Then I'll get going.

713
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:58,731
But how did you know I was here?

714
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:02,131
Sophie followed your scent.

715
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:03,297
He used to be a police dog.

716
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:06,164
Sophie!

717
00:44:06,164 --> 00:44:07,964
Sophie, come over here.

718
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:09,797
Accidental death
in front of Yongwang Lighthouse.

719
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:11,597
Officers nearby, please head to the site.

720
00:44:11,597 --> 00:44:13,231
I repeat, accidental death
in front of Yongwang Lighthouse.

721
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:15,264
This is Officer Hong Cho Won
of Yeondeok Precinct. I'm nearby.

722
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:16,731
I'll head there immediately.

723
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,731
Sophie!

724
00:44:19,197 --> 00:44:21,464
I'm sorry,
but can you look after Sophie for me?

725
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:23,764
He's obedient when he's wearing
the harness. I'm counting on you.

726
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:36,364
That's right.

727
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:37,664
Back then, it was...

728
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:44,331
What's the matter?

729
00:44:44,697 --> 00:44:46,164
Hey, I smell gas.

730
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:47,364
Gas?

731
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:50,264
I smell gas in the greenhouse.

732
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:51,497
I think there's a gas leak.

733
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:05,797
Get out! Hurry and get out!

734
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:07,364
You've completely lost it now.

735
00:45:07,364 --> 00:45:10,364
That's just harsh.
I won't put up with it anymore.

736
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:12,431
Soon Jae, cut it out now.

737
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:13,831
We're about to get annoyed.

738
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:21,364
(Greenhouse)

739
00:45:21,364 --> 00:45:22,864
Let's grill the meat.

740
00:45:22,864 --> 00:45:23,764
Yes, the meat...

741
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:25,264
Get out! I said get out!

742
00:45:29,331 --> 00:45:30,964
Get out!

743
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:32,564
There's no time to cook and eat these!

744
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:42,331
My goodness!

745
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:44,164
Everyone get out! Hurry!

746
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:45,297
Hurry and get out!

747
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:47,631
- Quickly!
- What's wrong with you?

748
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:50,764
Everyone, get out quickly!

749
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:52,297
(Greenhouse)

750
00:45:56,464 --> 00:45:57,897
What's the matter?

751
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:05,897
What?

752
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:12,297
What was that?

753
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:19,797
Hey, what was that?

754
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:22,131
What on earth is going on?

755
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,664
My goodness.

756
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:56,431
Run.

757
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:57,331
Yes, sir.

758
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:25,897
It's going to collapse! Step away!

759
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:27,264
My goodness!

760
00:47:37,264 --> 00:47:38,364
My goodness!

761
00:47:39,697 --> 00:47:43,264
The fire was caused by exposure
to the LPG burner gas.

762
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:48,664
If it weren't for Mr. Lee Soon Jae,
it would have been very disastrous.

763
00:47:48,664 --> 00:47:50,164
He saved your lives.

764
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:51,264
You should all be grateful to him.

765
00:47:51,264 --> 00:47:51,997
Thank you.

766
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:54,331
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

767
00:47:54,764 --> 00:47:56,297
I came to write my script in Geoje...

768
00:47:56,297 --> 00:47:58,197
and almost left for good.

769
00:47:58,831 --> 00:48:02,164
So that could have been
our cemetery, right?

770
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:05,664
It's my fault
for misconnecting the burner.

771
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:08,731
It could have been so terrible.

772
00:48:09,997 --> 00:48:11,597
I'm so grateful to Soon Jae.

773
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,731
I came to look after Soon Jae
since he would be alone,

774
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:17,597
but I survived, thanks to him.

775
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:19,831
You're right.
And all we did was misunderstand him.

776
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:22,164
- Thank you for your help.
- I feel so bad for Soon Jae.

777
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:24,064
Honestly, I was actually angry,

778
00:48:24,064 --> 00:48:26,097
so I thought of returning to Seoul.

779
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:29,231
But I should stay longer...

780
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:31,964
and repay Soon Jae for this.

781
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:36,497
Hey, I saved people, thanks to you.

782
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:39,064
Buy me a plate of blood sausages
next time.

783
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:41,197
But did Officer Hong go somewhere?

784
00:48:41,197 --> 00:48:42,697
Yes, she went to handle a case
after receiving a radio call.

785
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:45,664
I think it was some accidental death
at Yongwang Lighthouse.

786
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:47,431
An accidental death?

787
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:48,931
Then I shouldn't be here.

788
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,997
Park Yeong Chun.

789
00:48:54,997 --> 00:48:56,597
Yes, I'm over here.

790
00:48:56,597 --> 00:48:57,897
What are you up to again?

791
00:48:57,897 --> 00:48:59,131
You should come this way.

792
00:48:59,131 --> 00:48:59,964
What is it?

793
00:48:59,964 --> 00:49:01,764
She must have had a hard time.

794
00:49:02,497 --> 00:49:03,497
I'm the one having a hard time.

795
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:04,864
Why did she place the charcoal briquette
like that?

796
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:07,131
This is so frustrating.

797
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:08,531
It isn't suicide.

798
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:09,631
Is it not suicide?

799
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,431
The woman was murdered.

800
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:13,564
What? How would you know that?

801
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:17,564
Over there, Gussi witnessed
last night's incident.

802
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:19,131
Gussi?

803
00:49:21,197 --> 00:49:23,031
(Gussi)

804
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:30,964
(Gussi)

805
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:51,197
Last night, a man left after lighting
the charcoal briquette with a lighter.

806
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,931
A man killed her?

807
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:55,931
Yes, chief. It's definitely suicide.

808
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:58,597
We'll secure the evidence
and wrap up the investigation.

809
00:49:58,597 --> 00:49:59,731
Excuse me.

810
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,764
This isn't suicide.

811
00:50:02,764 --> 00:50:03,897
You're Lee Soon Jae.

812
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:10,797
This isn't suicide. It's a murder.

813
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:12,264
It's a homicide case.

814
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:15,031
What?

815
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:05,232
(Dog Knows Everything)

816
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:06,101
It's Kim Yong Gun!

817
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:09,319
You are the only person
on the list of potential suspects,

818
00:51:10,014 --> 00:51:12,634
You weren't the reason for her suicide,
so don't be bothered by it.

819
00:51:13,052 --> 00:51:14,892
You're talking like a witness.

820
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:16,158
My goodness!

821
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,852
It's nice to meet a person
I can communicate with.

822
00:51:17,877 --> 00:51:19,338
Can you tell me about it now?

823
00:51:19,364 --> 00:51:21,022
Aunt Su Jeong!
Is it only my father who isn't there?

824
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:22,207
What's wrong with this?

825
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:24,045
If I get caught, I'm doomed!

826
00:51:24,104 --> 00:51:26,604
His testimony included,
"Last night, man, charcoal briquette."

827
00:51:27,026 --> 00:51:28,646
Isn't it a little specific?

828
00:51:28,813 --> 00:51:30,706
I asked him who told him about it
and he couldn't answer.

829
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:32,959
He's in the early phase of dementia.

830
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,165
Kim Yong Gun and Lee Soon Jae,
we'll never forgive you.

831
00:51:37,919 --> 00:51:40,952
- What did he say?
- He said the culprit was in there.

832
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,160
He must be the perverted stalker
from yesterday.

833
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,815
Why is this guy here?
