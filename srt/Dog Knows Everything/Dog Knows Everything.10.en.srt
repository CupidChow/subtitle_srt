3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,300
Hey, Seo Yong Bin! Get over here!

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,200
No! I don't want to!

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,800
Your front tooth is wobbly though!

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,733
Hurry over here so we can pull it out!

7
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,066
You said we'd go and buy a game console
after classes at the academy,

8
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:36,366
but you took me to the dentist!

9
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:37,633
You're a liar, Mom!

10
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,666
Yong Bin.

11
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,066
Grandma!

12
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,566
I'm afraid of the dentist, too.

13
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:50,733
Shall we run away together?

14
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll carry it for you.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,900
- Really?
- Yes.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,600
- My goodness.
- Come on.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,833
You lost again.

18
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,833
Are you happy that I always lose?

19
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,366
You're just so terrible at it...

20
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:21,800
that it's so funny.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,233
Just look at you.

22
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:28,366
I'm going to make you cry like a baby.

23
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:32,400
My goodness, where did this go?

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
- Are you ready?
- Okay.

25
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,800
Hook it on his tooth!

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,933
A little more!

27
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,000
- You got it?
- Yes, it's hooked on.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
One, two...

29
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,400
How can you do this to me?

30
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,333
Thank you so much.

31
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,200
He always keeps his mouth shut
and runs away from the dentist,

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,100
so I was worried about what to do.

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,466
Hey, I told you I'd make you cry,
didn't I?

34
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:09,400
My goodness, it's making me
feel really good.

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,233
Let's see.

36
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,866
Yong Bin, you look handsome
even without your front teeth.

37
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:15,866
You look handsome.

38
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,166
You liar!

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,146

(Episode 10)

41
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,466
I bawled because he ran away
on our wedding day.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,166
How could that happen?

43
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,700
It's the truth.

44
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,900
Seriously...

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,000
I mean...

46
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:43,866
What kind of a jerk would abandon
someone so beautiful and talented...

47
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,666
like you on your wedding day?

48
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,066
That's just new.

49
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:50,533
What does that jerk look like?

50
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,033
Do you have a photo of him on your phone?

51
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,033
I don't have a photo.

52
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:56,866
My goodness, you're hiding him.

53
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,400
Do you still have feelings
for that jerk, Se Gyeong?

54
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,800
But you keep calling him a jerk.

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,633
What?

56
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,200
Then what else would you call
that darned jerk?

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Then should I call him a beloved jerk?

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,900
If I ever got my hands on that jerk,

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,433
I would've folded him in half backward...

60
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,566
and separated his torso from his legs.

61
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:20,700
My goodness!

62
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,300
Did I get too worked up?

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,100
It feels so good to imagine him
bent in half.

64
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Bent like this.

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,700
What's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,133
So you're staying in Geoje
for the time being, right?

67
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,533
Yes, I still have things to take care of.

68
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:44,433
I surf here every summer...

69
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,733
with my daughter Cho Won.

70
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,266
Next time, you should join us.

71
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,566
I'd love to!

72
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:54,566
I'll visit your hospital in Seoul...

73
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,200
to get laser treatment.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,366
Sure. I'll use the most powerful one...

75
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,333
to raise the tips of your eyes.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,766
I'm so happy to just think about it.

77
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:06,633
Will it be raised like this?

78
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:08,500
Then will I look ten years younger?

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,800
Even thinking about it makes me excited.

80
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:19,400
Se Gyeong and Eun Ha getting along
wasn't on my plan.

81
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:23,666
Hold on.

82
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,566
What's up with Mr. Yang?

83
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,800
He's here early.

84
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,000
Mr. Yang, you're here early!

85
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:42,366
My goodness, Mr. Yang,
you'll fall into the freezer.

86
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,200
Which ice cream are you looking for?

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,666
Are you looking for popsicles?

88
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,600
Shall I find them for you?

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,066
Let's find them together.

90
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:50,533
There's a lot here.

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,966
Where did it go?

92
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,600
Mr. Yang?

93
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,233
Mr. Yang...

94
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,233
Mr. Yang! My gosh!

95
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,766
Sir!

96
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,900
He had an argument with the landlord...

97
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,200
regarding renewing the contract
for the surf shop.

98
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,700
I knew it.

99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,766
I swear I didn't kill him!

100
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,033
Please believe me.

101
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,066
That blood on your hand...

102
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,000
and those clothes are what I trust more.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,666
I swear I don't remember!

104
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,666
I just came to the store drunk
and fell asleep!

105
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,000
That's all!

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,866
I really blacked out
because I drank too much!

107
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,566
I don't remember anything else!

108
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:53,333
This is driving me crazy!

109
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,466
Yes, once you go to the police station
and talk with me,

110
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:57,533
your memories will return one by one.

111
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,466
- Quit the nonsense and get in the car.
- I didn't do it!

112
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,100
Get him in the car!

113
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,866
I swear it wasn't me!

114
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,200
- Okay!
- He definitely looks like a culprit.

115
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,033
Anyway, is he not coming today?

116
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:14,200
He always appears when there's a crime.

117
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,800
Of course, he's here.

118
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:22,500
You walk just like Mr. Lee Soon Jae.

119
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
There's no evidence.

120
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:47,666
I'm only a witness,
yet my heart is still racing.

121
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:52,266
The landlord is dead
and your coworker is the murderer.

122
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,266
You must be shocked, Man Se.

123
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,333
Are you sure you don't need to go
to the hospital?

124
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:58,233
I'm okay.

125
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,166
Sophie, go away.

126
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,900
Hey, go away.

127
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,033
Feel free to call me if you need help.

128
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,933
Thank you.

129
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,100
Sophie, come over here.

130
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,566
Aren't you here with Officer Hong today?

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,533
Actually, your owner,
Hong Cho Won, is my...

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,633
Never mind.

133
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,300
Dogs can understand
the human language, too,

134
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,633
so I better watch what I say.

135
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,400
Sit!

136
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,333
Sophie, sit!

137
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,733
He made me sit.

138
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
What? Is there no one home?

139
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,566
Lee Soon Jae!

140
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,166
Where are you?

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,100
Where are you?

142
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,100
Lee Soon Jae!

143
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
Here you go.

144
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,333
I found it in the corner of the shop.

145
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,566
Thank you.

146
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:24,600
I didn't know I had dropped it here,
so I searched the entire inn.

147
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:28,233
But are you headed somewhere?

148
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:31,966
Rumors have spread on social media,
so the reservations have been canceled.

149
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,533
There's no chance
of doing much business this year.

150
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,733
I'll close the store for now
and take a break...

151
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,300
while thinking about what to do.

152
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,166
Dad!

153
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,433
Why are you here?

154
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,666
Your son is the witness...

155
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,200
and that man is the culprit.

156
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,133
I can smell the odor of the deceased
from him.

157
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,533
I couldn't smell it at all
from the guy who was arrested.

158
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,866
Then I'll get going.

159
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,033
Yes.

160
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,933
- Get him.
- Get what?

161
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,733
He's the culprit, so get him.

162
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,166
The culprit?

163
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,333
What's the matter?

164
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,633
Apparently, you're the culprit.

165
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,033
I'm sorry, but I need to catch you.

166
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,800
You're the culprit, aren't you?

167
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,466
Pardon?

168
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,033
What nonsense is that?

169
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,833
Who says I'm the culprit?

170
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,500
I saw you with my two eyes.

171
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,000
(Peek-a-boo Joints)

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,700
So this is on the waist,
and I pose like this, right?

173
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,733
Yes, that's right.

174
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:09,433
Okay, let's get started
if we're all ready.

175
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,900
- Yes, director.
- Okay, let's go.

176
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,200
I look forward to working with you.

177
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,733
- Let's go.
- Camera on standby.

178
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,300
Sir, you're coming down the stairs
and your knees are hurting.

179
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,500
Let's go.

180
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,133
Okay, I'll take the picture.

181
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,333
That's good!

182
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,300
One more, please.

183
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,833
One!

184
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,800
That's perfect.

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,900
Okay, the last one.

186
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,300
Yes, that was great.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,533
Sir, can you look happy this time
as if your knees don't hurt?

188
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,400
That's good, sir. One more.

189
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,333
One more!

190
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,633
Yes, that was great, sir!

191
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,866
Okay, let's move on to the next cut.

192
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:50,000
Sir, let's change into joggers
for the jogging scene.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,133
Okay, let's have a cup of coffee...

194
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,466
- and take it easy.
- Yes.

195
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,000
(Peek-a-boo Joints)

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,466
Hello. Can I get a cup of iced Americano?

197
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,533
Yes, one iced Americano!

198
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,766
Here's your iced Americano.

199
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,466
- Yong Gun?
- Yes?

200
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,533
Kim Yong Gun!

201
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,433
Won Man?

202
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,233
You're Baek Won Man, right?

203
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:27,633
How long has it been?

204
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,033
Hey, it's been around 20 years, right?

205
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,100
It's been more than that.

206
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:35,033
Hey, you've grown old, too.

207
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,866
You looked so young on TV.

208
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:39,733
But you're so wrinkly in person.

209
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,400
My goodness, you're still
just as outspoken.

210
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,266
By the way, are you running this truck?

211
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:49,166
I've retired. This is my son's truck.

212
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,766
But I'm here because my son broke his leg.

213
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:53,900
- Hey.
- What?

214
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,766
My son must have broken his leg,
so I can meet you, Yong Gun!

215
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,833
You're nonsensical as always.

216
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,866
Anyway, it's so good to see you.

217
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:05,233
- Hey, you must be hungry, right?
- Yes.

218
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,200
Our hotdogs are amazing.

219
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,133
Have it with your coffee.
It's on the house.

220
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,533
That sounds good.
I was hungry, so this is perfect.

221
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,633
My goodness, it's been so long.

222
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:19,566
(Wasabi)

223
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,833
My goodness.

224
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,366
Hey, don't put too much effort into it.

225
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:24,966
You don't have to make it nice.

226
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,433
My goodness.

227
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,500
Here you go. Eat up.

228
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,066
Get energized with this and good luck
with the shoot, my friend.

229
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,800
Yes. Thank you, my friend.

230
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,866
Hey! This is so spicy!

231
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:50,616
I need water!

232
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:51,366
(Salt)

233
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey!

234
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,066
You punk!

235
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,200
It's salty! This is brine!

236
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,733
Good to see you, my friend!

237
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,700
Won Man, you punk!

238
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,033
This is so salty!

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
The guy from the cafeteria
at the broadcasting station?

240
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,000
Won Man is at the cafeteria?

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,233
He's still full of mischief.

242
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,033
He should know when to stop.

243
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,766
He shouldn't fool around with wasabi
and brine at our age.

244
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,200
He almost killed me.

245
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
That crazy punk.

246
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,166
I visited the cafeteria occasionally
when I went to the broadcasting station.

247
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,333
His gimbap was so good.

248
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,333
The cafeteria guy was so jolly, too.

249
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,000
It was so nice.

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,866
The cafeteria had to move out...

251
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,866
after the broadcasting station moved...

252
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,133
and major franchise brands came in.

253
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,200
Won Man.

254
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,833
He also served in the Marine Corps,
so he was nice to me.

255
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,366
He remembered to remove the cucumbers
when he made gimbap for me.

256
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,733
Hold on. I better give him a call.

257
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
I don't have his number.

258
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:08,233
Actually, Won Man wanted
to hear from you all,

259
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,266
so he asked for your numbers.

260
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,200
It's Baek Won Man.

261
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Hey, it's Won Man.

262
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,666
What's this? An obituary?

263
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,133
What? Won Man passed away?

264
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:31,000
This punk is really crossing the line.

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,766
Even so, why is he joking around
that he has died?

266
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,300
What's going on all of a sudden?

267
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:40,233
But I missed Won Man.

268
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,633
Won Man, this punk...

269
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,233
I'm sure he's in a better place.

270
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,166
(Homicide Team One)

271
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,000
So you're saying a witness...

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
saw Gwang Man Se
at the crime scene last night?

273
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,133
Yes. I can't reveal the name,

274
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,733
but there was definitely a witness.

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,100
Sir, where were you between 9 p.m.
and midnight last night?

276
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,100
I told you I was at
Pacific Cafe last night.

277
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,900
Go and check if you don't believe me.

278
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,400
I totally remember him.

279
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,666
He sat here from early evening
until 2 a.m. when we were closing.

280
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,366
He had four cups of espresso.

281
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,733
Did he not go outside? Not even briefly?

282
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,300
He only went on bathroom breaks.

283
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,300
He has a clear alibi.

284
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:47,866
But Mr. Lee said he saw him.

285
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,333
Mr. Lee...

286
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,166
Hong Cho Won, you're in
for a rough ride again at the station.

287
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,133
What do you mean by again?

288
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:59,066
When was I ever not in for a rough ride?

289
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,266
Thank you for your cooperation. Let's go.

290
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,866
You're working so hard.
Have some coffee before you go.

291
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:07,033
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

292
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,866
Could they be twins?

293
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:25,500
I checked his family,

294
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,766
and there is no doubt
that Gwang Man Se is an only son.

295
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,333
Is there an only son that is doubtful?

296
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:32,300
Hey, Hong Cho Won.

297
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,600
You arrested an innocent man,

298
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,033
and you're wondering if he's a twin?

299
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,166
What should I do?

300
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,033
There's no doubt he's an only son.

301
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:42,033
Are you going to say
he's a doppelganger now?

302
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,633
Don't you ever hang around
the police station again.

304
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,666
Go.

305
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,166
I'm a dog,

306
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,666
yet I've failed to smell properly.

307
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,200
Honestly, I'm shocked.

308
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,533
I must be done for.

309
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:25,566
What do you mean? Everyone makes mistakes.

310
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, a mistake.

311
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,466
I also made a little mistake
in my sleep last night.

312
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,733
Pretend you didn't hear me.

313
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,900
Don't worry. I'll forget in no time.

314
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,233
Yes. I guess I'll also start
forgetting in no time.

315
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,400
But I'll stay by your side.

316
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:46,233
Okay, but I want to be alone today.

317
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, I'll be there.

318
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,600
My goodness.

319
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,433
It must be uncomfortable because
it isn't a funeral home.

320
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
But my father wanted his funeral
to be held at our home.

321
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,000
I hope you understand.

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,500
But how can such a thing
happen so suddenly?

323
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,866
My father had a weak heart.

324
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:06,900
My goodness.

325
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,166
Thank you for coming so far.

326
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,400
Take your time and enjoy your meal.

327
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,133
Life is so vain.

328
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:21,233
He used to pull pranks so joyfully.

329
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,000
It would have been nice to see him
at least once.

330
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:32,866
I didn't even accept his pranks...

331
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,166
and cursed at him too much.

332
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:37,400
I regret cursing at him.

333
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:43,000
Won Man was my life's savior.

334
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,687
- What? He was your life's savior?
- Yes.

335
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:53,733
I joined the broadcasting station
through an open recruit,

336
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:58,166
but was only given roles like
Employee One, Witness Two, Doctor One,

337
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,700
and roles where my face wasn't seen.

338
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:07,733
(Kim Yong Gun, Age 38)

339
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,600
I didn't order gimbap.

340
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,833
Yong Gun.

341
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,900
Why do you always come to the station
when you don't even have work?

342
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,500
Hey, go and roll gimbap
if you're going to say such things.

343
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,500
So are you going to act in that
erotic film you mentioned last time?

344
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,733
Hey...

345
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,700
- It's melodramatic, not erotic.
- My gosh.

346
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,233
I've said this countless times,
but you don't suit erotic genres.

347
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,833
Just go with the rustic sentiment.

348
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,100
According to what I've heard,
they're filming a drama called...

349
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,366
"Diaries of Home" next year.

350
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,766
And they have yet to find someone
for the eldest son's role.

351
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:46,400
You should take that role.
It suits you perfectly.

352
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,466
Won Man, I'm Son One.

353
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,066
Are you asking me to play another role
where I won't even be visible?

354
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:52,366
You have the eldest son's features.

355
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,566
That's enough. Just go and roll gimbap.

356
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:57,933
Yong Gun, I'll give you this store
if you don't make it big...

357
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,566
as the eldest son in that drama.

358
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:00,900
I mean it. It's my wish.

359
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,866
Take the role of the eldest son.

360
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm leaving.

361
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:07,033
My gosh.

362
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,266
They need to cast the eldest son
and start producing...

363
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,766
so that our store's sales can improve.

364
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:18,733
(UTS Acting Awards, 1985)

365
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:22,700
We're at the Acting Awards,
shining with tradition and honor.

366
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,700
The Grand Prize winner
for the male lead...

367
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,600
is Kim Yong Gun,
the eldest son from "Diaries of Home."

368
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,800
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

369
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:40,166
"Diaries of Home" has given me
such great strength in my life.

370
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,766
My goodness.

371
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:46,200
Yong Gun!

372
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,433
What would you have done
if you hadn't listened to Won Man?

373
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:54,866
Won Man was your savior indeed, Yong Gun.

374
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,866
I didn't tell anyone about this,

375
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:06,266
but Won Man is also my savior.

376
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:09,200
What? Is he your savior, too?

377
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,233
How?

378
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,333
(Ye Su Jeong, Age 36)

379
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,733
My gosh, you've been counting
the rice grains this whole time.

380
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,266
You must be studying the gimbap
because you're a screenwriter.

381
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:29,733
I'm sorry about doing this
to such a delicious gimbap.

382
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,533
I've lost my appetite lately.

383
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,233
You'll ruin your health if you
pull all-nighters, smoke,

384
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,200
and even lose your appetite.

385
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,566
I brought you some fresh watermelon.

386
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,266
My goodness.

387
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:42,800
When your mouth is dry,
have some refreshing watermelon.

388
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,033
Thank you.

389
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,400
At the time, the ratings for my drama
hit rock bottom.

390
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,266
So I was thinking of giving up
my job as a screenwriter.

391
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,266
Yes, this is it.

392
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,166
Why didn't I think of this?

393
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,866
Let's draw a mole on the face
of the female lead.

394
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:25,833
"Overseas Study of Wife."

395
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,800
That was a huge hit.

396
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:32,100
It featured a woman who resembled the wife
who went missing while studying abroad.

397
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,500
That's right. It was
"Overseas Study of Wife."

398
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,200
That was a huge hit
and it's your representative piece!

399
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
- Yes.
- So that's what happened.

400
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
So it was Won Man who gave you that hint.

401
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,733
That's so fascinating.

402
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,833
He really is a savior.

403
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,100
Then I also have something to say.

404
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,200
Was Won Man also your savior, Chae Moo?

405
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,000
No, not for me,

406
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,966
but a savior for someone globally famous.

407
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:00,000
Michael Jackson.

408
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,466
- What?
- Hey.

409
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:04,266
Even if you want to commend Won Man,

410
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:06,033
that's a little far-fetched.

411
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:07,666
It's true.

412
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,800
I witnessed it with my own two eyes.

413
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,100
Cut that nonsense out. That's enough.

414
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,200
This isn't the place to say such things.

415
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:18,633
No. I'm a little curious though.

416
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,566
Let's at least hear him out.
What happened?

417
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:25,000
Michael Jackson came to Korea.

418
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
You all remember, right?

419
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,066
Yes, that's true.

420
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,600
Michael Jackson visited
the broadcasting station.

421
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:47,333
He heard rumors that the gimbap
at the cafeteria was terrific,

422
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,966
so he came to eat it.

423
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,233
The place was off-limits
because of the bodyguards.

424
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,133
But I had been helping Won Man out...

425
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:57,266
at the cafeteria, so I saw him.

426
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:00,700
Your gimbap is ready!

427
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,766
Excuse me. Please move aside.

428
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,466
Move aside. Excuse me.

429
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,800
Excuse me! Move aside!

430
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:11,366
Move aside!

431
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,800
Your gimbap is here! Excuse me!

432
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:17,033
Your gimbap is here.

433
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,266
My gosh!

434
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,800
I've never seen a dance like this.

435
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,266
Chae Moo, you shouldn't lie
on such an occasion.

436
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:40,800
- Seriously...
- I swear I'm not lying.

437
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,066
I'm serious.

438
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:46,700
Chae Moo tends to exaggerate a lot.

439
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,233
Cut it out. We're not idiots.

440
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,333
You're all driving me crazy.

441
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,133
I said I'm not lying.

442
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,500
I can't even ask Won Man,
who has passed away.

443
00:25:57,566 --> 00:26:00,566
I wouldn't be this frustrated
if only Won Man were alive.

444
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,666
Hey, how are you here, Won Man?

445
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,900
- What?
- Hey!

446
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:13,133
- Chae Moo!
- My goodness!

447
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:17,000
I told you people wouldn't believe
the Michael Jackson story.

448
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:21,600
Hey!

449
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,233
- Chae Moo, wake up!
- Chae Moo!

450
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,500
You can't die before me, Chae Moo!

451
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,000
Chae Moo, drink up.

452
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,866
Won Man, you shouldn't go
too far with jokes!

453
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,633
How can you play such a prank like this?

454
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:38,566
Hey, but we've all come together,
thanks to my funeral.

455
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,433
We were together from the start.

456
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,066
I invited you all because I missed you.

457
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,566
You punk!

458
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:48,966
Are you going to play pranks like this?

459
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,300
What kind of bizarre thing is this?

460
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,500
I'm going to teach you a lesson today!

461
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,900
- I ought to...
- Yong Gun!

462
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,300
Won Man, Yong Gun cried the most,

463
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,500
saying how it was vain and sad.

464
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
He missed his friend, Won Man.

465
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
Thank you, my friend!

466
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,266
Don't touch me.

467
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,166
- How annoying.
- So your family was a part of it, too?

468
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,633
- We are sorry.
- We are sorry.

469
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,100
Please understand my father.

470
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,833
My goodness, are you really crying?

471
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:21,200
Your son is a great actor.

472
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,433
You should try acting.

473
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:30,533
I always added a "Boing!"
at the end when it's real.

474
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,100
How can you all forget this?

475
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,233
My goodness.

476
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,966
In any case,

477
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:38,600
since you came to my funeral,

478
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,233
you should enjoy the food, drink up,

479
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:43,166
and sing some songs, okay?

480
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:46,900
My goodness.

481
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
This is ridiculous.

482
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,400
("My Life at 99 and 88")

483
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,933
At 99 and 88, my life has only just begun

484
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:05,700
- At 99 and 88, my life has only just begun
- Come over here.

485
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:14,233
- Despite hardships, today will continue
- Okay.

486
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:20,833
Despite hardships, tomorrow will come

487

Welcome.

489

- Can I get dumplings to go?
- Sure.

490
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,366
Here you go.

491
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:40,866
You can pay inside.

492
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:41,866
- Is that so?
- Yes.

493
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,733
Sophie, you wait here.

494
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:48,933
Here you go.

495
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,500
My goodness.

496
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm sorry for suspecting you
as the culprit last time.

497
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,266
I made a huge mistake.

498
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:06,700
Yes, he must still be angry.

499
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,533
- I'll pay for that table, too.
- Sure.

500
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:13,133
- And please tell him I said sorry.
- Yes.

501
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:16,466
Where did he go?

502
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,600
What's the matter?

503
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,766
I bit someone.

504
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:25,800
What?

505
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,400
My goodness.

506
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,700
Let's hurry to the hospital.

507
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:33,933
I'm okay.

508
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:36,266
No. You better hurry to the hospital.

509
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:37,433
Let's go.

510
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm okay.

511
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,733
You mutt! Why did you bite him?

512
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:55,233
Sophie.

513
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:58,000
Sophie?

514
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,233
What should I do?

515
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,033
Once I start biting people,
I'm really done for.

516
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,500
Don't say such a thing, Sophie.

517
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,600
I left a clear bite mark on his wrist.

518
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,500
This is shocking.

519
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,666
He abruptly wielded his wrist,
so you got startled and bit him.

520
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,433
That's understandable.

521
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,900
But why did you go to that man?

522
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,166
That man smelled different from yesterday.

523
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:24,366
That's impossible.

524
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,466
I failed to smell properly...

525
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,166
and bit a person.

526
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,066
My time really must be up.

527
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:32,700
Sophie!

528
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,966
Officer Hong.

529
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,433
Mr. Lee,

530
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,500
did Sophie bite someone?

531
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:41,533
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
taken him to the market.

532
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,566
Sophie, why did you do such a thing?

533
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:49,766
I'm so sorry.

534
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:51,833
I'm okay.

535
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,700
But you should go to the hospital.

536
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:01,933
Hold on. He said you were bitten
on your left arm.

537
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,400
Was it your right arm?

538
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:07,033
That's not it. I wasn't bitten.

539
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,900
I'm fine.

540
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,033
That's strange.

541
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:14,700
Mr. Lee said Sophie had clearly
bitten your left arm.

542
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,966
Mr. Lee Soon Jae?

543
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:21,300
The one who accused me
and claimed to have seen me that night?

544
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,433
Is he seeing things?

545
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:29,166
I made a mistake again.

546
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,333
I'm so sorry.

547
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:35,766
I don't want to get involved again,
so please leave. I beg you.

548
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:38,033
I'm so sorry.

549
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:40,100
I'm so sorry.

550
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:46,166
Mr. Lee!

551
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,033
I'm sorry, Officer Hong.

552
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,533
I have nothing to say.

553
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,400
I first accused an innocent man...

554
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,833
and said he was bitten
when he was never bitten.

555
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:58,933
I must be seeing things. I'm so sorry.

556
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:03,533
It's okay.

557
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,833
Don't hold yourself back
because I'm old and just say it.

558
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,833
Take care.

559
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,266
My goodness, she's so docile.

560
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,600
The noodle lady did a great job
raising her daughter.

561
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,966
What's this?

562
00:32:25,966 --> 00:32:29,000
Which jerk spat chewing gum here?

563
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,566
I ought to catch that jerk
and chew him just the same!

564
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,100
I'll never forgive him!

565
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:54,000
Are you here to have anchovy noodles?

566
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,900
No.

567
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,466
You must be here to eat boiled pork.

568
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:03,533
But the noodles here are the best.

569
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:04,466
Trust me and try it.

570
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:08,400
- Yes.
- Cho Won, what perfect timing.

571
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,033
The drain is clogged...

572
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,400
and the hardware man
isn't answering the phone.

573
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,533
Can you look after the store?
I'll be back soon.

574
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:18,866
This is our restaurant.

575
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:21,000
And this is my mother.

576
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,866
Hello.

577
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:26,333
Yes.

578
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,666
But who...

579
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,033
I work part-time here at Pacific Cafe.

580
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,266
I see. Hello.

581
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:37,733
You must be working at the cafe
Cho Won visits often.

582
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,500
You're handsome.

583
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:44,666
Shall I check the drain for you?

584
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:46,600
The drain?

585
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,033
When I lived in Seoul,
I lived in a house...

586
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:51,233
where the drain was always clogged,
so I'm pretty much an expert.

587
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:54,666
Is that so? I'd totally appreciate it.

588
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:11,700
It's unclogging!

589
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,266
Thank you so much. Well done.

590
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,266
I'll boil some pork for you.
You should wrap up and take a seat.

591
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:20,366
Sure.

592
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm okay.

593
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:24,224
Be quiet.

594
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Anyway, I'm okay.

595
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,300
Come on.

596
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,500
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

597
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:35,533
- Ta-da!
- My goodness.

598
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,133
Octopus soup.

599
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:38,200
It looks good.

600
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,866
I mustered some magic
with Su Jeong's favorite dish.

601
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:43,866
Enjoy the meal.

602
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:46,100
- Thank you for the meal.
- Yes.

603
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
What is this?

604
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,033
(Message)

605
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:59,166
My goodness, it's Baek Won Man again.

606
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,500
Yes, it's Won Man.

607
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:07,433
It's a message from his wife.

608
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:11,666
Hello. I'm Baek Won Man's wife.

609
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:15,800
A little while ago,
my husband passed away.

610
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,600
Thank you for coming
to his funeral in advance.

611
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,466
We'll hold a small funeral
with only family members.

612
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,400
This is real.

613
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,833
This is not a prank.

614
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,300
May you be at peace.

615
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,033
What is this? Is it real this time?

616
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,133
I received a message from his son.

617
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,666
Hello. I'm Baek Won Man's son,
whom you met at the funeral.

618
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,600
My father has passed away.

619
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,533
He was terminally ill,

620
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:49,266
and he passed away
due to worsened conditions.

621
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:53,700
Thank you for spending time
with my father at the funeral.

622
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,333
This is a real situation.

623
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,300
This is not a prank.

624
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,700
I wish you all good health.

625
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:05,633
Won Man sent me his last words
with a video.

626
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,566
Thank you all for coming to my funeral.

627
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:22,433
I wanted to hold my funeral
when I was alive...

628
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:24,133
because I can't see you once I die.

629
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,166
I had so much fun at today's funeral...

630
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,766
and it was so good to see you all.

631
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,100
Soon Jae,

632
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,800
my buddy Yong Gun,

633
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
Chae Moo,

634
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,133
Su Jeong, and Ok Sook,

635
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,000
I hope you all stay healthy and happy.

636
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,900
Healthy and happy.

637
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,466
Until we meet again,
I'll be waiting with gimbap ready.

638
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:56,000
Hurry over. "Boing!"

639
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:05,533
He kept smiling until the end.

640
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,600
But he shouldn't ask us to hurry over.

641
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,133
Won Man...

642
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:32,433
Mister!

643
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
Mister, come on out!

644
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,366
This isn't a ten-dollar bill!

645
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:41,300
I can't even buy ice cream with it.

646
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,566
Mister, come on out!

647
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,433
You said you would give me ten dollars
if I did your errand!

648
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,133
You liar!

649
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:55,500
So are all adults liars?

650
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,533
Humans are a huge letdown.

651
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:00,866
What?

652
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:02,100
A letdown?

653
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,333
Do you even know what that means?

654
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,733
I'm serious.

655
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,766
That's funny.

656
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,166
My goodness.

657
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,900
I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

658
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,766
It's okay.

659
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:19,200
It didn't drip, so it's easy to clean up.

660
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,566
You're right. How fascinating.

661
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,533
Yes, so it's really convenient to clean.

662
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,833
Yong Bin, stop being serious
and finish what you were drinking.

663
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,000
- Thank you.
- Yes.

664
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,733
Yong Bin, why are you feeling so serious?

665
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:39,066
An eight-year-old tasted life's bitterness
after being scammed a few times.

666
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,433
But why are you holding a dollar bill?

667
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,733
A man who speaks poor Korean...

668
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:48,866
said he couldn't come out of the house
and asked me to get him a burger.

669
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:50,600
So I received it after doing his errand.

670
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:54,866
But neither the supermarket
nor the stationery store accepted it.

671
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:59,066
My goodness.
Did you talk to that man in English?

672
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:01,433
Yes. It was a casual conversation.

673
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:06,633
I even bought him an ointment
because a dog bit him.

674
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,300
Did a dog bite him?

675
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,333
Yes. He had a wound from a dog bite
on his left wrist.

676
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,266
That man smelled different from yesterday.

677
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
A bitten man and an unbitten man.
There are two of them.

678
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,000
Then it makes sense.

679
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,366
Thank you, Yong Bin.

680
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,300
Here you go.

681
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:38,500
I think the world is still worth living.

682
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,900
My goodness.

683
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,400
(DUI Checkpoint)

684
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,500
This is a DUI checkpoint.

685
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:46,866
Thank you.

686
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:52,900
This is a DUI checkpoint.

687
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:56,966
Yes, thank you.

688
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,233
This is a DUI checkpoint.

689
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:08,966
Hello.

690
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:15,566
Are you traveling?

691
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,766
Okay, enjoy your trip.

692
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,533
Just a moment, Mr. Gwang Man Se.

693
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,566
This is the bite mark from Sophie, right?

694
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,133
You didn't have a wound
on your left arm yesterday.

695
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,133
What is this?

696
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,800
Are there really two of the same people?

697
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,266
Excuse me. Can you get out of the car
for a second, Mr. Gwang Man Se?

698
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,233
You're not Gwang Man Se, are you?

699
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,900
What's going on?

700
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,100
- Stop right there!
- Stop right there!

701
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:02,833
Officer Hong!

702
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,733
- Are you okay, Officer Hong?
- Are you okay, Officer Hong?

703
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,033
We have an emergency.
Requesting immediate backup.

704
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,533
We have an emergency.
Requesting immediate backup.

705
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,433
(Emergency Medical Center)

706
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,966
Please have mercy!

707
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:45,200
Please, I beg you...

708
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,466
Please have mercy.

709
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,033
Please, I beg you...

710
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:54,733
Please.

711
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,366
Please have mercy.

712
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:59,700
Please, I beg you.

713
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,400
Who's calling?

714
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,233
(Eun Ha)

715
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:05,933
What?

716
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,900
Yes, Eun Ha?
Why are you calling at this hour?

717
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:42,733
- This way!
- Yes.

718
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:48,466
Go further in.

719
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:25,533
Robin.

720
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,866
Gwang Man Se.

721
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,733
You're under arrest for the murder
of Yang Gyu Bin.

722
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,033
Arrest him, Yeong Chun.

723
00:43:40,033 --> 00:43:41,933
They look totally identical.

724
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:44,400
- They're twins.
- Yes.

725
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:55,133
You said they weren't twins.
What happened?

726
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,433
They're twins and were separately adopted
to Korea and the U.S. as babies.

727
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,533
How identical could we be?

728
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:16,933
No way.

729
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,000
He really looks just like me.

730
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,866
Is this me?

731
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,633
A friend told me that a man in the U.S.
looks identical to me.

732
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,333
And I was taken aback when I saw
your picture, Robin.

733
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:41,033
We really do look alike.

734
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:44,333
I'm Gwang Man Se.
I live in Korea and I'm 35 years old.

735
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:49,100
I can't believe we were born
in the same year.

736
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,133
Seriously?

737
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:54,366
They were surprised by their similarities
and contacted each other through DMs.

738
00:44:54,366 --> 00:44:56,666
And they realized they were twins
with different adoptive parents,

739
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,933
so they tried to reunite after 35 years.

740
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,066
Please renew the contract.

741
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,266
We'll really die if you don't
renew the contract this time.

742
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:06,633
Ask for such a favor
after paying the rent on time.

743
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:10,333
There's a queue of people
willing to pay double the rent!

744
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,433
End of conversation!

745
00:45:11,433 --> 00:45:13,900
Mr. Yang, please! Just a moment.

746
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,233
You can't change your words
after agreeing to do so.

747
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:18,333
I said this conversation is over!
Get lost if you're incompetent!

748
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,366
Wait, Mr. Yang!

749
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:21,933
Who do you think you're grabbing?

750
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:22,833
Let go of me.

751
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,333
- I won't let go of you!
- Let go of me.

752
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,700
I won't let go of you!

753
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,933
I said let go!

754
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,366
Hey, Man Se!

755
00:45:51,366 --> 00:45:52,933
Do you want some beer?

756
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:08,500
Take it off!

757
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,433
Hey, Man Se, it's okay.

758
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,733
You got to go home.

759
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:28,700
Go!

760
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:33,333
But that day, Gwang Man Se
committed the crime...

761
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,233
and detective novelist Robin
feigned his alibi.

762
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:01,133
The two of them pretended
to be one person...

763
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:04,466
and planned to run away on a flight
bound for China today.

764
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,400
Officer Hong caught the culprit
of this case.

765
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:12,200
And thank you, Mr. Lee,

766
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,100
for taking Sophie to the crime scene.

767
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,733
Is Officer Hong okay?

768
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:20,533
Yes. She had a mild hemorrhage.

769
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,466
We were worried because
she has a rare blood type,

770
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,600
but she received an emergency
blood transfusion.

771
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:27,100
Officer Hong has a rare blood type?

772
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Yes.

773
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:02,333
I'm sorry.

774
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,666
I had no one else to call but you.

775
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:07,800
Of course, you should contact me.

776
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,000
My Cho Won...

777
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:23,200
I thought something would happen to her,

778
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:25,566
so I was so startled.

779
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:32,066
I was so scared that there was nothing
I could do for her.

780
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:36,566
You did everything for her.

781
00:48:36,566 --> 00:48:38,366
So don't cry, okay?

782
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,966
Cho Won will be sadder if you cry.

783
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:44,666
Cho Won will be fine,
so don't worry too much.

784
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,666
Yes, I'll do that.

785
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:52,466
Then I'll get going now.

786
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,933
You should wait until Cho Won
gains consciousness.

787
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,733
Maybe next time.

788
00:48:57,733 --> 00:49:01,500
Give the two of us time to ourselves
after Cho Won recovers.

789
00:49:02,966 --> 00:49:05,433
Okay. Get home safely.

790
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:06,866
- You should go inside.
- Yes.

791
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,166
Cho Won, are you okay?

792
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,166
It's me. Do you recognize me?

793
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:47,966
Thank you.

794
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,166
Dad.

795
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,400
Dad.

796
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:18,900
Dad.

797
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:06,186
(Dog Knows Everything)

798
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:09,762
Are you saying that Hyeon Ta,
the nation's idol, killed someone?

799
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:12,882
Song I died.

800
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:16,151
I'll deal with everything,

801
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:17,604
so don't worry.

802
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:18,619
Hey.

803
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:19,755
Think straight!

804
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:22,220
Delusional from sleeping pills?

805
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:23,830
I'll request a warrant to arrest Hyeon Ta.

806
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:25,780
You're not the type
of guy to do such a thing.

807
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:27,331
What on earth is going on?

808
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:29,762
Where's the body of your dead girlfriend
that you mentioned earlier?

809
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:31,156
I'm not sure.

810
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:34,460
I also saw her at the market yesterday.

811
00:51:34,873 --> 00:51:37,534
But she died the night before that
so, how did you see her yesterday?

812
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:41,309
The woman's scent still remains faint.

813
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,619
I'm sure he's hiding something.

814
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:45,663
Just watch him from up close.

815
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,833
