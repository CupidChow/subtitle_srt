(Scenes featuring animals are staged

3
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:11,566
Hello.

4
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:16,366
- Set it up nicely and end it smoothly.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,800
Good job. That's what I'm talking about.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,100
- You're all good to go.
- Yes, thank you.

7
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:39,733
What's the matter?

8
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,233
Why are you walking over with that face
and making me uneasy?

9
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,933
I'm sorry, sir.

10
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,633
It'll take a while to set things up.

11
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,500
I think the shoot will be delayed.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,233
What do you mean by "I think?"

13
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:52,100
When will anything be punctual
during the shoot?

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,133
So when am I scheduled to shoot?

15
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,400
We'll start shooting at 2 p.m.

16
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:57,766
I'll come to get you later.

17
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,600
The shoot is starting at 2 p.m.?

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
I guess I'll be shooting
until 3 p.m. then.

19
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:07,333
Then I should get some sleep.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,500
(Actor Kim Yong Gun)

21
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,400
Mr. Kim, we're about to shoot.
Please come with me.

22
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:35,666
Wake up, Mr. Kim. It's past 2 p.m.

23
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,033
Sir, wake up.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,133
Sir?

25
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,100
Kim Yong Gun has died.

26
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,700
Kim Yong Gun died!

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,000
Kim Yong Gun died!

28
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,700
What?

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,466
They said Yong Gun died.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,966
What crazy nonsense is that?

31
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,400
(Actor Kim Yong Gun stabbed to death
during a shoot.)

32
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:24,166
My goodness! Yong Gun!

33
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,733
(Actor Kim Yong Gun stabbed to death
during a shoot.)

34
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,200
My goodness! Yong Gun!

35
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,600
What's going on?

36
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,385
(Dog Knows Everything)

37
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:44,151
(Episode 8)

38
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,400
Kim Yong Gun has died.

39
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:51,866
What should we do? He died.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Check how many escape routes there are.

41
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,900
Hey, Yeong Chun.

42
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,900
The cast, staff,
and supporting cast members?

43
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,066
Anyway, receive a complete list.

44
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,466
How can this be?

45
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,733
What's going on?

46
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,100
This is a joke, right?

47
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,666
What should we do? Seriously...

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,066
How can this happen to him?

49
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,100
I died?

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,300
- What is this?
- What is this?

51
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:41,700
Are you okay, sir?

52
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,133
You startled us.

53
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,566
Your stand-in.

54
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,300
Your stand-in has died, Mr. Kim.

55
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,666
What?

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,966
So the culprit tried to kill me.
Is that right?

57
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,433
Yes. That's what we're assuming.

58
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:16,400
So, your stand-in,
dressed identically as you,

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,833
had been sitting in your chair
and was murdered.

60
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,966
But why would anyone kill me?

61
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:26,000
What have I done wrong?

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Does anyone come to mind?

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,233
Someone who would have
a grudge against you.

64
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,000
Excuse me, sir.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,133
Do you think I'd go around
asking for grudges?

66
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:37,366
That's not what I meant.
Surprisingly enough,

67
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:40,366
many people commit murders over
minor disputes or ridiculous reasons.

68
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,300
Cheol Seok, where have you been?

69
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,333
(First suspect, Kim Cheol Seok)

70
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,766
Cut! That's no good!

71
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,300
Haven't you been practicing?
Just how many times must we do this?

72
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,200
Seriously.

73
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,200
(Second suspect, Hyeon Ta)

74
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,533
- I quit!
- Sir.

75
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,566
(Third suspect, Director Baek)

76
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,633
This bread tastes weird.

77
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,433
That can't be.

78
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,533
"That's can't be?"

79
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,333
Try it! Go ahead and eat it!

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,400
(Fourth suspect, Kang Min U)

81
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,300
Raise your son decently!

82
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:06,933
(Fifth suspect, Lee Soon Jae)

83
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:07,766
It's a Gwang! I'll do a Go!

84
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,200
I didn't say "Go."

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,266
This doesn't count!

86
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:12,949
(Sixth suspect, Ye Su Jeong)

87
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:13,633
What's wrong with you?

88
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,616
(Seventh suspect, Song Ok Sook)

89
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:15,600
I was winning!

90
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,366
You lose!

91
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,766
(Eighth suspect, Im Chae Moo)

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,666
Sir, this murder was committed
in broad daylight.

93
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:30,100
You must tell me
if anything comes to mind.

94
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,833
Just a minute.

95
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,333
I've been threatened before.

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,466
Threatened?

97
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,366
Yes, so...

98
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:43,366
It was before I headed to the set
this morning.

99
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,033
What?

100
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,016
What's this?

101
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,000
(DIE)

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,366
What kind of jerk did this?

103
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,533
Hey, Cheol Seok.

104
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,666
Hey, hurry and erase this.

105
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,366
My goodness.

106
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,533
(DIE)

107
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:08,366
So the one targeting me
must have done it, right?

108
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,200
We'll start investigating immediately.

109
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,733
- Park Yeong Chun.
- Yes?

110
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,500
Please save me.

111
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:37,000
Darn it!

112
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,866
My goodness!

113
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,466
That startled me.

114
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,733
My back hurts.

115
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,033
Are you okay, Soon Jae?

116
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:52,800
I called the ambulance,
so hang in there a little.

117
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,666
Okay, walk gently.

119
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,600
- My back hurts.
- Go gently.

120
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,966
Being able to walk is everything
to old people like us.

121
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:18,433
Apparently, if you start relying
on others to walk,

122
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,966
it means your time is up.

123
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,100
Hey!

124
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you here as a visitor or a bully?

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,166
My goodness.

126
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,333
By the way, how did you end up
like this, Soon Jae?

127
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,200
He got into this mess because of books.

128
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,066
Books?

129
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:42,366
He can't even see clearly,
yet he reads so much!

130
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,600
He was highlighting phrases while reading,

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,266
dropped his pen, and sprained his back
while trying to pick it up.

132
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:50,000
My goodness.

133
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,566
It's so typical of an SNU graduate.

134
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,233
All of this over books.

135
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,900
My goodness, today is a long day...

136
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,266
- for Soon Jae and Yong Gun.
- That's right.

137
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,700
My goodness, how is Yong Gun doing?

138
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,800
He's residing in a studio
somewhere nearby...

139
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,466
He fears the culprit might find him
in Geoje-si, which is where we are.

140
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,933
So he rented a studio nearby
and said he'd stay there.

141
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:17,700
Let go of me!

142
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,000
Try calling Yong Gun then.

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
What? Okay.

144
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,233
What's this?

145
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,900
My goodness!
Why are you sitting there, Yong Gun?

146
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:43,600
I went to the studio,

147
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,233
but some strange guy chased after me,
so I couldn't stay there.

148
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,500
He knows I'm alive,

149
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,266
so he'll try to kill me whenever he can.

150
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm so scared.

151
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,433
What on earth is going on?

152
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:01,066
You're right. It'll be better for us
to stay here altogether.

153
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,466
It's a good thing you came.

154
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:05,300
But who on earth is the guy
that's trying to kill you?

155
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,500
The police don't know anything either.

156
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,500
The homicide case of actor
Kim Yong Gun's stand-in.

157
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,766
This is all over the news
and under the public limelight.

158
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,000
Yet you haven't found a single clue?

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,400
The thing is so many people
have a grudge against Kim Yong Gun,

160
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,533
so it isn't easy to identify the suspect.

161
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:32,766
It isn't possible because there are
too many. Is that what you're saying?

162
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,600
Are there 100,000 suspects?
Or are there 1,000,000?

163
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:36,666
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,633
The culprit will be after Kim Yong Gun
even at this moment.

165
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:43,600
Allocate a guard
at the hospital right now.

166
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,266
Right now!

167
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,533
What brings you here?

168
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,200
I'm Kim Yong Gun's daughter.

169
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,166
Dad!

170
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,500
Yes.

171
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,966
Do you know how shocked I was?

172
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:19,966
Did you come straight
from the hospital in Seoul?

173
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:21,700
Have you eaten?

174
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,433
That's not the issue.

175
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,666
I can't do anything because
my hands and feet are shaking.

176
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,733
You were so startled, weren't you?
Are you okay?

177
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,333
Of course, I'm okay.

178
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,700
You should say hello to Soon Jae.

179
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,033
That's right.

180
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:43,666
Mr. Lee.

181
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,933
You're here, Se Gyeong?

182
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:47,966
How's your back?

183
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,033
Is everything okay?

184
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,500
You and my dad are driving me crazy.

185
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,666
I'm okay.

186
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,133
I'm okay.

187
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,433
The police will continue
to guard the ward, right?

188
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,100
What brings you here?

189
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm here to visit.

190
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,466
I'm Lee Soon Jae's son.

191
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,566
Go ahead.

192
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,200
Se Gyeong...

193
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm sorry. Can you pretend
you didn't see me...

194
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:42,100
I'll go to the convenience store
to buy some necessities.

195
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,700
That's strange. I'm sure I saw Gi Dong.

196
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,033
Se Gyeong...

197
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,000
All I can do is just run away,
even if I meet you.

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,866
I miss you, Se Gyeong.

199
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,166
Hey, Lee Gi Dong!

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,900
What? Se Gyeong?

201
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,133
You bastard!

202
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,800
You ran away from our wedding...

203
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,133
and you were hiding in Geoje-do,
you bastard?

204
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,466
I looked for you so much!

205
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:51,166
Do you know how much I looked for you?

206
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,933
I'm sorry, Se Gyeong.
I'm the one to blame.

207
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,433
Do you know how much I missed you?

208
00:13:58,766 --> 00:13:59,766
Me, too.

209
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,366
I missed you, too.

210
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:15,733
Are you going to run away again?

211
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,200
Are you going to hide again?

212
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,066
No. I won't run away.

213
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,300
I'll never hide.

214
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,033
If you do this again,

215
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:27,633
I'll chase you to the end of the world
and kill you.

216
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:32,333
Okay. I'll never do that again.

217
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:39,800
I really missed you a lot, Gi Dong.

218
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,433
Me, too.

219
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,300
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll make up for the pain I gave Se Gyeong
for the rest of my life.

221
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,066
So are you saying that the two of you
will get back together...

222
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,733
after making all that fuss?

223
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,733
We reconfirmed our faith between us.

224
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,133
But there's something
I must resolve before this.

225
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,433
I had only avoided it so far
because I lacked courage.

226
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,333
But I'll no longer avoid it,
for Se Gyeong's sake.

227
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,333
I'll be sure to return after resolving it.

228
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,833
Gi Dong...

229
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,166
Se Gyeong, you trust me, right?

230
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,266
Don't worry.

231
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,933
See you later.

232
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,200
I'm sorry.

233
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,000
So you ran off on your wedding day?

234
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,066
Are you crazy?

235
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,300
How could I enter the wedding hall...

236
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,466
after learning that I have a daughter?

237
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:16,600
Gi Dong...

238
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:22,833
- Lee Gi Dong, listen to me carefully.
- Yes.

239
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,766
Cho Won is my daughter and not yours.

240
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:30,066
My daughter and I
have nothing to do with you.

241
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,733
Cho Won and I are happy
and couldn't ask for more.

242
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,766
There's no space for you between us.

243
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:40,800
So erase me and Cho Won
from your memories...

244
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,866
and get married.

245
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:47,100
Will that be okay?

246
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,533
You must have gone through a lot.

247
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,100
That should be enough.

248
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:56,233
Eun Ha...

249
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,733
I didn't want to say this,

250
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:06,266
but that night, I made a mistake
because I was drunk.

251
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,033
What?

252
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,333
And most importantly,

253
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,666
you're not my style. I'm sorry.

254
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,700
I see.

255
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,466
- Then is everything settled now?
- Yes.

256
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:41,700
What a relief.

257
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:45,400
What did I tell you?
I told you to trust me.

258
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,866
It's been so long since I last saw you
and you look even cuter.

259
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,100
That hurts, honey.

260
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,600
You're perfectly my style.

261
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,033
Come over here.

262
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,733
Seriously, don't do this.

263
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,566
Stay put.

264
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:06,833
I said don't do it.

265
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,600
- Our dads are all sleeping.
- Seriously.

266
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,000
Stop it!

267
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,566
Do you work out these days?

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,666
Who is it? I'm trying to sleep...

269
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,500
This is porridge
made with fresh sea urchins.

270
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,900
My goodness,
why did you bring such a thing?

271
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,566
I was so surprised
when I heard you collapsed.

272
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,900
- You should try it.
- Yes.

273
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,666
Eun Ha! My goodness!

274
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,266
You should also try it, Mr. Kim.

275
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:08,133
I don't know if it'll suit your palate.

276
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,633
The noodle lady
has brought porridge for us.

277
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,200
Porridge isn't enough to give me energy.

278
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,666
My goodness, it looks delicious.

279
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,866
Thank you so much.

280
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:23,133
You're so beautiful
and you're also a great cook.

281
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,566
You're so versatile.

282
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:29,833
My goodness, it feels great to be
complimented by a pretty person.

283
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,433
You should join them. I've cooked plenty.

284
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:34,800
Thank you.

285
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,733
I left the anchovy stock on the fire.
I better get going.

286
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,966
I hope you get better soon.

287
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:43,266
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

288
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,966
Yes, I'll get going now.

289
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,366
Good luck to you, too, Mr. Lee.

290
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes...

291
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,933
My stomach suddenly...

292
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,766
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Okay, go ahead.

293
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,066
Aren't you going to ask what's going on?

294
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,266
What?

295
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:16,466
Well, what's going on?

296
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,833
Actually, I'm here to ask you for a favor.

297
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,366
A favor?

298
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,733
There are issues
with my noodle restaurant.

299
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,800
Business is going well, so the landlord
seems to be having other ideas.

300
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,900
So at the end of this month,
when the contract ends,

301
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,266
- I need to leave the store.
- What?

302
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:40,166
Or pay an extra 100,000 dollars
for the deposit.

303
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,666
One hundred thousand dollars?

304
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,733
Yes, an extra 100,000 dollars.

305
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,933
Speaking of which,
can you lend me some money?

306
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:56,033
But I don't have any money.

307
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:01,033
Hey, who has 100,000 dollars
in their pocket?

308
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:04,866
I don't have such money
in my pocket or in that bank.

309
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
I don't have 100,000 dollars.

310
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:14,300
I went to see your father because
I thought you wouldn't have money.

311
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:18,833
Father? You mean my father?

312
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,500
I'm not his daughter-in-law,

313
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,233
but our daughter, Cho Won,
is his biological granddaughter.

314
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,100
He might help me if I explain
my situation to him.

315
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,900
But Eun Ha,

316
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,933
you told me to forget everything
and get married yesterday.

317
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,133
I had no choice but to visit the hospital.

318
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,100
Is it not possible?

319
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,033
Eun Ha, I seriously don't have money.

320
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:43,733
Is that so?

321
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:47,866
I guess we'll have to tell your father.

322
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,333
Let's introduce Cho Won to him first.

323
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,400
Eun Ha, wait! Just a moment!

324
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,333
We can't tell my dad about this.

325
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,366
I...

326
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,333
I'll try to figure it out.

327
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,466
I'm sorry, Gi Dong.

328
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,900
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

329
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,733
Please calm down and take a seat.

330
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,933
Sir, I have something to tell you.

331
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,100
Yes, what's the matter?

332
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,600
Can I receive my salary in advance?

333
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:38,166
Is it urgent?

334
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,166
Yes, it turned out that way.

335
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,066
Okay, I'll do it.

336
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,733
Really? Thank you!

337
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:44,833
Thank you, sir!

338
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:45,700
You thought I would say that?

339
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,633
If you need money,
take it after killing me!

340
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:50,633
Take it after killing me!

341
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,466
But how could I...

342
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:55,666
Do you know how I ended up
being abandoned by my wife...

343
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,866
and living like this?

344
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:59,400
I wonder who that is.

345
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,333
I don't think it's me.

346
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm hanging up.

347
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:11,666
I'll cut my own wrist with an axe
if I lend money again!

348
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,233
What's the matter, Manager Lee?

349
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,266
Do you have something to tell me?

350
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:18,533
It's nothing.

351
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:22,100
I'll chop the firewood, sir.

352
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,100
It snapped. What should I do?

353
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,966
I feel hungry after eating that porridge.

354
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:44,166
But have they still not
caught the culprit yet?

355
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,833
Is the police following me?

356
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,800
I apologize for everything.

357
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,300
I beg you. Please forgive me.

358
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,066
Yong Gun, turn around.

359
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,800
It's me, Byung Sook.

360
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,800
Byung Sook?

361
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Are you okay, Yong Gun?

362
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,200
It really is you, Byung Sook.

363
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,666
Of course, it really is me.

364
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,900
I was worried about you after seeing
the news, but we ended up meeting here.

365
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:37,400
Were you worried about me?

366
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,966
Of course, I did.

367
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:42,400
I've been thinking about you lately,

368
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,666
and I guess it was a sign
we would meet like this.

369
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,966
I missed you.

370
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,366
What brings you here?

371
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:54,833
I'm meeting my daughter and granddaughter.

372
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,433
I have a checkup today.

373
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,100
There comes my daughter.

374
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,200
Mom!

375
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,833
Mr. Kim Yong Gun?

376
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,400
Mom, how are you acquainted with him?

377
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
You don't know, right?

378
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:11,033
This man was my first love.

379
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,233
Mr. Kim?

380
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,566
Really?

381
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:16,700
Are you serious?

382
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
My goodness, what a surprise.

383
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,000
What is it, Mom? What's surprising?

384
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,933
Hey, Mr. Kim Yong Gun
is your grandmother's first love.

385
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,000
No way, Grandma!

386
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,766
You must have liked good-looking men.

387
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:33,800
Exactly.

388
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,233
What a coincidence this is.

389
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,866
I'm a regular customer
at her noodle restaurant.

390
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,533
- Exactly.
- That's right.

391
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,200
Her noodles taste good.

392
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,866
What should I do? Why now...

393
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:46,933
My goodness.

(Geumhan Bank,
Fingerprint login)

396
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,166
What are you doing?

397
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,400
Dad!

398
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,166
Why are you signing into my bank account?

399
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,400
Why?

400
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,700
Dad, please calm down.

401
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,300
You need to be careful of your back!

402
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,266
You punk!

403
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,866
How dare you try to use my fingerprint
to steal money when I'm sick in bed?

404
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,366
You thief!

405
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,366
You thieving rascal!

406
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:52,000
You should just get out and just die!

407
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,566
- Dad!
- Get out!

408
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:54,766
Get out and die!

409
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:57,766
I'm sorry, Dad! I was in a rush!

410
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,666
I'm sorry.

411
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,533
Dad, what is wrong with me?

412
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,333
Dad, about my daughter
whom I mentioned to you last time...

413
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,333
She's...

414
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,700
Officer Hong.

415
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:14,000
What?

416
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,900
Your granddaughter is Officer Hong Cho Won
at the precinct.

417
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,266
What are you talking about?

418
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:22,700
I briefly dated
the owner of Eun Ha Noodles,

419
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,833
the woman who visited this morning.

420
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,300
It was really brief,

421
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,400
but she must have realized
she was pregnant after we broke up.

422
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,500
But that child is Officer Hong...

423
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,433
and Eun Ha needs money,
but I don't have any.

424
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,200
I understand you ran away
on your wedding day...

425
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,033
because you found out you have a daughter.

426
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,366
But that daughter is Officer Hong
at the precinct?

427
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,333
Yes.

428
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,600
Then is Officer Hong my granddaughter?

429
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,100
Yes.

430
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,200
Mr. Kim!

431
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,966
What? You have a daughter?

432
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:05,166
But you hid that truth
and tried to marry my daughter?

433
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,733
Sir, that's...

434
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:11,366
Yong Gun, I'm sorry,
but please hear us out.

435
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:14,000
I have nothing to listen to,
so listen to me!

436
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:17,533
I'm never giving my daughter to you!

437
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,900
I'll never allow this wedding
and that's that!

438
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,533
You scoundrel!

439
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,100
Wait, sir...

(Geoje Hospital)

441
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,833
How can you be sleepy, Lee Gi Dong?

442
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,766
Just how many people are suffering
because of you?

443
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,100
Darn it!

444
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,566
That hurts.

445
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,366
What's the matter?

446
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:17,766
Is there something wrong with the results?

447
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:20,033
That's not it.

448
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:24,433
Yong Gun, the thing is...

449
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:27,166
I'm okay, so go ahead.

450
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:33,700
Actually, you're my first and last love.

451
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,000
My goodness, why would you
say such a thing?

452
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:43,700
Wait, what do you mean by that?

453
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,466
I'm your first and last love?

454
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,400
Then on that day...

455
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,933
Yes.

456
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,133
Eun Ha, whom you met yesterday,

457
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,666
is your daughter, Yong Gun.

458
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,000
Eun Ha...

459
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,033
Dear God.

460
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:15,600
Se Gyeong and Eun Ha...

461
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
were sisters.

462
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:22,200
What should I do now?

463
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:32,566
My boyfriend has a daughter.

464
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,833
You must have been startled, Se Gyeong.

465
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:40,100
He ran away on our wedding day...

466
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,200
because he realized he had a daughter.

467
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,966
What should I do now, Eun Ha?

468
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:50,833
It all depends on how you feel.

469
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:55,300
Do you still love that man?

470
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,000
I do love him,

471
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:03,366
but I'm not too sure anymore.

472
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,866
Se Gyeong...

473
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,366
What should I do?

474
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:22,733
Gi Dong, stop crying and come over here.

475
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:24,866
Dad.

476
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,566
I have someone to introduce to you.

477
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,166
She's your mother.

478
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,633
My mother?

479
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:37,100
But she's Kim Yong Gun's...

480
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,900
first and last love.

481
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,666
Say "Mom."

482
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,500
Darn it...

483
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,900
- Gi Dong.
- Yes?

484
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,066
That's right. The three of you...

485
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:54,400
are actually siblings
with the same mother.

486
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:56,733
Eun Ha...

487
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:58,933
Gi Dong...

488
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,433
Se Gyeong...

489
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,333
My siblings.

490
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,766
What's wrong with all of you?

491
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,566
What's going on?

492
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:15,200
No! This is ridiculous! This is a lie!

493
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,000
No!

494
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,166
- Gi Dong!
- Gi Dong!

495
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,200
This can't be true!
How can we be siblings?

496
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,266
My goodness me, you should move aside.

497
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:52,300
My goodness.

498
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:54,800
My goodness.

499
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,466
Something's touching me...

500
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,466
Mom?

501
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,366
Mom.

502
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:16,300
Mom, what are you doing...

503
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,100
What? "Mom?"

504
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,233
Look at this crazy guy saying nonsense.

505
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,133
Who do you think you're calling "Mom?"

506
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,766
You look like a mop.

507
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,433
I said get out of the way.

508
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,266
Yes! It was a dream!

509
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:34,366
You're not my mother, right?

510
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:37,000
Thank you so much for not being my mother!

511
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Thank you!

512
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,166
Thank you, ma'am!

513
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,533
It's nothing to thank, but...

514
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,166
Why are you sleeping on the stairs
instead of the bed?

515
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,466
What a weirdo.

516
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,533
It was a dream.

517
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:50,866
It was a dream.

518
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,533
Se Gyeong.

519
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:08,133
I missed you so much.

520
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:12,566
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

521
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,533
You missed me?

522
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:27,633
Don't talk nonsense with that mouth
of yours, you jerk!

523
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,766
What? You missed me?

524
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:32,466
This is making me so angry.

525
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,166
Okay, we're at a hospital,
so it's perfect.

526
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,933
Let's both kill ourselves today, you jerk!

527
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:40,700
Se Gyeong, that hurts! Don't do this!

528
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,566
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

529
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:45,900
I'll explain everything.

530
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,466
So please stop and hear me out, Se Gyeong.

531
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,866
Okay? I'm serious.

532
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,433
Okay.

533
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:54,933
Let's hear it.

534
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:56,533
What's with you?

535
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,133
Where have you been?

536
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,833
Why did you do such a thing?

537
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,333
You see...

538
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,266
Let's talk later!

539
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll be sure to call you! I'm sorry!
I'll call you, Se Gyeong!

540
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,500
Gi Dong!

541
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,766
Hey, Lee Gi Dong!

542
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,200
Did he just run away again?

543
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:19,500
He won't get away with this.

544
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,466
Hey, Se Gyeong.

545
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,000
- Dad.
- Yes.

546
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,100
What's the matter?

547
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,033
It's nothing.

548
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:43,300
Just what are you thinking, Lee Gi Dong?

549
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,466
I'm so distressed.

550
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,866
I'm so distressed because I feel so bad.

551
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,400
I ran away...

552
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,733
but because I want to run away again,
I'm so distressed.

553
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,700
For crying out loud.

554
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,966
That was my first gift from Se Gyeong!

555
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,100
Se Gyeong!

556
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:23,100
It's freezing!

557
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,800
Se Gyeong!

558
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,200
Help me!

559
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:43,066
Help me!

560
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:47,700
Sir! You can't do this!

561
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,533
Dying won't resolve anything!

562
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,333
- Help me!
- Sir!

563
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Sir!

564
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Here you go.

565
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,633
Thank you.

566
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,533
Anyone would think you were
committing suicide if they saw this.

567
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,566
Someone said that...

568
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:35,133
life continues if you continue to live on.

569
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,466
And a good day is bound to come
if you continue to live on.

570
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:43,466
You're right.

571
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:45,400
I guess I must live on, no matter what.

572
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,266
But who said such wise words like that?

573
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,700
I did.

574
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,833
I don't know what happened to you,
but hang in there a little.

575
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,766
It's hard to hang in there tight,
so just hang in there a little.

576
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,466
Then good days are bound to come for you.

577
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:09,233
Support request for a banner collection
report at Geoje Elementary School.

578
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:10,433
I need to get going.

579
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,500
Hang in there a little for now, okay?

580
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,700
My daughter is such a great person.

581
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,833
She's right.
There's no heaven for a runaway.

582
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,933
Lee Gi Dong, let's face this.

583
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:37,333
Let's cheer up for a little for now.

584
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:51,866
(Kang Jun Sik's handsome youngest son,
Kang Min U, passed the pharmacist exam!)

585
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,466
You're the offender?

586
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,466
Stop right there!

587
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:13,500
I'm arresting you for damaging the banner.

588
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,466
Officer Hong.

589
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:21,900
Wait, you're the offender?

590
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:27,300
I received a report that someone
was damaging the banner.

591
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:36,433
Then are you the commendable
and handsome youngest son?

592
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,133
Yes.

593
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:42,200
Don't laugh.

594
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,600
I told them not to do this.

595
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:49,266
Then are you now a pharmacist?
Congratulations.

596
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,366
Thank you.

597
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:56,333
But am I an offender?

598
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,600
You have a point. What happens
if you remove your own banner?

599
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,466
It's also my first time
seeing this situation.

600
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,433
But why are you removing it?

601
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,600
Your parents must be so proud.

602
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:14,933
Then can I just erase the "handsome" part?

603
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:16,766
But that's the whole point.

604
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,000
Pardon?

605
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,333
It's nothing.

606
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,300
I'll let it slide, so leave it like this.

607
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:26,766
Should I?

608
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:30,716
Why can't you catch the culprit?

609
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:31,900
(One week after the homicide)

610
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,933
A murder broke out at a tourist
destination in broad daylight.

611
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,233
There must be footage on dashcams,
so why can't you catch the culprit?

612
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:41,266
The thing is we arrived at the scene
ten minutes after the report was filed,

613
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:43,100
but there wasn't a single vehicle nearby.

614
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,566
Footsteps, fingerprints...

615
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:46,966
There wasn't a single trace.
It was so clean.

616
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,033
Right, Park Yeong Chun?

617
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,533
Yes, that is correct.

618
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:50,600
Are you certain?

619
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,000
That person is an expert.

620
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,533
They are undoubtedly skilled.

621
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,933
How should I report this
to the upper hand?

622
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,566
Hey, Yuk Dong Gu.

623
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,233
You've been catching criminals so well,
so what's wrong with you this time?

624
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:04,966
I'm sorry.

625
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:07,900
Do you think you can catch the culprit...

626
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,066
if you sit around quietly like this?
Do you?

627
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:11,633
Hurry and get out there!

628
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:13,233
Get out! I ought to...

629
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,800
Hurry and get out!

630
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,100
Why I ought to...

631
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:31,500
It's scarier to have the police
guarding the ward like this.

632
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,166
- Ok Sook.
- Yes?

633
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,100
It's already been a week
since you've been rinsing your eyes.

634
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
How many bottles have you gone through?

635
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:41,333
Let's go to the ophthalmologist together.

636
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,800
No, it isn't something
for the ophthalmologist.

637
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,966
I need to see a psychiatrist.

638
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:47,800
It's seriously driving me insane!

639
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,266
What nonsense is that?

640
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,533
But Yong Gun, there's a lot to do here.
Why go to the U.S. all of a sudden?

641
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:57,900
Please calm down, Yong Gun.

642
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,300
What else is there to prioritize?

643
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,000
What's the point of making money
when it'll go to vain if we die?

644
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:08,633
A murderer is after me,

645
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:10,433
so how am I supposed to live here?

646
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,000
Yong Gun.

647
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,100
The police are guarding our house...

648
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,966
and we'll take turns staying with you...

649
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:20,666
Don't talk about taking turns, Soon Jae.

650
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,100
You sprained your back
while trying to pick up a ballpoint pen.

651
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,300
You should look after yourself.

652
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,900
What's wrong with taking turns?

653
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:28,466
Soon Jae,

654
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,800
Sophie is outside.
He seems to have something to say.

655
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,066
The cat's name is Na Bi...

656
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:39,833
and the dog's name is Ba Duk.

657
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,633
According to their confession,

658
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:45,633
they were fighting over fish cakes
and Na Bi suddenly made a gust of wind...

659
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:49,000
and Ba Duk stabbed the man
with a big nail.

660
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,866
And that's how the man died.

661
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,566
So you're saying
that Na Bi made a gust of wind...

662
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:56,333
and Ba Duk stabbed him?

663
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:38,033
Fish cakes are here!

664
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,333
Spicy rice cakes are here!

665
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,633
Fish cakes are here!

666
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:43,966
Spicy rice cakes are here!

667
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:45,300
(Fish cakes)

668
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,233
Fish cakes are here!

669
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,000
Spicy rice cakes are here!

670
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,366
Yes, I can see clearly.

671
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,600
- Sir.
- Yes?

672
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,133
Were you also in business here
on the day of the incident?

673
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:07,400
Yes. I'm always in business from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Wednesdays.

674
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,200
Are you sure you left the place at 2 p.m.?

675
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,566
Yes. I'm punctual
when it comes to business hours.

676
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:17,766
Only then can I start selling
in front of the school at 3 p.m.

677
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:21,533
That's why there wasn't a single vehicle
when the police arrived at the scene.

678
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,466
Because the police arrived at 2:20 p.m.

679
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:25,833
And the time of the report?

680
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,633
The report? Give me a moment.

681
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,200
It was filed at 2:10 p.m.

682
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,933
I didn't even know a murder
occurred that day.

683
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:36,733
And the estimated time of death?

684
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:39,500
Forensics assume that it was...

685
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,566
between 1:40 p.m. and 2:10 p.m.

686
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:46,500
Was your truck facing this direction
that day as well?

687
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,566
Yes. I always set it up like this
for business.

688
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:03,300
If the culprit had committed the murder...

689
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,833
prior to the snack truck pulling out
before 2 p.m...

690
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:09,033
Then it would've been caught
on that dashcam.

691
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,733
(Actor Kim Yong Gun)

692
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,333
Of course.

693
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:06,333
I knew it.

694
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:08,900
A homicide without a culprit.

695
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:11,500
It's just as I expected.

696
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,033
I better go and report this to the chief.

697
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:16,166
- Officer Hong.
- Yes?

698
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,200
Great job. Return to the precinct.

699
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:26,266
"Of course. I knew it."

700
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,600
"It's just as I expected."

701
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,566
I better come up with a plan
if he steals the credit again.

702
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,466
I can't just sit back and watch.

703
00:48:12,966 --> 00:48:14,533
- My goodness.
- This is killing me.

704
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:15,866
My goodness, look at you.

705
00:48:15,866 --> 00:48:19,433
- Hey, get up.
- I'm hurting.

706
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:20,666
Get up.

707
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:21,533
My goodness.

708
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:26,233
The murderer has been identified...

709
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:27,766
and everything has worked out,
so what's the matter with you?

710
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:32,700
Su Jeong, I have something...

711
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,666
to confess to you.

712
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:37,733
Tell me. Just spill it out.

713
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,633
About Soon Jae...

714
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,533
Soon Jae didn't...

715
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:47,633
hurt his back...

716
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,266
while doing something graceful
like reading.

717
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:51,700
Then what was it?

718
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,733
My goodness.

719
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:01,700
My goodness.

720
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:03,533
My goodness.

721
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,566
- My goodness.
- What's this sound?

722
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:11,566
I don't think he's constipated.

723
00:49:13,933 --> 00:49:15,266
- Soon Jae.
- My goodness.

724
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,633
Are you okay, Soon Jae?

725
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:20,566
Help me. I can't move.

726
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,633
What is this? Did he collapse?

727
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:25,766
Soon Jae, I'm coming inside.

728
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:30,633
My goodness.

729
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,233
My back hurts.

730
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:36,700
That hurts.

731
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:56,400
I heard you found the fish cake truck...

732
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,666
and that's how the culprit was identified.

733
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:01,066
Why did you go through such a hassle?

734
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:03,300
What do you mean?
You said you're going to the U.S.

735
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,133
What about me going to the U.S.?

736
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,133
I guess you couldn't stand
parting with me, right?

737
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:13,000
My goodness, you're so annoying.
You should just go to the U.S.

738
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,533
Don't be annoyed.

739
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:17,600
Wait a minute.

740
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,233
Then what was that message
threatening me to die?

741
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:23,233
What was it?

742
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:29,366
(EID, Eat In and Dine)

743
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,533
(DIE, Dine In and Eat)

744
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:44,266
Jun Beom!

745
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,166
What are you doing? Let's go.

746
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:48,300
What were you doing?

747
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,866
(DIE)

748
00:51:23,203 --> 00:51:25,986
(Dog Knows Everything)

749
00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:28,323
Congratulations, number 12.

750
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:34,368
Is it true that the
lottery homicide suspect is Hong Bu Ja?

751
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:35,318
That suspect...

752
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:37,088
Ms. Hong Bu Ja.

753
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:37,521
Pardon?

754
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:38,504
It's my girlfriend.

755
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,349
Your father won the lottery.

756
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,206
- What?
- It's worth 350,000 dollars after tax.

757
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,096
The murder occurred
because of a lottery ticket,

758
00:51:48,096 --> 00:51:49,863
so the person with the lottery ticket
is likely to be the culprit.

759
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:50,821
My goodness.

760
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,928
I'm so upset.

761
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:55,096
I better meet Bok Sil.

762
00:51:55,428 --> 00:51:56,248
Bok Sil?

763
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:58,227
It's him. That's the man.

764
00:51:58,227 --> 00:51:59,774
Chae Moo is the murderer?

765
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:02,219
There's a person who's remaining silent.

766
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,469
We should wait and see.

767
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:05,405
Sophie, you can do it, right?

768
00:52:05,947 --> 00:52:07,947
