3
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:15,833
My goodness, hello.

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,366
- Yes.
- Hello.

5
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:18,666
You look much better in person.

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,933
You look great.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,033
You're so good-looking.

8
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello, Mr. Lee.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,933
- Yes.
- I'm your fan.

10
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,266
- Really?
- Can I take a picture with you?

11
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,166
Yes, go ahead.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,100
Say "Kimchi!"

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,033
Thank you.

14
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,033
Enjoy your trip.

15
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:38,066
Mr. Lee, you look great.

16
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:46,400
That rascal.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,933
Here she goes again.

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,233
Why do you bark at me whenever you see me?

19
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,433
You little ball of fluff.

20
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,366
Go away!

21
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:00,333
Seriously, I said go away.

22
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:07,566
(Dog Knows Everything)

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,433
That's Mount Wonhyosan
and that's Mount Hwangmaesan.

24
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,833
And that's Mount Jirisan.

25
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,266
It's a nice and breezy place
with beautiful hills.

26
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,166
There's a reason
why we installed these here.

27
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:21,600
So you're saying that you make money
with these windmills?

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,866
To be exact, I make money
with the electricity...

29
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,833
produced by these wind turbines.

30
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,533
The wind is free.

31
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,066
So you're making free money.

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,800
But can an individual possess these?

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,866
I thought the government managed these.

34
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,500
This isn't run by an individual,
but the company I invested in...

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,466
owns the business for these wind turbines.

36
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,933
And I receive the respective
dividends every month.

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,333
- That's incredible.
- Just a minute.

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,200
There are so many ways to make money.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,000
This is why one must be intelligent.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,900
Geun Su is the guy who made me
pay for the meat.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,933
What a cheapskate.

42
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,933
What's wrong with you?
Don't trust that man too much.

43
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,033
I have a feeling...

44
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,733
- Yong Gun.
- Yes, what is it?

45
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:06,966
Here you go.

46
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,433
No, don't bother.

47
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,000
Last time, you paid
for the meat instead of me.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,933
- My goodness.
- Hurry and take it.

49
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,166
I paid for it, so it's all settled.

50
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,066
- Hurry and take it.
- My goodness, no.

51
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:15,700
Take it.

52
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,866
My gosh. Okay, fine.

53
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,633
Hold on.

54
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,033
What's this?

55
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,633
I left my reading glasses in the car.

56
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,766
I can't read this.

57
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,033
What's this?

58
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:32,400
You'll send your cell phone all the way
to Seoul at this rate.

59
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,533
I guess you become far-sighted,
regardless of your intelligence.

60
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,266
Life is fair indeed.

61
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:42,300
- What does that say?
- Three thousand dollars for wind energy.

62
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,100
So you've already received
3,000 dollars as the dividend?

63
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,900
Why did they send me this now?

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,300
Wait, so the wind is free...

65
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,666
but you receive 3,000 dollars
for operating four windmills?

66
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,433
No, it's 3,000 per one.

67
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,333
- Three thousand dollars each?
- Yes.

68
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,200
Since there are four, that makes it
three times four.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,833
- So that's 12,000 dollars a month?
- Yes.

70
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,400
So you make 12,000 dollars...

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,266
a month with those windmills?

72
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,400
That's great.

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,233
Geun Su, I want to operate
a windmill, too.

74
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,933
Me, too!

75
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:17,400
How much do you need
to invest in one of those?

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,833
Don't do it.

77
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,166
- Why not?
- You don't have any...

78
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,600
Come on, tell me.

79
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,566
The total is 128 dollars?

80
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,533
Since it's free, the bill is this high
because you ordered everything.

81
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,766
Then what could I have done
when it's all free?

82
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:40,066
We should have one waffle per person,
even if it's excessively sweet.

83
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,500
I'm not having one waffle by myself.
It'll give me a sugar rush.

84
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,433
Fine, these are all mine.

85
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,500
I'll have two waffles for myself.

86
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:50,866
Mr. Park Geun Su said you can order
as you please, so don't worry.

87
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,400
Thank you.

88
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,333
You must have it so easy
to live like such a rogue.

89
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,233
I'm full just being around...

90
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,833
such a wealthy friend.

91
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,733
Hey, if you feed off someone,

92
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:11,300
it could go down the wrong pipe.

93
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,166
Continue after wiping that whipped cream
off your lips first.

94
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,133
Thank you.

95
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,933
- Geun Su.
- Yes?

96
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,766
Promise to give us a windmill each.

97
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,400
Okay?

98
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,533
Seriously...

99
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,366
Actually, I came to Geoje...

100
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,933
to invest in one more wind turbine...

101
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,433
and for other reasons, too.

102
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,333
You're genuinely interested, right?

103
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,166
- Yes.
- Yes.

104
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,133
Of course, since we've seen 3,000 dollars
get deposited into your bank account.

105
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,733
I'm fine, so leave me out.

106
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,766
Okay, I'll let you invest in this one.

107
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,500
Think of it as a means
to make pocket money.

108
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,366
It costs 30,000 dollars
to invest in one wind turbine.

109
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,066
The three of you can invest...

110
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,866
in 10,000 dollars per blade.

111
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,800
Then you're all interested
except for Yong Gun, right?

112
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,200
Go ahead and do it. Don't mind me.

113
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:10,866
You'll regret it, Yong Gun.

114
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,400
I won't regret it.

115
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,433
Let's decide with rock, paper, scissors.

116
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:23,633
No!

117
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,966
I always lose at rock, paper, scissors.

118
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,133
Just go ahead and do anything.

119
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,733
I'm holding back on going to the bathroom.

120
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,800
Why don't we decide with a vote?

121
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,633
Let's do it democratically.

122
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,533
Then everyone will write their own names.

123
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,800
Just write the name of the person
you want to exclude out of the four.

124
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:53,833
Now who do you want to exclude
from the wind turbine investment?

125
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,633
What?

126
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,566
- Lee Soon Jae.
- It's not me.

127
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,933
It wasn't me either.

128
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,200
Well, I...

129
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,533
Yes. I wrote it.

130
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,600
How could I write your names?

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,833
Okay, then let's check the next one.

132
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,666
Lee Soon Jae!

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,766
That wasn't me.

134
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,333
- Hey, Ok Sook.
- Yes?

135
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,100
How can you write Soon Jae's name?

136
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,033
What's wrong with you?
I swear it isn't me.

137
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:35,900
Next one.

138
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,666
Lee Soon Jae!

139
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,600
No, Soon Jae. I swear it isn't me.

140
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,833
Okay, here's the last one.

141
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,300
It's Lee Soon Jae and it's unanimous.

142
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,566
What's so funny? Give it to me.

143
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,166
You all wrote my name.

144
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,233
Hey, we need to talk.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,100
Darn it!

146
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,633
It wasn't me.

147
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Poor Soon Jae.

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,966
He must be upset. We're in trouble.

149
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:32,600
(Message)

150
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,133
It isn't me.

151
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,033
(Send 10,000 dollars
to Park Geun Su's bank account?)

152
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,866
Okay, the transaction is complete.

153
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:06,133
When I receive 1,000 dollars,
I'll buy a pair of heels.

154
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,300
I've also completed the transaction.

155
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,833
Once I receive the money,
I'll eat sweet and sour beef.

156
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,700
It sounds so good.

157
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,100
Hey, I don't feel too good about this.

158
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,800
Why would he let you guys
invest in it if it's that good?

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Geun Su has always been loyal
since our early days.

160
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,100
And he's good-looking, too.

161
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:27,300
Yong Gun, you've always been
jealous of Geun Su.

162
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,800
I guess you're still jealous.

163
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,166
Hey, you only feel jealous
when someone is better than you.

164
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,166
Anyone can see I'm clearly better.

165
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,933
The great Yong Gun,
so when will you get out of that chair?

166
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,333
Finish it quickly so I can also try it.

167
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,466
I've tried it...

168
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:48,600
and it feels great, like someone
is massaging me with their hands.

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,266
It does, right? It massages you
really deep, doesn't it?

170
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,333
Yes.

171
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,033
Su Jeong, have you completed
your transaction?

172
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,066
He said it has to be completed
by the end of today, so hurry.

173
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:04,266
I don't know. You guys take care of it.

174
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,633
Where are you going at this hour?

175
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,133
You need to complete
the transaction by today.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,533
Who's going to complete the transaction
instead of Su Jeong?

177
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,700
There's Lee Soon Jae.

178
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,133
The Lee Soon Jae
whom you eliminated unanimously.

179
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,833
Soon Jae, I swear it wasn't me.

180
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,033
I didn't write your name.

181
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,800
What a ridiculous duo.

182
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:48,433
I received a text message
on my cell phone.

183
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,466
(Samyong Card authorization,
Song "blank" Hun, 2.80 dollars, ANDU24)

184
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:55,000
So for the past five years, your son,
Song Yeong Hun, has never used his card.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,300
But last night, you received
this payment authorization text message...

186
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
on your cell phone. Is that right?

187
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,666
Yes.

188
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,866
I left my son's cell phone
and credit cards active...

189
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:09,133
after he went missing five years ago.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,066
And I changed the notification setting
so that I'd receive the message.

191
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,433
My son used his credit card.

192
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,866
So he must be alive, right?

193
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,600
Can you quickly look into it?

194
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,366
But I'm still going to buy this.

195
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,433
Okay.

196
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,866
So you're looking for the person who paid
this amount at 8:14 p.m. last night?

197
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,933
Sir, can I check the surveillance camera?

198
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,666
Yes. Please come this way.

199
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
He did it again.
He used the credit card again.

200
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,000
(Samyong Card authorization,
Song "blank" Hun, 5.60 dollars, ANDU24)

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
ANDU24 Convenience Store?

202
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,966
That's where we are now.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,033
- Can I have this, please?
- Okay.

204
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,566
- Please insert your card.
- Okay.

205
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,633
The payment has been completed.
Have a nice day.

206
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,100
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

207
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,066
Where did you get this?

208
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,997
- Daddy!
- Ro Ah.

209
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:04,666
(Five years ago)

210
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:27,233
Yeong Hun, didn't you say you would
introduce me to your fiancée?

211
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:29,766
Mom.

212
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:36,186
He's my fiancé.

213
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:41,804
Ms. Ye, we'll live happily.

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,128
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,069
What do you think you're doing?

216
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,692
No!

217
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,366
I'll never allow this before I die!

218
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,166
I placed Yeong Hun's credit card
in the drawer...

219
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,933
and I didn't know Ro Ah took it out
to use it.

220
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:29,333
I also still have Yeong Hun's possessions.

221
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:36,266
When I received the text message,
I knew it wasn't possible,

222
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,666
but I hoped Yeong Hun had used the card.

223
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,700
There's no way Yeong Hun
would have used it.

224
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,800
Your daughter has grown a lot.

225
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,433
I'm sorry, Ms. Ye.

226
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,733
It's already been five years, right?

227
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,300
It's still very tough, isn't it?

228
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,100
I better move on now.

229
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,533
Although he's still missing,

230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,666
I should accept that he no longer
exists in this world.

231
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Ro Ah.

232
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,900
Grandma is leaving.

233
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,833
Goodbye.

234
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,866
Here you go.

235
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,933
My goodness! Thank you so much.

236
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,500
I'll call you "big brother" from now on.

237
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:54,366
I genuinely appreciate it. Thank you.

238
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,666
- Soon Jae.
- Thanks a lot.

239
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,066
I love money indeed.

240
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,266
There's no need to thank me.
This is just the monthly settlement.

241
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,533
It's not much because
you've only invested in it for two days.

242
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,500
If we can make this much in two days
after investing 10,000 dollars,

243
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,733
it's truly amazing, right?

244
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,366
Let's party with chicken and beer tonight.

245
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:13,133
Chicken and beer party with free cash.

246
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,600
Chicken and beer? Okay.

247
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,300
There are five of us, so if we chip in
ten dollars each, we'll be full.

248
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,366
That's right.

249
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,866
Geun Su, you should join us.

250
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,600
I have to get going now.

251
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,200
I have guests from Japan.

252
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,200
Yong Gun, aren't you going to pay?
Come on.

253
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,500
Yong Gun has no money.

254
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,533
He didn't even receive the dividend.

255
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,800
This is just ridiculous.

256
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,600
Are you all beggars or what?

257
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,933
Chipping in ten dollars and going crazy
over chicken and beer.

258
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,733
Geun Su, let's go.

259
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll drive you to your appointment.

260
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,433
My goodness, a beggar? Going crazy?

261
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,100
What's wrong with him?

262
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,300
- Here you go.
- Okay.

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,866
There's no need to thank me.

264
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:04,300
It's on me, so eat until you're full.

265
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,766
Yong Gun, have you gone insane?

266
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,466
Do you know how much this is?
Why would you buy all of these?

267
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:13,633
Hey, can't you speak nicer
instead of calling me insane?

268
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:16,233
But you really seem to have gone insane.

269
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,100
You grumbled so much earlier,

270
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,966
so what are all these?

271
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:24,200
I thought I was a little harsh earlier.

272
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,266
Soon Jae.

273
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,100
Have a drink.

274
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,966
Yes. I like free stuff.

275
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,833
Me, too. I like everything that's free.

276
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,266
Okay, let's make a toast.

277
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,833
It feels great to see you
making a profit...

278
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,466
through your investment.

279
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:44,433
Cheers to our windmill,
which is still spinning in the wind.

280
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,233
- Windmill!
- Windmill!

281
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,000
That was nice!

282
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:54,366
Ye Su Jeong is a lucky woman indeed.

283
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:56,500
You have food to eat. Come on over.

284
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,700
Hurry over!

285
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,600
Hurry over here.

286
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Su Jeong, we're celebrating because
we received our dividends.

287
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,566
Hurry over.

288
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,033
I'm okay.

289
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:11,533
Su Jeong, Yong Gun is treating us
when he hasn't even invested.

290
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:14,666
Don't be so sour because you
couldn't invest and hurry over.

291
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:24,600
Su Jeong, are you upset because
you couldn't invest with us?

292
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,600
I guess you love money, too.

293
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:30,233
You're so simple-minded.

294
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,966
What's wrong with her?

295
00:17:58,433 --> 00:17:59,566
Why are you here?

296
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:02,000
You know what?

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,200
You can take one of the blades
on the windmill.

298
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,533
I'll give it to you.

299
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,400
That's not the issue, right?

300
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,766
You're not like this because
of the investment, are you?

301
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,933
I knew that wasn't the issue.

302
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,800
Something must have happened.
Is that why you suddenly went to Seoul?

303
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:25,866
Soon Jae.

304
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,766
Can you go somewhere with me tomorrow?

305
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
You want me to light a fire on the beach?

306
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,166
You should at least tell me why.

307
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,100
What is going on?

308
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,133
This is what Yeong Hun wore
when he was a baby.

309
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm going to burn this
to bid him farewell.

310
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,133
What do you mean?

311
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,000
Didn't you say Yeong Hun was in the U.S.?

312
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,066
Yeong Hun...

313
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:17,633
committed suicide at the beach
five years ago because of me.

314
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,133
The police said...

315
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:23,500
Yeong Hun's cell phone signal
was cut off at that beach.

316
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:28,766
My goodness.

317
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:31,200
How did such a thing happen?

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,666
You must have had such a hard time.

319
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll burn this to bid him farewell...

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,766
and wrap up my feelings.

321
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,533
So help me, Soon Jae.

322
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:45,900
My goodness.

323
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,933
What's wrong with her?

324
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,000
What's wrong with her?

325
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,766
She says she's a dog
that has been reincarnated.

326
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,866
Apparently, she was this lady's dog
in her past life.

327
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:20,900
Her name is Man Du.

328
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,633
Reincarnated? Man Du?

329
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,533
What? Man Du?

330
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,633
What? It's nothing.

331
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,100
Did I just mishear you?

332
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Man Du was my son's dog.

333
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,333
She was also a terrier
and looked similar to this one.

334
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,866
She was your son's dog?

335
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,666
Her son adopted a stray dog...

336
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,700
at his college.

337
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,233
Man Du is a dog Yeong Hun
brought from college?

338
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,266
My goodness, how did you know that?

339
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,900
This lady's husband got caught
cheating on her in their master room...

340
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,300
and that's why they got divorced.

341
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,166
Did your ex-husband cheat on you
in your master room?

342
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,600
What?

343
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,833
My goodness, how do you know that?

344
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,933
No one knows that.

345
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,433
Soon Jae, please explain.

346
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:13,000
What does all of this mean?
What's going on?

347
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,300
I don't know if you'll believe me,
but I can talk with dogs.

348
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,733
What? Talk with dogs?

349
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,233
This is Officer Hong Cho Won
at Yeondeok Precinct.

350
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,633
Okay, so your dog has gone missing?

351
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,100
Yes.

352
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:45,900
The name is Grace?

353
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,633
A terrier with a red collar?

354
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,400
My goodness.

355
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:58,866
You must be Man Du.

356
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,633
You're Man Du.

357
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,300
Her current name is Grace.

358
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,133
Man Du.

359
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:13,600
Man Du, can you talk?

360
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,766
What happened to Yeong Hun
that day five years ago?

361
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,566
What happened to Yeong Hun when he
left the house with you that day?

362
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,300
She died with him that day.

363
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,900
My goodness.

364
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,333
I'm sorry, Man Du.

365
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,966
Did you also drown at sea with Yeong Hun?

366
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,766
She says it wasn't the sea.

367
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:40,233
What do you mean it wasn't the sea?

368
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:41,933
They died in the mountains.

369
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,166
The mountains?

370
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,133
- Grace!
- Grace!

371
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,466
I told you not to follow strangers!
Let's go home, Grace.

372
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,466
There was a dog theft report,

373
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:05,066
so I asked them to check if this was
their missing dog and they came.

374
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,300
What do you think you're doing?

375
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,366
Put both of them in jail now!

376
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:10,400
- Let's go home.
- Now!

377
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,933
- Ma'am!
- Man Du!

378
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,100
Man Du!

379
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,800
What do you mean it was in the mountains
and not at sea?

380
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,866
Man Du!

381
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:21,866
Ma'am...

382
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,033
Yeong Hun's cell phone
was turned off by the sea,

383
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:41,666
so all along,
I had thought he died at sea.

384
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:44,833
But all of a sudden, it's the mountains?
What is this about?

385
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:50,766
Sophie has rounded up all the dogs
in the neighborhood to look for Man Du,

386
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:52,133
so just wait a little bit.

387
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,866
You'll pass out at this rate.

388
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:56,700
Please calm down.

389
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,000
Sophie!

390
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:07,833
What did he say?

391
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,400
Man Du is heading to the airport
right now.

392
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,566
We must stop them before they leave.

393
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,566
We need to treat her well
when we get home.

394
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,466
- Excuse me.
- My gosh. Is it you again?

395
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,500
I want to talk with you about that dog.

396
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,100
It's not your dog. It's her dog.

397
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,033
Listen to me, okay? Just go.

398
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,566
- I'm sorry. Just a moment.
- Go away!

399
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:45,233
- What is that?
- What?

400
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,566
Get in the car now! Go!

401
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,033
Are you crazy? You can't steal the dog.

402
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,000
Then what could I have done?

403
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,933
They were about to take
the plane and leave.

404
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,366
Forget it.

405
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,900
Hurry and ask Man Du about Yeong Hun.

406
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,300
Sophie,

407
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,433
is Yeong Hun in the mountains
and not at sea?

408
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:26,833
Yes, that's right.

409
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:33,533
Then why did his cell phone
turn off at the beach?

410
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,600
(Yongji Jwasa Bus Stop)

411
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,566
Just a moment, sir.

412
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:09,533
Let's go, Man Du.

413
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,766
Be quiet.

414
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,700
I had no idea.

415
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,733
I went to the beach every day...

416
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,666
and prayed...

417
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,200
for my son to be found.

418
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,066
Hello?

419
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,366
I'm Yeong Hun's mother.

420
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,033
Yes, Ms. Ye.

421
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,100
Yes.

422
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,666
A mountain Yeong Hun
would have likely visited?

423
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,566
There is one place.

424
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:47,100
One iced Americano, one hot Americano,
and four cups of lattes.

425
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:50,533
And can I get one of each cake?

426
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,466
Six cups of coffee
and eight slices of cake.

427
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,033
- That will be 84 dollars in total.
- Yes.

428
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,933
You're actor Kim Yong Gun, right?

429
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,033
How would you like to pay?
Credit card? Cash?

430
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:00,633
You must be new.

431
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:02,766
I guess you haven't heard yet.

432
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:04,966
I have free access
to all the drinks and cakes here.

433
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,933
By the way, you know Park Geun Su,
the owner of this place, right?

434
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:13,166
We're very close friends,

435
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,200
so it's just...

436
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:16,966
all on the owner.

437
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,400
- I see.
- Yes.

438
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,266
Having coffee and cake for free
under Park Geun Su...

439
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:24,133
must have been great.

440
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,400
It's free,

441
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,233
so I order things to eat,
even if I don't feel like eating it.

442
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,833
- Mr. Kang Min U.
- Yes?

443
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,400
Lock the door so that this man
can't run away.

444
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,700
Why?

445
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,566
I've already locked the door,
Mr. Park Geun Su.

446
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,766
Hold on. What are you doing?

447
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:43,233
And what do you mean by Mr. Park Geun Su?

448
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:45,600
Who are you? What's going on?

449
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm...

450
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,000
Park Geun Su, the owner of Pacific Cafe!

451
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:52,833
How can a well-known celebrity like you...

452
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,266
have free coffee using a fake owner?

453
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:56,266
What?

454
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,433
Hey, Mr. Kang,

455
00:29:57,433 --> 00:30:00,266
just how much did Kim Yong Gun's group
eat for free?

456
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,066
They spent 2,534 dollars, sir.

457
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,800
A fake owner?

458
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,733
We spent over 2,500 dollars?

459
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:12,566
If you want to avoid going to the police,
pay 2,534 dollars.

460
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:14,766
But I ate it because it was free.

461
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,566
Why must I pay for all of it?

462
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,966
Then...

463
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:19,933
let's go to the police!

464
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:23,800
Park Geun Su, that rotten man.

465
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,100
No wonder he looked just like a con man.

466
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,933
No, not you. I'm talking about
the other Park Geun Su.

467
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:34,500
What a terrible conman.

468
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,400
Just a moment.

469
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:41,800
Then my windmill, my money...

470
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,666
Nine, nine, eight, eight, my life

471
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,600
It has only just begun

472
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,133
Stop singing along!

473
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,900
Let me listen to him sing!

474
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,866
Seriously...

475
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,166
-My life
- Darn it!

476
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:59,833
Hey, wait a minute.

477
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:01,500
What is it this time?

478
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,800
Hey, we were totally fooled.

479
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,266
Everything about Geun Su is a scam.

480
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,266
He wasn't the cafe owner...

481
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,033
and the windmills are never
distributed to individuals.

482
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,833
I told you he was suspicious
from the start.

483
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:17,666
Hey, hurry and call the police and get
Park Geun Su on the wanted list.

484
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,666
Okay?

485
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,466
I said you were scammed!

486
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,866
Just forget about it.

487
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,600
What do you mean forget about it?

488
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:33,433
What's this? Did you all know about it?

489
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,766
That money is for his son's surgery.

490
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:39,500
We're going to regard it
as giving him help.

491
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,166
Wait, what?

492
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,100
Then why didn't you tell me?

493
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,033
You didn't even chip in.

494
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,700
I can't believe this.

495
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,933
I invested in one whole windmill!
I spent 30,000 dollars!

496
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,266
- Did you say 30,000 dollars?
- Did you say 30,000 dollars?

497
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:57,833
But when did you guys find out?

498
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,833
Anyway, you're our savior, Geun Su.

499
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:02,700
Don't you agree?

500
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,100
There isn't a better annuity
than this at our age.

501
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,000
You're right.

502
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,200
You'll return to Geoje, right?

503
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,566
Of course.

504
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:13,566
Let's gather and have drinks
when I return.

505
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:14,600
Okay.

506
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,100
I need to take my flight,
so I better get going.

507
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
- I'll get going.
- Okay, thank you.

508
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,066
- Have a safe flight.
- Yes.

509
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,800
- Call us when you come to Geoje.
- Yes.

510
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,766
My goodness, just look at me.

511
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:30,600
I brought hand cream for Geun Su,
but I forgot.

512
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,400
I'll go and give it to him.

513
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,966
Yes, my dear.

514
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,566
Did the surgery go well?

515
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,333
Don't worry about the money.

516
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:47,433
I made 30,000 dollars for the surgery...

517
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,266
and I'm about to head to Seoul.

518
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:51,733
Why are you crying again?

519
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,833
Yes. You've also gone through a lot.

520
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,266
I'll see you at the hospital.

521
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:04,866
Geun Su.

522
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,466
Yes.

523
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:10,766
I'm giving this to you as a gift
because I'm grateful.

524
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:15,100
What kind of a businessman
has such coarse hands like you?

525
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,300
This is hand cream,
so be sure to apply it.

526
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,933
Okay. Thank you.

527
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:25,266
I'll get going.

528
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:42,866
Hey!

529
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,100
Geun Su!

530
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,566
Geun Su, stop!

531
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,166
Hey, Geun Su.

532
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,466
You need to take the investment.

533
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:52,566
You didn't tell me
your bank account number,

534
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:55,000
so I brought cash.

535
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,800
Here you go.

536
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,433
I said it's all over.

537
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:58,700
Why do you keep doing this?

538
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,366
You have four, so just give me one.
You have a lot.

539
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:05,200
Hey, I put 30,000 dollars in this.

540
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,900
I'm taking one whole windmill, okay?

541
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,333
Take it back.

542
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,000
Investing 30,000 dollars alone
is too much.

543
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,533
Hey, I'm doing very well these days.

544
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,900
Don't worry.

545
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,266
I trust you.

546
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:18,033
Thanks. Okay, get going.

547
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:19,333
I said go!

548
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,800
- Get going! Okay, let's go!
- Okay, Yong Gun.

549
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:26,200
My goodness.

550
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,566
Yes!

551
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:34,066
Close your mouth.

552
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:37,366
For someone as timid as Geun Su,

553
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,866
It must have been so tough
for him to swindle us.

554
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:42,766
Why are you telling me this now?

555
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:44,600
Why was I the only one
who didn't know about it?

556
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:49,333
You slyly forked over cash like a snake
to make money on your own.

557
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,900
Why are you making a fuss?

558
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,533
But still, you've been filming dramas
and advertisements,

559
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:59,033
so you make the most money out of us.

560
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:01,300
Just regard it as helping him out
in a major way.

561
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,300
You'll be blessed for doing so.

562
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:13,166
- My goodness.
- What? Did you receive it, too?

563
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:14,600
Yes.

564
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,100
What's wrong? What is it?

565
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,666
Look here. It's Park Geun Su.

566
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:22,200
He returned the 10,000 dollars.

567
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,433
Really?

568
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:28,200
I was going to think of it
as helping Park Geun Su out.

569
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,433
My goodness.

570
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,000
What's that?

571
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:34,133
I also received a message.

572
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:42,900
Yong Gun, I'm sorry.

573
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,300
I needed the money urgently,

574
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,033
so I lied a little while I was in Geoje.

575
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,800
I know it's shameful,
but I'll be indebted to you.

576
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll repay your 30,000 dollars,
no matter what.

577
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,900
Like you said, it's such a relief
that you're doing very well.

578
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,600
Thank you, Yong Gun.

579
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,833
What's the matter, Yong Gun?

580
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,500
Yong Gun, are you okay?

581
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:13,400
Lately, I've never been okay.

582
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:44,766
What did they say?

583
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,333
This is the mountain.

584
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,466
Is it?

585
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:52,033
He must have eaten at a nearby restaurant
before hiking.

586
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,333
Apparently, hairless people didn't
give her meat at the restaurant.

587
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,133
Hairless people?

588
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,600
They didn't give her meat?

589
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,033
(Three Brothers' Natural Dining)

590
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:14,766
I think she's talking about this
wild vegetable restaurant.

591
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,700
Then who are the hairless people?

592
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,000
Of course, I remember.

593
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
This puppy bit my brother's hand,

594
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
so he suffered for over a year.

595
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:38,433
There's my brother.

596
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,000
Hey, Gwang Sik!

597
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,600
Do you remember this dog
that bit your hand?

598
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,500
Of course, I do.

599
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,433
It was the year we opened the restaurant,

600
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,800
so it's already been five years.

601
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,466
Yes, that's right. It was five years ago.

602
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,833
Do you happen to remember
which way he went?

603
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,333
He asked us to look after his dog...

604
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,800
and set out for the summit.

605
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,333
But this dog bit my brother's hand,
ran off,

606
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,066
and followed his owner.

607
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:25,733
Wait, Mr. Lee Soon Jae!

608
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:33,433
My youngest brother said...

609
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:36,266
he took this side trail
instead of the main trail over there.

610
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
- Over here?
- Yes.

611
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,666
Hello.

612
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:45,133
He asked for a shortcut because he had to
rush to Seoul after reaching the summit.

613
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,700
So I told him.

614
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,833
Man Du!

615
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,033
Wait for me.

616
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,466
Why are you rushing?

617
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:46,466
My goodness, Man Du. Wait for me.

618
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:29,766
Man Du.

619
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:32,266
Man Du!

620
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,766
Man Du!

621
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:41,233
Don't move, Man Du!

622
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,500
Hang in there for a bit, okay?

623
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,900
Man Du.

624
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:05,633
Hang in there. I'll save you.

625
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,966
Stay still. You just have to stay still.

626
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:14,066
I'm almost there.

627
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:20,066
It's okay. Let's go.

628
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,033
It's okay.

629
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:26,066
Let's go home now.

630
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:14,600
Man Du.

631
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:30,233
Stay by my side, Song Man Du.

632
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,166
(Police line,
Do not cross.)

633
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:58,133
(Identification Card, Song Yeong Hun)

634
00:45:45,066 --> 00:45:46,866
Mom.

635
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:49,500
The wind blew just now,

636
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,066
and it smelled like you, Mom.

637
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,533
I'm so sorry for leaving
after getting mad at you.

638
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,333
I should have thanked you a lot.

639
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,466
I was thinking of going to your favorite
dumpling spot with you when I go to Seoul,

640
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,300
but I guess I won't be able to.

641
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:12,833
Don't cry too much.

642
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,433
And don't remain sad for too long.

643
00:46:15,766 --> 00:46:17,400
I was happy with you, Mom.

644
00:46:20,066 --> 00:46:23,366
Let me be born as your son again
if there's a next lifetime.

645
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:27,166
Thank you for everything.

646
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,400
I miss you.

647
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:32,333
I love you, Mom.

648
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,500
Yeong Hun.

649
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm sorry...

650
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:47,733
for leaving you on your own
for five years.

651
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:55,233
You must have been so lonely.

652
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,133
I'll cry just for today.

653
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:31,500
The frame is a little tacky, isn't it?

654
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,333
No, it looks fine.

655
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,300
Hey, my son is allergic to flowers.

656
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:39,766
These are artificial flowers.

657
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:41,000
Really? I'm sorry.

658
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,733
He's picky because he takes after me.

659
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:47,166
But he looks like you.

660
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,766
Hey, my son looks far better.

661
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,200
Someone's here.

662
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:21,466
I'm your grandmother.

663
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:23,666
Say "Grandma Su Jeong."

664
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,133
Grandma.

665
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,033
Someone else is here.

666
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,333
We're here as there's been a report
of a kidnapped dog.

667
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:47,500
Okay.

668
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,866
Let's go.

669
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:55,066
Let's go.

670
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:57,833
Sophie.

671
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:01,200
Why does Man Du always show
her teeth and try to bite me?

672
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,400
Apparently, you stole her food.

673
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,700
I stole her food?

674
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,900
Are you saying that I ate dog food?

675
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:21,366
(Five years ago)

676
00:49:22,966 --> 00:49:26,700
My goodness, Su Jeong lives
in a beautiful house.

677
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:35,100
This must be the kitchen.

678
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:40,233
She must have been
in the middle of serving lunch.

679
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:42,100
I'm starving.

680
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,866
Su Jeong, I'll start eating first!

681
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,400
My goodness. What are you doing, Soon Jae?

682
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,166
I'm sorry.

683
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:10,433
I ate first because I was starving.

684
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,300
The meat was tender and well-cooked.
You did a great job.

685
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,800
I enjoyed it a lot.

686
00:50:17,433 --> 00:50:20,733
My goodness, that was for Man Du.

687
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,600
I ate dog food.

688
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,333
I stole dog feed.

689
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,266
I'm sorry, Man Du.

690
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:47,700
Grace!

691
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:49,700
- Grace!
- My gosh!

692
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,533
Grace!

693
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:55,000
You insane woman!
You can't just steal someone's dog!

694
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,366
Calm down.

695
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:59,166
Ma'am.

696
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:04,533
Thank you for coming to see me, Man Du.

697
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:07,133
Go and live a happy life in the U.S. now.

698
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:12,533
I'm sorry.

699
00:51:13,966 --> 00:51:16,233
Thank you so much.

700
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,433
- Go to the police.
- Yes, go.

701
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:30,200
My goodness, she opened
and got in the police car herself.

702
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,633
She's even waving her hand.

703
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:33,700
My goodness.

704
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:35,800
See you later!

705
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,533
My goodness, just look at her.

706
00:52:19,248 --> 00:52:21,951
(Dog Knows Everything)

707
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:25,971
Then what was that message
threatening me to die?

708
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:27,710
Does anyone come to mind?

709
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,510
But who on earth is the guy?

710
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:32,320
The police don't know anything either.

711
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:34,751
Are you saying that the two of you
will get back together...

712
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,464
after making all that fuss?

713
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:38,969
We reconfirmed our faith between us.

714
00:52:39,558 --> 00:52:41,074
Can you lend me some money?

715
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:42,579
One hundred thousand dollars?

716
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:44,776
I guess we'll have to tell your father.

717
00:52:47,156 --> 00:52:49,502
The culprit will be after Kim Yong Gun
even at this moment.

718
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:51,845
Please save me.

719
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:53,684
Sir, wake up.

720
00:52:53,684 --> 00:52:54,535
Sir?

721
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:57,155
They said Yong Gun died.

722
00:52:57,155 --> 00:52:58,839
My goodness! Yong Gun!

723
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:01,801
This murder was committed
in broad daylight.

724
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:03,829
