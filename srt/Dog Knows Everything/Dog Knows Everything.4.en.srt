3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,600
How may I help you?

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,700
I'm here to turn myself in.

5
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:32,500
Webcomic artist Park Oe Su...

6
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,600
I killed him.

7
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:44,233
(Yeondeok Police Station)

8
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:48,366
(Dog Knows Everything)

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,966
So the culprit was his ex-girlfriend,

10
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:54,133
just like in Su Jeong's script?

11
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,266
What on earth is going on?

12
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,666
Anyway, since the culprit
turned herself in,

13
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,300
the police will tell us what had happened.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,433
So don't bother or worry
too much about it, okay?

15
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,633
Okay.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
How did the bride commit
such a horrendous crime?

17
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,466
She looked so docile.

18
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:17,366
That's why you shouldn't judge
a book by its cover.

19
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,833
That's right.

20
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,733
Who would have imagined
that Su Jeong snores like a tank...

21
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,566
with such an intelligent appearance?

22
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,766
Hey.

23
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:28,933
You...

24
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,633
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:32,866
How could you?

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,133
- My goodness!
- Yong Gun!

27
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,033
Are you okay, Yong Gun?

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,933
Are you okay?

29
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,033
- The stairs are slippery.
- Yong Gun.

30
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:44,633
I almost sprained my sacrum.

31
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,633
Yong Gun, that's because
you have weak legs.

32
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:50,233
I'm hurt and you're not even worried.

33
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,766
Hold on. Wait a minute.

34
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,566
What is it? Are you hurting somewhere?

35
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,700
No, wait a minute.

36
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:03,066
Was I going upstairs?
Or was I coming downstairs?

37
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:07,666
You have weak legs and you must be
coming down with dementia, too.

38
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,866
Dementia?

39
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,633
What do you mean? I'm not even that old.

40
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,133
You forgot the color
of your new car yesterday,

41
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,666
so you went all the way to Gangneung.

42
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,333
Hey, I can remember my lines...

43
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,833
after reading through the script once.
What are you saying?

44
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,133
Then do you remember
what day it is tomorrow?

45
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,633
You said you drew three stars on your
calendar because it's an important day,

46
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:29,166
but you couldn't remember what day it was.

47
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,133
That's because I'm tired.

48
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,333
Dementia? What a joke.

49
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:38,233
It'll all come to mind, so don't worry.

50
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:41,400
Seriously.

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,233
I killed him.

52
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:04,666
How were you acquainted with Park Oe Su,
the webcomic artist who had been murdered?

53
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,733
We used to live together.

55
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,400
So you were lovers.

56
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,633
Does your fiancé know your relationship
with Park Oe Su?

57
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,933
Jong Kuk doesn't know about Park Oe Su.

58
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:19,966
Why did you kill him?

59
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,666
Because he said he'd stop me
from getting married.

60
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,800
He kept stalking me
when I was taking wedding photos.

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,500
So you're saying
he threatened and stalked you?

62
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:32,533
And that's why you, Son Myeong Ok,
visited Park Oe Su.

63
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:36,533
He sent me a text message
to come to the inn.

64
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,566
So I went to tell him that I'd kill him
if he continued to torment me.

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,633
(Come Again Ocean Inn)

66
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,333
Congratulations on your wedding,
Myeong Ok.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,566
I'm the gift.

68
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,833
Is that why you killed him?

69
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,633
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,333
Okay, I understand.

71
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,400
My goodness, it's stuffed.

72
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,766
Santa, this will do the job.

73
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,766
It's gone down nicely.

74
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,566
I told you this would do the job.

75
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,533
It's Santajeong indeed.

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,033
My gosh! Yong Gun, this is amazing.

77
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,866
You even filmed a commercial
with Hyeon Ta!

78
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,666
- My goodness.
- That's right.

79
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,233
You filmed a commercial at your age
and your drama is doing well.

80
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,566
Your latter years are rolling smoothly.

81
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,433
And you even divorced three times.

82
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,100
Congratulations, Yong Gun.

83
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,066
You'll be making quite a bit.

84
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:33,466
This is all because I'm too good.

85
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,200
My goodness.

86
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,533
Honestly speaking,

87
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:41,166
this was actually Soon Jae's role.

88
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,700
But Hyeon Ta rejected him,

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,466
so you took that spot.

90
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,733
That's true.

91
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,233
The wealth and fame
initially belonged to Soon Jae.

92
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,900
But Soon Jae is so cranky,

93
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,966
- so the young lad rejected him.
- Seriously.

94
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,566
What's wrong with you?

95
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,233
That's just great.

96
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,900
What's the matter? You look down.

97
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,733
Everything is fine.

98
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,200
What's wrong?

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,233
You look like an old man who is sad
because everyone forgot your birthday.

100
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,800
It must be your birthday today then.

101
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,333
I'm not upset in particular.

102
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll be celebrating my 100th birthday
after a few more.

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,500
Who cares if I don't have
a measly birthday party?

104
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,033
So you must be really upset.

105
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,366
You must be disappointed and sad.

106
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,133
I said I'm not.

107
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,600
They say being forgotten
is the saddest thing.

108
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,533
Cut it out!

109
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,400
So stop being so cranky
and be good to others.

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,133
What would you know?

111
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,266
Stop crossing the line, you mutt!

112
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,700
I can't control the air conditioner
in this room.

113
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:24,933
It's cold, isn't it?

114
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,866
Do you still need to remember the tool
you used for the crime?

115
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,366
Detective, sir, I was so terrified
and flustered last night...

116
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,933
that I don't remember
where I discarded it.

117
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:40,233
I just grabbed whatever I could
get my hands on in the room.

118
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,966
And I don't remember
what happened afterward.

119
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,766
So you used something from the room
that could be used as a weapon...

120
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:53,200
and just stabbed him with it?

121
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,400
Yes, that's right.

122
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,533
I use the hatchet to chop firewood...

123
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:06,000
and always hang it by the pile
of firewood.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
But it vanished.

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,000
Try remembering it again slowly.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you sure you didn't enter the room...

127
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,733
carrying the weapon to murder him?

128
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,066
No. I didn't go there to kill him.

129
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,333
I got worked up, lost my rationality,

130
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,300
and grabbed whatever I could get hold of.

131
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:27,733
I see.

132
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,566
Okay. You should have some of this.

133
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,200
How may I help you?

134
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,033
What brings you to our precinct?

135
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,700
I'm here to turn myself in.

136
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,566
Turn yourself in?

137
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:09,266
I'm the culprit.

138
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,566
It's strange.

139
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,800
Something isn't right.

140
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,366
What? Why is she here again?

141
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,133
Hey.

142
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,200
What's with you?

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,500
Hey, Precinct.

144
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,866
Are you here to loiter around
the homicide case again?

145
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:35,400
You better brace yourself
if you can't explain why you're here.

146
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,700
He's the one who murdered...

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,266
the webcomic artist.

148
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,700
He turned himself in at the precinct,
so I accompanied him.

149
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,233
Are you the accomplice?

150
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,100
That's not it. The bride is innocent...

151
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,333
and made a false confession.

152
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,166
The groom said
he committed the crime on his own.

153
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,733
Why are you answering for him?

154
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,700
Why are you and your fiancée
trying to take the blame for each other?

155
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,966
Is this some kind of loyalty game?

156
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:05,700
Do you think homicide is a joke?

157
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Myeong Ok made a false confession
to take the blame instead of me.

158
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,433
A false confession...

159
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,233
Why did you make a false confession?

160
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,066
You can also get punished
for making a false confession.

161
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,033
Because it's all my fault.

162
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:40,066
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for me.

163
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,833
I felt so bad.

164
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,733
I should be punished instead.

165
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:47,700
Please calm down.

166
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,633
Take your time and explain to me
what had happened.

167
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:58,800
I think this one's nice.

168
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,333
No?

169
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:01,266
(You have one text message.)

170
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,200
This one?

171
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,366
That night, I was resting at the hotel.

172
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,033
It's from an unknown number.

173
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,966
(Myeong Ok, do you think
you'll be able to get married?)

174
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,700
I received a text message from Park Oe Su.

175
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,966
(Do you think you can live without me?)

176
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:14,333
(Only death will part us.
Hurry over right now.)

177
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,900
(I'm at Come Again Ocean Inn
in Room Eight, Park Oe Su)

178
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:21,233
Myeong Ok, what's wrong?

179
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,266
I went to the hotel garden to calm down...

180
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,266
and returned to my room.

181
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,366
Jong Kuk?

182
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,766
But Jong Kuk was missing.

183
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,933
I waited for him, but he wouldn't return.

184
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:47,200
I doubted it but felt uneasy,

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,533
so I went to the inn
where Park Oe Su was residing.

186
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,066
Jong Kuk.

187
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,266
It's all my fault.

188
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,433
If it weren't for me,

189
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,100
Jong Kuk wouldn't have killed someone.

190
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,033
Then you witnessed your fiancé...

191
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,066
running away from the crime scene, right?

192
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,566
The webcomic artist...

193
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,166
was sitting in a gift box
with a ribbon wrapped around him.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,533
Everyone knows...

195
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,866
that situation because of the rumors.

196
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,266
What about the weapon for the crime?

197
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,133
What did you kill him with?

198
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,966
A hatchet.

199
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,266
Where is that hatchet?

200
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,333
I don't remember.

201
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:25,833
I must have been out of my mind.
I don't remember anything.

202
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,300
The thing with memories...

203
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,533
We're bound to find it anyway.

204
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,000
Where did you discard the hatchet?

205
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,633
Soon Jae,

206
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,900
we're having a party tomorrow,
so pay 50 dollars.

207
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,433
What party for tomorrow?

208
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,266
A party to congratulate Yong Gun.

209
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Yong Gun filmed a commercial...

210
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,266
and his drama is also doing well.

211
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,533
He'll be featured in another drama, too.

212
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:10,833
So we're thinking of throwing
Yong Gun a congratulatory party.

213
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,400
It'll be a surprise party for him.

214
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,900
Why throw such a party?
It's not even a big deal.

215
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,833
- Leave me out of it.
- Why are you being so petty?

216
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,600
Who are you calling petty?

217
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,133
My goodness, you're not even a child.

218
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,966
We should all congratulate each other
at this age.

219
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,133
You considerate people should continue...

220
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,700
fending for each other.

221
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,400
My gosh, he's so cranky.

222
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
Why are you going around
on an empty stomach?

223
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:59,833
How would you know if I've eaten or not?

224
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,900
You don't smell like you've had a meal.

225
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,066
How can you starve on your birthday?

226
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,000
Apparently, some man threw the hatchet...

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,566
from the Rose Bridge that night.

228
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,466
And I confirmed that my girlfriend
Jin Sun...

229
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,066
went to Rose Bridge with a different dog
that night.

230
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,866
That's too bad.

231
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,833
I was so infuriated,

232
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,000
but I listened to her attentively because
I thought it would help resolve the case.

233
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:52,333
Two days ago, Jin Sun lied to me...

234
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,466
and went to the Rose Bridge
with a different dog that night.

235
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:03,166
And she's certain that she saw a man...

236
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,366
throw the hatchet from the bridge.

237
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,166
Then the culprit must be a man.

238
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,400
How did you know that?

239
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,366
The culprit was the groom
and not the bride.

240
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,833
Only the police know this.

241
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,100
I was just thinking about this and that.

242
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,266
It must be from all those years acting
as a detective in dramas.

243
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:29,566
You have a great sixth sense.

244
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:33,533
I'm usually very curious
about such incidents.

245
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,566
The groom turned himself in.

246
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,000
And the bride had made a false confession.

247
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,033
Eventually, it ended differently...

248
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,366
from Ye Su Jeong's script.

249
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,966
But we're still investigating it,

250
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,433
so you must not tell anyone about it.

251
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,266
Of course.

252
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,733
Then was it the groom
who discarded the hatchet?

253
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,300
Did you find the hatchet?

254
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,066
No.

255
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,766
The groom turned himself in,

256
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:04,033
but he doesn't remember where he discarded
the hatchet used in the crime.

257
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,633
So the investigation is at a standstill
because they couldn't find the hatchet.

258
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,000
Since the culprit ran off haphazardly
after committing the murder,

259
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,100
it wouldn't have been easy for him
to bury the hatchet.

260
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,400
Then was it water?

261
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,166
Yes, I think he would've thrown it away
in the river or something.

262
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,100
We might be able to find something if we
look into rivers near the crime scene.

263
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,300
Would you like some peaches?

264
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,000
My goodness.

265
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm allergic to peaches.

266
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,600
Me, too.

267
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,300
Yes.

268
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,066
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
Peaches.

270
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,900
You're here early.

271
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,933
Anyway, I'm sorry.

272
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:17,100
No. It was a mistake.

273
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,700
You're like a different person
now that I've paid you back.

274
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,266
By the way,
did your housemate go somewhere?

275
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,733
My housemate? Who?

276
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,700
- Shall I call my housemate for you?
- No. That's not what I was asking.

277
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Then since we're sorted,
you should get going.

278
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,100
I have much to prepare
for tonight's party,

279
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,966
so I'm going to be a little busy.

280
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,000
Are you having a party?

281
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:46,500
Then please use this for the party.

282
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:48,966
For the party?

283
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,733
This is flustering.

284
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,100
What have you got to do with our party?

285
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,700
Please use this.

286
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,900
I beg you, sir.

287
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,433
Please?

288
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,566
Wait...

289
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,833
Why does that guy keep giving me money?

290
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,166
Shall I carry it for you?

291
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,900
What? This?

292
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,000
It looks heavy, but it seems light.

293
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,666
I thought it was heavy,
so I offered to carry it for you.

294
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,666
Quit trying to talk to me.

295
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,633
Finish off your ice cream
and mind your own business.

296
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,166
- Yes.
- Get going.

297
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,600
Ma'am, you dropped this!

298
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,800
Ma'am!

299
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,633
My goodness. Thank you.

300
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:59,266
- Why did it drop?
- Buddy, where did you buy that ice cream?

301
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,766
"Buddy?"

302
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,400
Don't address her as "ma'am."
Apologize to her.

303
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,700
I called her "ma'am"
because she's a ma'am.

304
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,633
Is that a problem?

305
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,233
No.

306
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:15,333
Ma'am!

307
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:18,966
That kid.

308
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,533
Shall I carry that for you, ma'am?
I mean...

309
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,466
Eun Ha?

310
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:26,966
Do you want this ma'am to beat you
to come to your senses?

311
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,733
Hurry and get lost!

312
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,900
They're having a big sale here.

313
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,500
Soon Jae didn't end up paying
the 50 dollars for the party, right?

314
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,966
He's jealous because
Yong Gun is successful.

315
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,866
Honestly, how should I put it?
As Soon Jae is growing older,

316
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,966
he's becoming slightly unlikeable.

317
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,733
Why are you saying such things?

318
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:04,000
Was I a bit too mean?

319
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,333
He's not slightly unlikeable.
He's very unlikeable.

320
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:14,100
"Why is the chili pepper
in the bean sprout soup so spicy?"

321
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,933
It's spicy because it's a chili pepper!
Did he think it would taste savory?

322
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,833
"I must find out who the strand of hair
in the bathroom belongs to."

323
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,200
My goodness, I thought he was
a researcher at the NFS.

324
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,800
This morning,
he scolded Chae Moo for sleeping in.

325
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:31,300
My goodness, why is he making
life difficult for himself?

326
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,266
Making people feel uncomfortable
must be a talent, right?

327
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:35,166
I agree.

328
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,333
Here it is.

329
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,300
There's only one packet
of enoki mushrooms left.

330
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,933
- What?
- This...

331
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,333
You should take it.

332
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,933
No.

333
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,500
You must be newlyweds.

334
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,633
Take it and enjoy.

335
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:55,066
- My goodness, thank you.
- Thank you.

336
00:21:58,133 --> 00:21:59,166
Was I being excessively nice?

337
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,866
Only Soon Jae will eat
the enoki mushrooms anyway.

338
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,566
You did the right thing.

339
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,966
Let's buy these instead.

340
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,166
(Handwashing Campaign
365 Days for COVID-19)

341
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,166
Excuse me.

342
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,300
I'm so sorry, but can I take this?

343
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:43,066
I'm sorry, but we really need
the enoki mushrooms.

344
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,133
Yes, go ahead.

345
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:46,866
Thank you.

346
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:52,933
Let's cook enoki mushroom pancakes
when we prepare for the party.

347
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,866
Add them to the soybean paste stew, too.

348
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:57,433
Old man Soon Jae doesn't eat these
when it's in the soybean paste stew.

349
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,300
It's no surprise.

350
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,933
He's so hard to please.

351
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:02,400
It's our turn.

352
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:19,333
This is driving me crazy.

353
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,433
Just what do these stars mean?

354
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:24,733
Did I miss a shoot?

355
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,300
No way. Then someone
would have contacted me already.

356
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,833
This is really driving me crazy.

357
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,666
What day is it today?

358
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:42,266
This is the route from the inn,
which is the crime scene,

359
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:45,366
to the hotel where the bride and groom
are residing.

360
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:48,400
But there isn't a river down this path.

361
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,933
And there isn't a bridge here either.

362
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,933
I think he must have buried it
in the bushes or on the ground.

363
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,733
Wait a minute.

364
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,600
There is a bridge.

365
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:02,033
The Rose Bridge is located...

366
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,966
opposite the route
from the inn to the hotel.

367
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,266
Is that so?

368
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,766
But it's strange.

369
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,600
What's the point of hiding the hatchet
when he's turned himself in?

370
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
That's right.

371
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,000
He couldn't remember
where he disposed of it.

372
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:25,433
Yes, Mom?

373
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,333
Squid sausage?

374
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,333
Of course, I'd like some.

375
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,766
Okay, I'll see you later.

376
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,633
I guess you like squid sausages.

377
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:35,933
Yes, I totally do.

378
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,266
But there aren't any restaurants
that make decent ones in Geoje,

379
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:39,733
so we need to buy it when
the sausage man comes...

380
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:42,000
to the port street once a month.

381
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,533
It's going to be so good.

382
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:47,933
Can I have three servings
of squid sausages?

383
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:49,633
Yes.

384
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,833
Why do you keep following me?

385
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,833
I came here first
and ordered the squid sausages.

386
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,733
I told you not to loiter around me.

387
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Hurry up and beat it.

388
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,166
I'm waiting for my order...

389
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,833
No.

390
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,833
I should just tear your limbs off here.

391
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,066
- No.
- Get over here.

392
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,700
Hello.

393
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,966
Yes, we meet again.

394
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,533
Thank you for last time.

395
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:33,166
Many people leave their wallets behind
at the restaurant.

396
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,300
I only did what must be done.

397
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,200
Are you leaving today?

398
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,733
Yes. I had time before the flight,

399
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:41,666
so I came to enjoy the sea,
but it looks like I'm lucked out.

400
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,366
Pardon?

401
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,266
If you don't mind, would you like
to have a cup of coffee?

402
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:49,133
Coffee?

403
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,566
Your squid sausages are ready.

404
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:51,600
My sausages...

405
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,733
Coffee sounds great.

406
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,866
That's a relief.

407
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:03,100
I was worried you'd turn me down.

408
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,666
No. I was just in the mood for coffee.

409
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,600
- Then let's go.
- Okay.

410
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,800
Sir, please slice them.
I'll come to pick them up later.

411
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,833
Okay.

412
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,333
It's a relief to see that Eun Ha
is doing well.

413
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,566
These are good.

414
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,300
What a relief.

415
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:36,333
Have a good day.

416
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,866
(Tasty Sausages)

417
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:42,233
You want me to eat these at the party?

418
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,166
Yes. Once again,
I hope you can agree to this.

419
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:52,900
They're squid sausages.

420
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,533
But what do you have to do with our party?

421
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,833
Wait a second.

422
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:06,466
That man looks really familiar.

423
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,800
Is he a fan of Yong Gun?

424
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:23,200
Yong Gun.

425
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:27,033
Have some walnuts and peanuts.
They prevent dementia.

426
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:29,200
I said I don't have dementia,
so why do you keep insisting so?

427
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,300
Why are you getting angry at me?
I'm just worried about you.

428
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,633
Why? Yong Gun, do you still not remember?

429
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:39,566
If you eventually remember,
you're just being forgetful.

430
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:42,600
But if you don't remember things at all,
then it's dementia.

431
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,833
What should we do?

432
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,600
That's enough!

433
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,266
It must be great that all of you
are mentally healthy except for me.

434
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,633
And what are you looking for?

435
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,600
Have you seen my glasses?
I've been looking for them all day.

436
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,500
Where did they go?

437
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,100
They must be somewhere.
It's not like your glasses have feet.

438
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,000
Take a good look around.

439
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Why are you carrying the garbage bag?

440
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:10,433
My goodness, just look at me.

441
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:13,100
I went to throw out the garbage,
but threw my cell phone away...

442
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,400
and brought the garbage back in.

443
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,633
She's so adorable at times.

444
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,433
I'll go and find my cell phone...

445
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,233
and help you find your glasses.

446
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:33,900
Brain training?

447
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,000
You need to guess the proverbs
from the given initials.

448
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,133
If you get over three of them correct,
you don't have dementia.

449
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:40,566
If you get over seven correct,

450
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:43,300
you don't have to worry about dementia
until you turn 100 years old.

451
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,666
That sounds like fun. Let's do it then.

452
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,766
Let's start with you first, Yong Gun.

453
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,533
"I have bigger fish to fry."

454
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:54,633
Yes.

455
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,666
"When good cheer is lacking,
our friends will be packing."

456
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:04,433
"So..." No, that's not it.

457
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,900
"So that we... Then why..."

458
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,066
Incorrect.

459
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:10,166
"Sow the wind and reap a whirlwind."
You know, right?

460
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,066
This is pretty confusing.

461
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:15,033
Okay, next one.

462
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,233
"A piece of cake."

463
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:19,433
That's right.

464
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:22,700
"A bolt out of the blue."

465
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,100
That's right.

466
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,066
Was there such a proverb?

467
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:33,733
Hey, this is offensive.

468
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:34,933
Offensive?

469
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:35,933
Yes.

470
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:39,533
"Every clueless, harebrained fool
sounds lackadaisical."

471
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,066
How is that referring to a fool?

472
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,800
Then what is it if it's not a fool?

473
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,000
"Every cloud has a silver lining."

474
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,033
- Yes.
- So that's what it was.

475
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,500
Hold on. Do I have
early symptoms of dementia?

476
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,433
I just think you're ignorant.

477
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,133
Right?

478
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,200
I really wanted to see the sea.

479
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,533
Really?

480
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,433
Can't you see it when you're flying?

481
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:16,700
It's different seeing it like this.

482
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:18,900
I didn't know there was a place like this.

483
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,200
Yes, it's really nice.

484
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,133
I'll take a picture for you.

485
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,300
Can you give me your cell phone?

486
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,333
I guess you like yellow the most.

487
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,133
Chicks, kindergarten hats, forsythia...

488
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,866
Everything cute is yellow.

489
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,300
Excuse me.

490
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,266
- Here you go.
- I'm wearing your cap, too?

491
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:41,500
Yes. Try climbing up.

492
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,133
You look very adorable
on the yellow rock, too.

493
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,633
My goodness.

494
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,300
Here I go. One, two, three.

495
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,766
One more time. One, two, three.

496
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,766
It looks great. Come over here.

497
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,900
Thank you.

498
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:05,033
I like it so much. Thank you.

499
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:08,800
I'll go over there and buy some coffee,
so wait here.

500
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,033
Okay.

501
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:32,600
Your coffee is here.

502
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:36,733
Thank you.

503
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,733
I guess you like red the most, Se Gyeong.

504
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,000
Yes, it's passionate.

505
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,666
My life lacks passion.

506
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:52,933
So I like the color red,
but I also feel jealous when I see it.

507
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:58,100
I'm flying to Seoul today. It would have
been nice if we were on the same flight.

508
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:03,266
I'll be coming to Geoje frequently,

509
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,700
so let's wait for the next opportunity.

510
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:07,900
I'll be nervous whenever
I take the flight from now on.

511
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Hold on.

512
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,333
There you go.

513
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,766
I'll take a picture for you.
Give me your cell phone.

514
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,833
Okay, strike a pose.

515
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,600
One, two, three.

516
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,733
One more.

517
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,400
One, two, three.

518
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:30,266
That's strange. Where did it go?

519
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:32,433
What? Didn't you bring your purse?

520
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,166
No. I know I had it with me
when I bought the squid sausages earlier.

521
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,800
You must have dropped it somewhere.

522
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,933
I guess so.

523
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,933
I'm so sorry. I'll pay you back tomorrow.

524
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,766
Okay.

525
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:49,233
I can't believe this. Where did it go?

526
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,500
Seriously...

527
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,766
I don't have my ID, so I can't even
get on my flight. This is a problem.

528
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:04,066
I have appointments with patients
tomorrow morning.

529
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,133
Where did I lose my wallet?

530
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:09,266
I'm an idiot.

531
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:26,300
For calling you a mutt yesterday
and saying you crossed the line,

532
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,600
You were harsh.

534
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:30,866
I stayed put because it was your birthday.

535
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,133
Try to understand.

536
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:35,833
Actually, my birthday is today
and not yesterday.

537
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:39,000
I only found out because the bank
sent a text message this morning.

538
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,466
I don't remember my birthday either.

539
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:42,866
Wait right here.

540
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,833
I fetched this on my way here.

541
00:33:58,733 --> 00:33:59,466
My goodness.

542
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
It looks good on you.

543
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,900
Does it? Thank you.

544
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:09,466
But you seem to be in a good mood today.

545
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,966
Jin Sun broke up with the other guy.

546
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,300
We're dating again.

547
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,566
Is that so? Congratulations.

548
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,566
But I heard this when I went to
the Rose Bridge with Jin Sun earlier.

549
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:22,166
The man who threw the hatchet
away that night...

550
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:25,000
is taking pictures
of a newlywed couple today.

551
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,400
- Here I go. One, two, three.
- Hello?

552
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,900
- It's been a while.
- Please face each other this time.

553
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,733
You should have called often.

554
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:37,100
Yes, Jin Sun is...

555
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:38,966
The photographer?

556
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:44,066
- Sir.
- Yes?

557
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,533
You look stylish.

558
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,500
Do I? Thank you.

559
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:51,533
By the way, did you find the hatchet?

560
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:53,933
No. Not yet.

561
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,366
I've been thinking...

562
00:34:57,366 --> 00:35:02,200
and I have a feeling the groom
might have also made a false confession.

563
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,766
That can't be.

564
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:08,300
But the groom is unable to give
detailed explanations for his crime.

565
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,800
He keeps saying he can't remember.

566
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,733
Maybe there is a third person involved.

567
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,500
A third person?

568
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,533
Well, the groom and bride came to Geoje
to take wedding photos.

569
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:21,600
Wedding photos?

570
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:26,400
The photographer?

571
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:32,566
But what does the photographer
have to do with the victim?

572
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,233
What's this?

573
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:47,466
My goodness!

574
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:49,633
- My gosh!
- Congratulations!

575
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:51,733
Hey, what's all this?

576
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,166
Surprise!

577
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,600
- You were surprised, weren't you?
- Yes.

578
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,933
Congratulations on your successful drama
and for shooting an ad.

579
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,000
My gosh.

580
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,633
- Yong Gun.
- Yes?

581
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,500
I chose this, thinking of you.

582
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,633
I'm at such a loss for words.

583
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:08,233
I never imagined this.

584
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,666
Thank you so much!

585
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,800
- Yong Gun.
- My gosh.

586
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,966
- Hurry and blow out the candles.
- Okay.

587
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:16,400
Soon Jae, come over here.

588
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,166
- Soon Jae!
- Come over here, Soon Jae.

589
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,800
Soon Jae, you, too!

590
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:31,333
This is driving me crazy.

591
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,133
Just what do these stars mean?

592
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,333
Today...

593
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:40,533
Yes, it's today.

594
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,633
Happy birthday, Soon Jae!

595
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:52,066
It's a surprise, Soon Jae!

596
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:53,800
Happy birthday!

597
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,433
Su Jeong, Chae Moo, and Ok Sook
prepared all these dishes...

598
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:59,933
since it's your birthday.

599
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,733
Come over and blow the candles out.

600
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,533
- Soon Jae.
- Hurry, Soon Jae.

601
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:06,166
Surprise!

602
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,133
You were surprised, weren't you, Soon Jae?

603
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,366
Is it Soon Jae's birthday?

604
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,966
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

605
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:21,166
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

606
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:25,066
- Happy birthday, dear Soon Jae
- Happy birthday, dear Soon Jae

607
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:28,400
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

608
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:40,366
Happy birthday, Soon Jae.

609
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:42,500
I chose this, thinking of you.

610
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,666
Here you go. Congratulations, Soon Jae.

611
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:44,966
My goodness.

612
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,000
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

613
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes. Congratulations, Soon Jae.

614
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,866
Thank you.

615
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:56,600
How did you know I like squid sausages?

616
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,733
Thank you so much.

617
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,966
- Yes.
- Yes.

618
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
My gosh.

619
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:29,000
Hold on. It looks a little big for me.

620
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,133
But it's nice and fancy,
so I'll look young in it.

621
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,966
What do you think? Does it look nice?

622
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:53,200
Of course.

623
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,800
It looks great on you.

624
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,000
Soon Jae, you look so stylish.

625
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,500
All that effort to choose has paid off.

626
00:39:01,366 --> 00:39:03,400
Lend it to me when I go for a shoot.

627
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,200
Then I'll be back.

628
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,300
Yes.

629
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,733
My goodness, I tried so hard
to hold my laughter back.

630
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,966
Should we throw it out
without Soon Jae knowing?

631
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,300
I don't know.

632
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:22,700
Yong Gun, you gave it to him,
so you deal with it.

633
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,466
An airline cap?

634
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,833
You're trying so hard.

635
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:49,700
Look, mister.

636
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,533
Are you saying that you pretended
to be an airline pilot to flatter women...

637
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:56,166
and stole that many wallets?

638
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:59,666
It was hard to make ends meet. I'm sorry.

639
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,333
Do you think everyone
who finds it hard to make ends meet...

640
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,133
fools others and steals wallets as you do?

641
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:06,900
Those who were fooled are to blame.

642
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,033
Playing around with someone's feelings
is the worst.

643
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,800
I can make this the last time
you enjoy the outside view.

644
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,933
- How dare you?
- Officer Hong.

645
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:17,766
That's enough.

646
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,833
I'll take this shameless conman...

647
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,500
and turn him over to the police station.

648
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:24,400
In the meantime,
contact the wallet owners...

649
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,333
and tell them to collect
their wallets, okay?

650
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,400
Yes, sir.

651
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,300
This is also evidence.

652
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,100
Follow me.

653
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,300
How did he fool so many people?

654
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,333
Are they innocent or clueless?

655
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,600
(Hong Eun Ha)

656
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,300
Mom?

657
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,233
Hello.

658
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:02,266
Yes.

659
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,633
You're actor Kim Yong Gun's daughter,
aren't you?

660
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,500
I saw you at my noodle place last time.

661
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,500
Yes, I remember.

662
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,900
I have a terrible taste for men.

663
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,100
I probably have the worst taste for men.

664
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,433
Your husband ran away at your wedding...

665
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:23,766
My goodness.

666
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:27,033
I'm sorry. I overheard
the conversation unintentionally...

667
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:29,300
It's not even a secret.

668
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,233
But you're so beautiful.

669
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,233
I wonder what's wrong with me.

670
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,633
You should visit my noodle place
for drinks next time.

671
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,200
I have a long story to tell.

672
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,966
Don't cry after listening to mine.

673
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,800
I wonder what's wrong with us.

674
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,500
- Ms. Kim Ja Gyeong?
- Yes.

675
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,500
- Please sign here and take your wallet.
- Okay.

676
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:03,800
- Ms. Hong Eun Ha?
- Yes.

677
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,000
Ms. Hong Eun Ha,

678
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,033
let's talk at home later.

679
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,833
I'll be waiting for you.

680
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:17,466
Get going.

681
00:42:27,566 --> 00:42:29,833
(Geoje Rainbow)

682
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:35,533
All of them were so preoccupied
taking pictures here...

683
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:38,133
that they didn't realize their wallets
were being stolen?

684
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,433
My goodness.

685
00:42:45,466 --> 00:42:47,866
Isn't this guy the photographer?

686
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,433
And this is the deceased webcomic artist.

687
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:54,700
Why are the two of them together?

688
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,133
Sir!

689
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:09,000
- Sir!
- Yes?

690
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:15,733
- Sir.
- Yes?

691
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,266
Guess what?

692
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:19,900
I found the webcomic artist's
Instagram account...

693
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,366
and it turns out he was acquainted
with the photographer...

694
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,733
who took photos for the groom and bride.

695
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,912
If the photographer had informed
the webcomic artist about the schedule...

696
00:43:28,912 --> 00:43:32,466
for the couple, it would explain
how he appeared at every photo shoot.

697
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:33,700
Is that so?

698
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,166
And...

699
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:41,066
this is where photographer
Yang Jin Man is lodging.

700
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:43,300
And there's a river
from the crime scene...

701
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,933
to this accommodation.

702
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:47,100
And the Rose Bridge is there, too.

703
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,933
I see!

704
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:53,400
Do you reckon the photographer
is involved in this case?

705
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,966
Do not fear and go all in with confidence.

706
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:00,266
It's better than regretting it later.

707
00:44:01,866 --> 00:44:03,500
I should, right?

708
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,400
I'll go all in with confidence like you.

709
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,500
You look great.

710
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,666
Thank you.

711
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:14,066
Why are there so many cases these days?

712
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:15,566
It's seriously driving me crazy.

713
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,533
Hey!

714
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,700
I told you not to loiter around.
Didn't I make myself clear?

715
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,133
Do you really think I'm joking around?

716
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:26,400
Detective Yuk!

717
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,133
Please look at this map over here.

718
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,133
Please look.

719
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:38,600
I know you're all exhausted,
so let's have dinner once we find it.

720
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,233
Let's make this nice and neat and find...

721
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:41,500
Hey, why are you looking for grasshoppers?

722
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,433
Find something blunt
that can be used as a weapon.

723
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,466
Please look carefully.

724
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,000
I found it!

725
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,900
What?

726
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:57,200
Hey...

727
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,000
Hey, stay put. I'll go there.

728
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,533
- Detective Yuk!
- Yes, what is it?

729
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,266
- Detective Yuk!
- What is it?

730
00:45:08,266 --> 00:45:10,266
Traces of blood have been found
in the vehicle...

731
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:13,733
Photographer Yang Jin Man rented
on the day of the homicide.

732
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,800
He must have driven it with the axe
covered in blood.

733
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:19,200
Locate Yang Jin Man.

734
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,633
Hey, you bring that over here.

735
00:45:20,633 --> 00:45:21,966
Go up and do it.

736
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:24,266
You're such a fuss. Hurry up.

737
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:26,366
Can you come closer?

738
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:28,533
One, two, three.

739
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:30,833
That's good. Let's take another one.

740
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,033
One, two, three.

741
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,633
Yes, that was good.

742
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:37,800
This time, let's all laugh out loud.

743
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,766
Laugh out loud?

744
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,866
Laugh.

745
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:44,966
Open your mouths wider.

746
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:48,400
(Why are we taking photos like these
at our age?)

747
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,800
(Why not? It's nice and fun.)

748
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,500
(Soon Jae is thanking us
for congratulating his birthday.)

749
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,466
(We're the youngest today, so smile.)

750
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,133
You're all done.

751
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,833
Let's wrap up here. I'll contact you
once the photos are out.

752
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:03,400
Hold on. Let's take a few more.

753
00:46:04,066 --> 00:46:05,833
I've just warmed up.

754
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:08,733
I need to catch my flight.

755
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:11,333
If you miss your flight,
I'll buy you a new ticket,

756
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,200
so let's take a few more.

757
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,900
Okay. Then can you all put your arms
around each other...

758
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,866
- Arms around each other?
- Okay.

759
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:24,566
Look as if you're feeling great!

760
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,400
- I feel great.
- Yes.

761
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,066
Excuse me?

762
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,833
- What?
- What is it?

763
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,066
Are you photographer Yang Jin Man?

764
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:36,700
Yes. Why?

765
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,700
I'm the police. Please follow me.

766
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:42,700
Mr. Yang Jin Man.

767
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:44,766
Darn it!

768
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:46,200
Catch him!

769
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:48,866
Hey!

770
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:51,600
I got him. Hold him tight.

771
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,766
Press him down.

772
00:46:56,966 --> 00:46:58,166
We got him.

773
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,566
What are you doing? Stay put!

774
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,100
- You were here.
- Yes.

775
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:21,333
Thanks to you all,
we were able to catch the culprit.

776
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,166
Thank you so much.

777
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:24,633
So what happened?

778
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:29,600
Apparently, the webcomic artist
and the photographer were lovers.

779
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,900
The title of the drama
is called "Bizarre Gift."

780
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,633
It was entertaining.

781
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,333
I want to draw it out as a webcomic
as soon as possible.

782
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:48,166
Using photos speeds up the job,
so take them from multiple angles.

783
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:55,800
What's this hatchet?

784
00:47:56,233 --> 00:47:59,100
A gift box carrying the man,

785
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,466
who dies with a hatchet in his head,
arrives.

786
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:05,633
Sitting like this...

787
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,333
Can you give me the hatchet?

788
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:14,033
I'll strike a pose to make it look like
it's stuck in my head.

789
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,500
Unable to get over his ex-girlfriend,
the webcomic artist was only using...

790
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,033
the photographer,
and the photographer felt jealous.

791
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:34,066
I see.

792
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:36,400
Don't you ever come here again.

793
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:39,533
- Myeong Ok!
- Jong Kuk!

794
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,800
- The bride thought the groom did it...
- Sorry. It's my fault.

795
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,700
- and made a false confession.
- No, it's not. Are you okay?

796
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,033
And the groom thought the bride
had committed the murder,

797
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:49,533
so he also made a false confession.

798
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:52,533
My goodness.

799
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,733
It's more dramatic
than your dramas, right?

800
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,466
Yes. Fiction can't be better
than non-fiction.

801
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,500
Soon Jae, are you not going to
take off your sunglasses?

802
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:08,000
It's getting dark.

803
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,900
It's a gift from my favorite friend,

804
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,000
so I don't want to take them off.

805
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,939
(Dog Knows Everything)

806
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:21,438
"I'm your fan, Lee Soon Jae."

807
00:50:21,891 --> 00:50:24,092
It was your son who left that there,
not your fan.

808
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:26,601
And what do you know about Gi Dong
to say such things?

809
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:28,126
Shall we just kill ourselves today?

810
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:29,214
My gosh, Dad!

811
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:31,589
You bullied the newcomer again,
didn't you?

812
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:34,295
How annoying. I should just not sign up.

813
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:38,154
We'll legally inherit everything
if you pass away anyway.

814
00:50:38,575 --> 00:50:41,220
Apparently, she messaged them
saying that she'll commit suicide.

815
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,030
My mom wouldn't do such a thing.

816
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:45,380
How can she give her entire fortune
to her cat?

817
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,795
Is that ridiculous will really valid?

818
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,770
I find that diver's young daughter
a little suspicious.

819
00:50:51,108 --> 00:50:54,721
She has a completely different persona.

820
00:50:54,816 --> 00:50:58,044
Must we risk our lives for ten dollars?

821
00:50:58,044 --> 00:50:59,299
I canceled my installment savings.

822
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:01,039
It's YOLO.

823
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:03,633
Haven't you heard YOLO
brings you down low?

824
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:06,124
That girl must be Gi Dong's daughter.

825
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:07,784
She's my granddaughter.

826
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:09,291
And what's with that dog again?

827
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:13,207
But it's abnormal for a diver...

828
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:14,803
to throw herself into the sea
to take her own life.

829
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,791
Was she a diver?

830
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:19,191
