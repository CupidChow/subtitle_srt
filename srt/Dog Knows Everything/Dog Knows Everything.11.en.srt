(Chae Moo's Garden)

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,600
Grow nice and big.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,033
Grow nice and big.

7
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,466
You're working hard in this weather.

8
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:25,766
What did you plant?

9
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,300
Peas.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,566
I'm growing more attached to them...

11
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,733
at the thought of raising them myself.

12
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:33,033
I guess this is why people farm.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,633
But isn't this your plot of land?
Why aren't you planting anything?

14
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,400
I can't because it's too strenuous.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,966
Just plant anything.

16
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,566
I'll water it when I water mine.

17
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:45,366
It's okay. It's cheaper to buy
in the market.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,766
I don't find this cumbersome at all.

19
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:55,166
All you have to do is grow nicely.

20
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:06,200
This is an eye from Ah Rin's rabbit toy.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,166
Arin will be happy I found it for her.

22
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,800
Cho Won, what brings you here?

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,733
Is your leg okay?

24
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,866
Why are you carrying such a big bag?
It's so heavy.

25
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,233
Can I stay here for the night?

26
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:21,066
I ran away from home.

27
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,100
From home? Why?

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,833
I argued with Mom.

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,233
Mom still thinks I'm a baby.

30
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,500
Does it make sense for her to tell me...

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,866
to quit my police job
just because I hurt my leg?

32
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,600
It's impressive and commendable
you're working with the police.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,133
How can she say such a thing?

34
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,500
You must've been upset.

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,466
You're truly the empathic type.

36
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,166
But why are you wearing sunglasses?

37
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,800
Because my eyes are puffy...

38
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,000
from the hospital.

39
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,200
I see.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,233
(Restricted Area)

41
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Take my blood.

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,500
Take all of my blood and save her.

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,366
Hurry up!

44
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:21,366
She's RH...

45
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,666
Yes, it's RH-O. It's the same as me.

46
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,100
But who are you?

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,500
Can't you tell? I'm clearly...

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
her father.

49
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,200
I'm her father.

50
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,033
Please save my daughter.

51
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,500
Cho Won.

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,633
It's me. Do you recognize me?

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,066
Dad.

54
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,066
Dad.

55
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,400
Cho Won.

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,066
You and your mom must have had
a hard time because of me.

57
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,300
I'm so sorry.

58
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,933
Of all people, it had to be me.

59
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:26,400
If you hadn't met Mom,

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
I wouldn't be here.

61
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:32,266
I met a brave mother,

62
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:35,400
so I received all the love I could.

63
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,700
I thought nothing would change...

64
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,566
even if the secret behind my birth
was unveiled.

65
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:44,933
But I feel satiated...

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,033
and warm at heart,
even if I don't do anything.

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,033
And we've actually shared blood now.

68
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,933
So don't be sorry.

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,700
I'm so glad...

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,966
that you're my dad.

71
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,033
Cho Won.

72
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,133
Thank you so much...

73
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,500
for growing up into a fine young lady!

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,866
I don't know if I deserve
to hear such a thing!

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,500
Are you okay?

76
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,900
Don't cry.

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
That's enough.

78
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:36,233
What's wrong with you?

79
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,033
Let me take you to the best room we have.

80
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,100
Okay.

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,333
- What? What is it?
- Hold on.

82
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:52,866
Then Mr. Lee Soon Jae
is my biological grandfather.

83
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:57,366
That's right. He's my father,
so he's your biological grandfather.

84
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:01,766
Grandfather and dad, dad and grandfather.

85
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:05,966
(Dog Knows Everything)

86
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,566
- Hey! Get him!
- Hurry and get him!

87
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,566
Stop right there!

88
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,233
What's going on?

89
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,000
Hyeon Ta!

90
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,733
Wait a minute. Isn't that Hyeon Ta?

91
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:30,733
Those punks...

92
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,400
What do you think you're doing?

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,633
Back off!

94
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,100
I said back off!

95
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,933
How can you gang up on him?

96
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey, Hyeon Ta,

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,533
why are you letting them beat you up?

98
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,466
You should beat them up, too!

99
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,133
Sir, please stop.

100
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,733
What do you mean?

101
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,233
Hurry and call the police!

102
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,733
Cut!

103
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,266
Cut! I said cut!

104
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:54,600
Darn it!

105
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,466
Where did he jump out from?

106
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,500
Mr. Lee Soon Jae!
What are you doing there?

107
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,433
My goodness, I didn't know it was a shoot.

108
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,466
It looked like
Hyeon Ta was getting beaten up.

109
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:11,233
It's obviously a shoot, Mr. Lee.

110
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,900
Don't you know
what these settings are like?

111
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,700
I didn't see any cameras,
so I didn't know it was a shoot.

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,400
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,266
Then good luck.

114
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,000
Good luck, Hyeon Ta.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,833
I'm sorry, Mr. Director.

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,966
(Comfortable and unnoticeable
unlike underwear)

117
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,833
Thank you for saving me earlier.

118
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,866
Honestly, I was a little touched.

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,233
Hyeon Ta.

120
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,966
Did you bring this gift out of gratitude?

121
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:53,133
Yes. I read through the reviews...

122
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,333
and bought the one that's highly absorbent
and comfortable to wear.

123
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,166
Just trust me and try using it.

124
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,233
I have nothing to say because
you're actually serious about this.

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,133
In fact, I had always felt guilty...

126
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,033
about Mr. Lee going on hiatus
due to the urine-terrorizing incident.

127
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:06,966
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,700
Forget it. It's all in the past.

129
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,800
But Soon Jae doesn't need such a thing.

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,833
He has no problem going to the bathroom.

131
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,533
He fixed it all in Geoje.

132
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,366
Pardon?

133
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:21,766
Then if any one of you needs it...

134
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,366
What must you do to be good at acting?

135
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,633
Well...

136
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,766
I've been acting for over 50 years,

137
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,833
yet I still don't know
what makes good acting.

138
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,400
I always say this,

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,133
but acting is always incomplete.

140
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,333
So you just keep going.

141
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,333
I love acting, but I'm growing
more and more unconfident.

142
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,300
Wouldn't it be enough
if it makes your heart beat?

143
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,700
Just like how it's important in life.

144
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,166
Do what makes your heart beat.

145
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,366
By the way, who is this lady?

146
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,566
She's a staff on the PR team
at our agency.

147
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,633
But why are you holding hands
with a staff member?

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,633
She's a staff on the PR team
and my girlfriend.

149
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,000
We've only just started dating recently.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Please keep it a secret.

151
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,933
Your heart is already beating hard.

152
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,933
Hyeon Ta grew up abroad,

153
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,166
so he finds it difficult
around the older adults.

154
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,866
Ju Hwang, I'm comfortable
with everyone here.

155
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,933
They even promised to keep it
a secret that I'm dating.

156
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,766
Can we visit again after we go camping?

157
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:01,500
My manager found a great spot
that no one else knows.

158
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,500
I think it's a great idea
we came here today.

159
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Right?

160
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Yes, but Mr. Lee is a bit boring.

161
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,733
I was so sleepy.

162
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,133
Regardless, he's old-fashioned.

163
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,100
I'll bring the car, so wait a little.

164
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,800
What? Boring and old-fashioned?

165
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:33,466
They're not wrong, but that annoys me.

166
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,800
Are you done?

167
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, I'm all done.

168
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,900
The view here is fantastic.

169
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,933
It's wonderful, isn't it?

170
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,200
Hey, you know I can't drink.

171
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,500
Not drinking beer in front of such a view
is a crime.

172
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
Don't you know I pass out when I drink?

173
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,266
But we're the only ones here.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,266
Just pass out.

175
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,300
Try passing out. Do it for me.

176
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,600
Then should I pass out just a little?

177
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,533
Cheers.

178
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,000
This place is so nice.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,233
It's so nice.

180
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,366
What are you doing?

181
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,233
What is it? Why are you hiding it?

182
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,666
Hide what? It's nothing.

183
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,433
Then show me.

184
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:50,333
I don't want to doubt you.

185
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,333
Why would you doubt me?
Don't go overboard.

186
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:56,433
Who is it?

187
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,433
Hyeon Ta, let's cut this out
and drink beer.

188
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,533
I said show me!

189
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,500
Have you gone crazy? Give it to me!

190
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,933
Baek Song I, you know you look
more suspicious if you do this, right?

191
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,266
Forget it, so give it to me!

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,566
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

193
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,300
If you don't show me your cell phone,
it's over between us.

194
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:16,866
It's over?

195
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,400
Say that again. What was it?

196
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,400
Hey, say that again!

197
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,300
Song I.

198
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:28,400
Song I.

199
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:54,233
Ju Hwang.

200
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,900
Song I...

201
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,466
died.

202
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,633
Look at you.

203
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,833
Stop looking at me.
You're embarrassing me.

204
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,366
Ok Sook, you should be the one
getting married...

205
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,400
instead of your daughter.

206
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,866
You look stunning, Ok Sook.

207
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,133
Really?

208
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:29,766
Then should I find a good-natured man
while I'm at it...

209
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:32,433
and hold a joint wedding with my daughter?

210
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,700
Ok Sook, which one is better?

211
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,800
This one or this one?

212
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,066
I'll go with this one.

213
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,000
My goodness, thank you.

214
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,433
I'll use it carefully
and return it to you.

215
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,466
Hyeon Ta, you were never here.

216
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:07,933
You suddenly felt ill,

217
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:10,366
so you went to Seoul last night
to rest, okay?

218
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,333
Are you going to end everything like this?

219
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,700
Are you going to abandon everything
you've worked so hard to build?

220
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,300
Hey.

221
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,500
Think straight!

222
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,666
Ju Hwang...

223
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,366
I'll deal with everything,

224
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,833
so don't worry.

225
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,933
It's okay.

226
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,166
Everything will be fine.

227
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,500
I'll make sure that it'll be fine.

228
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,966
I'll deal with Song I's body,

229
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:37,433
so hurry and head up to Seoul.

230
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,900
Hurry up!

231
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,300
Mom!

232
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,366
Mom.

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,133
You're here.

234
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,900
You must be tired from coming
such a long way.

235
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,100
No, I'm not tired at all.

236
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,133
It's rough preparing for the wedding,
isn't it?

237
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,300
It's rough for Eun Yeong.

238
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,533
I have it easy because I just have
to do as Eun Yeong says.

239
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,666
My goodness, my adorable son-in-law.

240
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,600
Mom, you look so pretty today.

241
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,500
Did you buy something expensive?

242
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,866
Of course.

243
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:27,466
A doctor is becoming my son-in-law,
so I better look good to my in-laws.

244
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:28,800
- Right?
- Yes, that's right.

245
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,900
Let's go.

246
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:40,900
My goodness, I'm nervous.

247
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
You're here.

248
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,600
How have you been?

249
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,866
This is my mother.

250
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,333
My goodness, hello.

251
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,133
It's good to meet you like this.

252
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,366
Nice to meet you.

253
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:08,033
Yes, nice to meet you.

254
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,166
Shall we take a seat?

255
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,733
Mom, you should sit inside.

256
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:20,733
My parents couldn't wait to meet you.

257
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:23,133
I love Eun Yeong so much...

258
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:25,766
that I was curious about her mother.

259
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:29,133
And seeing you in person,
you're so beautiful and sophisticated,

260
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,766
just as I expected.

261
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,233
I see.

262
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,500
She's in Geoje, right?

263
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,033
Yes, Dad.

264
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,600
I dreamed of becoming an elementary
school teacher when I was young.

265
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,800
So I'm delighted that Eun Yeong
is a teacher.

266
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,066
Mom.

267
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,100
Yes?

268
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:57,033
I see.

269
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,733
Ok Sook.

270
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,100
What are you doing here?

271
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,666
Something happened
at the family gathering, right?

272
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,166
You even lost my bag.

273
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,366
Hurry and tell me.

274
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,366
Don't hesitate and tell me.

275
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,066
Just what is going on?

276
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,066
Did you fight with them?

277
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,000
Are you on the verge of
calling off their wedding?

278
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,600
I don't think I'll be able
to give them my consent.

279
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,766
Hey, are the in-laws...

280
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,100
that bad?

281
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,400
Are they rude? Are they trash?

282
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,100
That's not it.

283
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,733
The father of Eun Yeong's fiancé...

284
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,800
is my first love.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,866
Ok Sook, there's nothing more common
than first love.

286
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:23,200
Everyone in Korea has a first love.

287
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,133
It's not a big deal.

288
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:29,800
We lived together for three years...

289
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,266
before we broke up because
my parents were against our relationship.

290
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,366
But that man...

291
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,633
is the father of her fiancé.

292
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,133
What did he say?

293
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,966
Did he agree to call off the wedding?

294
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:49,600
He just pretended he didn't know me.

295
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,666
What should I do, Su Jeong?

296
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,366
What should I do with my daughter?

297
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:03,633
She won't be able to get married
because of me.

298
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:07,300
I feel so bad for Eun Yeong.

299
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,366
Dad.

300
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:29,800
My daughter, what are you up to?

301
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:34,400
I was just thinking of you
and you called me.

302
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,700
Where are you?

303
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm having a glass of soju in Gangnam
after the shoot.

304
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
My goodness.

305
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,400
Don't drink too much, okay?

306
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,700
Don't worry.

307
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm also snacking.

308
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Snacking on what?

309
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,633
I'm having beer as a snack with my soju.

310
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,766
You give me such a hard time, Dad.

311
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,833
I shouldn't give you a hard time.

312
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,600
Dad!

313
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,566
You should have told me
if you were in Geoje.

314
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,600
When did you arrive?

315
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,633
It's been around three or four days.

316
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,166
What about your hospital?

317
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,666
You'll lose patients if you keep
taking days off as you please.

318
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,700
You're so haphazard.

319
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,266
It's because I take after you.

320
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:19,866
My goodness,
you only take after my bad qualities.

321
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,666
I also take after
some of your good qualities.

322
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,200
Soju with beer on the side then?

323
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:26,833
Let's do it.

324
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:41,733
Just look at you.

325
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Okay, may all of you live long
in good health.

326
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,566
Cheers!

327
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:54,800
Cheers.

328
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,366
Se Gyeong, I feel so apologetic
for everything.

329
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,533
You don't have to feel that way.

330
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,433
Anyway, I'm sorry, Se Gyeong.

331
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:06,333
Then say cheers with me. Cheers!

332
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,800
She's very cheerful.

333
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,566
For a woman who had her groom run away,
she's very cheerful.

334
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,200
It's a compliment.
Why are you pinching me?

335
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,100
Thank you for seeing me in a good light.

336
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,866
Since I'm grateful, cheers!

337
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:23,700
You're so likable!

338
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,333
She's very likable.

339
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,333
Dad.

340
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,866
My daughter, what are you up to?

341
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:56,933
I was just thinking of you
and you called me.

342
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:57,866
Where are you?

343
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm having a glass of soju in Gangnam
after the shoot.

344
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:09,866
You must be so happy
to have such a bright daughter.

345
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,433
She's very bright
because she takes after me.

346
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,833
You only say that my positives
take after you.

347
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,866
(Ju Hwang)

348
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:38,133
(Ju Hwang)

349
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,233
(Ju Hwang)

350
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:01,766
(A hopeful future with the people!)

351
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,566
I killed someone.

352
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:28,533
Are you saying that Hyeon Ta,
the nation's idol, killed someone?

353
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:32,466
Last night, I killed my girlfriend,

354
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:33,800
Baek Song I.

355
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:40,166
I mean, tell us in detail...

356
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,200
when, where, and how you killed her.

357
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:45,000
We argued at the campsite last night.

358
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,233
- I got drunk and used a tent hammer...
- Hyeon Ta!

359
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,333
Hyeon Ta.

360
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,300
Hyeon Ta, what's wrong with you?

361
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,266
Who are you?

362
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,666
Yes.

363
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,733
I'm Hyeon Ta's manager, Hwang Ju Hwang.

364
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:00,866
Sir, this is nonsense.

365
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,000
Yes.

366
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,766
Hyeon Ta has been working on a film lately
and he's been very stressed.

367
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:07,200
- He was prescribed sleeping pills.
- My goodness.

368
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,600
So he's a little delusional.

369
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Mr. Hyeon Ta.

370
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,633
A homicide case needs a dead body.

371
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,666
Where's the body of your dead girlfriend
that you mentioned earlier?

372
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,133
I'm not sure.

373
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:30,766
You're not sure?

374
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,666
- Sleeping pills and delusional...
- Yes.

375
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:36,866
Mr. Hyeon Ta.

376
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm your fan.

377
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,933
Return once you find the body.

378
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:44,266
Mr. Hwang, you should
take good care of Mr. Hyeon Ta.

379
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,866
You must be really busy.

380
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:47,400
- Let's rise.
- Let's go.

381
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,333
We're also busy, too.

382
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,366
Mr. Hyeon Ta, I'm also a fan.

383
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:54,666
One, two, three.

384
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,233
With the lighthouse. One, two, three.

385
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,500
One, two, three.

386
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,133
- Hey, I'll take it for you.
- Okay.

387
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,700
Stand there. One, two, three.

388
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,266
What's that?

389
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:10,666
What's that?

390
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,133
I knew it.

391
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:27,800
My prediction was correct.

392
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:31,000
The victim is Baek Song I,
a 22-year-old woman.

393
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,533
She died from a fracture
on the back of her head.

394
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,900
The weapon used in the crime was
a hammer used for securing tent pegs.

395
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:40,466
It matches Mr. Hyeon Ta's testimony
from yesterday.

396
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:45,266
Delusional from sleeping pills?
Are you joking with me?

397
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm sorry. I killed her.

398
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,466
I killed Song I...

399
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,266
and threw her body into the sea.

400
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,533
Sir.

401
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:02,200
I'll request a warrant to arrest Hyeon Ta.

402
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,233
Put him in custody.

403
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,333
Yes, sir.

404
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:21,666
Hyeon Ta, you're not the type of guy
to do such a thing.

405
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,866
What on earth is going on?

406
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:28,400
Sir, please stop.

407
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,900
Is something wrong?

408
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,700
Someone I know killed someone I know.

409
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:00,500
Hey, what does that mean?

410
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:05,133
A fellow actor killed his girlfriend.

411
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:08,133
I still vividly remember how they smiled
at each other contently...

412
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:10,033
when they visited my house.

413
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:12,000
Did that pink ribbon girl die?

414
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,633
How do you know her?

415
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,200
I saw her in front of your house.

416
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,733
That's unfortunate.

417
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:20,533
I also saw her at the market yesterday.

418
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:23,333
But she died the night before that,
so how did you see her yesterday?

419
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:24,666
Did she die the day before yesterday?

420
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,000
Are you sure you saw her yesterday?

421
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,800
Yes. I was flustered,
so I clearly remember seeing her.

422
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,333
Where did you see her yesterday?

423
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,433
In front of the dried fish store
in Geoje Market.

424
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,400
Just a moment. I'll give this to you.
You should try tasting this.

425
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,233
It's freshly made, so it's nice,
chewy, and delicious.

426
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,333
You should try it.

427
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,900
Thank you.

428
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,200
This looks good.

429
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,000
It's so glutinous. How is it this good?

430
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,333
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's so good.

431
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,600
Sophie.

432
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,800
Don't lick this. You should eat it there.

433
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,033
Is business going well?

434
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,333
Seriously, what is this?

435
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,066
Are you kidding me?

436
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,366
But your business is doing well.

437
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,566
What? What was that?

438
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,800
(Su Jeong Market, B and B)

439
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:42,933
So you're telling me
to follow that manager...

440
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,200
and keep my eyes on him, right?

441
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,966
Yes. I'm sure he's hiding something.

442
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:51,333
I've attached a small camera
on your collar,

443
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,000
so just watch him from up close.

444
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,966
Something will be filmed
and recorded on it.

445
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,400
Okay. Good luck, Sophie.

446
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,100
Are you wagging your tail?

447
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,033
What are you doing?

448
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,166
Hey, are you not going to fall for this?

449
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,566
You're cute.

450
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,566
Paw!

451
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,500
Down!

452
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:35,133
Why must I do this?

453
00:29:37,366 --> 00:29:38,233
Pray!

454
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:43,233
Life sure is tough.

455
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,733
You're incredibly smart.

456
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,266
Then how about break dancing?

457
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:48,466
Why I ought to...

458
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,933
Yes. That wench Baek Song I...

459
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,033
said if I didn't give her 30 percent,

460
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:09,100
she would tell Hyeon Ta everything.

461
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,566
That if she pretends to be dead,
I'll pretend to cover it up...

462
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,200
and use Hyeon Ta's weakness...

463
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,333
to make him sign a slave contract
with your agency to leech off of him.

464
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,533
She said she'd tell him
that everything was rigged.

465
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,800
I got so annoyed.

466
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,933
Then after I do all the work,

467
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,566
you'll take half the sum...

468
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:29,166
and Song I will take 30 percent.
Then what am I left with?

469
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:35,966
Yes. That wench Baek Song I,

470
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,200
I killed her.

471
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
So what?

472
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,933
Hey, hang up.

473
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:46,000
Hey, wait up.

474
00:30:53,366 --> 00:30:54,333
Do you like beef jerky?

475
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,133
I'm giving it to you because you're cute.

476
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:10,633
Well done, Sophie.

477
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:13,966
So that manager
confessed his crime, right?

478
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:16,133
He spilled everything out.

479
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:18,866
But why is this camera wet?

480
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,533
Must I know that, too?

481
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:23,133
I was just asking.
Why are you getting so worked up?

482
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,600
Do you know how far I went to film this?

483
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
I also had a hard time, too.

484
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,066
I let go of my pride a lot.

485
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,300
My goodness, okay. I understand.

486
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,966
The sound wasn't recorded,

487
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:45,133
so I can't tell what he's saying.

488
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:48,766
Isn't it this?

489
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,566
"Yes."

490
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:54,133
"Bésame mucho."

491
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,966
"I sang it."

492
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,500
"Get lost."

493
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,633
Come on. That's not it.

494
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:03,366
"Yes."

495
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:08,700
"Did you roll the gravel
in the seaweed soup?"

496
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,533
"Where are you?"

497
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:13,566
This is what it is. It's the exact same.

498
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:15,333
What do you mean it's the same?

499
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,233
- "Get lost."
- That's not what he's mouthing.

500
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:19,266
Look carefully.

501
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,566
"Bésame mucho."

502
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,300
- It isn't "Bésame mucho."
- "I..."

503
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:58,466
Did you recognize me
at first glance yesterday?

504
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,700
Of course.

505
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,800
I recognized that you were Bong Soon
the minute I saw you.

506
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:08,633
I changed my name 30 years ago.

507
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm Ok Sook now.

508
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,266
So that's why I couldn't find you.

509
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:19,333
Did you look for me?

510
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:26,900
I was enlisted right after
breaking up with you.

511
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:32,233
And I went around looking for you
as soon I was discharged.

512
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:39,400
I was in the U.S. at the time.

513
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,200
I learned how to do makeup there...

514
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,566
and it became my job.

515
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:48,933
You eventually became a novelist.

516
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,566
I even read your novel.

517
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,966
I'm grateful that you read it.

518
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,600
When I read your novel,

519
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,366
I could almost hear your voice.

520
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,633
It never crossed my mind...

521
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,566
that when someone who knows me
reads my book,

522
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:10,600
it can bring my voice to their mind.

523
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,133
Han Su...

524
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:19,266
I mean, Mr. Jeong.

525
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,200
We can't become in-laws...

526
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,700
Bong Soon.

527
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:30,366
What would have happened to us
if we had not broken up then?

528
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,700
I've always thought of this.

529
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:38,433
Mr. Jeong, please stop.

530
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,433
You shouldn't say such things anymore.

531
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,933
We can't let our kids get married.

532
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,900
I'll tell my daughter Eun Yeong...

533
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:55,233
that I dislike her parents-in-law.

534
00:34:56,133 --> 00:35:00,800
So Mr. Jeong, you should also explain
why the marriage must be called off.

535
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,933
Ms. Song...

536
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:10,033
Hey, how did you know we were here?

537
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:12,400
Hyeon Su.

538
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,933
This is my first love.

539
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,700
A woman I loved so dearly.

540
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:18,566
Bong Soon.

541
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm so sorry, Ms. Song.

542
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,766
I should have told you in advance,

543
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:44,766
but my father's dementia
has recently worsened.

544
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,500
These days, he can't even remember
what happened yesterday.

545
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:55,900
My father asked for your number,

546
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,666
so I saved it on his cell phone.

547
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,533
But I had no idea he'd reach out
to you like this.

548
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:02,900
You had a hard time responding
to him, right?

549
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,700
No.

550
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,366
Earlier, my father said...

551
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:11,133
you were his first love.

552
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,000
But that's because he's been talking
about his first love a lot lately.

553
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:19,700
Whenever my mother hears this,

554
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,466
she laughs and tells him
to look for his first love.

555
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:26,366
I guess my father's first love
must have left quite an impression.

556
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,666
He even mentions her name,

557
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,066
that her name is Bong Soon.

558
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:37,333
The name does sound like a first love.

559
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,133
But who knows?

560
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,833
That name might not be real...

561
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,933
or my father could have come up with it.

562
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,300
Ms. Song.

563
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:53,733
I'm sorry.

564
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:59,766
Eun Yeong and I cried a lot, too.

565
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:02,400
We pitied my father.

566
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,833
Eun Yeong's fiancé's father has dementia?

567
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,733
So your first love has dementia?

568
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:33,400
But he recognized me so well.

569
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,500
He even remembers things
from the past so clearly.

570
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,333
My goodness, he must have
longed for you deeply.

571
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:43,200
What did he say?

572
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,566
I mentioned calling off the marriage...

573
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,333
but have yet to hear a response.

574
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,566
But Ok Sook,

575
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:57,366
have you and your first love
done something wrong?

576
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:59,666
Did you scam someone?
Did you assault someone?

577
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,900
All you did was love each other.

578
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:07,433
But still, I can't let them get married
as if nothing had happened.

579
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:11,433
So do you plan to make your kids
break up like your parents did to you?

580
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,400
Nothing happened.

581
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Just let them get married.

582
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,333
Hey, mentioning your first love...

583
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,100
to your children or anyone else
is unnecessary.

584
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,266
Just keep it to yourself to your grave.

585
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:28,266
Just keep it a secret as it is.

586
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,900
That's all you need to do.

587
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,966
Have another drink.

588
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:47,600
Is there a surveillance camera
in this market?

589
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:50,333
I see.

590
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,266
There are no surveillance cameras
in this market.

591
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,466
And no one has seen the lady.

592
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,300
I mean, if someone who is known
to have died three days ago...

593
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,033
roamed around this place yesterday,

594
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,633
it'll become evident Hyeon Ta
isn't the one to blame.

595
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,700
That woman's scent still remains faint.

596
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,966
Really?

597
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,666
Was she here?

598
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:47,566
Have you seen a lady
go back and forth near here?

599
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:49,633
- No, I haven't.
- I see.

600
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,033
Sophie, let's go.

601
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,533
There are traces of her
moving around here and there.

602
00:39:56,533 --> 00:40:00,366
But there's no evidence or witnesses
to prove she was alive yesterday.

603
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,266
I think she deliberately went to places
where nobody was around.

604
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:05,833
Anyway, it is suspicious.

605
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,333
(Chae Moo's Garden)

606
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,633
(Sun Ja's Garden)

607
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:18,433
I mean, how are these peas yours?

608
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,966
They're my peas if they're growing
from my plot of land.

609
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:22,033
How are they your peas?

610
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,200
I worked hard to sow the seeds
and manage the garden.

611
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,166
And you just moved them to your garden!

612
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,400
Why would I go through the hassle
of moving them to my garden?

613
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,433
I didn't move them.

614
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:32,700
Then why are these peas in your garden?

615
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,233
I don't know either.

616
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,200
The peas must have walked over themselves.

617
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,700
Ma'am!

618
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,700
I heard you filed a report
on the theft of your peas.

619
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:46,866
The thing is I sowed the seeds,
watered, and looked after them.

620
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:49,033
And this lady moved all the saplings
to her garden.

621
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:51,033
I told you I didn't.

622
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,966
They just grew here.

623
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,100
That's it, Officer Hong.

624
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,766
Let's use the polygraph.

625
00:40:57,766 --> 00:40:59,733
I'm innocent, Officer Hong.

626
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,300
Let's do a hypnosis.

627
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,533
And call a profiler or something.

628
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,800
Grandpa.

629
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:15,166
Hey, I can smell the woman from here, too.

630
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:16,633
From this garden?

631
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,100
Are you here after hearing about
the theft of my peas?

632
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,533
Peas?

633
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:23,733
The saplings of the peas
Mr. Im Chae Moo had sown...

634
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:26,400
are growing in the neighbor's garden.

635
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Hold on.

636
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,500
Someone must have dug up this garden.

637
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,833
The paper that had been in the soil
has come to the surface.

638
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,333
You're right.

639
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,566
Give me this.

640
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,866
Why are you digging the ground?

641
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,900
Chae Moo, your peas moved
to the lady's garden...

642
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,533
because the soil was moved
from here to there.

643
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:55,333
What?

644
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,633
It really seems so.

645
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:00,466
Wait, what is this?

646
00:42:19,966 --> 00:42:22,733
When Baek Song I was murdered,
the situation was recorded...

647
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:24,433
on her smartwatch.

648
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,700
Manager Hwang, who murdered
Baek Song I, abandoned her...

649
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,833
and buried the smartwatch,
which was crucial evidence,

650
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,600
and confessed that he was accountable
for the entire crime.

651
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:03,066
Well done, Officer Hong.

652
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:11,566
Hyeon Ta, I knew you wouldn't
do such a thing.

653
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,233
Thank you, Mr. Lee,

654
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:17,500
for trusting me and finding the evidence.

655
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,866
Thank you so much.

656
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,700
Can I call you "Grandpa?"

657
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,233
Of course, you can.

658
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,266
I'll repay this gratitude to you someday.

659
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:31,900
My goodness, don't bother.

660
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:36,000
Grandpa!

661
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,566
Yes?

662
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,966
Did they ask to have another
family gathering?

663
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,400
So are you planning to call off
Eun Yeong's wedding?

664
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,133
It's for my daughter's sake.

665
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,966
And I'll be punished.

666
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,500
Mom, why are you dressed so humbly today?

667
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,833
Are you feeling comfortable
because it's our second gathering?

668
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,266
I'm sorry, Eun Yeong.

669
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:28,733
There's no need to be sorry.

670
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,866
You look beautiful just as you are.

671
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:33,100
But I guess it's a little funny.

672
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:35,400
Two family gatherings?

673
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,100
My fiancé's father has something
to say before our wedding.

674
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,233
Yes.

675
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,766
Actually,

676
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,966
I also have something to say.

677
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:50,766
We're here.

678
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,633
Hello, Ms. Song.

679
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:57,866
It's so good to see you again.

680
00:44:57,866 --> 00:44:59,700
Yes, hello.

681
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,300
Honey, you should say hello.

682
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,700
Hello. Nice to meet you.

683
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,166
I'm Hyeon Su's father.

684
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,900
Yes, hello.

685
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,833
Nice to meet you.

686
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,366
I'm Eun Yeong's mother.

687
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,066
Dad, this is your daughter-in-law.

688
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,766
Of course, I know Eun Yeong.

689
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,433
She's the kindest and prettiest
daughter-in-law.

690
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:31,800
Thank you.

691
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:34,800
Shall we take a seat?

692
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,366
I heard from my son earlier...

693
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:48,966
that you came all the way from Geoje.

694
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,766
Yes, that's right.

695
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:53,266
That must have been tough.

696
00:45:53,266 --> 00:45:55,866
How many days did it take to come here?

697
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:58,333
Honey, Geoje is in Korea.

698
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,666
It only takes a few hours.

699
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,400
You must be hungry from the long trip.

700
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,433
Our meal will be served soon.

701
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:07,766
I see, my beautiful daughter-in-law.

702
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:11,200
But Dad, what did you want to say
at this gathering?

703
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,300
Well...

704
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,100
No one knows about this,

705
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,266
but I have a plot of land in Gyeonggi-do.

706
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:34,833
You should sell that and afford a house.

707
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:40,333
Honey, we sold that 20 years ago
for Hyeon Su's education.

708
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:41,333
Did we?

709
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,333
Well done, my beautiful wife.

710
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,066
But you also had something to say, Mom.

711
00:46:52,066 --> 00:46:53,700
I'm curious as to what it's about.

712
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,366
Well...

713
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:01,800
Actually,

714
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:13,300
I wanted to thank you
for accepting the two of us,

715
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,666
who are insignificant,
as part of your family.

716
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:20,733
I don't think I was able
to thank you last time.

717
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,566
I'd like to treat you to a meal this time.

718
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:27,300
You want to treat us to a meal?

719
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,233
My goodness, you're wonderful.

720
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,966
Excuse me, Mr. Jeong.

721
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,366
Yes, Ms. Song?

722
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,466
What about Bong Soon?

723
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:58,466
Wait, how do you know Bong Soon?

724
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:00,700
Bong Soon died a long time ago.

725
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:12,933
Dad, get in the car.

726
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,800
Share this with your friends in Geoje.

727
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,000
These are good rice cakes.

728
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,733
Thank you. I'll enjoy them.

729
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:31,366
Then have a safe trip.

730
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:32,633
Yes.

731
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,466
We'll get going, Ms. Song.

732
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,366
Bong Soon...

733
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,300
I heard Cho Won is at the inn.

734
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,000
Yes. She'll be going home today.

735
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:35,266
I scolded her to listen to her mom.

736
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:38,333
These are pork hocks.

737
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:39,900
It's the front hocks, your favorite.

738
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,200
Gi Dong.

739
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,433
You should be the one who listens to me.

740
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,166
If you have time to buy me
front hocks like this,

741
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:51,933
use it to sort out your marriage issue.

742
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:55,800
Yes. I'll go see her, tell her everything,
and apologize with all my heart.

743
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,633
But I wanted to apologize to you first.

744
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,233
It's unnecessary, so hurry and go.

745
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,700
Well, it'll be hard to ask for
understanding and forgiveness,

746
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,000
but if you're honest,
everything will work out for the best...

747
00:50:10,266 --> 00:50:12,533
because she's the only one
you love right now.

748
00:50:14,933 --> 00:50:16,366
Thank you, Eun Ha.

749
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:18,100
My goodness, why are your hands
trembling so much?

750
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:21,333
I took two pills to calm myself,
yet I'm still like this.

751
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,300
Maybe I should have one more.

752
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:26,000
Why are you taking those pills like candy?

753
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,566
Is it crazy of me to ask you
to hold my hand in this situation?

754
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:31,466
Seriously.

755
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:38,466
So why would you come to see me
before your wedding?

756
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:39,966
It would have been great
if we had never met again.

757
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:45,100
Anyway, I'm also sorry.

758
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,200
No, I'm even more sorry.

759
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,766
Don't mind me and Cho Won anymore...

760
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:55,600
and return to the times
when you didn't know us.

761
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:03,766
Thank you for stepping up to Cho Won
as her father.

762
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:10,133
Thank you for raising Cho Won
into such a fine lady.

763
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,066
I'll try to become
a better person as well...

764
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:14,866
Se Gyeong!

765
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,433
Se Gyeong.

766
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,433
So that's what happened.

767
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,366
This is why you ran away from the wedding.

768
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,166
And I had no idea.

769
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:37,133
So I wondered if you were
having your meals,

770
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:38,700
whether you were okay,

771
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,266
or crying somewhere.

772
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,233
I had been worried for no reason...

773
00:51:47,366 --> 00:51:48,966
and I pity myself for doing so.

774
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:51,366
No, Se Gyeong. That's not it.

775
00:51:51,366 --> 00:51:52,866
When did you start listening to us?

776
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:55,266
I've been meaning to tell you everything.

777
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:57,266
You're the only one I love...

778
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,833
Wait, Se Gyeong!

779
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:04,366
What are you doing? Hurry!

780
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:05,233
I'll get going first...

781
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:06,866
Mr. Kim!

782
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:09,300
I'm sorry.

783
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,066
I think I need to go get Se Gyeong.

784
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:14,233
I'm sorry! Se Gyeong!

785
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:20,266
Hello.

786
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,033
Se Gyeong!

787
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:25,200
Se Gyeong, don't go away like that!

788
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,766
Se Gyeong, no!

789
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:28,533
It's dangerous!

790
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:30,833
Se Gyeong, I won't chase after you,

791
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,933
so don't leave.

792
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:37,300
Se Gyeong, no!

793
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,566
No!

794
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:39,300
No!

795
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:41,966
Se Gyeong!

796
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:45,300
Se Gyeong!

797
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:52,533
- Hey.
- Mr. Kim.

798
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:53,900
- Hurry and get in.
- Se Gyeong...

799
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,366
- I said get in the car.
- Who? Me? Get in the car?

800
00:52:56,366 --> 00:52:57,766
- I said get in the car quickly.
- Okay.

801
00:52:57,766 --> 00:52:59,233
Mr. Kim, I...

802
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:04,580
Mr. Kim, where are we going?

803
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:06,100
Buckle up.

804
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:49,421
(Dog Knows Everything)

805
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:53,133
I can't believe you wrote a script
with me in mind.

806
00:53:53,702 --> 00:53:56,102
It isn't easy to produce a drama
without a popular actor.

807
00:53:56,261 --> 00:53:58,251
Lower the ages of the lead roles?

808
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:01,271
Did Su Jeong give up
on her drama because of us?

809
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,406
You know what?
Let's just produce it ourselves.

810
00:54:03,426 --> 00:54:04,503
Anything is possible.

811
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:05,612
Cut! Okay!

812
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:06,634
Soon Jae.

813
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,087
Get up.

814
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:09,570
Someone call the ambulance!

815
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,717
Your grandfather collapsed.

816
00:54:10,717 --> 00:54:11,891
- What?
- He's in critical condition.

817
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,341
Dad!

818
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:14,810
He'll be fine.

819
00:54:15,494 --> 00:54:17,586
I must go to Seoul.

820
00:54:18,312 --> 00:54:19,876
Sophie went missing?

821
00:54:20,266 --> 00:54:21,691
It's already been three days.

822
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,172
Just where did he go?

823
00:54:23,756 --> 00:54:25,576
Wait for me, Lee Soon Jae.

824
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:26,941
You must not die.

825
00:54:27,623 --> 00:54:28,540
Hang in there.

826
00:54:29,423 --> 00:54:31,423
