00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:26,666
I can't continue to be indebted to you.

4
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,733
Indebted?

5
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,066
We're friends.

6
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,000
Eat this and let's go home.

7
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,600
I also feel...

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,333
sweet and savory like these macarons.

9
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,200
Cut! Okay, good job!

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,233
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job, everyone.

11
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:58,966
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

12
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,733
Yes, Hyeon Ta. Well done.

13
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,900
Your acting has improved significantly.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,800
Thank you.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,966
- I'll get going.
- Yes. Take care.

16
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,233
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

17
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,300
Director Baek, don't you think
you're being a bit too harsh?

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,000
How can you make me stay up all night?

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,733
I'm sorry. We were on a tight schedule.

20
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,366
Why don't we have some hangover soup...

21
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:23,966
What soup? I have a dry mouth.

22
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:26,600
I better hurry to Geoje and have
a bowl of puffer fish soup.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Then... I'll see you next week.

24
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,033
My goodness, I'm exhausted.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,733
Let's see. The flight time is...

26
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,100
I still have time.

27
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,166
My goodness.

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,766
(Dog Knows Everything)

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,733
One, two, three.

30
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,100
That was nice. One more.

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,633
One, two, three.

32
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:15,800
That's great.

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Let's have the groom lean his head
toward the bride this time.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,766
Yes. One, two, three.

35
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,233
Yes, that's good.

36
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,866
Customer number 19.

37
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm serving your drinks because you didn't
respond when I yelled they're ready.

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,766
I'm sorry. We didn't hear you again.

39
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,700
- Enjoy your order.
- Yes.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,466
We better stay wide awake
when we're at a cafe,

41
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:41,900
whether it's coffee or whatever.

42
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:47,166
We might get badmouthed
for being a nuisance.

43
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,333
Why are you being so silly?

44
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:53,866
Su Jeong,

45
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,366
don't they look so beautiful?

46
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,766
That will be the first thing
in the trash can when they divorce.

47
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,966
Why does everyone put so much effort
in taking wedding pictures?

48
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,700
Don't rain on the parade!

49
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,566
As someone with experience, my advice...

50
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,833
is that one shouldn't leave
evidence of affection.

51
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,900
Of course. You must have realized...

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,333
the great truth of life
after divorcing twice.

53
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:30,266
Eun Yeong would also look
so pretty in a wedding dress.

54
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,700
Honestly speaking, your daughter
doesn't have a pretty face.

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,700
If you keep talking like that,
I'm leaving!

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,933
Okay, I'll stop.

57
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,266
How sensitive.

58
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,000
My earring!

59
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,066
My goodness.

60
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,866
What should I do?

61
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,866
What is she up to this time?

62
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:12,233
Can't you see it?

63
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,633
What should I do?

64
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,500
Myeong Ok, we can't find it.

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,733
Even if we do, we can't reach it.

66
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm so upset.

67
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,666
Excuse me.

68
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,166
You're such a beautiful groom and bride.

69
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,266
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,900
You'll only look upset
if you keep worrying about it.

71
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,733
We need to take more pictures,
so let's forget about it.

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,900
What is wrong with me?

73
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,400
The picture won't look as good
without my earrings, right?

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,633
Excuse me...

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,333
If you don't mind,
shall I lend you these earrings?

76
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,466
What do you think of these?

77
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,733
These are pretty.

78
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:57,733
Thank you.

79
00:04:58,733 --> 00:04:59,800
Here you go.

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,700
Thank you.

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,766
Try it. Go ahead.

82
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,566
It's beautiful! It looks good on you.

83
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:10,566
It looks amazing on you.

84
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,133
She's so nosy.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,800

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
(70N 6786)

88
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,033
(Gangneung Station)

89
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,133
Why am I at Gangneung Station?

90
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,366
Yes.

91
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:05,333
I understand, sir.

92
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,533
How strange.

93
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,866
Yes, I understand.

94
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,966
Wait a minute. My vehicle is black?

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,166
Yes, sir. It's been a month
since your vehicle has changed.

96
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,333
Did I ride in a black vehicle?

97
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,066
Yes. You even rode it last week...

98
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,700
I talked to Mr. Kim Cheol Seok
on the phone.

99
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,166
Did you talk with Cheol Seok?

100
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,333
Mr. Kim has your cell phone.

101
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,166
He said he'll visit your place
to pick up the luggage you asked for...

102
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:35,233
and wait for you at the airport.

103
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,566
He'll wait? He's picking up my luggage?

104
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,933
But I need my cell phone.

105
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,166
And what's on your agenda?

106
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,400
I need to pick up my actor from here...

107
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,900
and head to Cheongju.

108
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm sorry, but can I borrow some money?

109
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't have my wallet.

110
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,300
I see.

111
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,333
I'll ask Mr. Kim for reimbursement.

112
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay, thanks.

113
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:04,466
By the way, aren't you hungry?

114
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,566
The thing is I can't eat alone.

115
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:09,200
But I'm in a hurry, sir.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,133
Okay. Get going.

117
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,600
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,800
My goodness.
I didn't know my vehicle was black.

119
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,966
I can't believe this!
This is driving me crazy!

120
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,166
My gosh!

121
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,366
Can the groom smile brighter?

122
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,500
Let's raise the balloons higher.

123
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,300
Yes, that's good.

124
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,166
The bride looks amazing.

125
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,533
The groom shouldn't be preoccupied.

126
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,166
- Yes.
- Yes.

127
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,433
How nice.

128
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,600
Yes, that's great.

129
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,300
Let's take a few more.
Face each other this time.

130
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
Can you link your arms?

131
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,700
(Voice recorder)

132
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,366
The male photographer.

133
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:00,466
He was the bride's ex-lover.

134
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:04,400
The bride, who is a model,
heartlessly dumps the photographer,

135
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,966
whom she had dated for a long time,
and marries a third-generation tycoon.

136
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,366
Unable to forget his ex-lover,

137
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,266
the photographer changes his face
to disguise his identity...

138
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,566
and moves in as a neighbor
to the newlywed's house.

139
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,533
(Ok Sook)

140
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,616
It's our turn. Let's hurry.

141
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:24,866
(The most famous hijiki gimbap in Geoje)

142
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,933
Yes, Su Jeong. Where are you?

143
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,400
Where do you think I am?
I'm with the bride and groom.

144
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Are my earrings safe and sound?

145
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,333
I don't know. I can't see them from here.

146
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,833
Is that why you're calling me again?

147
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,366
It's because they're my favorite.

148
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,133
Then why did you lend it to them?

149
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,033
Hey, hang up for a second.

150
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,066
Thank you so much.

151
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,800
Thank you. It'll remain
a good memory for us forever.

152
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,533
It was a pleasure.
Congratulations on your wedding.

153
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,900
I got married twice.

154
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,000
Myeong Ok.

155
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,466
Myeong Ok, what's the matter?

156
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:41,466
It's nothing.
I just felt dizzy all of a sudden.

157
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:43,866
The lack of sleep and stress
must be getting to you.

158
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go to our car and rest.

159
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,766
Yes. The bride must be exhausted.

160
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,066
Hurry and rest.

161
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:52,466
- We can resume the shoot later.
- Yes.

162
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:54,466
Thank you.

163
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,800
Let's go.

164
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,533
Hey!

165
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,466
Who are you?

166
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,766
- What?
- Don't play innocent.

167
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,300
Why are you chasing the bride?
Are you her stalker?

168
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,233
Why are you smirking?

169
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,500
You're the bride's stalker, aren't you?

170
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,866
Let's call the police.
You're busted today.

171
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,933
You're screenwriter Ye Su Jeong, right?

172
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:32,700
I'm your fan.

173
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,300
Okay, my friends.

174
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,033
I'm still standing in line at
the hijiki gimbap store in Geoje.

175
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:54,900
The line is gradually getting shorter.

176
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,566
You're curious about how it tastes, right?

177
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:02,700
I'll deliver that taste
as vividly as possible to you.

178
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,033
I live off the power of rice!

179
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,333
I, Glutton, the elderly food show creator,

00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,366
will return shortly. See you soon.

181
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

182
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,633
Everyone is a YouTuber these days.

183
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,766
Do you think you stand a chance
with food show content?

184
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,333
Come on now. I'm good at eating, too.

185
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,733
Wait and see.

186
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,966
Three hundred thousand subscribers
and a decent profit.

187
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,333
The concept isn't too bad.

188
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,366
There are no elderly food show creators.
It's a niche market.

189
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,266
What if he dies from eating?

190
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,766
Why would you say such a thing?

191
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:40,600
We have indigestion from old age.
What if you die from eating?

192
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,433
A well-fed person looks good
even when they're dead.

193
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,833
Are you also throwing shade at me?

194
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,200
"Throwing shade?" What nonsense is that?

195
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,966
Making someone feel ashamed
and embarrassing them.

196
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,433
It's our turn.

197
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,366
(We are sorry.
We have run out of ingredients today.)

198
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:01,366
I'm sorry. We're out of ingredients,
so that's it for today.

199
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:02,666
Thank you.

200
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,333
What?

201
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,200
We've been waiting for hours.

202
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,700
This is driving me crazy.

203
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,633
Just how many times has this been?

204
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:14,700
Why can't I eat it? Why?

205
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,400
Let's just go home and have
homemade gimbap instead.

206
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,966
I'll make them for you.

207
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:19,966
Yes.

208
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,366
My friends.

209
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:28,466
Today, I'll show you
a homemade gimbap food show.

210
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:31,233
I'll see you in a bit.

211
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:36,533
(Park Oe Su)

212
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,366
"Webcomic," "Restaurant of Death..."

213
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,400
That's intense.

214
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:48,266
So you're a famous webcomic artist.

215
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,700
But it's been a long time
since I last worked on a drama.

216
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,233
Young people don't know me these days.

217
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,266
So how did you recognize me?

218
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:56,166
I'm a fan of old dramas.

219
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:59,700
I'm a big fan of your drama,

220
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,733
"Theater Detective."

221
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I've read all of your interviews...

222
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,866
and watched all of your shows.

223
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:07,400
You know everything about me.

224
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:10,533
Thank you.

225
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,800
But why were you chasing after me
like a stalker?

226
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,766
Well, I wanted to ask you for a favor.

227
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,933
But I hesitated because
I didn't have the courage...

228
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,633
and I ended up getting caught by you.

229
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,933
A favor to ask me?

230
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,066
What could it be?

231
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,733
Sophie, house.

232
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:44,133
(Sophie's House)

233
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,566
My goodness, Sophie.

234
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:49,800
Stop wandering around
and please stay home.

235
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,900
Owners with female dogs asked me
to keep my eyes on you.

236
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,933
They said you're all over the place.

237
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,733
Being cute isn't everything.

238
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,666
Give the girls a break, okay?

239
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,800
Come on, I'm still a young lad
full of energy.

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,366
Was the precinct safe and sound overnight?

241
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,966
There was a drunk man and a stalker.

242
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:26,000
Drunk men are a given, but it's been
a while since you had a stalker.

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,366
He was a man in his 30s
who followed a woman from Seoul.

244
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,833
She filed a report and we arrested him
and sent him to the police station.

245
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,000
They worked in the same company
and the man hit on her,

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,066
but the woman didn't budge.

247
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:40,866
The woman moved jobs and ran far away,

248
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:43,600
but he kept obsessing
and stalking her, right?

249
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,633
How did you know? You're spot on.

250
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,333
Hey, stalking must be punished heavily.

251
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,000
It's a serious crime.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,133
Mom, what's wrong with men?

253
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:01,066
All they do is hit on women
and they're selfish and irresponsible.

254
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,833
Was Dad like that, too?

255
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,933
Why are you suddenly
talking about your dad?

256
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm just curious.

257
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,533
I'm curious about what Dad looks like.

258
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,733
Do sperms have a face?

259
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,233
Come on!

260
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,533
I always told you...

261
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:25,233
that your dad is a high-quality sperm.

262
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:28,700
Yes, I know. I understand.

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,333
Mr. Park! You're back?

264
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,066
Did you finish planning your piece?

265
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,566
Yes.

266
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,733
I'm a big fan of yours.

267
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,433
I've read all of your webcomics.

268
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,700
I see. Thank you.

269
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,566
Shall I clean your room?

270
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:56,800
No, it's okay.

271
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,333
Please don't clean my room
even if I'm away.

272
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,600
Manager Lee!

273
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,400
Yes, sir!

274
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,266
Your monthly wage.

275
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,933
Yes, thank you.

276
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,966
Why aren't you opening a bank account?

277
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:21,533
It's such a nuisance
to go and withdraw cash.

278
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,466
- Hurry and open a bank account.
- Yes, sir.

279
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:24,566
You worked hard this month.

280
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,500
Thank you.

281
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:40,200
(Carrot World)

282
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,500
(Selling a 256GB Nintendo Switch)

283
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,366
It's 230 dollars.

284
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:50,933
(Reserve)

285
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,266
I might as well.

286
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,033
(Reservation confirmed)

287
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,466
(Your reservation has been confirmed.)

288
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,766
"Reservation confirmed."

289
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,566
Okay.

290
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:10,833
Wait a second.

291
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,733
We have sausages for gimbap,
eggs, pickled radish,

292
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,000
and carrots, too.

293
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,333
But what's taking Soon Jae so long
to buy just the laver?

294
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,266
My goodness.

295
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:25,233
Darn it.

296
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:44,800
Carrot?

297
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:48,733
What?

298
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,100
Carrot?

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,533
Yes, it's carrot.

300
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,666
Yes, I'm the...

301
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,300
Dad!

302
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,300
Excuse me...

303
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,566
That crazy lad.

304
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,300
What a crazy...

305
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,166
Chae Moo, I bought the laver. Let's go.

306
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,833
Soon Jae, I better go
and buy the carrots again.

307
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,100
Where are the carrots?

308
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,666
I sold them.

309
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,333
Wait right here. I'll be back in no time.

310
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:26,233
What a gawky guy.

311
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,633
My goodness.

312
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:45,766
Newspaper?

313
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,066
A carrot?

314
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,533
Carrot?

315
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,366
Carrot...

316
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,600
Darn it!

317
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:19,466
My 230 dollars!

318
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,066
My 230 dollars!

319
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,433
Chop the carrots.

320
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,700
The more carrots that go in,
the better it tastes.

321
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,800
Cook the eggs in a pan.

322
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,166
Stir-fry the ham,

323
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,400
the crab sticks, and the vegetables.

324
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
Stir-fry them until they're tasty.

325
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,000
Spread the rice out on the laver.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,766
Add a hearty amount of ingredients
and roll them nicely.

327
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,200
Here you go.

328
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,900
Okay.

329
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,200
Now I should film myself eating it.

330
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:09,666
I better prepare the beverage.

331
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,366
Okay.

332
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,566
It's good.

333
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,566
It's good, isn't it?

334
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,566
What's wrong with all of you?

335
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,833
I'm asking you to help me because
I need to film my YouTube video.

336
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,866
Because it tasted so good.

337
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:46,366
- You should try one, too.
- Forget it.

338
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:48,400
- Try it.
- What's wrong with you?

339
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,266
It tastes really good.

340
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,233
It does, right?

341
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,166
It must be good because
it has a lot of carrots in it.

342
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,833
Should we sell these?
Should we start a business?

343
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,766
When home-cooked meals taste good,
people say it tastes like restaurant food.

344
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,833
When restaurant food tastes good,
people say it's like a home-cooked meal.

345
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,366
Which opinion should we follow?

346
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,800
Why are you getting grumpy
all of a sudden?

347
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,133
You're so hard to adjust to.

348
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,166
It's because he's old.

349
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,133
By the way, Su Jeong,

350
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:21,700
didn't that webcomic artist want to make
your drama into a webcomic?

351
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,366
- Really?
- Yes.

352
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,600
If he's a webcomic artist,
he must be young.

353
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,533
I wonder how such a young lad
recognized me.

354
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,966
He was so commendable and adorable
that I decided to proceed with it.

355
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,300
When is it starting?

356
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,800
I already sent him a script
from "Theater Detective."

357
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,900
Do you remember
the "Bizarre Gift" episode?

358
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,666
Kim Yong Gun wore a red ribbon
on his head.

359
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,766
He died in a large gift box
with his head cracked open.

360
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:44,933
That's right!

361
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:48,400
I had so much fun dressing Yong Gun up...

362
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,800
to look like he was axed in the head.

363
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,866
That's right.
You had dressed him up so realistically...

364
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:57,166
that I got scared shining the light on him
and couldn't go to the bathroom alone.

365
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,533
Yes. You even passed out.

366
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,200
So our shoot was suspended.

367
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,933
Yes, that's right!
That's what happened back then.

368
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,666
My goodness.

369
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:13,000
But what's taking Yong Gun so long?
It's already nighttime.

370
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,400
He took the morning flight, didn't he?

371
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,466
You're right. He didn't even call us.

372
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:17,700
Should I call him?

373
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,100
Leave him alone.
He might be seeing a woman.

374
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,433
I saw him carrying the thing.

375
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:25,000
I caught a glimpse of a Viagra.

Hey, Cheol Seok!

379
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,266
Where have you been?

380
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,433
And where has your mind been?

381
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,200
What? My mind?

382
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,733
You have such audacity to talk like that.

383
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,900
I said I'd wait for you at the airport.

384
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,266
What airport?

385
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,866
You said you would come
if I wait for you here!

386
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,133
Mr. Kim, I told you countless times
not to selectively listen as you please!

387
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:05,200
I said I'd go to your house, take your
belongings, and wait at the airport.

388
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
I waited for you at Gimpo Airport all day!

389
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:10,466
Did you?

390
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,366
And if you don't know my number,

391
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:15,066
you should have called your phone.
Then I would have answered it!

392
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,966
You're right.

393
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:19,366
I can't take this anymore.

394
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:23,266
I always take the blame for your mistakes!

395
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:27,233
Our managers said they didn't want to deal
with you, so I stepped up as the CEO!

396
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,933
But now, I quit.

397
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,866
I'll officially end it for good.

404
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,433
I can't believe this.

Yes, a composite of the criminal.

410
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:38,400
If Mr. Park draws a composite portrait
for me, I can search the market...

411
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,500
and find that carrot crook!

412
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,366
Yes, that's a great idea!

And a blow from a weapon on the back
of his head led him to his death.

the composite portrait when he's dead?

00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:13,233
The thing is we receive large firewood...

538
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:15,433
and chop them into small pieces...

539
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,933
for guests to use for their campfires.

540
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:19,333
I see.

541
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,800
What's this?
Why is she loitering around again?

542
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,300
Enough with the salute.

543
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,066
What brings a precinct officer
to the petty homicide squad?

544
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:39,466
I caught a thief stealing
100 boxes of carrots...

545
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:42,566
on a carrot field while I was on patrol.

546
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:44,033
And I was on my way to bring him
to the police station just now.

547
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,433
Carrot? Darn it.

548
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,000
I see.

549
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:55,233
It really is a bizarre site.

550
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,300
What was the tool used in the crime?

551
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:58,066
Mr. Lee Gi Dong?

552
00:32:58,066 --> 00:32:59,866
Yes.

553
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:02,333
You may go home now.

554
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,533
I appreciate your cooperation.

555
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,533
And on the occasion of leaving Geoje,

556
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,266
don't forget to inform me about it.

557
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,300
But I'm not the culprit...

558
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,000
Please inform me when you do.

559
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,500
- Okay.
- Yes.

560
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,033
Then good luck.

561
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,100
Hey!

562
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,333
Do you think I'm joking around?

563
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:29,333
I told you not to get involved in our
business. Why are you asking questions?

564
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,466
Are you going to start investigating
once you know the tool for the crime?

565
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,133
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:35,666
I can't help it when there's a crime.

567
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:39,266
If I catch you loitering around again,

568
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:42,533
I'll show you how angry I'll get.
Do you understand?

569
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,966
Yes, sir.

570
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,100
Get out of here.

571
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,200
Yes, sir.

572

(Yeondeok Police Station)

573
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:05,033
For a detective, he's awfully arrogant.

574
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:07,033
My goodness!

575
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,966
I'm sorry. Did I startle you?

576
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,666
I'm okay.

577
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,366
You filed the report
on the homicide case at the inn, right?

578
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:15,966
Yes.

579
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:20,400
But is there anything I can do for you?

580
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,300
- The tool for the crime.
- Pardon?

581
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:25,166
The tool used in the crime was a hatchet.

582
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,166
A hatchet?

583
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,100
(Hong Cho Won)

584
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,600
"Hong Cho Won."

585
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:42,066
Why are you trying to look
at someone else's cell phone?

586
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:45,433
That man was secretly taking photos
of you. Didn't you notice?

587
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:46,933
The photo guy at the cafe.

588
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,633
No.

589
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:50,833
The perverted stalker!

590
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,233
If I spot you again,

591
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:54,533
- I'll arrest you immediately!
- Darn it, that wasn't it.

592
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,666
The drama also featured a hatchet?

593
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,333
It really is just like
the script you wrote.

594
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,600
I shouldn't have gotten involved.

595
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,200
How did such a thing happen?

596
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,933
It's not your fault.

597
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:13,966
Don't think of it like that.

598
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:17,166
The culprit better get caught quickly
to find out what happened.

599
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,500
We'll catch the culprit
as soon as possible...

600
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,900
and resolve all of your questions.

601
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:33,333
I went to your inn last night
and you weren't there.

602
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,133
Where were you at that hour?

603
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,000
Could it be?

604
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,166
Did you go to the Rose Bridge
with another guy?

605
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:44,500
My goodness, why are you
barking so loudly?

606
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,400
Jin Sun, let's go. Hurry up.

607
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,433
Please stop this woman.

608
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,700
I still have things to talk about
with Jin Sun.

609
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,700
Hello.

610
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,600
My goodness, aren't you Lee Soon Jae?

611
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,433
Yes.

612
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:01,366
If you don't mind,
shall I take a picture for you?

613
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:02,866
A picture?

614
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:04,933
No thank you.

615
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:06,700
Good day.

616
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,466
Jin Sun, let's go.

617
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:12,666
I'm sorry.

618
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:15,466
But is there something between you
and that little dog?

619
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:18,600
That dog came to live in Geoje
for a month.

620
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,066
And she's lying only a day
after she started dating me.

621
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,200
She better not have gone to
the Rose Bridge with another dog.

622
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,100
Rose Bridge? Where's that?

623
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,033
It's a sneaky area somewhere off there.

624
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,433
I'm too embarrassed
to explain any further.

625
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,200
This is funny.

626
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:42,900
We won't have customers once the rumor
spreads that a murder broke out here.

627
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,333
Why is he asking me to chop firewood?

628
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,866
Seriously...

629
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,533
Is it because it's new?

630
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:55,066
I better sharpen the blade.

He's making me speechless.

640
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:33,633
My friends, you probably think
old people can't eat spicy stuff, right?

641

That's not true.

of eating spicy foods.

First, the broth is savory
and the flavor is very deep.

680
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,533
The noodles are great, too.
They've been boiled very well.

for our toothless friends.

While having the noodles,

683

I'll also try the boiled pork.

684
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,266
It's moist and very juicy.

685
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,200

716
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,566
She's pretty because
she takes after your looks.

717
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:02,933
And she's tall and adorable
because she takes after me, right?

718
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:05,133
You listen to me carefully.

719
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:09,033
If you loiter around me and Cho Won again,

720
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:12,133
I'll cut off all of your limbs.

721
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:21,066
But still, I'm Cho Won's dad.
How can you be so harsh?

722
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:28,233
I ought to just rip your mouth apart.

723
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,600
Hurry and beat it!

724
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,966
Beat it! I said beat it!

725
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:33,000
- Wait...
- I said beat it!

726
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,700
- My sunglasses...
- Take it!

727
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:40,133
Hey, you're the perverted stalker.

728
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:42,000
How dare you fearlessly
come all the way here?

729
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,100
No, Cho Won!

730
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,200
Mom, I have to catch that stalker
chasing after me.

731
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,433
No! He's not a stalker.

732
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,533
Do you know him?

733
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:52,166
Yes.

734
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,233
I mean, no.

735
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:57,666
He doesn't look like a stalker.

736
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:00,733
Mom, you can't just tell
from someone's looks.

737
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:04,600
Anyway, you're the perfect target
for swindlers, Mom.

738
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,566
I almost caught him this time.

739
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,100
Weren't you on your way to work?
You're late.

740
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,600
- Fine. I'll go.
- Hurry and go.

741
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,666
Run!

742
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:24,533
(Twenty two years ago)

743
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:26,733
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

744
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,500
- Young man.
- Yes?

745
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:34,466
I'll return tomorrow
to pay for the shortage.

746
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,666
There's a whole basket of guys like you.

747
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:37,800
Call your parents.

748
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,300
I'd rather go to the police station...

749
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,733
than call my father.

750
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,900
I'll pay for him.

751
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,133
Deduct it from my hourly wage.

752
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:47,500
Why would you pay for me?

753
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,600
From what I've seen, it seems to be
your birthday today. It's a birthday gift.

754
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,500
Thank you.

755
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,900
I'll come to pay you back tomorrow.

756
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,400
Happy birthday.

757
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:00,966
- Enjoy.
- Excuse me.

758
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:01,900
Yes?

759
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,200
Yes, sir.

760
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,866
- Please wipe this down for us.
- Okay.

761
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:11,966
Republic of Korea!

762
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:13,466
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam

763
00:45:13,466 --> 00:45:14,800
Republic of Korea!

764
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,666
Just one goal, please!

765
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:17,566
Kick it! Shoot it!

766
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,566
He scored!

767
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:23,833
Leave soccer to Ahn Jung Hwan!

768
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:46,666
I finally passed the auditions!

769
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,800
Check out my face on TV from now on!

770
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:52,933
What?

771
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:55,133
Why would I start taking care
of my private life already?

772
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,800
Eun Ha?

773
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:58,866
What are you talking about?

774
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:00,700
There's nothing between me and Eun Ha.

775
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,033
She isn't my girlfriend.

776
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:03,866
Seriously.

777
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:08,133
Not yet.

778
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,900
I'm going to ask her out today.

779
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,266
Hey, hang up. I'll call you back later.

780
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Eun Ha!

781
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,900
Eun Ha!

782
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,933
Didn't you see me?

783
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,533
Congratulations on passing
the auditions, Gi Dong.

784
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:21,733
Thank you.

785
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:25,533
I have something to tell you today.

786
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,300
Good for you, Gi Dong. Congratulations.

787
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,366
But my boyfriend is waiting for me,
so I better go.

788
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:33,633
What?

789
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:37,233
Did you have a boyfriend?

790
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,133
Of course.

791
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:43,033
Did you think I'd date you
after sleeping with you once?

792
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,466
You're so cute.

793
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,933
I hope you become a famous actor
and make lots of money.

794
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,900
And don't leave tabs at the bar
from now on.

795
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:53,466
I'm leaving.

796
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,333
Here are your two pints of beer.

797
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,800
Thank you.

798
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,766
Excuse me.

799
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,766
Lee Gi Dong, that man...

800
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:34,400
He was so excited and caused a fuss
as if he were going to become a star.

801
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,633
But why is he loitering around
before my eyes, after all these years?

802
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:40,900
Seriously!

803
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:57,600
Hey, it's that crook.

804
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,566
I'm sorry.

805
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:09,200
I didn't know you meant Carrot World
when you said "Carrot."

806
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,733
Whatever.

807
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:11,966
Give me my 230 dollars back.

808
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:14,700
I should return it to you.

809
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,733
But I don't have it with me right now.
It's at home.

810
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:20,300
So can I give it to you next time?

811
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,766
We can go to your place together...

812
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:24,366
if you have the money at home.

813
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:25,700
You don't trust me?

814
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,200
How could I trust you?

815
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,066
I can't believe he's following me
to my place.

816
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,100
What a rude young lad.

817
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,466
Doesn't he even have parents?

818
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,366
Soon Jae?

819
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,366
Where are you going, Soon Jae?

820
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:50,300
Soon Jae!

821
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,366
Seriously.

822
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:55,100
Has he gone deaf with old age?

823
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:00,033
Where did he go?

824
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,100
Dad has grown so old.

825
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:25,033
What's the matter, Officer Hong?

826
00:49:25,033 --> 00:49:27,833
Sir, about the hatchet homicide case...

827
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:31,266
I came because the culprit apparently
surrendered to the police just now.

828
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:32,566
The culprit surrendered?

829
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,400
Who's the culprit?

830
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,700
But before that,
I want to ask you something.

831
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,733
Okay.

832
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:42,400
Who was the culprit in the drama
"Bizarre Gift?"

833
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:48,300
I'm the culprit.

834
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:51,166
I killed him.

835
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,133
I'm the late webcomic artist
Park Oe Su's...

836
00:49:57,133 --> 00:50:00,200
ex-girlfriend.

837
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:03,800
The culprit...

838
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,066
was the deceased victim's ex-girlfriend.

839
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,400
The actual culprit...

840
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,633
is exactly the same as the script
for "Bizarre Gift."

841
00:50:58,373 --> 00:51:01,399
(Dog Knows Everything)

842
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:05,391
How did the bride commit
such a horrendous crime?

843
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:06,568
Why did you kill him?

844
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:08,496
Because he said
he'd stop me from getting married.

845
00:51:09,037 --> 00:51:10,919
We're thinking of throwing
Yong Gun a congratulatory party.

846
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,929
He's jealous because
Yong Gun is successful.

847
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:17,382
How can you starve on your birthday?

848
00:51:17,382 --> 00:51:19,425
Stop crossing the line, you mutt!

849
00:51:19,605 --> 00:51:21,194
It's a relief to see that Eun Ha
is doing well.

850
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,015
Then the culprit must be a man.

851
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:24,172
Are you the accomplice?

852
00:51:24,172 --> 00:51:25,817
The groom turned himself in.

853
00:51:25,985 --> 00:51:27,679
And the bride had made a false confession.

854
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:30,361
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for me.

855
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:33,140
The investigation is at a standstill
because they couldn't find the hatchet.

856
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:37,701
Apparently, some man threw the hatchet
from the Rose Bridge that night.

857
00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:40,584
There might be a third person involved.

858
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,869
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
