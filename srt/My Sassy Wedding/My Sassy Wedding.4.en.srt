1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,880
What I said

2
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,200
wasn't to criticize Madam,

3
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,040
but honestly, I think Lady Yeesoon

4
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,600
is more suited to Khun Aek than Madam is.

5
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm impressed.

6
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,520
Any updates on the gun deal?

7
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,080
The company has replied.

8
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,240
They're sending
a representative to negotiate.

9
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,120
But it's just about buying guns.
Why so much reading?

10
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Because I need to understand every angle.

11
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,800
It's important to know your counterparts.

12
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,560
Aek understands all of this.

13
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,880
He even studies the personalities
and politics of foreign nations.

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,360
If we compare price and quality
based on your prior research,

15
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
it's quite a compelling deal.

16
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,360
And he's offering enough guns
to meet our needs.

17
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,680
Then does that mean you approve
of the purchase, Khun Pra Saming?

18
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,120
Ouch!

19
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,320
Hey.

20
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Stop!

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,920
I'll go check it out myself.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,520
You and Mr. Chadwick, please wait here.

23
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,640
Sergeant Boonchai, guard the area.

24
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Yes, Sir.

25
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,760
Damn these shoes…

26
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
- Oh? Kamduang?
- Ping.

27
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,800
Did you see anyone
dressed strangely running around here?

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
No, I didn't.

29
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,520
What are you doing here anyway?

30
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
What did you say again?

31
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,760
I asked what you're doing here.

32
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,440
Oh… I came to deliver hoes and shovels
the town office ordered.

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,960
You sell metal too?

34
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Yes.

35
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
I have to go now.

36
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,160
By the time I reached the courtyard,
the culprit was gone.

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,720
We already checked the area
but found nothing.

38
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,080
So you're saying I'm lying, then?

39
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880
To be honest, I had my doubts

40
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,040
since you claimed to
have thrown a rock at them.

41
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,120
Why? You think I can't fight?

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,480
I've trained in boxing.

43
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
Boxing?

44
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,600
That laugh means you don't believe me.

45
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
Khun Pra Saming!

46
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,640
What if I don't believe you?

47
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,520
You're a lady from Phra Nakhon.
A refined woman

48
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,280
shouldn't know anything about fighting.

49
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,800
Today's incident startled Mr. Chadwick.

50
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,480
And it has damaged
Thung Yai City's reputation.

51
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
- I'll go talk to--
- No need.

52
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,160
Both of you may leave.

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,320
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

54
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
Oh, Ping.

55
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,880
Long time no see. How have you been?

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
She's not answering…

57
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,640
Are you alright?

58
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,680
Pardon?

59
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,760
I asked if you're alright.

60
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,960
I'm fine.

61
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,160
Excuse me.

62
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
You don't believe me either, do you?

63
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,960
I believe you.

64
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
But for Khun Pra Saming
to believe you too,

65
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
I'd have to say you're a buffalo trader.

66
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,000
So I'm a liar now.

67
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,440
That's the smaller problem.

68
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,600
The real one is you've made
Khun Pra Saming suspicious of you,

69
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
and of me too.

70
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Then why do you believe me?

71
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,640
There's no proof.

72
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,440
Because you're a woman of your word.

73
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,000
And your story

74
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,080
also makes sense.

75
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,840
It's true! The culprit
climbed the balcony, eavesdropped,

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,680
fought like a pro, and disappeared.

77
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,240
The bad guy you were talking about

78
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
could very well be pirates.

79
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,960
Huh?

80
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,680
Pirates? Like, ship-plundering pirates?

81
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,920
And how do they know these skills?

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,600
There are many groups of pirates
in many places.

83
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,240
They travel from Siam
to the Eastern countries.

84
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,520
They pick up all sorts of skills.

85
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,559
What are you doing?

86
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,200
You said the culprit hit you here, right?

87
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,640
Yes.

88
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll tell Yip to bring medicine.

89
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,040
No need. I've got my own balm.

90
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,720
That's the one
you used on me the other day?

91
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,720
You remember?

92
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,040
What are you doing?

93
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm applying the balm for you.

94
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,080
What?

95
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
You can't do that.

96
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,360
Why?

97
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,800
You can reach back there yourself?

98
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,160
Almost.

99
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,760
You can't.

100
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,760
I'll do it.

101
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,640
Don't worry.

102
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,720
Give it to me.

103
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,840
This way,
I won't have to touch you directly.

104
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,320
You could've ignored everything

105
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,120
and walked away.

106
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,600
But instead,
you risked yourself to uncover the truth.

107
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,520
That's brave

108
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,920
and noble.

109
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,920
THRIVING AND PROSPEROUS BUSINESS

110
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,080
Did you hear anything useful?

111
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,800
They were talking
about buying guns from foreigners.

112
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,600
And?

113
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,680
That's all I got. Kamduang found me first.

114
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,880
You did well.

115
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,040
Don't worry. You'll be fine soon.

116
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,640
Thank you.

117
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,040
Yip.

118
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,760
Yes, Madam?

119
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,200
There's something I've been wondering,
but I don't know who to ask.

120
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,320
Please answer me frankly.

121
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,600
Oh, Madam, you don't have to be so polite.

122
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,120
You can ask me anything.

123
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,560
Who exactly is Yeesoon?

124
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,720
About that…

125
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,280
As a servant, I really can't say it.

126
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,760
That's alright. I understand.

127
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,680
But in another capacity, I can speak.

128
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,200
What do you mean?

129
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,040
As a fellow woman.

130
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,480
I have to tell you.

131
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,960
Khun Aek and Lady Yeesoon
used to be in a relationship.

132
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,080
It started two years ago.
The elders introduced them.

133
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,240
So, Aek, what did you think?

134
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
You're so quiet.

135
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,080
Was her playing beautiful or not?
Tell her yourself.

136
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm quiet

137
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,120
because I was thinking of the right words.

138
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,640
Her playing

139
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
was so beautiful,
I was at a loss for words.

140
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,080
Are you feeling morning sickness, Madam?

141
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,000
Sorry, it hit me all of a sudden.

142
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,360
It's fine. Shall I continue the story?

143
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,440
What was the name

144
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,120
of the song you played?

145
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,720
What's wrong, Yeesoon?

146
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,400
Answer him, dear.

147
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,640
Yes.

148
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,120
It's called "Bulan Loy Luean."

149
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Oh, Nam-ob,

150
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,840
didn't you say
you wanted some beautiful orchids?

151
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
- Yes, I did.
- Let me take you to see them.

152
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,040
Sure.

153
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,480
Stay and keep Khun Aek company, Yeesoon.

154
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,880
I'll be right back.

155
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,320
Yes, Mother.

156
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,280
Aek, take good care of her.

157
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Yes, Father.

158
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,320
- Yip.
- Yes, Sir?

159
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,680
Pour some tea for Yeesoon.

160
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes, Sir.

161
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,240
Why did Khun Pra leave you there
as a third wheel?

162
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,840
I was there to play watchdog, ma'am.

163
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
If they were alone, it'd cause gossip.

164
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Weren't they embarrassed in front of you?

165
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,520
They treated me
like a stool or a chamber pot,

166
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,440
invisible.

167
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,040
Do you know how to play the Khim?

168
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
No, I don't.

169
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,720
It looks quite difficult.

170
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,880
It's not that difficult.

171
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,000
If you really try,

172
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,440
I'm sure you'd be great.

173
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
I don't have a teacher.

174
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
I could teach you.

175
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,599
How do I start?

176
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,920
Khun Aek secretly inhaled her scent.

177
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,360
He looked so pleased.

178
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
She liked him too.

179
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,720
From then on, they were a couple,

180
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,960
seeing each other more often.

181
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,120
So why did they break up?

182
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm not sure, ma'am. I wasn't there.

183
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,600
- Oh?
- They broke up in the garden.

184
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,960
Juan was nearby picking chilies.

185
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,280
She said

186
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,120
Khun Aek dumped Lady Yeesoon.

187
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Huh?

188
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,320
Shortly after they broke up,

189
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,800
Lady Yeesoon got in a relationship
with Khun Pra Saming.

190
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,520
You didn't know that?

191
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,880
Yeesoon is my only child.

192
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,240
Even though I introduced you to her,

193
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,800
as her mother,

194
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
I want her to have the best.

195
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,760
You understand, don't you?

196
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm not sure, ma'am.

197
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,160
You have a Khun.

198
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,080
Your father is a Khun Pra.
You have land and wealth…

199
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,280
But not as much as Khun Pra Saming,

200
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,280
the governor's son.

201
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,720
If you truly love Yeesoon,

202
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,800
you should let her go.

203
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,520
Let her be with someone more deserving.

204
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,560
Don't you agree?

205
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,000
Here, I've got it.

206
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,920
ON SALE

207
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,040
Yip.

208
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,560
Alright.

209
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh.

210
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh, it's you.

211
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,440
Look how eager you are.

212
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,560
No one's stealing
that discount fabric from you,

213
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,680
Kamduang, wife of Khun Aek Itthirit.

214
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,280
It's not.

215
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,040
Not the discount fabric?

216
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,040
It's not your business.

217
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
I'm just looking for a bedsheet.

218
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,120
I'll need to sew the corners in too.

219
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,520
I heard that in Phra Nakhon,

220
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
they have foreign bedsheets

221
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,360
with the corners already sewn in.

222
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,040
Right?

223
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,520
Hmm, yes.

224
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
They said they've got flowers,

225
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,240
are easy to get on the bed,
and not too pricey.

226
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,000
I mean the fabric.
Don't get the wrong idea.

227
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,080
What wrong idea?

228
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm just afraid

229
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,640
you thought I was talking about you.

230
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,720
And it's got plenty of edges,
all neatly tucked away.

231
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,120
I mean the fabric edges, of course.

232
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,880
If you've got something to say,
then say it straight, Yeesoon.

233
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,760
I'm not good at this kind of talk.

234
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,200
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

235
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
You're always mocking me.

236
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,640
Oh… or maybe you still like Khun Aek?

237
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,240
Even though he dumped you.

238
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,360
HOK AN MEDICINE

239
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
That was great, Madam.

240
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,760
I'll take this one.

241
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,080
I made this for you, Khun Pra Saming.

242
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,720
PRA SAMING

243
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,040
Thank you, Yeesoon.

244
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,880
You're welcome.

245
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
Coincidentally,

246
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,800
I brought something for you too.

247
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,680
Open it.

248
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,560
Alright.

249
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,640
It's beautiful.

250
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,760
It's gorgeous. And expensive.

251
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,480
I think Khun Pra Saming
has feelings for you.

252
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,320
You can tell from a gift?

253
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,720
I think he loves you.

254
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,280
He's just polite.

255
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,280
He's respectful.

256
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,200
We got together

257
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,280
because of our families' arrangement,
didn't we?

258
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
Don't be difficult.

259
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
One day, when you're my age,

260
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,240
you'll realize

261
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,720
what you think matters now, doesn't.

262
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,360
And what I say matters, really does.

263
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,080
The future.

264
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
Status. Power.

265
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,000
Exactly.

266
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,520
But Khun Aek has all of that too.

267
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Maybe,

268
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,880
but not as much. And it's not secure.

269
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,320
We agreed

270
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
not to talk about him anymore, didn't we?

271
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,200
We've made this decision.

272
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,400
You made the decision alone.

273
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,520
Yeesoon!

274
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
I'm sorry.

275
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,760
Trust me.

276
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,680
Everything I do

277
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,480
is because I love you.

278
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,720
Truly exquisite.

279
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,480
Just as rivers full of water
flow into the ocean,

280
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,680
so too does the merit given here

281
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,880
reach the departed…

282
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,760
Selling buffaloes
means separating mother from calf.

283
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,880
Sometimes they die along the way.

284
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,160
Being a buffalo trader
is a sinful profession, isn't it?

285
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,720
Every time I finish delivering buffaloes,
I always come to make merit.

286
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,160
Thank you for coming with me.

287
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,160
It's no trouble at all.
Making merit brings peace of mind.

288
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,560
I feel good.

289
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,840
It's not a burden at all.

290
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,160
Are you here to make merit, Khun Aek?

291
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,920
Kamduang wanted to make merit,

292
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,240
so I brought her.

293
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,960
I came to pray for blessings

294
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,080
for our family to be happy,

295
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,240
loving, and full of joy forever.

296
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,760
That's lovely.

297
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,080
And you two?

298
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,840
I just came for
the usual chat with the monk.

299
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,280
But Yeesoon wanted to come today,

300
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,840
so I brought her along.

301
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
PRA SAMING

302
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,760
PRA SAMING

303
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
Let's go, dear.

304
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,920
I want you to look at
those golden dendrobium over there.

305
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,600
They're beautiful.

306
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,720
I want more of them.

307
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,720
They suit your house best,

308
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,760
more than any other flowers.

309
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,040
Let's go.

310
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,880
If you'll excuse me.

311
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Of course.

312
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,000
Are you still thinking about her?

313
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,160
I know who you're talking about.

314
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,360
But I don't see why it matters to you.

315
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,680
Because you're my husband.

316
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,080
Do I need to remind you?

317
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,760
This whole marriage is a lie we made up

318
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,120
for others to believe.

319
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,480
Still, any wife would care
about her husband's old flame.

320
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,000
Otherwise, no one would buy our act.

321
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Fair enough.

322
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,640
What do you want to know? Just ask.

323
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,480
I can tell you still care about Yeesoon.

324
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,360
But you're the one
who ended things with her.

325
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
Why?

326
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,440
You're keeping a spirit medium?

327
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,840
How do you know all this?

328
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,880
Just answer me.

329
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,920
Sometimes, the one who ends a relationship

330
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,040
isn't the one whose feelings changed.

331
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,040
So…

332
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,640
do you want to forget her?

333
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,760
Yes.

334
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,560
More than anything.

335
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,440
KHUN AEK

336
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,520
It looks like something important to him.

337
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,280
If you want to forget,

338
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,080
I don't need to return it.

339
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,720
Hey! Get up! Time to eat!

340
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,320
Time to eat.

341
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,040
Thank you, sir, for helping me.

342
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,560
It's alright.

343
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,640
But did you lie to me?

344
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,120
Kamduang punched you out cold?

345
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,440
It's true, sir.

346
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,320
I just didn't tell anyone. Getting
knocked out by a woman is embarrassing.

347
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,720
And me telling you to kidnap her,

348
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,720
did you tell anyone?

349
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,040
Definitely not, sir. I wouldn't dare.

350
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,600
You can trust me.
Even if I die, I'll never talk.

351
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,680
Good.

352
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,880
Wow.

353
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,200
I've got a new job for you.

354
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,600
Are you going to do it?

355
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,200
Of course, sir. With a payment this good,

356
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,800
I wouldn't say no.

357
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,080
Do you want me to go after Kamduang again?

358
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,240
I'll plan it right this time.

359
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
No need.

360
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,440
I've got something else for you.

361
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,320
What's this, sir?

362
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,080
A map of Mr. Chadwick's residence.

363
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,360
And what do you want me to do?

364
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,000
Ohm… unlock.

365
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,800
Hey.

366
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,920
Whoa.

367
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,000
Watch it! You'll fall.

368
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,880
See? I told you!

369
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,360
What did you find, Sergeant Boonchai?

370
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
They used a lock-picking technique

371
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,120
used by a certain group of thieves.

372
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
Any idea

373
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,240
who's skilled in that?

374
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,080
There are a few who are,

375
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,920
but the one I suspect most is Thong,

376
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,600
the prisoner who just escaped.

377
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,760
Track him down.

378
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,240
This house is royal property
we've allowed Mr. Chadwick to stay in.

379
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,200
No petty thief would dare touch it.

380
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,000
I want him alive.

381
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,240
I must know what he was after,

382
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,720
and more importantly,

383
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,000
who's behind this.

384
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,800
Understood, Sir.

385
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,960
No valuables were taken,

386
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,520
but documents belonging
to Mr. Chadwick are missing.

387
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,680
What kind of documents?

388
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,320
He said some important,

389
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,440
some worthless.

390
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,560
So the thief just tore pages randomly?

391
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,320
I never said anything was torn.

392
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,400
How did you know?

393
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,000
If only parts were missing,

394
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,960
they must've been torn
from a notebook, right?

395
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
Permission to report, Sir.

396
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,920
We've found Thong.

397
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,640
Bring him in.

398
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,400
I'll question him myself.

399
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
He's dead, Sir.

400
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,200
He had Khun Aek's
perfumed sachet in his hand.

401
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,800
I've got business. Wait here.

402
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,960
Yes, Sir.

403
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,440
We tracked Thong here

404
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,640
and found this.

405
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,880
He was holding it when he died,

406
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,000
not planted afterward.

407
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,040
Anything else?

408
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,440
Not yet, Sir.

409
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,800
KHUN AEK

410
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,120
This perfumed sachet

411
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,760
belonged to Khun Aek Itthirit.

412
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,160
Is this your perfumed sachet?

413
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,520
KHUN AEK

414
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,920
Yes.

415
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,320
Yeesoon gave it to me a long time ago.

416
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,480
Then explain
how it ended up with Thong's corpse.

417
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,640
I don't know.

418
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,080
I lost it a long time ago.

419
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,480
Where did you lose it?

420
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,560
I have no idea.

421
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,040
Any witnesses or proof that you lost it?

422
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,560
No, Sir.

423
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,200
I never told anyone.

424
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,240
Khun Pra Saming,
you suspect me, don't you?

425
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,120
With evidence this strong,

426
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,000
how could I not?

427
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,320
I just heard about Khun Aek.

428
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,080
What do you think?

429
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,200
Speak freely.

430
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,200
Everyone knows you're close to him.

431
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,160
That doesn't matter.

432
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,600
If he's guilty, he'll be punished.

433
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,040
Then I'll say it.

434
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,280
I think Khun Aek killed Thong.

435
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
I don't want to believe that.

436
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,760
I figured you'd say that.

437
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
Sergeant Boonchai.

438
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,280
Yes, Sir.

439
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,320
Take Khun Aek
to the provincial court for interrogation.

440
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,200
Shackle him tightly.

441
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,080
He's skilled
in both sword and hand combat.

442
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,680
Yes, Sir.

443
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,720
That one, ma'am.

444
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,680
Madam!

445
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,160
What is it, Yip? You startled me.

446
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,520
Don't panic so easily!

447
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,400
Look over there!

448
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,320
Huh? My dear!

449
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,480
Hey.

450
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,760
Why you taking my husband?

451
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,640
He's being taken to the city officials.

452
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,600
Your husband is a murder suspect.

453
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,880
I don't believe it. Let him go.

454
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,080
Don't make a bigger scene than this.

455
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,200
I warn you.

456
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,040
- My dear.
- Stop.

457
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
Go home.

458
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
I don't believe you killed anyone.

459
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,000
Just go.

460
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,880
Sergeant Boonchai is right.

461
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,680
Don't make this worse.

462
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,880
Dear…

463
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,960
Greetings, sir.

464
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,440
You've come all the way here.

465
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,160
Do you need anything, sir?

466
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,360
Khun Sajja,

467
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,040
Khun Aek's being brought here

468
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,240
for questioning, right?

469
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,640
Yes, sir.

470
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,120
Khun Sajja,

471
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,680
do you know

472
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,520
this case is important?

473
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,720
Khun Aek

474
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,040
is known to be clever

475
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,880
and well-connected.

476
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,280
Rumor has it

477
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,280
that this might be beyond you.

478
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,520
From this questioning,

479
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,240
you may not be able
to press charges on him.

480
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,600
So, I came here to warn you as a friend.

481
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,640
If you can get

482
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,240
a confession from Khun Aek,

483
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,960
you'll not only silence doubters,

484
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,160
this important case

485
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,760
will give you serious credit.

486
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,400
It's not about credit.

487
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,960
My job

488
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,680
is to uncover the truth.

489
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,360
Khun Aek,

490
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,560
will you confess?

491
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,880
I don't know anything.

492
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,440
Calm, I see.

493
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,320
No matter what, I have my ways.

494
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,280
What did you just say?

495
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,600
The evidence used against him is…

496
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,760
The perfumed sachet that Yeesoon gave Aek.

497
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,560
I've seen it myself.

498
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,120
Have you ever seen it, Kamduang?

499
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,360
That sachet was found in Thong's hand.

500
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,600
That's the key evidence
tying Aek to the murder.

501
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,200
No one knows how it ended up with Thong.

502
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,040
Sometimes, the one who ends a relationship

503
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,080
isn't the one whose feelings changed.

504
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,560
So,

505
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,200
do you want to forget her?

506
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,240
Yes.

507
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,040
More than anything.

508
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,920
KHUN AEK

509
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,800
If you want to forget,

510
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,640
I don't need to return it.

511
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,720
Will we be able to visit him?

512
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,480
Khun Pra Saming said
visiting hours start tomorrow morning.

513
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,480
Khun Aek.

514
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,280
Did you kill Thong?

515
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,240
No.

516
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,200
I…

517
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,960
I didn't kill him.

518
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,000
Liar!

519
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,360
All I had to do
was bait the hook a little.

520
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,160
Khun Sajja swallowed it whole.

521
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,000
He must be desperate.

522
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,880
By now, he's probably torturing Khun Aek,

523
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,840
maybe he's already dead.

524
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,680
The heavens were on my side.
I happened to see them.

525
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,480
If you want to forget,

526
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,760
I don't have to return it.

527
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,960
KHUN AEK

528
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,160
I have a new job for you. Will you do it?

529
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,600
Yes, sir.

530
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,920
Here, sir. These are Chadwick's documents.

531
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,040
KHUN AEK

532
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,440
This isn't money?

533
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,800
Why… why are you killing me?

534
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,720
Father, what are you doing?

535
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm doing the math.

536
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,920
After we finalize the gun deal,

537
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,200
I'm thinking whether to skim 30% or 20%.

538
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,080
The budget's huge.

539
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,680
If this works,

540
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,920
we'll be rich for life.

541
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,520
Are you alright?

542
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,600
It's you.

543
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,920
We've met before.

544
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,600
Yes, sir.

545
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,360
What happened that day?

546
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,320
You seemed unwell.

547
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,640
I'm fine now, Khun Pra Saming.

548
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,000
You know me?

549
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,560
You're Khun Pra Saming,
the incoming governor of Thung Yai City.

550
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,240
Who wouldn't know?

551
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,000
Are you here to make merit?

552
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,840
Yes, sir.

553
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,960
Great, now I'll have company.

554
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,760
I wouldn't dare
presume I'm your equal, sir.

555
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,480
Please, stand up and be at ease.

556
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,040
Don't see me as a superior.

557
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,360
Can I be your friend?

558
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,880
This is a request, not an order.

559
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,480
Will you allow it?

560
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,720
Would that be alright?

561
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,440
Of course.

562
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,560
Then, yes, sir.

563
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,680
What's your name?

564
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,200
I'm Ping, sir.

565
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,800
Ping?

566
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,000
Let's go.

567
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,680
Let's make merit.

568
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,760
Yes, sir.

569
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,680
Visiting is not allowed.

570
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,760
But Khun Pra Saming said we could visit.

571
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,880
Even if Khun Pra Saming himself came,

572
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,800
I still wouldn't allow it.

573
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,120
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
I'm about to get the truth.

574
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,600
If something happens to Aek…

575
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,680
Khun Pra Chuay, go home.
Don't threaten me.

576
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,520
I'm not afraid of you.

577
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,920
Let's go back for now.

578
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,720
Go!

579
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,920
Hurry up!

580
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,320
Go!

581
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,680
Ugh!

582
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,960
- Ugh!
- Go!

583
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,320
We have to find a way to save him.

584
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,840
What's on your mind, Saming?

585
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,720
I was thinking about Khun Men.

586
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,600
I should appoint him as the negotiator
for the gun deal, replacing Khun Aek.

587
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,920
Father, what do you think

588
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,880
about Khun Aek?

589
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,160
Why do you ask?

590
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,560
We've been close since childhood.

591
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,200
I don't believe he's guilty,

592
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,600
but I handed him over
to Khun Sajja to investigate

593
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,160
because I was afraid people would think

594
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,280
I let my personal ties
interfere with justice.

595
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,960
I think you're conflicted.

596
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,600
But you're about to succeed me
as the next governor.

597
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,400
Please guide me, Father.

598
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You're afraid you'll lose your reputation

599
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,520
and hurt Khun Aek, your friend.

600
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,280
But those

601
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,160
are small matters.

602
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,160
Your duty to protect this town

603
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,040
is far more important.

604
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,280
It's more important.

605
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,600
You must do everything in your power

606
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,680
to bring peace to our town.

607
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,240
Our people deserve
to live safely and prosper

608
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,920
without any thieves or bad people.

609
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,080
Do you understand?

610
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,000
I understand.

611
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,320
You killed Thong, didn't you?

612
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,920
Khun Aek, you are the murderer

613
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,280
who killed Thong. Say it.
Admit it. You hear me?

614
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,360
Khun Aek.

615
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,720
You're a murderer. You killed Thong.

616
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,040
You what? Admit it. You what?

617
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,400
Who did you kill?

618
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,280
What now?

619
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,720
A prisoner has escaped, sir.

620
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,680
- Let's go.
- Yes, Sir.

621
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,200
Hey.

622
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,800
How did you get in?

623
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,960
Buffalo-throwing punch!

624
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,080
Dear!

625
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,400
<i>This doesn't just affect Aek.</i>

626
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,320
I'm in danger too. I'm telling you to run.

627
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,080
Run away while you still can.

628
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,120
<i>No. I'll stay and help him.</i>

629
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,680
You still have time
to run away from this town.

630
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,040
- Just go.
- You didn't kill anyone.

631
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,480
Why stay here and let them torture you?

632
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,720
<i>I'll give Khun Aek</i>
<i>a chance to defend himself.</i>

633
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,200
If he clears his name,

634
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,240
he can return to his duties.

635
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,640
<i>If not,</i>

636
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,040
I'll appoint Khun Men
to handle the gun negotiations instead.

637
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,960
Khun Pra Saming's giving Khun Aek
a chance to defend himself?

638
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,000
Over a single perfumed sachet,

639
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,960
I'm being accused of treason?

640
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,200
<i>If you can't clear your name,</i>

641
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,320
<i>everyone will have doubts,</i>

642
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,480
including me.

643
