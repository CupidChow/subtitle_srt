1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,760
The Death Incantation is complete.

2
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,040
You won't survive.

3
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,920
DIE

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Die?

5
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,240
- Ugh!
- Dear!

6
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,680
I think he's been cursed.

7
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,160
They're raiding villages
and killing soldiers.

8
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
Take our troops and gunners and

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,000
- wipe the Srichai gang out completely!
- Yes, Sir.

10
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,440
There's another one, Khun Pra Chuay.

11
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright. Then I'll have my men

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
kill them all.

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
Go! Kill them all!

14
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
<i>Whoever tries to break it will take risks.</i>

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,880
<i>Their concentration must be diamond-hard.</i>

16
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
<i>If they falter for even a moment…</i>

17
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,520
And then what happens?

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
If the curse was written for death…

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,320
…the breaker dies.

20
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,520
Yip.

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,640
Yes, ma'am.

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,040
Today, no one must enter this room,

23
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
not even Father.

24
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,880
Tell them it's my order.

25
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,960
What are you going to do, Madam?

26
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,800
I cannot say. Just do as I told you.

27
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Yes, Madam.

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,360
I won't let anyone in.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,720
If by evening I still haven't come out,
then you may enter.

30
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,560
Yes, Madam.

31
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,080
If anything happens to me,

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
give this letter to Uncle Yoy.

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
And this is for my husband.

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,920
‪MY DEAR

35
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,920
Why are you saying such things, Madam?

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,560
What are you going to do?

37
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,720
Don't ask.

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,840
Just do as I've said.

39
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,920
EID

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
EID

42
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh, Lady Yeesoon.

43
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,160
What are you doing,
sitting there like that?

44
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,680
It's Madam's order. No one may enter.

45
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,920
Don't talk nonsense. Move aside.

46
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm worried about Khun Aek.
I'm visiting him.

47
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
I really cannot let anyone in.

48
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,720
What?

49
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,640
You, a mere servant, dare to defy me?

50
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,760
Move!

51
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,160
You really can't enter.

52
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,600
I gave my word to Madam.

53
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,760
Kamduang!
You set your servant against me because

54
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,360
you're afraid he will heal because of me?

55
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,120
Wicked woman!

56
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
Do you hear me?

57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Yip,

58
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,720
you're overstepping.

59
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
This is Lady Yeesoon. Step aside!

60
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,720
Yeesoon or not,

61
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,680
no one goes in.

62
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Why not?

63
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,480
- Why?
- Move!

64
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,360
Move. Lady Yeesoon, please go.

65
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,720
Take her.

66
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,960
- Why are you blocking the way?
- You can't go in.

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,080
Whoa!

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
Kamduang, what are you doing?

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
I asked, what are you doing? Kamduang!

70
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,680
<i>Their concentration must be diamond-hard.</i>

71
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,560
<i>If they falter for even a moment,</i>

72
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,880
<i>the curse transfers onto them.</i>

73
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I asked, what are you doing?

74
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,480
Kamduang, what are you doing?

75
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,200
What are you doing? Kamduang!

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
Lady Yeesoon!

77
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,800
Madam.

78
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,280
What happened?

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
Juan, look at Khun Aek.

80
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,960
The characters on his back are gone.

81
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,440
They really are.

82
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,000
He's awake.

83
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,160
‪He's awake.

84
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,120
What happened here?

85
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,680
Kamduang?

86
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,880
Kamduang.

87
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Kamduang.

88
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,400
Kamduang.

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,680
Dear…

90
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,240
Kamduang.

91
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
Kamduang.

92
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,440
Kamduang.

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Kamduang, do you hear me?

94
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,120
Khun Aek, Vet Yoy is here.

95
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,360
Vet Yoy,
I don't know what's wrong with her.

96
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,440
EID

97
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,920
What are those characters?

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,640
The curse has passed to her?

99
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,480
Yes. Kamduang tried to save you,

100
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,520
but her skill wasn't strong enough.

101
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
Kamduang…

102
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,480
Then how can I save her?

103
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,640
Accept it.

104
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,600
Yes, accept it.

105
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,360
Sir, Madam has woken.

106
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
Kamduang.

107
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
Dear.

108
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,440
You're awake…

109
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,120
Vet Yoy said I was cursed

110
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
and the curse passed onto you
when you tried to save me.

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,360
Yes.

112
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,560
But I decided it was worth it.

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
So I did it.

114
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,520
Why would you say that?

115
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,960
Dear,

116
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
since I was born,

117
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,400
I've never met anyone like you.

118
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,760
Someone who sacrifices himself for others.

119
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,240
If I die, only I die.

120
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,160
But if you die,

121
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,520
soldiers and villagers will die too

122
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,840
because they'd lose someone like you

123
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,880
who protects the city.

124
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,080
When you were ill,

125
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,480
your father went to fight Bandit Srichai.

126
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,840
Meanwhile, Khun Men

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,840
pushed Khun Pra Saming
to buy Eastern guns.

128
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,520
The city is on the brink.

129
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,920
I think you should go
and do what you must.

130
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,440
I cannot leave you.

131
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,720
I must find a way to save you first.

132
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,600
You cannot save me.

133
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,720
If you chase two rabbits,
you'll catch none.

134
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,280
Trust me.

135
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,040
Kamduang, I can't.

136
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,160
You are a high official.

137
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,440
Don't let personal matters

138
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,760
destroy the greater cause.

139
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,840
Thank you, Kamduang,

140
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,520
for bringing me back to my senses.

141
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,680
Thank you for everything.

142
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,480
I promise

143
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,840
I'll do all I can to protect this land,

144
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
and the people of Thung Yai City.

145
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,440
But don't you leave me yet.

146
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,640
I'll also find a way to save you.

147
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,880
Don't worry.

148
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,120
I'll do everything I have to do.

149
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Vet Yoy!

150
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,360
Vet Yoy!

151
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
What is it, Yip?

152
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,200
Madam gave this to me this morning.
She said if anything happens to her,

153
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,000
I must give it to you,
to pass on to Khun Aek.

154
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,360
Alright.

155
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,960
Kamduang asked me to handle
the matter of the golden ginseng.

156
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,600
I'll play your wife for real

157
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,320
in exchange for
that golden ginseng as a bonus

158
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,880
What are you doing?

159
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,520
Writing my name to claim it.

160
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,560
KAMDUANG

161
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,040
You probably think Kamduang
wanted the golden ginseng just to sell it

162
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,000
for money, don't you?

163
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,360
You're mistaken.
She didn't want to sell it.

164
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,600
Then what's it for?

165
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,320
To heal her father.

166
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,520
He's gravely ill, bedridden,
and we don't know if he'll recover.

167
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,400
When she saw the golden ginseng here,

168
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
she believed it could save him.

169
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,440
That's why she wanted it so much

170
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,000
that she even risked everything
to play this role with you.

171
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,800
Why didn't she tell me?

172
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,960
If she had,
I would have given it long ago.

173
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
She couldn't.

174
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,880
She's a trader.

175
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,800
If she didn't fulfill her bargain,

176
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,440
how could she accept the reward?

177
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,600
But today,
she must have thought death was near,

178
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,800
and she's worried about her father.
That's why she sent me to ask you.

179
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,440
KAMDUANG

180
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,640
THREE SEN

181
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,440
The Eastern gun is every bit
as effective as Western ones,

182
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,360
but with more advantages.
First, it's lighter,

183
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,320
made with woods unknown to foreigners.

184
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,240
Second, it's suitable for our climate.

185
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,480
Third, it's cheaper.

186
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,840
Let me see the first, effectiveness.

187
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,760
Yes, Sir.

188
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,000
ONE SEN

189
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,520
Wait.

190
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,520
Let Sergeant Boonchai shoot.

191
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,720
If the gun is good, anyone should succeed.

192
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,839
Yes, Sir.

193
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,640
TWO SEN

194
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,520
THREE SEN

195
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
Khun Pra Saming, you're truly skilled.

196
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
If Bandit Srichai's gang comes,

197
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,200
they'll be mowed down.

198
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,200
The situation is dire now,

199
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,160
and the Eastern gun has no weakness.

200
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,680
- Then…
- Greetings.

201
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,080
Khun Pra Saming.

202
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,680
Khun Aek,

203
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
you've recovered?

204
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,160
Yes, Sir.

205
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
Good.

206
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,120
I was just deciding whether
to purchase these Eastern guns.

207
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,600
What do you think?

208
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,960
This is an excellent gun,

209
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,520
but it is not an Eastern gun.

210
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Explain that.

211
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,560
The gun is made of maple wood,

212
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,960
which is light.
Eastern guns use various kinds of wood,

213
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,920
but none as light as this.

214
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
The barrel

215
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,040
is cast by European technique,

216
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
which the East cannot yet replicate.

217
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,600
I can guarantee this gun

218
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,440
was custom-made

219
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,280
to mimic an Eastern gun,

220
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
but it is not.

221
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,800
Who would waste time forging such a thing?

222
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
Then will you let me test them?

223
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,040
Test before we pay.

224
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,120
If all are like this, then purchase.

225
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,160
You may not know

226
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,200
how urgent things are.

227
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,680
Bandit Srichai could strike at any time.

228
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,760
I wonder how Khun Pra Chuay is now.

229
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
He hasn't returned yet.

230
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
I fear the worst.

231
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,040
I'm not cursing him,

232
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,680
but if he is defeated,

233
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
it's possible
Bandit Srichai will grow bold

234
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
and attack sooner.

235
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,440
Khun Aek,

236
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,440
Khun Pra Chuay did draw many guns.

237
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,080
The armory is thin.

238
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,760
Then our crisis worsens.

239
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,400
Without replenishment,

240
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,960
I fear--

241
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,000
When will the Eastern guns
arrive at the earliest?

242
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,040
Within seven days, Sir.
It should be in time to defend the city.

243
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
Then…

244
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,320
Khun Pra Chuay has returned, Sir.

245
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Khun Pra Chuay,

246
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,680
how was the mission?

247
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,800
Hey!

248
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,840
Go!

249
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,120
Kill them all. Leave none alive.

250
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,680
Operation "Bird Eats Fish."

251
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,000
What nonsense!

252
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,640
And when birds eat fish,
where do they strike from?

253
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,280
- Hey?
- Fire!

254
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
This is Yom's head.

255
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,280
Ked escaped.

256
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,840
So, our guns still work.

257
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,360
They have bulletproof shields,

258
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
but they still
can't take bullets directly.

259
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,640
Except for Srichai,
whose skin is as tough as leather.

260
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,200
The rest are frail.

261
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,240
Well done, Khun Pra Chuay.

262
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,120
Thank you.

263
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,960
I'm truly grateful
that you are not only safe

264
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,760
but also succeeded
in defeating the bandits.

265
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,320
It is indeed
a great blessing for our town.

266
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,760
The Eastern guns are suspect,

267
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,040
while the bandits are now checked.

268
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,360
I think you still have time to consider.

269
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,040
I agree with Khun Aek, Sir.

270
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,920
The situation has changed.
We have more time now.

271
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
The budget is vast.

272
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,480
We should decide carefully.

273
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,000
Then let it be as you say.

274
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,960
But we cannot afford
to waste any more time.

275
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,000
Khun Aek,

276
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,360
clear your name
regarding the foreign guns.

277
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,760
Khun Men,
confirm the quality of the Eastern guns.

278
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,240
Then we'll decide from whom to buy.

279
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,360
Yes, Sir.

280
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,480
Will those two never stop troubling me?

281
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,040
I didn't think you'd dare
show your face again, Shaman Dum.

282
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,200
Khun Men,

283
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,520
are you angry because Yom and Ked
lost to Khun Pra Chuay?

284
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,440
Bandits losing
to an elite soldier is one thing,

285
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
but Khun Aek

286
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,520
was struck squarely by your curse,

287
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,400
yet he's alive and well. Explain that.

288
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,400
What?

289
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,800
He still stands?

290
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,800
Of course.
He humiliated me before everyone.

291
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,840
Impossible.

292
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,320
Then your sorcery is worthless.

293
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,920
Mind your tongue, Khun Men.

294
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
Don't threaten me.

295
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,520
If you're so powerful, kill Khun Aek.

296
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,920
Then I'll respect you.

297
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,720
Get out.

298
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,600
I've suffered enough today.

299
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,280
And unless you finish Khun Aek,

300
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,960
don't ever return.

301
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,360
Khun Aek…

302
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,000
Damn you!

303
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,320
Are you sure Khun Aek has fully recovered?

304
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,960
Yes, my lady.

305
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,400
This afternoon he even went to attend
official business at the City Hall.

306
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
And what about that Kamduang?

307
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,000
The word "Die"
appeared on Madam's body instead.

308
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,120
Right now she's gravely ill.

309
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,120
Has anyone said anything about me?

310
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,640
No, my lady. Why do you ask?

311
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,360
Nothing. It doesn't matter
as long as Khun Aek is well.

312
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,920
Now go tell him I've come to visit.

313
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,440
I daren't step into that room myself.

314
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,480
Is that a good idea, my lady?

315
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
Of course. Go.

316
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,080
Yes, my lady.

317
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,640
You should go handle your work, Dear.

318
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,120
Don't waste your time with me.

319
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,440
How can I work while you're like this?

320
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,200
I must find a way to save you.

321
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,400
But the matter of the guns is important.

322
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,240
Leave that for later.

323
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,880
Sir, Lady Yeesoon is here.

324
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,760
She is waiting in the hall.

325
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,280
Mhm…

326
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,160
Go and see her, Dear.

327
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,120
I'm worried for you.

328
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,560
I don't wish to leave your side.

329
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,960
My condition is stable.

330
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,200
It's alright.

331
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,320
Where did he get such protection?

332
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,440
How could he still be unharmed?

333
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,880
Very well. I'll intensify the curse

334
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
and see how long he can endure.

335
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,640
EID

336
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,040
Kamduang!

337
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
Kamduang.

338
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,360
- Madam.
- Kamduang.

339
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
EID

340
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,240
Kamduang.

341
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Sir, Lady Yeesoon is waiting.

342
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Get out!

343
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,920
Yes, sir.

344
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,200
Kamduang, take this medicine.

345
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,920
‪Kamduang.

346
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,520
You'll be alright.

347
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,760
Do you hear me? You'll be alright.

348
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,480
Kamduang…

349
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,160
Oh merciful heavens,
please protect my lady.

350
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,280
Please, divine grace…

351
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
Ohm… shortcut.

352
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,200
I've examined her thoroughly,

353
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,120
yet I cannot determine

354
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,160
what illness afflicts her.

355
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,240
Have you sought shamans?

356
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,000
Before calling you, I summoned three
foreign shamans and one Chinese doctor.

357
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,200
None could tell how to cure her.

358
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,720
None offered any hope.

359
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,560
Did they say anything else?

360
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,280
What do you mean?

361
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,680
Sir, other doctors

362
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,120
may not dare,

363
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,080
but since we respect each other,

364
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,880
I must say,

365
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,480
Kamduang may not last past tonight.

366
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,040
I regret I cannot help.

367
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,000
May a miracle occur.

368
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,240
Kamduang…

369
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,960
Water…

370
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,120
Kamduang.

371
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,600
Kamduang!

372
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,320
- Kamduang.
- Madam.

373
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,720
Kamduang…

374
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,200
Shall I take care of her, sir?

375
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,320
No.

376
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
- I'll take care of her myself.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,680
Kamduang.

378
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,880
Khun Aek,

379
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,680
tonight is the night you die.

380
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,720
You won't survive tonight.

381
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,200
Grandma…

382
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,760
What is it?

383
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm scared…

384
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,120
Scared of what?

385
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,680
I'm scared that…

386
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,680
Madam will…

387
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
Come on.

388
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,680
When a person's time comes,

389
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,280
it comes.

390
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,560
Accept it, Yip.

391
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,920
Have you eaten at all today, son?

392
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,840
If you starve yourself,
you'll fall ill too.

393
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,840
Let the servants bring food.

394
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,600
I cannot eat, Father.

395
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,719
Tell me if you need anything.

396
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,639
I'll go pray for her.

397
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,560
Yes, Father.

398
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,360
‪Kamduang.

399
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,920
Kamduang!

400
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,720
- Madam!
- Madam!

401
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,840
Kamduang.

402
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,040
Kamduang.

403
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,760
Dear…

404
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,680
This…

405
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,240
is…

406
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,960
farewell…

407
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,440
Kamduang? Kamduang.

408
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,120
Kamduang.

409
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,040
Kamduang. Kamduang.

410
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,840
Kamduang.

411
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,800
Kamduang.

412
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,920
Kamduang!

413
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
Madam.

414
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,840
Dear,

415
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,720
keep fighting.

416
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,920
I gladly give my life for you.

417
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,760
How sad that fate gave us
so little time together.

418
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
Yip,

419
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
don't forget what I told you.

420
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,560
Farewell…

421
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,520
Kamduang…

422
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,320
Sir…

423
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
Kamduang…

424
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,120
Who are you? How did you get in here?

425
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,000
I can save her.

426
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,360
I asked you--

427
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,720
Trust me.

428
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,360
EID

429
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,560
The Death Incantation.

430
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
EID

431
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,360
What's happening?

432
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,000
EID

433
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,320
Begone!

434
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,080
Kamduang…

435
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,000
Who's dragging me back?

436
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,680
Who's that? He looks familiar.

437
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,400
Kamduang.

438
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,080
Kamduang?

439
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,880
Kamduang.

440
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,080
Kamduang, you're awake.

441
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,800
It's alright now.

442
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,360
Damn it… The curse rebounded.

443
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,440
Fresh air.

444
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
Hey?!

445
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,240
What?

446
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,360
Madam.

447
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,360
Be quiet!

448
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,040
Who is that old man?

449
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,160
He's your father, isn't he?

450
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,960
Yes… So, everyone knows he's my father?

451
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,240
When did he arrive?

452
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,080
Last night,

453
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,160
just in time to save you.

454
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,000
He saved me?

455
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,600
Then he's well again.

456
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,280
Has he spoken with Khun Aek,
or Khun Pra Chuay?

457
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,640
No, ma'am.

458
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,760
He only said
he was your father, named Yod.

459
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,800
Then he went pale,
said his strength was gone,

460
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,920
and sat to meditate.
He told us not to disturb him.

461
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,880
What about Uncle Yoy?

462
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,080
He hasn't returned yet.

463
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,640
And where are Khun Aek and Khun Pra Chuay?

464
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,800
They went to City Hall together.

465
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,800
And where is the sachet
I made for Khun Aek?

466
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,080
I still have it. Here.

467
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,080
Yip, order all the servants

468
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,800
not to speak with my father. Understand?

469
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,400
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,720
He's finished meditating.

471
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,120
Oh.

472
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,800
What do I do now?

473
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,120
Well.

474
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,320
If my father asks,
tell him I haven't woken yet.

475
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,200
Yes, ma'am.

476
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
How is Kamduang? Has she awoken?

477
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,680
Not yet, sir.

478
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,440
Madam.

479
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,760
Hm?

480
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,200
Your father is coming.

481
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,600
There was much work at City Hall.
So, we came back late.

482
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,000
Please forgive us, Yod.

483
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,440
How is Kamduang, Father?

484
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,560
Who are you calling father?

485
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,200
Oh.

486
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
I meant…

487
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,840
I was asking my father.

488
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,280
Actually,
Kamduang should have woken by now.

489
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,080
If she hasn't,

490
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,520
it means

491
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,800
her spirit has strayed.

492
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,960
I must perform a ritual to call it back.

493
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,760
There are buffalo here, right?

494
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,920
Yes.

495
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,840
I must slaughter
nine buffalo for the rite.

496
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,520
Take me to the pen.

497
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,360
Must it be now?

498
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,520
What are you waiting for?

499
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,680
Please follow me.

500
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,920
Oh?

501
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,800
Dad?

502
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,040
Greetings.

503
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,760
Open your mouth.

504
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,240
Stick out your tongue.

505
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,880
Fire element, skin, eyes, tongue,

506
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,040
all normal.

507
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,080
Except…

508
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,160
where did that sticky rice come from?

509
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,720
You must be mistaken.

510
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,880
That's bits stuck in my teeth.

511
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,840
Kamduang, you're awake?

512
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,360
Dad, excuse me.

513
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,880
I need to speak with Uncle Yoy.

514
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,040
Oh?

515
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,920
Why are you so late?

516
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,520
Whoa, I don't have
the shortcut magic your father does.

517
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,360
Did you tell him about Khun Aek?
Did you say anything about the marriage?

518
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,280
I couldn't.

519
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,480
If I did, he'd cause
an uproar and tear the house apart.

520
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,200
Then what did you tell him?
I'm worried our stories won't match.

521
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,360
I said you worked for Khun Aek,

522
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,440
earned much,
but your pay was the golden ginseng.

523
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,640
The job was dangerous, full of enemies,

524
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,480
and that's how you got cursed.

525
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,760
Alright, let's stick with that.

526
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,840
My father can't know we're married.

527
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,440
If he does, it'll be chaos.
The house could fall apart.

528
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,960
But it isn't even true. It was all a lie.

529
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,040
He can't know it's a lie either.

530
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,640
He won't understand why we have to lie.

531
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,560
And if he rages, the whole city will know,

532
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,760
including Khun Men and Khun Pra Saming.

533
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,560
Oh?

534
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,800
Then what should we tell him?

535
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,960
Tell him I'm just a servant
working for Khun Aek.

536
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,880
Oh?

537
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,880
Another lie on top of a lie. What a mess.

538
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,440
But everyone in town
believes we're husband and wife.

539
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,400
He's bound to find out.

540
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,720
Then we must keep him
from speaking with anyone else.

541
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,680
It's hard, but necessary.

542
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,320
I'll order the servants
not to speak to Uncle Yod.

543
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,200
And we must settle the matter
of the foreign guns,

544
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,640
before things spiral further.

545
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,440
I must thank you, Dad,

546
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,560
for saving my life.

547
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,080
It is a father's duty.

548
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,560
Still, I owe thanks to you

549
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,000
and Khun Aek,

550
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,920
for sending the golden ginseng.

551
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,240
Without it, I might not have survived.

552
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,120
There's no need, Uncle Yod.

553
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,560
That ginseng was Kamduang's wage by right.

554
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,120
Anyway, may I ask what illness struck you?

555
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,720
I was taking buffalo
through the Phaya Fire Forest.

556
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,280
I shot a tiger,

557
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,680
but its claws raked me down.

558
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,560
Though I pulled them out,
I grew gravely ill

559
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,320
until the ginseng saved me.

560
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,760
Are you fully well to travel here so fast?

561
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,440
Not yet, sir.

562
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,640
But Yoy told me Kamduang was near death,

563
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,880
so I rushed here

564
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,920
with the shortcut spell.

565
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,080
Then I had to break the curse.

566
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,840
I still feel weak.

567
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
I think this place is far too chaotic.

568
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,160
You should return home and rest.

569
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,840
I've just arrived, and you want me gone?

570
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,880
I'm worried for you, that's all.

571
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,000
Sir, Khun Pra Saming is here.

572
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,360
He says he's come to visit Madam.

573
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,120
Well…

574
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,080
My Lord comes.

575
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,120
Vet Yoy, please take Yod to rest first.

576
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,480
Yes, sir.

577
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,680
How are you, Kamduang?

578
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm fully recovered, sir.

579
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,640
Strange, isn't it?
One day you said Khun Aek was gravely ill,

580
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,080
and you suddenly recovered.

581
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,760
Then I heard Kamduang was sick instead,

582
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,600
and now here you are, all well again.

583
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,320
There's something abnormal here.

584
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,840
If I can piece the clues together,
I'll explain it to you.

585
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,440
Never mind.

586
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,680
What matters is you're well. The royal
physician even said you wouldn't survive.

587
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,600
I even brought dried persimmons.

588
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,320
Hey, who are you?

589
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,640
Get out.

590
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,880
Ugh!

591
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,280
- Hey!
- No, please.

592
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,400
Sergeant, this is my father.

593
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,480
This is Yod, sir,

594
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,920
Kamduang's father.

595
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,920
And this is Khun Pra Saming, my superior,

596
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,680
acting governor of Thung Yai City.

597
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,960
Oh.

598
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,080
I thought
you'd already gone with Uncle Yoy.

599
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,880
I forgot my yellow oil bottle,
so I came back for it.

600
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,720
Thank you.

601
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,120
Here. Now that you've got it…

602
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,720
- Let's go, Dad. Come.
- Let's go.

603
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Hold on.

604
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,600
Sergeant Boonchai is a skilled warrior.

605
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,760
I've never seen anyone
dropped him with one kick.

606
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,160
Oh.

607
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,720
I'm nothing special.

608
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,640
He just wasn't careful around an old man,

609
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,920
right?

610
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,960
It's a lesson for me, Sir.

611
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,240
Next time, I'll be more observant.

612
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,560
Yod is sharp in both fist and tongue.

613
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,640
No wonder you must feel tense

614
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,520
to be his son--

615
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,040
What's the matter?

616
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,520
Looks like Kamduang isn't fully well yet.

617
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,040
You should take care of her, as her hus--

618
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,040
Khun Pra Chuay,
seems everyone around you is sick,

619
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,400
both your child and your daughter-in--

620
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,960
Pardon me, Sir.

621
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,320
Let's go, Dad.
Leave these nobles to their state matters.

622
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,720
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

623
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,520
Whoa.

624
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,160
Did I catch it from you?

625
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,200
What are you doing, Dad?

626
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,400
EID

627
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,440
Here it is.

628
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,320
DIE

629
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,480
How did this charm end up under Khun…

630
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,880
Hmm?

631
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,360
Under my bed, I mean.

632
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,920
Kamduang,

633
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,680
what sort of work
are you doing for Khun Aek

634
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,160
that you've earned enemies this ruthless?

635
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,680
I can't say, Dad. It's political business.

636
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,720
Then your work must be vital indeed.

637
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,760
This is magic meant to kill.

638
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,960
I'd say

639
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,240
there's a traitor inside this household.

640
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,720
I can't imagine

641
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,880
which servant here would be so vile
as to try to murder one of you.

642
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,200
Neither can I.

643
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,000
But we can't let it go.

644
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,480
If we don't find that person,
we'll never live in peace.

645
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,000
Then we'll have to secretly watch
and listen among the servants.

646
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,600
We might catch a clue.

647
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,920
- Grandma.
- Hmm?

648
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,640
Do you know much about sorcery?

649
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,480
Of course. My relative

650
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,440
is a sorcerer.

651
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,360
What's it like?

652
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,000
Back when I was a kid,
I played around that relative's house.

653
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,920
I saw all sorts of strange things.

654
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,800
What about you two? Do you know anything?

655
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,280
I don't know anything.

656
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,520
Really?

657
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,320
I only know a little.

658
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,720
Then why are you asking me?

659
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,400
Whoa, Grandma.

660
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,520
Because the curse
that struck Khun Aek and Madam,

661
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,640
I think one of us servants put it there.

662
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,520
Juan! You think the same as me!

663
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,760
Keep it down.

664
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,840
Yeesoon asked her kin
in Phra Nakhon to investigate us.

665
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,880
Yes, what shall we do?

666
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,840
We can't let Yeesoon read that letter.

667
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,120
<i>You must use your charm to distract her.</i>

668
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,000
You give the best massages.

669
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,400
<i>Then I'll slip in and get the letter.</i>

670
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,000
<i>For men, being close to a woman you like,</i>

671
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,960
you never want it to end.

672
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,360
Not just ten years. I can be
your husband for 100 more.

673
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,000
<i>I think</i>

674
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,960
we should be mates.

675
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,200
Kham?

676
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,880
Yes.

677
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,080
It's me, your same old Kham.

678
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,720
