1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,720
<i>Your wife, Kamduang. She clashed</i>
<i>with Yeesoon again at the market.</i>

2
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,760
<i>The townsfolk are gossiping endlessly.</i>

3
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,960
Did Kamduang hurt Yeesoon again, Sir?

4
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,760
Not at all.
This time, the whole market saw

5
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,039
<i>that Yeesoon hurt herself</i>
<i>to frame Kamduang.</i>

6
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,280
<i>The authorities</i>
<i>have issued a warrant for me.</i>

7
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,040
<i>You know</i>

8
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,720
<i>how you'll be punished, don't you?</i>
<i>You copied my portrait.</i>

9
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,960
If you want the antidote,
you'll do a job for me first.

10
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,280
What job? I'll do anything.

11
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,760
Kill Khun Aek.

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>You must kill him.</i>
<i>Only then will you get the antidote.</i>

13
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,240
<i>If you fail, you know exactly</i>

14
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,600
<i>who will have to die, don't you?</i>

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,520
<i>I've found a way</i>
<i>to counter your technique.</i>

16
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,000
Dear!

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,120
Does it hurt badly?

18
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
So you're a pirate?
Let me test your skill.

19
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Surround her!

20
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,920
Chief.

21
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,440
I failed. But I gave it my all.

22
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,080
Khun Pra Chuay did it?

23
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,640
His swordsmanship is excellent.

24
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,440
From the wound alone, I believe you.

25
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
This is the antidote.

26
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,960
I'll give you only half,

27
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,960
since you failed.

28
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,000
If you want the rest,

29
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,600
kill Khun Aek first.

30
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,040
And don't forget
to treat the wound on your face properly.

31
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,960
How is he, Uncle Yoy?

32
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Oh, the blade was very sharp.

33
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,360
I asked about Khun Aek.

34
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,920
The bleeding has stopped.
The wound isn't deep.

35
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,320
It's not serious.
He'll recover with some rest.

36
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,440
Dear, how are you?

37
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,440
Just a little pain.

38
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,480
I'm sorry. If I had been here,

39
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,800
I would have fought beside you.

40
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,920
When she attacked, I didn't even notice.

41
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,560
Suddenly, a sword
pierced through the mosquito net.

42
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,840
I survived

43
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
because I was about to rise
and apologize to you.

44
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,320
Please, no more words.

45
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,120
Nothing matters more now than your safety.

46
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,840
Please rest, Dear.

47
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,880
I'll take care of you.

48
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,120
The mask is from foreign lands.

49
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,400
It could belong to pirates.

50
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,960
Some pirate factions are bold enough
to steal guns from foreign ships.

51
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,280
It may relate
to the guns we can't identify.

52
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,680
Our city is a port.

53
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,520
Besides pirates,
many foreigners dwell here.

54
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,000
The culprit could be pirates,

55
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,880
or a local in disguise.

56
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,120
Her skill is beyond
that of a common thief.

57
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,920
Then I entrust you

58
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,960
to investigate further.

59
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,160
Yes, Sir.

60
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,160
Khun Men Manmueang,

61
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
do not fear. I come as a friend.

62
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
A friend?

63
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,560
My name is Shaman Dum.

64
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,880
Srichai sent me to thank you, Khun Men,

65
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,600
for saving him.

66
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,559
Go, before someone else sees you.

67
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,480
Not that way.

68
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,960
My soldiers are there,

69
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,520
and Khun Pra Chuay's troops the other way.

70
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,440
But Khun Aek's after me.

71
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,080
I'll handle him.

72
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,440
So Bandit Srichai is safe?

73
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,680
Injured, but recovering.

74
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
He'll return stronger.

75
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,400
Meaning he won't raid the city yet?

76
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,200
Correct. Now is not the time.

77
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,080
I'll tell you one thing. Listen carefully.

78
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,400
Our Governor plans to buy foreign guns

79
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
which are very powerful.

80
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,640
I'm persuading him instead to buy my guns,

81
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,560
the useless ones.

82
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,320
If you help me sell them,

83
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,320
when you raid the city,

84
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,880
you'll have nothing to fear

85
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,560
from those useless guns.

86
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,040
I'll tell Srichai.

87
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
He will decide.

88
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
When will you know?

89
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,280
<i>I agree.</i>

90
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,640
He agrees.

91
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,840
I talked to him.

92
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,840
He agrees to work with you.

93
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,160
If you help us seize the city,

94
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,040
you'll have half of it.

95
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,560
Now, about the guns,
what do you want me to do?

96
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,920
The nobleman handling the gun purchase

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
is Khun Aek Itthirit. He's injured now.

98
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,760
Once he recovers, he'll push the Governor

99
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,080
to buy from foreigners.

100
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,280
What do you want me to do?

101
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,960
Use your sorcery. Finish him.

102
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,640
Bring me his birth date.

103
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,200
I'll make it look like an illness

104
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,320
until he dies.

105
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
How is it going?

106
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,320
Down on your luck today?

107
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,160
I've lost everything, sir.

108
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,280
For you.

109
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,800
Thank you, sir.

110
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,520
I have an important task for you.

111
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,680
Do it well, and I'll give you more.

112
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,720
Please tell me, sir.

113
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Even through fire and water,

114
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll do everything.

115
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,160
<i>Hide this talisman under Khun Aek's bed.</i>

116
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,400
<i>It's called the Great Ally Talisman.</i>
<i>It will soften his heart.</i>

117
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,080
He'll accept me as a friend.

118
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,440
EID

119
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,200
Trust me.

120
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,080
Here.

121
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,240
I trust you, sir.

122
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,520
A man as kind as you

123
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,720
could never harbor evil intent.

124
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,480
I'll do it right away.

125
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,400
EID

126
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
EID

127
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,720
Dear.

128
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
Dear, what's wrong?

129
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,080
Dear.

130
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,640
Dear, what's happening?

131
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,640
Yip! Yip!

132
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Dear, are you feeling unwell?

133
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,120
Hey! Did you get the andrographis yet?

134
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,040
Hurry up! Chop up more
heart-leaved moonseed too.

135
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,680
Come on, chop it faster.
Are you out of strength?

136
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,520
Ugh, it's too hard, Grandma.

137
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,520
You're all moving like snails!

138
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,000
What took you so long

139
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,200
just to go to the market?

140
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,680
Dried shrimp is out of stock.
I had to search every stall in the market.

141
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,520
What's all this chaos about?

142
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,760
Last night,

143
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,520
suddenly Khun Aek's
condition worsened badly.

144
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,400
He groaned and moaned the whole night.

145
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,880
Could the fever have relapsed?

146
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,160
I don't know. But this time

147
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,280
it seems strange.

148
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,160
It looks unnatural somehow.

149
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,080
Dear.

150
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,720
Hang in there. The doctor is coming.

151
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,800
How are you, Dear?

152
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,080
Dear.

153
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,640
Breathe deeply.

154
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,120
The doctor is coming.

155
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,520
Where does it hurt?

156
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,000
This way, Doctor.

157
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,040
Juan, move aside.

158
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,200
He was attacked by intruders and wounded.

159
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,440
He was recovering,

160
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,120
but suddenly
his condition turned severe again.

161
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,640
It must be
the wound infection flaring up again…

162
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,960
Nothing more, surely.

163
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,840
Do you think like I do, Sir?

164
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,400
That Khun Aek's case

165
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,200
seems strange?

166
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
How?

167
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,480
At first they said an assassin

168
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,640
attacked him inside his house.

169
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,400
I think that's hard to believe.

170
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,920
Then just as he improved,

171
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,600
he suddenly collapsed again.

172
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,400
No wonder Khun Pra Chuay
summoned the royal physician so early.

173
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
Khun Aek's illness must not be ordinary.

174
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,120
- The royal physician is here, Sir.
- Bring him in.

175
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,080
How is Khun Aek?

176
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,760
On inspection, nothing seems wrong, Sir.

177
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,520
His elements are balanced.

178
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,680
He doesn't look sick at all.

179
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,960
So, he's not ill?

180
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
But he vomits heavily,

181
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,240
has no strength,
and complains of stomach pain.

182
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,280
Yet I find no cause.

183
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,880
It's very strange, Sir.

184
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,359
Perhaps he's not sick at all,
just pretending.

185
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,960
He once swore he'd prove

186
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,160
the gunpowder explosion

187
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,800
wasn't his fault.

188
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
Now,

189
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,920
since he hasn't found proof,

190
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,760
he might be buying time

191
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,560
by claiming assassination

192
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,000
or illness.

193
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
But as his friend,

194
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,280
I know Khun Aek isn't like that.

195
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,200
Don't forget, Sir.

196
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,400
If the foreign gun was faulty

197
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
and injured the Governor,

198
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,960
Khun Aek must take responsibility.
If not with prison, then execution.

199
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,720
I admit,

200
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,200
Khun Aek carried himself well before.

201
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
But when cornered,

202
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,960
a man's true nature shows.

203
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Doctor,

204
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,480
are you sure you checked thoroughly?

205
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Yes, Sir.

206
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,400
Unless…

207
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,920
Unless Khun Aek is under a curse.

208
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,080
That, I cannot detect.

209
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,040
Being attacked by assassins
in your own home is ridiculous enough,

210
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,080
now sorcery too?

211
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,440
Let me ask you one thing.

212
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,680
Is it possible

213
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,280
he simply ate something
to make himself vomit?

214
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,920
Yes, that could be.
A lot of food can cause vomiting.

215
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,600
So, between sorcery

216
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,280
and deliberately eating something
to make himself vomit,

217
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
which one is more possible?

218
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
The latter one.

219
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,120
EID

220
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,840
Dear.

221
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,400
Again?

222
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,680
What's happening to me?

223
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,960
I don't know. I can't tell.

224
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,320
Do you think he's been cursed?

225
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,320
No. Not likely.

226
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,720
And in this house,
how could a curse reach him?

227
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,320
Dear.

228
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,680
Where does it hurt?

229
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,160
Sir, Lady Yeesoon has come to visit.

230
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,160
Tell her

231
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,760
he is too ill.

232
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,120
This is not the right time.

233
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,600
- Yes, ma'am.
- No.

234
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,080
Let her wait for me at the pavilion.

235
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,720
Yes, sir.

236
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,640
- But Dear…
- I can manage.

237
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,920
When I heard you were gravely ill,

238
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,480
I rushed here.
I didn't even bring medicine.

239
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,920
I was too worried about you.

240
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,960
Your concern alone is enough for me.

241
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,960
My heart is always with you.

242
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,720
By the way,

243
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,560
speaking with you like this
makes me feel better.

244
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,440
You don't need to flatter me.

245
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,160
I'll be visiting you often anyway.

246
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,760
Dear, please take your medicine.

247
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,200
Kamduang takes such good care of you.

248
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,720
Thank you for your compliment.

249
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,560
Dear, you should rest now.

250
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,760
Excuse me.

251
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,480
Yes.

252
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Clean thoroughly.

253
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,880
Burn incense candles too, freshen the air.

254
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
Yes, sir.

255
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,360
I'll do under the bed.

256
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,960
You fetch the candles.

257
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,360
Be careful, Dear.

258
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
How are you, Aek?

259
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,960
I suddenly feel better.

260
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,960
That's strange.

261
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
When Yeesoon was here?

262
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,560
And where is she now?

263
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,000
She's gone home.

264
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,280
You should rest a bit more, Dear.

265
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,560
Oh, I thought it was about the talisman.

266
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,760
It turns out to be
just matters of the heart.

267
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,680
It's flaring up again?

268
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,080
Dear.

269
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,520
Lady Yeesoon,

270
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
I'm not just flattering you.

271
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
Everyone saw with their own eyes

272
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,400
that Khun Aek's condition improved
because of you.

273
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,720
When you visited him, his condition

274
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,320
was better instantly.

275
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,400
But once you left…

276
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,360
somehow his health worsened again.

277
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,760
As the old saying goes,
"The mind commands, the body obeys."

278
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,240
My dear Khun Aek's mind must be
dwelling on me, until his body falls ill.

279
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,400
Even Madam must sense it.
She looked so uneasy.

280
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,120
What will you do next, Lady Yeesoon?

281
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,080
I'll just have to visit him more often.

282
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,200
Let him see my face,
and then he'll recover faster.

283
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,280
But I fear it might not look proper.

284
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,120
Khun Aek already has a wife

285
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,640
as the rightful mistress of the house.

286
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,360
Then I'll endure the villagers' gossip.

287
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,200
If that's the price
for my dear Khun's recovery,

288
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,760
I'll do it.

289
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,360
My Lady Yeesoon,

290
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,160
you are truly beautiful inside and out.

291
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,600
What I notice is

292
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,720
when you leave the room, you feel better.

293
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,200
You're right.

294
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,840
It surely doesn't matter
whom you meet or don't meet.

295
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,480
What if it does?

296
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,920
What if seeing Yeesoon
makes me feel better,

297
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,480
what would you do?

298
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,080
Then I'd let Yeesoon stay by your side

299
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,760
until you recover.

300
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,480
Really?

301
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,520
Really… my foot!

302
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,520
I've said it a thousand times already

303
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,880
that Yeesoon isn't
the good woman you think she is.

304
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,520
Maybe she's kind to you,
but she's cruel to me,

305
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,200
more than anyone.

306
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,400
You're no angel yourself.

307
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Perhaps you wronged her first,
and she just returned the favor.

308
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,720
You defend her this much?
Shall I announce to everyone

309
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,880
that we're just a fake husband and wife?

310
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,640
So are you angry at me or jealous of me?

311
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,480
Jealous!

312
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,440
No, not jealous!

313
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,720
Your words don't match your heart.

314
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,560
Chief Kamduang,

315
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,360
has anyone ever told you…

316
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,440
- Deep down you're a woman who--
- Sir.

317
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,560
Sir.

318
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,440
Khun Pra Chuay asks you
to return to the house now, sir.

319
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,120
Lady Yeesoon has come to visit, sir.

320
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,680
Kamduang, wait here.

321
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,720
Why, Father?
You also think he will get better

322
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,640
just because of Yeesoon?

323
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
We'll have to see.

324
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Yeesoon.

325
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,520
Why are you smiling?

326
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,840
This is the first time in my life

327
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,400
I've been this close to a man's bed.

328
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,280
A bed is a bed,
whether it's a man's or a woman's.

329
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,080
From what I've observed,

330
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,560
whenever he goes outside,

331
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,400
he gets better.

332
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,360
But once back in this room,
his illness worsens.

333
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,240
It must be the elements in this room.

334
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,520
Just watch.

335
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,560
Soon he'll be in pain again.

336
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,560
Yeesoon?

337
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,000
Well…

338
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,360
Well, I just wanted to know

339
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,560
if a man's bed

340
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,000
was as comfortable as mine at home.

341
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
I see.

342
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,960
See, Kamduang?

343
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,440
He's not in pain at all.

344
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,400
Don't tell me…

345
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,560
he really is getting better
because of Yeesoon.

346
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,680
Here is the medicine, my lady.

347
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,520
Take your medicine first.

348
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,920
I'll help.

349
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,400
If I stay with you
and you're getting stronger,

350
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,400
then I wish I could stay longer,

351
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,360
so you'll recover quickly.

352
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,520
But it might be difficult.

353
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,800
You know why?

354
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,120
Why, my lady? Why can't you stay?

355
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,160
Please tell me.

356
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,080
Oh Juan, I don't dare say.

357
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,440
I must respect certain people.

358
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
But you should already know

359
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,720
who I mean.

360
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,760
I don't know, my lady.

361
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,040
I'm too foolish.

362
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,360
But someone smarter than me surely knows.

363
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,200
Yes, someone smart

364
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
not only knows,

365
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,920
but also knows how they should behave.

366
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,120
I've finished visiting Khun Aek.
I'll take my leave.

367
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,480
I'll walk you out.

368
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
Thank you.

369
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,960
See, Yip?

370
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,440
Didn't you see clearly?

371
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,160
Khun Aek loves Lady Yeesoon so much.

372
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,320
Just seeing her face cured him.

373
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,120
Nonsense.

374
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,360
If patients could recover just by looking

375
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,520
at their loved ones' faces,

376
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,280
there'd be no doctors in this world.

377
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,880
Whoa.

378
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,200
You're so stubborn,

379
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,400
never admitting defeat.
What do you think, Grandma Aoy?

380
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,720
Well, even the royal physicians
couldn't heal him.

381
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,520
But now, he recovers
the moment he sees Lady Yeesoon's face.

382
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,400
That's what you call

383
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,320
"the old-flame fever."

384
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,440
I'm craving the old chili dip
with sticky rice.

385
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,240
You just can't resist it.

386
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,480
Whoa.

387
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,200
Look, is this sticky rice ball big?

388
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,600
Whoa.

389
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,160
Both of you

390
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,880
always twist things into something dirty.

391
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
What's wrong with a little spice?

392
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,880
It keeps the heart young.

393
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,080
But overall, I'd say

394
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,320
Khun Aek simply misses Lady Yeesoon.

395
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,960
It can't be anything else.

396
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,080
Yes.

397
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,920
Now, come on, let's go
to the kitchen and make chili paste.

398
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,920
Again?

399
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,280
I think you're the one
craving it, Grandma.

400
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,920
Wouldn't it be extra spicy though?

401
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,360
I've heard news about Khun Aek.

402
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,159
I admit, you're really skilled.

403
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
This is

404
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,440
just a small matter for the Srichai gang.

405
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,800
Once I finish chanting

406
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,960
the Death Incantation,

407
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,480
Khun Aek

408
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,880
will die in unbearable agony,

409
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,159
and no one will be able to save him.

410
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,639
Just killing Khun Aek isn't enough.

411
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,760
We need Khun Pra Saming
to quickly buy guns from my side.

412
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,120
Go tell Bandit Srichai

413
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,480
to stir up more pressure.

414
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,080
Right now,
Bandit Srichai isn't ready to act.

415
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,200
But we

416
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,560
still have many capable underlings.

417
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,640
Whoever it is,

418
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,280
just pressure Khun Pra Saming
until he has no other choice.

419
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,280
Understood. I'll see to it immediately.

420
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,440
Good.

421
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Kamduang,

422
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,080
what are you doing sitting here?

423
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,520
Calming myself.

424
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
Calming yourself?

425
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,680
Is it about Yeesoon?

426
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,360
And you're not going to check on Aek?

427
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,120
If I show my face,

428
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,440
his illness will worsen again.

429
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,600
Don't overthink it.

430
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,720
You're not a curse.
It's just a coincidence.

431
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
And Aek has already gotten much better.

432
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Really?

433
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,800
If you don't believe me,
go see with your own eyes.

434
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,560
Yes.

435
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,920
You look much better.

436
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,800
No vomiting, no pain.

437
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,360
See, Kamduang?

438
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
You came in and nothing happened to him.

439
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,080
Stop worrying.

440
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,360
Oh, Kamduang.

441
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,160
My sickness has nothing to do with you.

442
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,640
Why blame yourself?

443
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,560
But I've noticed

444
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,640
every time I'm near you,

445
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,200
your condition worsens.

446
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Nonsense.

447
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,760
Look, I'm fine now.

448
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,400
I'm just glad you're better.

449
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,000
It's partly thanks to your care.

450
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,880
Thank you so much.

451
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,000
EID

452
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,200
- Ugh!
- Aek!

453
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,160
Dear!

454
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,400
Kamduang, leave.

455
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,720
No. If I'm not a curse, I won't leave.

456
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,720
Leave, Kamduang.

457
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,120
You told me yourself

458
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,400
that his illness
had nothing to do with me.

459
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,280
Go, or Aek will die!

460
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,480
EID

461
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,320
Go!

462
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,880
Kamduang.

463
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,760
This has nothing to do with you.

464
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,360
What madness is this?

465
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,400
Could it be

466
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,000
black magic?

467
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,080
S

468
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,320
This raid is as easy as peeling a banana.

469
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,480
Just flash the flag

470
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,640
and the villagers kneel

471
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,960
and hand things over.

472
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,240
Fighting back would just get them killed.

473
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,480
The patrol soldiers rarely show up.

474
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,280
As if they could do anything
even if they showed up.

475
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,040
Srichai gang, today I'll capture you all.

476
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,960
You've troubled the people long enough.

477
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,080
You don't need to bother.
We will handle this ourselves.

478
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,880
You underestimate us too much.

479
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,720
Resist and we'll cut you down.

480
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,200
You're the ones who should prepare to die.

481
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,240
Then bring it on!

482
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,160
Come at me!

483
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,280
The villagers confirm
they were indeed men of Bandit Srichai.

484
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,680
Our patrol soldiers fought them

485
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,160
but were outnumbered.

486
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,240
Insolent bandits! How dare they!

487
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,680
And where's Khun Pra Chuay?
Still not here?

488
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,280
Not yet, Sir.

489
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,160
I sent someone to call him a while ago.

490
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
He's likely delayed caring for Khun Aek.

491
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,480
Forgive me for being late.

492
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,320
Khun Aek still hasn't recovered
from his strange illness, has he?

493
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,280
It's been days,
and you still don't know what it is?

494
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
I heard about Srichai's men.

495
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,440
I believe
they're deliberately provoking us.

496
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,520
I think the same.

497
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,440
That's why I want you
to lead the troops against them.

498
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,120
I fear that's exactly what they want.

499
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,360
They must have a trap prepared.

500
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,400
So what you're saying is

501
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,680
we should just do nothing?

502
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,160
Or is it that you're afraid of them?

503
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,640
I'm not afraid.

504
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
I just don't want us
to rush in recklessly.

505
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,520
You can't!

506
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,400
They're raiding villages
and killing soldiers.

507
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,520
How can I sit still?

508
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,480
Khun Pra Chuay,

509
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,680
take our troops and gunners

510
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,320
and wipe the Srichai gang out completely!

511
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Yes, Sir.

512
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,000
Go prepare at once.

513
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,040
Khun Pra Saming.

514
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,440
I think we must buy new guns
as soon as possible.

515
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,200
But we still haven't settled
on the matter of the foreign guns.

516
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,680
With Khun Aek
dragging things out like this…

517
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,400
If the Srichai gangs storm in,
we'll all be in trouble.

518
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,920
You think the guns we already have

519
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,000
can't handle them at all?

520
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,280
To be honest,

521
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,760
our guns are really outdated.

522
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,080
Then let's test it.

523
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,440
If Khun Pra Chuay manages to return alive,

524
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,400
at least we can feel reassured
that our guns still work.

525
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,000
But if he loses, that proves our guns

526
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,400
are old and worthless.

527
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,320
But there's another one
you must beware of,

528
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,840
Khun Pra Chuay.

529
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,880
He's deadly skilled,
both in combat and in strategy.

530
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,840
Could you tell me

531
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,560
how many of them are coming,

532
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
and with what weapons?

533
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,080
Of course I can.

534
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,960
Alright. Then I'll have my men

535
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,680
kill them all,

536
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,520
leave no one alive.

537
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,160
Good.

538
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,720
If you can kill Khun Pra Chuay,
that's a double profit.

539
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,800
First, Khun Pra Saming will have no choice

540
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,240
but to buy guns from me right away.

541
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,240
Second,

542
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,400
Thung Yai City loses a key defender.

543
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,320
If Khun Pra Chuay dies,

544
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,560
raiding the city
will be many times easier.

545
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,120
Kamduang.

546
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,360
This time I go,
I don't know if I'll ever return.

547
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,360
Why do you say it
as if you're going off to die?

548
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,720
I didn't say that.

549
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,360
You're the one who did.

550
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,080
I'm sorry.

551
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,920
I have a request.

552
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,800
Even if you're not truly Khun Aek's wife,

553
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,600
not really my daughter-in-law,

554
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,720
if I die,

555
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,640
please take care of Aek for me.

556
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,040
At least
until he fully recovers from his illness.

557
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,720
As for payment,

558
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,320
whatever you want from this house,
just take it.

559
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,600
I don't mind.

560
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,800
Whether it's money or valuables, take it.

561
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,840
There's no one else
I can entrust Khun Aek to,

562
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,480
only you.

563
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,680
Don't worry, Father.

564
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,480
I'll look after him until he recovers.

565
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,760
You're kind and good-hearted.

566
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,960
Thank you so much.

567
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,920
May the sacred spirits

568
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
protect Father and keep him safe

569
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,920
from this mission against the bandits.

570
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,680
The Death Incantation is complete.

571
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,440
Khun Aek, you won't survive.

572
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,080
All that's left is for you to suffer.

573
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,360
What happened, Yip?

574
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,720
His back, Madam.

575
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,160
What?

576
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,000
EID

577
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,720
Where did these characters come from?

578
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,680
I don't know, ma'am.

579
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,240
DIE

580
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,720
Die?

581
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,000
Dear.

582
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,480
What's going on?

583
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,600
Yip, you screamed so loud!

584
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
His back.

585
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,000
That is…

586
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,560
You know what this is?

587
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,240
I…

588
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,320
- I…
- What is it, Juan?!

589
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,400
I don't know, ma'am. But it's frightening!

590
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,200
Dear.

591
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,680
Dear, hang in there.

592
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,120
- What happened?
- Uncle Yoy.

593
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,360
Please help him!

594
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,200
Khun Aek, take this.

595
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,800
Chew it, then swallow.

596
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,600
What did you give him?

597
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,080
A sedative,

598
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,320
to spare him the pain for now.

599
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,440
What's wrong with him?

600
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,600
I think he's been cursed.

601
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,640
Huh?

602
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,400
- What kind of sorcery?
- I don't know.

603
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,560
Then how can we help him?

604
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,960
There are many levels of sorcery.

605
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,960
If it's high-level sorcery,
I fear Khun Aek could die.

606
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,400
Oh.

607
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,480
Dear.

608
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,040
Sathu.

609
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,000
Holy Father,

610
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,760
please heal Khun Aek.

611
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,400
If he recovers,

612
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,480
I'll perform
a Chui-Chai dance offering for you.

613
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,560
Yip, are you sure
he wants to see you dance?

614
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,840
You cow!

615
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,200
I can vow whatever I want.

616
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,840
You can vow whatever you want.
Mind your own business.

617
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,440
- The Buddha…
- Hey, stop.

618
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,600
Stop fighting.

619
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,840
- Enough, you two.
- Alright.

620
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,280
Holy Father, Khun Aek is a good man,

621
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,200
sacrificing for the city and the country.

622
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,080
Please protect him.

623
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,680
As for anyone who cast this curse,

624
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,920
punish them. Let the earth swallow them,

625
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,080
let them burn in hell

626
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,880
for eternity!

627
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,040
Yes. And may they be reborn

628
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,640
as maggots in dung

629
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,000
for 500 <i>moew</i> lives.

630
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,600
Sathu.

631
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,160
<i>Don't listen to them, Father.</i>

632
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,640
<i>Please save Khun Aek.</i>

633
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,240
<i>If he dies,</i>

634
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,440
<i>I'll bear the sin forever.</i>

635
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,240
<i>Please help him.</i>

636
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,600
Kamduang.

637
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,440
Where are you coming from?

638
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,000
I came to see the abbot,

639
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,800
to ask him
to break the curse on my husband.

640
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
And what did he say?

641
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,520
He said he cannot.
it's beyond his training.

642
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,320
We barely have someone
who knows this in the city.

643
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,600
I'll also help ask around.

644
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,760
Thank you so much.

645
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,440
I was planning to visit Khun Aek anyway,

646
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,040
to see if he can still prove himself
on the foreign guns issue.

647
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,800
Otherwise,

648
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,160
Khun Men may need to make the purchase.

649
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,360
You won't wait for Khun Aek?

650
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,480
The town is in crisis.

651
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,440
We may not have time to wait.

652
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,840
I'll take my leave.

653
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,960
<i>My love.</i>

654
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,560
Dear, I think I have been cursed.

655
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,480
Everyone, go back.

656
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,880
I need to take care of something.

657
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,000
Look after Khun Aek well.

658
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,080
Yes, Madam.

659
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,240
Back then, yes,
I cast a love spell on you.

660
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,240
But that was simple sorcery.

661
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,760
What Khun Aek suffers now

662
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,800
is high-level sorcery.

663
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,600
What kind of spell is it?

664
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,480
The Death Incantation.

665
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,360
I've never seen it myself,
only heard from my master.

666
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,080
The sorcerer writes
cursed characters onto a talisman,

667
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,040
then chants the spell until complete.

668
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,720
The characters then attach
themselves to the victim's body,

669
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800
inescapable.

670
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,560
Where did these characters come from?

671
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,200
If it says sick, they'll get sick.
If it says die, they'll die.

672
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,520
DIE

673
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
Die?

674
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,520
Can you undo it?

675
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,560
I cannot,

676
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,720
but I know of a way.

677
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,560
Then tell me.

678
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,240
I can tell you,

679
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,400
but who will you find to do it?

680
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,120
The one who wrote this Death Incantation

681
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,840
is of master level.

682
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,880
And whoever
tries to break it will take risks.

683
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,080
Their concentration must be diamond-hard.

684
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,480
If they falter for even a moment,

685
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,840
the curse transfers onto them.

686
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,040
And then what happens?

687
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,160
If the curse was written for death,

688
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,840
the breaker dies.

689
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,320
The bandits can't be far.

690
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,680
The tracks are clearer now, Sir.

691
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,760
Tell everyone to prepare for battle.

692
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,080
- You've got guts coming here.
- Welcome to hell.

693
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,960
Khun Pra Chuay Chaikonlaseuk.

694
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,120
You even know my name?

695
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,640
There's nothing about your side

696
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,880
that we don't know.

697
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,440
Gunmen!

698
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,120
Shields!

699
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,400
Fire!

700
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,640
Go.

701
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,200
Fire!

702
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,480
Fall back!

703
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,440
Kill them all!

704
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,760
Surround them!

705
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,880
S

706
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,560
Dear!

707
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Dear.

708
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,240
Dear, take this medicine.

709
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,560
Chew it. Chew it.

710
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,880
<i>I can tell you,</i>

711
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,280
but who will you find to do it?

712
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,480
<i>And whoever</i>
<i>tries to break it will take risks.</i>

713
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,120
<i>If the curse was written for death</i>
<i>the breaker dies.</i>

714
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,760
You've sacrificed so much for the city.

715
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,520
Now it's time for me to sacrifice for you.

716
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,200
THREE SEN

717
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,880
Khun Pra Saming, you're truly skilled.

718
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,400
The situation is dire now.

719
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,560
When will the Eastern guns
arrive at the earliest?

720
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,280
Within seven days, Sir.
It should be in time to defend the city.

721
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,400
<i>Today, no one must enter this room,</i>

722
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,280
<i>not even Father.</i>

723
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,360
What are you going to do, Madam?

724
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,920
I cannot say.

725
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,440
EID

726
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,920
<i>Did the curse transfer to you?</i>

727
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,880
Yes, but I've decided it was worth it.

728
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,440
So, I did it.

729
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,240
<i>I must say,</i>

730
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,480
Lady Kamduang may not last past tonight.

731
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,640
