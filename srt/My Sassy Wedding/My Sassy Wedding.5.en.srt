1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Today's incident startled Mr. Chadwick.

2
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,400
And it has damaged
Thung Yai City's reputation.

3
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>They used a lock-picking technique,</i>
<i>one used by a certain group of thieves.</i>

4
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,520
<i>The one I suspect most is Thong,</i>

5
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,240
<i>the prisoner who just escaped.</i>

6
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,240
Thank you, sir,

7
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,400
for helping me.

8
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
This isn't money?

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,720
<i>What did you just say?</i>

10
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,560
The evidence used against him is…

11
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,160
The perfumed sachet that Yeesoon gave Aek.

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
<i>He was holding it when he died,</i>

13
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,320
<i>not planted afterward.</i>

14
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,240
You suspect me, don't you?

15
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,160
With evidence this strong,

16
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,800
how could I not?

17
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
Why take my husband?

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,680
He's being taken to the city officials.
Your husband is a murder suspect.

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,960
Khun Aek.

20
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,520
You're a murderer. You killed Thong.

21
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,720
A prisoner has escaped, Sir.

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,720
How did he get out?

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
I really don't know, Sir.

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
Gather more men!

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
Surround the area and catch him! Go!

26
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,120
Yes, Sir!

27
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,360
Stop.

28
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,200
- Arrest him.
- Why are you arresting me?

29
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,800
You still have the audacity to ask?
You broke out of prison!

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
What? I'm not a prisoner!

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,840
If not, then why are you in shackles?

32
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,400
Shackles? I was just practicing running!

33
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,120
See? It's just a rope.

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,960
A decoy?

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
You're breaking someone out, aren't you?

36
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,960
Let's go back now!

37
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,360
Let's go.

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
Hey.

39
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
- How'd you get in?
- Buffalo-throwing punch!

40
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,160
Dear.

41
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,279
Dear. Dear.

42
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,399
Dear.

43
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,680
Dear. Dear. Dear.

44
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,280
It's me.

45
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,280
You must have been drugged with smoke.

46
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Hold on. I'll help you.

47
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,120
No…

48
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
Run…

49
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,840
Dear.

50
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,960
Kamduang…

51
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,280
You're conscious now.

52
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,920
I'm going to get you out of here.

53
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
Don't. Listen carefully.

54
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,840
You still have time
to run away from this town.

55
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,080
Go now.

56
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,640
I'm not running away.

57
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,520
I need to take responsibility.

58
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
What do you mean?

59
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
I had the sachet for a while.

60
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,840
I meant to return it,
but we kept fighting.

61
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I almost threw it away, but felt guilty

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,320
because I didn't return it to the owner.

63
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,560
What's that got to do with anything?

64
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,480
I just threw it away at the temple.

65
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,440
What?

66
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,440
You said you wanted to forget the owner.

67
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,040
So I threw it away.

68
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,800
Someone must've found it
and used it to frame you.

69
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,520
It's all my fault.

70
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,920
Whoever's fault it is doesn't matter.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,480
You must run now.

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Let's run together.

73
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,000
I can't. Only you can go.

74
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,000
You didn't kill anyone.

75
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,720
Why stay here and let them torture you?

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
Because I didn't do anything wrong.

77
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,240
That's why I have to
face the charges and fight.

78
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,200
You're being foolish.
You'll die before you realize.

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,280
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you.

80
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm not mad.

81
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,960
You just don't understand.

82
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,280
Still, thank you
for risking your life to save me,

83
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,040
and for telling the truth.

84
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,000
This might be the end of us in this life.

85
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
Dear!

86
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,040
Run away now.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
- Dear…
- Go now.

88
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,480
- Did anyone sneak in here?
- No, Sir.

89
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,680
Spread out and find them!

90
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,040
Yes, Sir.

91
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,520
Go now.

92
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
Who gave you the antidote?

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,920
Who?!

94
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,720
Who?!

95
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,800
He was drugged with smoke
and was unconscious.

96
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,000
I used a hot remedy to wake him.

97
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,200
He said he wouldn't make it

98
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,559
and told me to flee.

99
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,520
That Khun Sajja!

100
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,039
He did this to my son.

101
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,280
I'll kill him!

102
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,040
Kamduang,

103
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
just run like Aek said.

104
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,880
I'll cover your fee.

105
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm not leaving.

106
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,360
Kamduang.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,960
You can't stay here.

108
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Khun Aek and Khun Pra Chuay are
noblemen. They know how serious this is.

109
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,200
Vet Yoy's right.

110
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,280
Even if you confess
that you threw the sachet away,

111
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,920
it's gone too far now.

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,880
It's no use blaming you.

113
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,200
Both of you, just go.

114
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,680
No. I'll stay and help him.

115
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,840
Kamduang!

116
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,920
I'll tell you what.
This doesn't just affect Aek.

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm in danger too.

118
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm telling you to run.
Run away while you still can.

119
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,240
Kamduang, as your uncle, this is my order.

120
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,600
Pack up and leave now.

121
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
I have to help him.

122
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,480
This is my responsibility.

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,480
Who helped you?

124
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,480
Will he die, Sir?

125
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
Who cares?

126
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,400
He dares defy me.

127
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,920
You're the one who went too far.

128
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,200
Khun Sajja.

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
Get Khun Aek out and call the doctor.

130
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
Yes, Sir.

131
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Khun Pra Chuay.

132
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,160
What are you doing here?

133
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I heard Khun Sajja went too far
and was abusing Khun Aek,

134
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,040
so I came to speak with him

135
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,000
and to visit Khun Aek.

136
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,880
When I arrived,

137
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,400
I saw him torturing Khun Aek.

138
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,720
He really went too far.

139
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
I've already ordered him to be flogged.

140
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
I've had the doctor examine Khun Aek.

141
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,040
He's not in danger,
but he'll need time to recover.

142
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,320
You came just in time.

143
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
Tomorrow,

144
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,240
I'll give Khun Aek
a chance to defend himself.

145
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,920
You're well-versed in the law.

146
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,320
Figure out the defense.

147
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,440
If he clears his name,

148
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,640
he can return to his duties.

149
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,920
If not,

150
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,800
I'll appoint Khun Men
to handle the gun negotiations instead.

151
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,520
Yes, Sir.

152
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
A chance to defend himself?

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,320
What?

154
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,200
Khun Pra Saming's giving Khun Aek
a chance to defend himself?

155
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,840
Yes.

156
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,200
He must've softened.

157
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400
He probably wants
his close friend to avoid punishment.

158
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,760
It's alright.

159
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,480
I believe it won't be easy
for him to talk his way out.

160
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,920
I didn't leave behind any evidence.

161
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,440
Good.

162
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,640
Then,

163
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,800
tomorrow,
we'll sit in on the investigation.

164
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,360
If it looks like he's making progress,

165
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,160
keep questioning and cornering him.
Got it?

166
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
Yes, Father.

167
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,280
If you want to leave, I won't stop you.

168
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I won't say anything.

169
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
Good luck then. I'm off.

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
You're really going?

171
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,600
Just kidding.

172
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,760
Whoa, you scared me.

173
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
Honestly, I don't want you to go either.

174
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,920
I couldn't leave you alone anyway.

175
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,040
So? Have you figured out

176
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,680
how to help Khun Aek yet?

177
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,760
Give this to Khun Pra tomorrow.

178
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,280
Not before.

179
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
What is it?

180
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
A plan to help Khun Aek.

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,760
Are you serious, Kamduang?

182
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,800
What? Kamduang's going to--

183
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,160
I think that's too risky.

184
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
You should've stopped her.

185
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,080
She knew I'd try.

186
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,560
That's why she sent Vet Yoy
to deliver the letter this morning.

187
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,200
It's too late already.

188
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,720
Thong's case is a major one.

189
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,080
I asked to join the investigation.

190
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,200
I hope you don't mind, Khun Aek.

191
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,040
Please do.

192
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
Let's speak plainly.

193
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,640
I have nothing to hide.

194
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,160
Thong stole documents from Mr. Chadwick

195
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,560
and ended up dead.

196
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,760
He was found with a sachet
embroidered with your name.

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
Got anything to say?

198
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,720
KHUN AEK

199
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,120
I had nothing to do with Thong's death.

200
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,720
Yes, the sachet was mine,

201
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,440
but I lost it before all this happened.

202
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,480
As far as I know,

203
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,240
that sachet was a gift from Yeesoon

204
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,200
when you were lovers.

205
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,960
Yes.

206
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
If it was that important,
you'd have kept it close.

207
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,880
But when it went missing,
you didn't even look for it?

208
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,160
That's suspicious.

209
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,800
But if you say you killed Thong

210
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,840
and lost it in a panic,

211
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,000
I think that makes more sense.

212
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,960
But that sachet was large.

213
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,200
Khun Aek would've noticed it.

214
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,640
Honestly, I think it's obvious

215
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,760
someone planted it

216
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,720
to frame him.

217
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,160
That makes more sense.

218
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,640
Who would frame him?

219
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,720
The only one who stood
to benefit from those documents

220
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,480
was Khun Aek.

221
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,360
What if he's working
with the bandits who raided the residence?

222
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,760
Over a single perfumed sachet,

223
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm being accused of treason?

224
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,520
You may be angry.

225
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
But I'm just stating facts.

226
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
If you can't clear your name,

227
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,160
everyone will have doubts,

228
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,480
including me.

229
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,800
Thong might've found the sachet
and just picked it up off the street.

230
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,600
Petty thieves like him

231
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,360
take whatever they find.

232
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
From what I know,

233
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,440
Thong was a serious thug,

234
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,359
not a petty thief.
He wouldn't collect trash.

235
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,359
How would you know?
Have you been to his house?

236
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,880
No,

237
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
but if you don't believe me,
let's go to his house.

238
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,599
Let's not go that far.

239
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,040
It's a waste of time.

240
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,960
Let's check the house to be sure.

241
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,200
If he was a hoarder like you said,

242
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,920
maybe your defense

243
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,240
might sound a little more convincing.

244
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,760
Shall we go to Thong's house then?

245
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,800
What kind of junk was this guy collecting?

246
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,880
PRA SAMING

247
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,480
PRA SAMING

248
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,480
All clear, Sir.

249
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,160
With a place this empty,

250
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,200
if he was a hoarder,

251
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,680
it would be packed with things.

252
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,880
It wouldn't be this empty.

253
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
I think

254
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,120
Khun Aek's excuse is falling apart.

255
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,320
What do you think, Khun Pra Saming?

256
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,120
Seems you're right.

257
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,160
If there's nothing else, let's head back.

258
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,480
Khun Pra Saming can rule on the case.

259
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,480
Wait.

260
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,800
PRA SAMING

261
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,680
What's this?

262
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,800
Why would Thong embroider
your name on the sachet?

263
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,760
He didn't.

264
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
This is my sachet.

265
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeesoon made it for me.

266
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,240
We all know

267
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,040
Yeesoon and Khun Pra Saming are close.

268
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,480
That sachet was a token of love.

269
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,680
But it was found in Thong's home.

270
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,520
What do you think of that,
Khun Pra Mek and Khun Men?

271
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,120
Thong must've stolen it.

272
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,600
Then what about Khun Aek's sachet,

273
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,080
also from Yeesoon?

274
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,760
Khun Pra Mek, Khun Men,

275
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,440
what do you think?

276
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,120
There's no other way to see it.

277
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
It must've been stolen too.

278
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
I think someone may have planted my sachet

279
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,600
in Thong's house

280
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,560
to help Khun Aek.

281
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,280
That's possible, Sir.

282
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,160
I agree.

283
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
Thong's house isn't secure.

284
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,200
Anyone could've snuck in.

285
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,280
But if it's easy to plant something

286
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,240
to help Khun Aek,

287
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,080
it's just as easy to plant evidence

288
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
to frame him.

289
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,880
Right?

290
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,920
So this sachet is unreliable as evidence.

291
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,440
Therefore,

292
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,760
I rule…

293
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,320
to dismiss the charges.

294
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,960
Damn it! That bastard!

295
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,520
They planned this all along.

296
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,200
They must've stolen
Khun Pra Saming's sachet

297
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,840
and planted it in Thong's house.

298
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,920
We fell right into their trap.

299
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,120
Shall we go to Thong's house then?

300
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,920
Let's not go that far.

301
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,600
It's a waste of time.

302
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,160
We handed it to them on a silver platter.
Fell straight into their game.

303
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,480
Stealing something
from the Governor's mansion isn't easy.

304
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,120
No ordinary thief could do that.

305
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,720
Even Thong wasn't that skilled.

306
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm wondering

307
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,360
who helped him.

308
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,400
Tomorrow, let's go make merit
to ward off bad luck.

309
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,360
Bring Kamduang too.

310
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,560
I was already planning on it.

311
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,520
Yip.

312
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,520
- Yes, Sir?
- Where's Kamduang?

313
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,040
She went straight into her room
after coming back.

314
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,560
She told me not to let anyone disturb her.

315
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,560
Kamduang!

316
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,720
Kamduang.

317
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,320
Kamduang.

318
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,600
Kamduang.

319
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
What happened?

320
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Dear…

321
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,400
What did Khun Pra Saming say?

322
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,520
Did my plan work?

323
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,640
Yes.

324
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,720
He dismissed the case.

325
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm sorry…

326
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,440
I got you into this.

327
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,920
It was all my fault.

328
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
Don't worry about that now.

329
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,800
Why are you so badly hurt?

330
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,040
When I was leaving Thong's house,

331
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,920
I was shot with a crossbow
by one of the guards.

332
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,440
I couldn't dodge it.

333
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,240
Hey! Who's that?

334
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,520
Hey!

335
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,880
But don't worry.

336
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
They didn't see my face.

337
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,480
Thung Yai's guards poison their arrows.

338
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,120
The wound won't stop bleeding.

339
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
But don't worry.

340
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,560
I know how to treat it.

341
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,680
- Yip.
- Yes, Sir?

342
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,400
- Go to Dr. In's shop. Get the medicine.
- Yes, Sir.

343
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,240
The bleeding has stopped.

344
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,080
How are you feeling?

345
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,480
I feel tired…

346
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,200
You lost a lot of blood.

347
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,880
Rest now.

348
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,440
I'll get you something to eat.

349
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Don't worry, Uncle. I'm healing.

350
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,280
A weapon wound like that
isn't just a knife scratch.

351
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,640
It won't heal so easily.

352
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,400
You're still in pain, aren't you?
I can tell.

353
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,160
To not be suspected,

354
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,000
you mustn't leave the house. Understand?

355
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Yes.

356
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,200
And don't defy me again, like last time.

357
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,840
Alright.

358
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,600
Sir,

359
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,280
Khun Pra Saming and Khun Men are here.

360
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,080
Tell them to wait in the pavilion.

361
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,960
Yes, Sir.

362
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,200
I have something urgent to discuss.

363
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,640
So I came here.

364
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,280
Of course, Sir.

365
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,240
Then I'll excuse myself.

366
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,960
Please stay.

367
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,560
This concerns you too.

368
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,280
There are two matters.

369
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,520
I'll let Khun Men explain the first.

370
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
When we searched Thong's house,

371
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,560
one guard said he spotted someone running

372
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,600
and shot at them with a crossbow.

373
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,280
He later found
the bolt stuck in a banana tree,

374
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,520
stained with blood.

375
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,720
Please forgive me. I'm scared.

376
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,160
What's going on?

377
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,760
I'm apologizing to Lady Tanee.

378
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,320
The guard thought
that banana tree was Lady Tanee.

379
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,720
That same night, my maid Waen

380
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,920
saw Yip,

381
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,080
your maid,

382
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,120
at the apothecary

383
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,680
buying blood-clotting medicine.

384
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,440
Khun Men finds it all too coincidental.

385
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,680
Why was your maid buying such medicine?

386
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,080
Fine. It's already come this far.

387
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,440
Ask whatever you want to ask.

388
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Good.

389
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,120
Then let me ask you frankly.

390
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,480
The one who stole Khun Pra Saming's sachet

391
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,880
and planted it in Thong's house was…

392
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
him.

393
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,040
He's the culprit.

394
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,360
Here it is.

395
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,679
This is my boss's room.
The guy who hired him is inside.

396
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
It's still warm.

397
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
He must've sensed we were coming and fled.

398
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,800
I was told you're new here.

399
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,719
You claimed to be Kamduang's kin,

400
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,440
but might actually be a bandit.

401
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,440
These are serious suspicions.

402
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,880
I came to see if they're true.

403
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,120
I don't know anything.

404
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
You act mysterious.
Maybe you practice dark magic.

405
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,360
If you're innocent, drop your pants.

406
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,560
Just pants? That's not enough.

407
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,440
Go on, look.

408
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,480
See any wounds? Look.

409
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,200
Turn around.

410
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,120
Enough!

411
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,320
Here! Put something on.

412
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,000
You're blinding everyone.

413
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,960
Don't worry.

414
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,400
I'll help you see something else tonight.

415
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,880
Oh.

416
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,760
Dear.

417
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,280
You might not know that the medicine

418
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,920
I had Yip buy

419
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,120
can be used to treat internal bleeding
when mixed with other kinds of medicine.

420
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,680
Your accusations caused real harm.

421
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,880
What you do today

422
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,520
is really serious.

423
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,640
First,

424
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
you insulted me

425
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,920
in front of my wife and servants.

426
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,240
Second,

427
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,720
you falsely accused an innocent man.

428
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,640
Third, you used Khun Pra Saming as cover

429
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,360
to disgrace me.

430
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
Three offenses.
How will you take responsibility?

431
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,400
I was reckless. I apologize.

432
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,520
For Khun Pra Saming's sake,

433
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,280
I forgive you.

434
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,080
Alright, alright.

435
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,240
I also came here because
what Khun Men suspected seemed valid.

436
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,360
Now that it turned out to be a mistake,

437
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,760
I ask that you both reconcile.

438
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,080
Don't let today's events
drive a wedge between you.

439
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,200
Understand?

440
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,240
‪Understood.

441
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,600
But don't do it again.

442
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,200
Understood.

443
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,040
You said you had two things to discuss?

444
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,800
Yes, there's another one.

445
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,280
Khun Men doesn't know about it.

446
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,680
I also just found out this morning.

447
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,880
Your sachet found with Thong

448
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,600
had grass sprouting on it.

449
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,920
Sergeant Boonchai confirmed
it's the same kind growing at the temple.

450
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,160
There must've been
some grass seeds stuck to the pouch.

451
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,520
That means you really lost it
at the temple.

452
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,120
You're officially cleared.

453
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,400
You may resume the gun negotiations,

454
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,680
Khun Aek.

455
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,960
Yes, Sir.

456
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I'll give this back to you.

457
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,080
I already have a wife.

458
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,640
I no longer need it.

459
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,400
I'll take my leave.

460
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,080
Are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

461
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,960
Just like an ant bite.

462
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,600
Must be an ant the size of an elephant.

463
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,680
That jump might have torn the wound open.

464
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,240
I did it to make them believe
and stop suspecting.

465
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,680
I'll treat it for you.

466
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,440
- Yip.
- Yes, Sir?

467
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,120
- Help me grind some herbs.
- Yes, Sir.

468
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,360
‪KHUN AEK

469
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,920
You don't need to do that.

470
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,240
I can do it myself.

471
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,720
You can't.

472
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,120
But… I'm shy.

473
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,800
Then close your eyes.

474
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,800
You should close your eyes,

475
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,160
not me.

476
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,200
That's my ankle.

477
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,920
That's my knee.

478
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,280
Dear.

479
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,760
What you're about to touch

480
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,800
is my lotus flower!

481
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,320
I think I should open my eyes
and you should close yours.

482
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,160
Otherwise, this won't be done.

483
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,360
How are you feeling?

484
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,960
Does it still hurt?

485
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,040
It still hurts,
but it's much better than yesterday.

486
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,000
Then we'll keep changing the herbs often
so you heal fast.

487
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,600
Eat first, take your medicine,
and I'll clean the wound afterward.

488
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,160
Yes.

489
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,080
That's not necessary.

490
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,040
My legs are injured,

491
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,600
not my arms.

492
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,360
Don't be stubborn.

493
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,720
You risked your life
and got hurt to help me.

494
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Let me do something for you.

495
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,400
If you can laugh,
you must be fully healed.

496
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,720
You can test it.

497
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,280
Whoa.

498
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,400
What's with the yelling?

499
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,080
You're bleeding!

500
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,480
Bleeding?

501
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,760
Oh.

502
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Oh.

503
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,960
I'm sorry. I was too rough.

504
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,440
Seeing you healthy again

505
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,280
puts me at ease.

506
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,280
Kamduang…

507
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,760
Kamduang, Kamduang!

508
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,560
Oh.

509
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,080
I nearly suffocated because of this.

510
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,480
The bleeding's stopped now.

511
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,080
Now that you're all better,
I won't worry anymore.

512
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,760
I'm off to work.

513
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,880
Alright.

514
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,680
I've prepared the tent

515
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,080
for you already, Sir.

516
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,040
We'll rest here tonight.

517
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,040
The ash scattering ceremony is tomorrow.

518
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,720
You take the bed. I'll sleep on the mat.

519
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,600
Khun Men is spying on us

520
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,320
from his tent.

521
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,320
He still suspects me?

522
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,800
He's not a fool.

523
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,440
He won't trust us easily.

524
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,640
Why's he staring so long?

525
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,440
- He stopped a while ago.
- Oh?

526
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,720
But you never know when he'll look again,

527
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,440
so I better keep holding you like this.

528
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,480
Won't he wonder

529
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,080
why a husband
keeps hugging his wife all day?

530
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,360
Maybe.

531
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,120
But if I had a real wife,
I'd hug and kiss her all day and night.

532
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,760
Huh?

533
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,640
Then I'd be pregnant
with a whole elephant herd by now!

534
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,320
Yes.

535
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,160
But since you're just my fake wife,

536
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,800
I'd never do such things.

537
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,280
Then stop hugging me.

538
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,400
That was right. I couldn't breathe.

539
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,240
I didn't want to hug you.

540
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,760
I only did it to fool Khun Men,

541
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,000
not for any other reason.

542
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,200
Is it tasty?

543
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,200
Not really.
I just wanted to know what it tasted like.

544
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,080
So what does it taste like?

545
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
Oh.

546
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,840
Ugh. Tastes like dog piss.

547
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,400
That's because a dog peed right there.

548
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,320
Huh?!

549
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,520
I didn't know you liked
the taste of stray dog piss.

550
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,920
Eat up.

551
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,800
Sweetheart,

552
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,840
mind your language.

553
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,360
And if you're going to argue with someone,

554
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,920
make sure they're your equal.

555
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,840
A swan pecking a crow

556
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,760
is just unsightly. Don't do it again.

557
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,120
I understand, Mother.

558
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,360
Kamduang, do you think
what my mother said was right?

559
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,800
I don't know about metaphors,

560
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,440
but if it's a fight you want, say so.

561
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,360
I'll knock both mother and daughter flat.

562
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,440
How crude.

563
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,000
No wonder Khun Aek
couldn't keep his pants on around you.

564
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,400
You gave yourself to him,
and he had to marry you.

565
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,960
Such a leech.

566
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,160
My, my.

567
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,120
Don't insult her like that.

568
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,040
People are different.

569
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,360
You're lucky to be raised

570
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,160
as a proper lady,

571
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,840
not a promiscuous, low-class woman.

572
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,160
Some people aren't so lucky.

573
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,920
They had no parents to teach them.

574
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,560
That's too much.

575
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,240
Do you want to fight?

576
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,240
Do you?

577
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,400
What's with the shouting?

578
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,000
Nothing, sir.

579
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,040
We just passed by

580
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,560
and saw Kamduang alone,
so we came to keep her company.

581
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,600
You two are always glued to each other.

582
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,840
Why are you separated now?

583
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,240
It's a husband and wife thing.

584
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,280
You might not understand.

585
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,760
You don't have one.

586
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,360
Well, I could never
rival you in this matter.

587
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,480
So many women are chasing after you,
but I wonder, which one you love the most?

588
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,320
Of course, this one.

589
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,760
If he doesn't love his own wife,

590
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,480
who else would he love? A dog?

591
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,120
Watch your mouth.

592
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,840
I'll have to punish you at the tent.

593
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,720
Dear!

594
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,760
I love punishments. I'll talk more.

595
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,040
Dog, dog, dog…

596
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,520
You're getting bold.

597
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,880
I'll make sure you learn your lesson.

598
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,600
Dear!

599
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,360
You're really carrying me?

600
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,360
- Didn't you say you wanted punishment?
- Oh, dear.

601
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,800
You're mad
because I insulted Yeesoon, right?

602
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,360
You have no idea

603
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,240
what she said to me first.

604
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,720
I don't. I only know
Yeesoon's a proper lady.

605
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,760
She wouldn't make a scene like you.

606
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,040
A proper lady? Yeesoon?

607
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,920
Ugh! I could puke!

608
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,080
She's 100 times more ladylike than you.

609
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,400
Such filthy language!
How dare she call me a dog!

610
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,280
My goodness.

611
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,560
So intense…

612
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,120
He's really strong.

613
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,720
Lucky girl.

614
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,840
I mean… poor girl.

615
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,400
Did you scold her yet, Mother?

616
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,320
I think scolding isn't enough.

617
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,080
She deserves worse.

618
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,480
What are you planning?

619
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,880
You've used a lot of energy.

620
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,280
Let's go eat.

621
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
No.

622
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,000
I'm too frustrated to eat.

623
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,280
"A hundred times

624
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,240
more ladylike than you."

625
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,520
I'm not giving in. I'm just hungry.

626
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,360
How was the food?

627
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,920
Delicious.

628
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,720
What happened, Yeesoon?

629
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,560
Mother's necklace is missing.

630
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,600
I don't know where I dropped it.

631
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,240
Standing around won't help find it.

632
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,440
Mother and I already searched everywhere.

633
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,840
If you don't know anything,
it's best not to speak.

634
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,600
Everyone here has noble blood,

635
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,280
except you.
No one knows where you come from.

636
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,000
What are you saying?

637
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,680
I'm saying

638
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,280
someone greedy might've picked it up
and chosen not to return it.

639
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,400
Kamduang was with me the whole time.

640
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,000
I doubt she took it.

641
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,680
Are you sure?

642
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,320
The whole time?

643
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,360
If you suspect me, search me,

644
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,480
or check my tent.

645
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,000
As if you'd hide it on your body.

646
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Alright.

647
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,160
For everyone's peace of mind,

648
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,320
let's do as Kamduang suggests.

649
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,800
Why stop me?

650
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,400
Afraid I'll find what you stole?

651
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,320
Enough stalling. We're already here.

652
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,680
Can Khun Pra Saming
and Khun Aek do the search?

653
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,640
Because frankly,
I don't trust anyone else either.

654
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,240
Did you find it, Khun Pra Saming?

655
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,920
It's your first time
seeing the sea, isn't it?

656
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,600
If you want to play in the sand, water,
or do whatever you like, go ahead.

657
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,280
<i>I've got the whole day for you.</i>

658
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,120
Thank you, husband.

659
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,280
There's something important
I want to talk to you about.

660
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,680
Yes?

661
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,880
Khun Pra Saming and Lady Yeesoon
are no longer together.

662
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,080
The gun deal is nearly finalized.

663
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,080
<i>I'd say the negotiation</i>
<i>went quite smoothly.</i>

664
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,000
<i>Once the gun contract is signed,</i>

665
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,720
your mission will be considered complete.

666
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,800
You can start preparing to head home.

667
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,200
Go collect a strand
of Kamduang's hair for me.

668
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,120
I want you to get revenge for me.

669
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,080
And how exactly do you want me
to deal with that woman Kamduang?

670
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,960
I want you to make them
fall in love with each other.

671
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,280
Sure.

672
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
