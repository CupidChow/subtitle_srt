1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
According to Thung Yai City tradition,

2
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,320
when a noblewoman passes,

3
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,360
the eldest son in every noble family

4
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,320
must enter monkhood.

5
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,800
That would be true

6
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
if not for one thing. My son, Khun Aek,

7
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,800
just got married
less than three months ago.

8
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,760
So I'm to play your wife?

9
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,720
I can't do this anymore.

10
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
What?

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,480
Have you ever been to Thung Yai before?

12
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,200
-It's my first time.
-I have a job for you.

13
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
This is my wife, Kamduang.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,120
What do you think
of my daughter-in-law now?

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
Even though we got rid of Khun Pra Mek,

16
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,000
she's still our biggest liability.

17
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,120
Get rid of Kamduang.

18
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,400
Uncle Yoy, where are you?

19
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,920
Uncle Yoy.

20
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,200
Uncle Yoy.

21
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,000
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

22
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,760
I've spoken to Father. You know too much.

23
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
I have to get rid of you.

24
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Get rid of me?

25
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,720
Yes.

26
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,840
I don't want to, but I have no choice.

27
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,440
I understand.

28
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,160
But promise me one thing.

29
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,880
Uncle Yoy and my men know nothing.
Let them go home.

30
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,120
Fine.

31
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
Then come at me.

32
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm not that easy to kill.

33
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,519
Are you insane?

34
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,720
I didn't mean I was going to kill you.

35
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Huh?

36
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
I meant you must
leave Thung Yai City tonight.

37
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,160
Make sure no one sees you.

38
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
Then what's with the club?

39
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,760
It's money. From Father.
He asked me to give it to you.

40
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,200
He's giving me this? For what?

41
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,600
In the foreign language,
it's called a bonus.

42
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
Bo-nuts?

43
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,960
No. Bonus.

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,600
It means extra pay.

45
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,640
You did a good job,

46
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
so you get more money.

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
Bonus?

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,680
I like bonuses.

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,000
Later tonight,
I'll take you to the city gate myself.

50
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,200
Kamduang? You're possessed
by a Phra Nakhon ghost, aren't you?

51
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
My sacred blade can help.

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Uncle Yoy!

53
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
What are you doing?

54
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm human, not a ghost!

55
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,320
This Phra Nakhon ghost is fierce! Die!

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm not possessed.

57
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,760
Khun Aek hired me to dress like this.

58
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,200
Really?

59
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Really!

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm still the same old Kamduang.

61
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,640
And where have you been?
I've been calling forever!

62
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
I went to take a dump.

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,280
And what's that?

64
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,640
A bonus.

65
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Why is she still dressed
like a Phra Nakhon lady?

66
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,240
That outfit's too flashy.

67
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
Ugh!

68
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,920
-Ugh!
-Come!

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,840
-Hurry!
-Please let me go.

70
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Don't stop.

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,440
Move!

72
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,040
Hurry!

73
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,680
I can't.

74
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,720
Please forgive me.

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,480
Please let me go.

76
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Come here!

77
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,000
Please let me go.

78
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,640
Go!

79
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
That's Muen Khao.

80
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
Is that your friend? Muen Khao?

81
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,280
Just an acquaintance.

82
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,840
He must've done something wrong.
Not our concern.

83
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,800
There's no one now. Let's go.

84
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
Those soldiers know me.

85
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,560
They won't ask questions.
Once you're at the gate, go straight out.

86
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,480
Thank you for today, Kamduang.

87
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,040
It was nothing.

88
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,280
Go on.

89
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,760
Kamduang?

90
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,600
What are you doing?

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,040
We've only known each other a day.
No need for such drama.

92
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,760
If you like me,

93
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,240
I appreciate it,
but there's no future for us.

94
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Stop babbling

95
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,040
and look over there, you blind bat!

96
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,320
The Governor? Khun Pra Yong?

97
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I thought it was someone else.
It was you, Khun Aek Itthirit.

98
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
And who's that?

99
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,040
She is my wife, Sir.

100
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
Stand up.

101
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,600
I heard you took a wife in Phra Nakhon,

102
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,760
which is why you didn't ordain
for Lady Sri's funeral.

103
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
I…

104
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
No need to worry.

105
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,400
The law made an exception for a reason.

106
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,400
Speaking of which…

107
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,800
Why the sigh, Sir?

108
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,280
It's Muen Khao.

109
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,840
When he heard Lady Sri had passed,

110
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,240
he faked an illness
to avoid the ordination.

111
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,560
How do you know he lied?

112
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
At one o'clock,

113
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,880
<i>he tried sneaking out with Doctor Kram.</i>

114
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,400
The gate guards got suspicious,

115
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
so they questioned him

116
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,520
until Doctor Kram confessed he was paid

117
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,640
to say Muen Khao had leprosy
to avoid the ordination.

118
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,920
I just saw them

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,520
being dragged away.

120
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,680
That's right.

121
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,040
They'll be whipped 30 times.

122
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,640
And they'll also be in jail.

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,280
It's Lady Sri's funeral.

124
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,240
I don't want to add more sin to my karma.

125
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,520
But the law is the law.

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm afraid they'll die under the whip.

127
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
How pitiful.

128
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,760
So what are you two doing
out here at this hour?

129
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,520
I…

130
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,680
Well…

131
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,880
What is it?

132
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
Well…

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,240
What?

134
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,160
We're gathering herbs, Sir.

135
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,520
This herb must be eaten fresh,

136
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,680
or it won't work.

137
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,640
No need to be embarrassed.
When I got married,

138
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,600
I ate that same herb.

139
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,000
It works wonders.

140
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,800
I bet you two

141
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,720
want to get back to your house now.

142
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Let's go back together.

143
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,880
Yes, Sir.

144
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,840
You'd better hurry.
That thing kicks in fast.

145
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
What kind of herbs did you give me?

146
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,160
Goat weed.

147
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,160
Goat weed?

148
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,440
They use it for mating buffaloes.

149
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,360
When a buffalo isn't in the mood,
they give it this,

150
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,640
and it gets so riled up
the pen can barely hold him.

151
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,360
The nobles know about it too.

152
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
And you gave it to me?

153
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,520
You're shameless!

154
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, come on. I was just helping you out.

155
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,400
None of those nobles got suspicious.

156
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,440
And now you're blaming me?

157
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,440
You can't leave town tonight,

158
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
probably not for several days.

159
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
Maybe a week.

160
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,840
What? A week?

161
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,720
You must play the role of my wife
even more convincingly.

162
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,240
I'll pay you more.

163
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,760
No. I want to go home to my father.

164
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,680
You can't.
The governor has seen your face.

165
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,120
You'll be punished too.

166
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,160
What does any of this have to do with me?

167
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
How does it not?

168
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,760
You played the role of my fake wife.

169
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,400
That makes you an accomplice
in fooling the governor.

170
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,760
You saw it yourself
what would happen if the secret got out.

171
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Muen Khao and Doctor Kram
got whipped 30 times

172
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
and were thrown in jail.

173
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,440
But if I must really act like your wife…

174
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,760
-Then I…
-I'll give you a bigger bonus.

175
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,440
Is that golden ginseng?

176
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,240
Yes. You know what it is?

177
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
Dad, are you okay?

178
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
It's fine.

179
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,200
This is normal when you've been cursed.

180
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,880
It'll pass.

181
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,240
You expelled the curse,
but it drained your energy.

182
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,400
That's why you're weak.

183
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,960
I'll buy you some good medicine.

184
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,720
Thank you, my daughter.

185
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,000
Do you have any tonic
that helps you recover quickly?

186
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,280
Yes. There, golden ginseng.

187
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,840
It's ancient Korean ginseng.

188
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,480
It's just what you want,

189
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,320
but it costs 100 times more
than what you just bought.

190
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,440
A hundred times more?

191
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,800
I'll never be able
to afford that in this lifetime.

192
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,320
I'll play your wife for real…

193
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,040
in exchange for that golden ginseng
as a bonus.

194
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,000
No.

195
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,240
That ginseng came all the way from Korea.

196
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,960
It's a family heirloom.

197
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,040
Then no deal.

198
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,160
You're unbelievably greedy.

199
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
And what you're asking me to do

200
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,840
isn't something a buffalo trader like me
agrees to easily.

201
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,640
Fine.

202
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,440
Deal.

203
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,880
What are you doing?

204
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
Writing my name to claim it.

205
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,240
I keep my word.

206
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,640
I'll go talk to Father.

207
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

208
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,960
KAMDUANG

209
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,120
What are you doing in my bed?

210
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,240
Well,

211
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,840
you told me to be your real wife.

212
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,040
Do whatever you want. I'm ready.

213
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,520
Why are you just standing there?

214
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,160
Sip some warm ginger tea.
It'll help clear your head.

215
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
My head is fine.

216
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,359
You noblemen
are always talking in riddles.

217
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,839
You told me to be your real wife,
so I thought I really had to be one.

218
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,080
I had you play the role of my wife
for strategic reasons.

219
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm a man of honor.
I don't take advantage of women.

220
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,320
I'm not some lust-crazed brute.

221
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,440
How would I know that? It's not written
on your forehead that you're a decent guy.

222
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,240
So if I really wanted you,

223
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,800
you'd just let me?

224
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,960
Yes. We made a deal.

225
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,240
For that golden ginseng?

226
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,680
Yes.

227
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Now that we're on the subject,

228
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,720
when I said real wife,

229
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,760
I meant from now on,

230
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,200
we have to act
like a married couple all the time.

231
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,280
-Even here in the house?
-Yes.

232
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,840
We can't trust the servants.
Walls have ears, doors have eyes.

233
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,080
One slip, and it could cost lives,

234
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
and something else too.

235
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,680
Your benefits, right?

236
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,120
That's none of your concern.

237
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,360
I didn't want to know anyway.
The less I know, the safer I am.

238
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,720
Fine. I get it.

239
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
No. We're not done yet.

240
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,560
According to the plan,
you're supposed to be a Phra Nakhon lady.

241
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,120
Right now,

242
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,480
you're like a wild stallion.

243
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,840
The way you act and the way you talk
are all wrong.

244
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,200
No one's paying that much attention.

245
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,360
We can't be careless.

246
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,520
Among the noblemen,

247
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,760
there are good and bad people.
But none of them are fools.

248
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,640
If you keep acting like this,
they'll figure it out in no time.

249
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,880
So what should I do?

250
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,640
That'll take time.

251
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,160
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
For now, go to sleep.

252
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,280
You sleep on the bed. I'll sleep here.

253
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,720
Oh.

254
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,360
That thing kicks in fast.

255
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,120
What are you doing?

256
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Didn't you say you were a decent man?

257
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,440
That you're not some lust-crazed freak?

258
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,720
Be my wife, Kamduang.

259
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,120
Please, be my wife.

260
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,920
What do I do now?

261
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,200
My wife.

262
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,920
My wife.

263
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,960
My goodness.

264
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,960
My wife.

265
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,360
My wife, where are you?

266
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,240
My wife.

267
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,000
My wife.

268
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
My wife.

269
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,080
My wife, where are you going?

270
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,840
Oh my.

271
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,120
My wife.

272
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,240
My wife, where are you?

273
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,560
Are you in there?

274
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,560
Are you here?

275
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,240
Good. Stay here.

276
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,640
Don't come out.

277
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,160
You smell very good.

278
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,400
Since you're already in the jar,
let's just become husband and wife.

279
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,720
No!

280
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,480
You can't. You're only into me
because of that herb's effect!

281
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,560
-Herb?
-Yes!

282
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,520
My sweet, sweet medicine…

283
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,400
Be my wife, please.

284
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Whoa.

285
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,480
Where do you think you're going,
my precious darling?

286
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm sorry.

287
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,720
Why is it so hard?

288
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,000
Kamduang, you brought this on yourself.

289
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,200
Hey, let go of me.

290
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,520
Where are you running off to, darling?

291
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,400
Be mine, won't you?

292
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,160
What happened?

293
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,800
Why are you here?

294
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,680
So, the goat weed wore off.

295
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,600
Were you trying to take advantage of me?

296
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,640
How shameless!

297
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,200
Me? Do that to you?! You crazy man!

298
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,200
Don't even think about
laying an eye on my manhood!

299
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
You won't even see my thigh!

300
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,600
Whew.

301
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,680
That was close, Kamduang.

302
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,120
Please deliver this letter
directly to my father.

303
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,240
<i>Father, I have to take on</i>
<i>more work here in Thung Yai City.</i>

304
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,360
<i>The pay is good. I'm staying</i>
<i>with Uncle Yoy. Don't worry about me.</i>

305
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,680
<i>Once the job is done, I'll hurry home.</i>

306
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,920
<i>Take care of yourself. From Kamduang.</i>

307
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,360
This is my wife,

308
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
Kamduang.

309
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,840
From now on, call her

310
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,520
Madam.

311
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,560
Yes, Sir.

312
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,480
Nice to meet you.

313
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,000
I didn't know it.

314
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,200
My name is Kamduang. I'm from I--

315
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,440
I'm from Phra Nakhon.

316
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,440
It's my first time here in Thung Yai City,

317
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,960
so I'm not familiar
with the people or the place.

318
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,480
And it's also my first time being a Madam,
so I'm not used to that either.

319
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,760
And it's even my first time
having a husband.

320
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,640
Oh.

321
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm Aoi, ma'am.

322
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,120
I'm Juan, ma'am.

323
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm Yip.

324
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,160
Whatever you need,
just call on me anytime.

325
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,000
Thank you. You're locals,

326
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,160
so please look out for me.

327
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,000
Get me some garlic.

328
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,880
Suddenly, out of nowhere,

329
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,880
our house has a Madam,

330
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,600
like she just dropped from the sky.

331
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,000
No wedding.

332
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
I think it's kinda strange.

333
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,080
You're talking about me?

334
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,520
Oh no, Madam!

335
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,000
Please forgive me! My wretched mouth!

336
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,480
Bad mouth! Bad, bad mouth!

337
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,000
Yip!

338
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,960
-Stop!
-Bring it on!

339
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,840
You two are gonna
bash each other's heads in!

340
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,600
Granny, look at what she did.

341
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
I nearly had a heart attack.

342
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,640
Some say

343
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,080
when you're that scared,
even a flying cow will make you scream.

344
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
Cows don't fly!

345
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,920
That's what I meant. The master warned us

346
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,720
not to gossip,

347
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,360
but you just couldn't stop your mouth.

348
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,960
Well, I can't help being curious.

349
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,920
There was no wedding, no engagement.

350
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
I heard from Maen
at Khun Pra Yong's house.

351
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,440
-What?
-Tell us.

352
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,960
Yaem overheard
Khun Pra talking to his wife…

353
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,960
What is it?

354
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,760
-Tell us.
-Khun Pra…

355
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,120
admitted in a meeting

356
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,520
that our master…

357
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,640
Oh my goodness!
They got caught in the act?

358
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,640
In bed?

359
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,200
Whoa.

360
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,360
Keep your voices down
or we'll all get whipped.

361
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,960
That's why we suddenly
have ourselves a Madam.

362
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,800
-I see.
-So that's what happened.

363
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,960
Useless. You don't learn.

364
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Walk like a proper lady.

365
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,280
Are you mocking me?

366
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,160
Of course.

367
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,400
Don't be so bold.

368
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,560
Don't flick my ear again!

369
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,480
Go--

370
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,400
Go walk again.

371
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,920
Please, just walk
like a normal human being.

372
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,200
You jerk! You could've caught me!

373
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,880
What are you looking at?

374
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,800
No lady sits that way.

375
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,480
So what? My sitting posture offends you?

376
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,240
You are rude.

377
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,000
You must refer to yourself as "Nong"

378
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,120
and call me "Dear."

379
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,720
Dear? Yuck. That makes me cringe.

380
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,720
If you can't do that,
forget about any golden ginseng.

381
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,160
-Fine.
-Try it.

382
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,400
Dear…

383
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,160
it's so hot today.

384
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,080
Dear.

385
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,160
Don't leave the house.

386
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,360
If you need anything, tell the servants.

387
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,880
Why can't I…?

388
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,560
I…

389
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,480
That's correct.

390
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,080
It's so hard to say.

391
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,120
I…

392
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,120
I just moved to this city,

393
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
can't I go see people and temples?

394
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,560
No, because anyone who sees you

395
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,960
will know you're not a noblewoman.

396
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,520
If your father found out, he'd be furious.

397
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,720
I can't let him know.

398
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,960
I didn't tell him in the letter.

399
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,000
He'd be worried If he knew

400
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,680
I had to sleep in the same room as a man.

401
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,560
It's not that.
He'd probably be more worried

402
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,240
about Khun Aek.

403
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,000
Why does no one see me as a woman?

404
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,400
What's that?

405
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
<i>Kanom banduk.</i>

406
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,760
They say you can only find
a good one around here.

407
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,760
Do you have any more?

408
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
No. All gone.

409
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,040
If you want some,
you'll have to buy it at the market.

410
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
But Khun Aek won't let me leave.

411
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,400
He even told the servants
to keep an eye on me,

412
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,240
like he doesn't trust me.

413
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,600
But I think he's pretty smart, actually.

414
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,320
He thinks he can stop me?

415
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,760
Clearly, he doesn't know who Kamduang is.

416
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,520
Are you sure this is a good idea?
He said not to leave the house.

417
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,640
If he finds out, you'll be in trouble.

418
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,800
It's alright.

419
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,720
I want <i>kanom banduk.</i>

420
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,440
Let's go eat.

421
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,600
No, thanks.
I already had some this morning.

422
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
I'll go look over there.

423
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,960
Alright.

424
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,120
What brings you here, sir?

425
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,120
I've got a job for you.

426
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,639
This is based on my father's description.

427
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,920
It might not be exact.

428
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,840
Who is she?

429
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,920
Her name is Kamduang,
wife of Khun Aek Itthirit.

430
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,880
A nobleman's wife?

431
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,080
Are you scared?

432
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,400
I'm not scared,

433
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,800
but if she's a nobleman's wife,

434
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,400
it might cost more than the usual.

435
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,480
No problem.

436
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,880
Should I kill her or just kidnap her?

437
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,720
Kidnap her.

438
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,200
I've got questions for her.

439
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,400
This must stay secret.

440
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,000
Not a word to anyone.

441
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,800
You got it, sir.

442
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,240
Yeah, you.

443
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Who are you?

444
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,520
Come here. I've got something to show you.

445
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,120
No. If you want to
show me something, bring it here.

446
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,040
Hey!

447
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,560
This is what I wanted to show you.

448
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,200
What are you doing?

449
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,800
Help! Help!

450
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,000
Somebody help!

451
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,120
Help!

452
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,480
Buffalo-throwing punch!

453
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,320
This way.

454
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,560
This way. Hurry up.

455
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,040
Thong! You did this again.

456
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,640
I was starving,
so I tried robbing that woman.

457
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,560
You scumbag! This time you'll rot in jail!

458
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,440
He's a top-tier thug.
You're brave to have stopped him.

459
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,040
Just lucky.

460
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,760
He tripped on a stump.

461
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,800
Go! Take him.

462
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,320
Get up.

463
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,040
Are you okay? Thank you so much.

464
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,600
No worries.
We women have to help each other.

465
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,680
I'm Kamduang. What's your name?

466
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,320
I'm Ping.

467
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,200
I haven't seen you before.

468
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
First time in Thung Yai City?

469
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,960
Yes.

470
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,200
By the way,
wasn't there another thug? I saw two.

471
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
I have no idea. Just forget about them.

472
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,680
Let me treat you to a nice dessert shop.

473
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,280
Let's go.

474
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,000
-Go.
-Please don't hurt me.

475
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,720
That's my boss's room.

476
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,920
The guy who hired him is inside.

477
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,720
Who is he?

478
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,280
I don't know. Only Thong talked to him.

479
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,560
I never saw his face.

480
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,000
But if you want to know,
go see for yourself.

481
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,800
Alright.

482
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,680
That's what I use on buffalo.
It's much stronger than yours.

483
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
It's still warm.

484
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,160
He must've fled just before I got here.

485
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,280
I hear there are many gun companies.

486
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,000
Which ones have you contacted?

487
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,640
I'm currently in contact
with some interesting Western companies.

488
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,200
Good. Khun Aek.

489
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,880
Yes?

490
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,640
Aside from ranks and work,

491
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,920
we're close friends.

492
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,760
That's always how I've seen it.

493
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,120
Why do you say that?

494
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,840
You're married now.
Why didn't you tell me?

495
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,680
It's a long story.

496
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,320
Even Pra Mek

497
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,960
and my father have met your wife.

498
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,560
But not me, your closest friend.

499
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,600
She's very…

500
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,600
shy.

501
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,200
She's reserved and always avoids people.

502
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,120
She's also quite frail and sickly.

503
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,000
I heard it too. Could it be…?

504
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,520
Ah, here he is.

505
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,120
You're all giving me strange looks.

506
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,880
What's going on?

507
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,080
Well, we were just
talking about your wife.

508
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,720
You really picked quite the woman.

509
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,760
Right?

510
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,800
My wife? What about her?

511
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,920
Oh, so you haven't heard?

512
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,920
She went out walking in the market,

513
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,640
and somehow got into it
with that thug, Thong.

514
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,800
No one knows how she did it,
but she knocked him clean out cold.

515
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,240
When he woke up,
he couldn't even remember what happened.

516
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,520
The soldiers said he nearly died.

517
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,640
Right?

518
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,040
Looks like our little club

519
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,960
has found its new president.

520
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,480
Oh? I mean
the "Husbands Who Fear Their Wives" Club.

521
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,480
You really married someone fierce.

522
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,400
What did you just say?

523
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,240
Your wife was shy,

524
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,360
reserved, frail, and sickly?

525
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,480
Or is it that
you just didn't want me to meet her?

526
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,640
That's not it at all.

527
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,320
I'll arrange for you
to meet Kamduang soon.

528
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,920
Kamduang.

529
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,640
You really bring me trouble.

530
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,200
Thank you so much, Ping,
for bringing me to this amazing place.

531
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,120
I ate until I was stuffed.

532
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,280
I should be thanking you too.

533
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,880
I'm really glad we got to meet.

534
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,960
I don't have many friends around here.

535
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,400
Then let's be friends.

536
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,400
Are we cutting fingers or something?

537
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,200
No, it's a pinky promise!

538
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,280
Here, raise your pinky

539
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,320
and link it with mine.

540
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,440
This is a pinky promise.

541
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,480
It means we're officially friends.

542
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,960
Where I come from,
we call that being buddies.

543
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,000
Okay then. We're buddies now.

544
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,720

THRIVING AND PROSPEROUS BUSINESS

547
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,680
Boss,

548
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,520
today I encountered
the wife of Khun Aek Itthirit.

549
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,080
Her name is Kamduang.

550
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,760
I was following her,
trying to find a way to talk,

551
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,800
but she ran into a thug.
So I helped her out.

552
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,680
And now we're friends.

553
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,560
Well done. Stay close to her.

554
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,440
Understood.

555
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,920
That thug you sent me,

556
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I had him lead me to whoever hired him.

557
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,640
But the guy was sharp.
He caught on and fled before I got there.

558
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,680
Why would anyone want to kidnap me?

559
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,080
I'm nobody important.

560
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,560
You must be very careful.

561
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,560
This town may seem peaceful,
but it's dangerous.

562
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,680
Hey.

563
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,360
You startled me. Couldn't you
make a sound before barging in?

564
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,840
I did.

565
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,280
Are you satisfied now?

566
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,520
Yes.

567
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,160
Well then, I'll leave now.

568
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,560
Didn't I tell you not to go outside
under any circumstances?

569
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,440
Calm down…

570
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,360
I mean, Dear, calm down.

571
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,200
I…

572
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,800
I just went out to buy dessert!

573
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,920
To buy dessert?

574
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,640
And did buying dessert
include fighting with a thug?

575
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,960
Oh, that?
I thought it was about something else.

576
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,920
Something else?
The whole of city hall knows.

577
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,360
Was it Vet Yoy who took down the thug?

578
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,080
Everyone thinks it was you.

579
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,760
Now I'm married to a lady thug.

580
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,000
People are dying to meet you,
especially Khun Pra Saming.

581
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,400
Then let them meet me.
What's the big deal?

582
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,000
Even Khun Pra Mek has seen me already.

583
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,320
It's not the same.

584
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,640
Khun Pra Saming is sharp.
He'll figure you out for sure.

585
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,840
Unless…

586
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,960
Unless what?

587
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,280
You need to act like a proper lady.

588
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,560
Oh please, I've herded buffalo

589
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,280
across mountains before.

590
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,200
Being a lady?

591
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,520
It's not that hard.

592
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,640
Oh?

593
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,400
You've fallen head over heels for me,
haven't you?

594
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,720
Honestly, I didn't feel anything before.

595
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,320
But after seeing these mannerisms,

596
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
I just want to…

597
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,240
Kiss me on the cheek?

598
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,920
Chop you up! Chop! Chop! Chop!

599
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,360
And turn you into minced pork!

600
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,640
These clothes and ornaments

601
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,920
belong to Khun Aek's mother.

602
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,560
After she passed,
no one ever touched them again.

603
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,680
Khun Pra Chuay and Khun Aek
both kept them very dearly.

604
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,920
He must really love you

605
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,840
to open this chest for you.

606
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,960
Has his mother been gone a long time?

607
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,720
Yes, a long time. He was devastated.

608
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,640
I understand.

609
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,080
My mother passed away
when I was very young too.

610
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,560
Her belongings
are my most precious treasures.

611
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,640
Kamduang, I'm coming in.

612
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,560
Yes, come in.

613
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,280
Beautiful.

614
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,680
Beautiful?

615
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,520
What am I even looking at now?

616
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,520
It's hot.

617
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,480
It's even hotter.

618
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,400
Who did you complain about?

619
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,720
You, obviously.
You eat like you haven't eaten in days.

620
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,840
Then don't look!

621
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,640
A hungry girl
shouldn't worry about looking pretty.

622
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,240
Delicious!

623
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,560
It's so delicious.

624
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,760
Give me water.

625
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,400
Refreshing.

626
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,200
That was hand-washing water.

627
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,560
Are you trying to kill me?
I almost died over lunch.

628
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,360
You lunatic.

629
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,560
Maybe now you'll remember

630
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,520
not to eat like a starving pig.

631
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,000
Eat like a civilized person.

632
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,560
Oh, please.

633
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,440
Eat that slow and someone else
will finish the meal before you.

634
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,960
But you're a woman.

635
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,320
Who are you racing with? A buffalo?

636
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,240
I'll eat slowly.

637
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,360
You look like
a foreign lady doing a Thai dance.

638
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,000
You mean Western women dance beautifully?

639
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,760
So clumsy and improper.

640
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,600
I can't watch you do anything womanly.

641
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,120
You're not soft or gentle
when you touch or press anything.

642
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,000
Even your posture is all wrong.

643
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,760
Didn't I tell you how to sit properly?

644
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,960
Fold your legs in.

645
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,680
Tuck your legs in!

646
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,560
I'm sorry. My hand just moved on instinct.

647
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,080
Are you hurt?

648
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,480
I made it back.

649
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,520
I've been hearing shouting all morning.

650
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,400
Are the husband and wife fighting?

651
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,840
You could say that.

652
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,760
What were they arguing about?

653
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,880
I don't know.

654
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,200
I'm not nosy or anything.

655
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,640
I didn't mean to overhear either.

656
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,640
But you did.

657
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,040
Spill it now.

658
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,680
He said she's not soft or gentle
when she touches or presses anything.

659
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,160
Touch what? Press what, Yip?

660
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,320
-What?
-Granny!

661
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,120
-What is it?
-I don't know! I only heard sounds.

662
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,880
Use your imagination
according to your experience.

663
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,280
Oh.

664
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,760
I'm getting tingles.

665
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,040
Oh my.

666
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,200
Then he told her to spread her legs

667
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,080
and relax her body.

668
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,920
Whoa, I feel all tingly too.

669
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,920
Then what?

670
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,320
Then Khun Aek screamed.

671
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,840
-Was it loud?
-Echoed through the house!

672
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,000
Ow, Granny!

673
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,560
Then Madam said sorry.

674
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,720
My hand just moved on instinct.

675
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,840
My goodness!

676
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,160
Then Khun Aek said, "It's okay."

677
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,760
Let's start over.

678
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,680
What is that?

679
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,840
What's going on here?

680
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,120
Fueang! Who told you to yell like that?

681
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,840
Granny's about to faint.

682
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,480
I didn't mean to. Anyway, Yip.

683
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,800
-Yes?
-Khun Aek just left for City Hall.

684
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,640
He had a stack of papers
and he dropped this one.

685
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,800
Yip.

686
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,160
Yes, Ma'am?

687
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,040
Where are you going?

688
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,920
I'll deliver the book Khun Aek dropped

689
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
to the City Hall.

690
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,520
I'll deliver it myself.

691
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,840
It's a wife's duty.

692
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,280
Yes, Ma'am.

693
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,480
-Stop.
-Stop.

694
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,080
This is City Hall, not a rice field.

695
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,120
You can't bring a buffalo in. Get out.

696
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,360
You know nothing.
I'm the wife of Khun Aek Itthirit.

697
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,880
That means this buffalo
is an official noble buffalo!

698
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,840
Kamduang?

699
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,800
This Sunday there'll be a grand
merit-making ceremony for my mother.

700
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,440
Oh, and bring your wife, Kamduang.

701
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,000
Am I ladylike enough for that now?

702
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,920
I think you don't need to go
to the merit-making ceremony.

703
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,080
I need your help.

704
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,280
No problem.

705
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,680
I hear you've taken in a new maid.

706
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,200
Is this her?

707
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,400
This is Kamduang.

708
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,960
She's my wife.

709
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,680
Kamduang!
