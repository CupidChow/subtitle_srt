1
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,720
<i>In the past, there was a brutal gang</i>
<i>of bandits empowered by dark magic.</i>

2
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,320
<i>They plundered, burned,</i>
<i>and murdered without mercy.</i>

3
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
<i>Their boldness escalated</i>

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>to seizing homes and torching towns.</i>

5
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>Each city was forced to defend its land</i>

6
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
<i>from these vicious outlaws.</i>

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,800
<i>Thung Yai City was no exception.</i>

8
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,680
<i>When spears and swords were</i>
<i>no longer enough to resist such savagery,</i>

9
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,920
<i>new weapons from the Western world</i>
<i>became a vital hope,</i>

10
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>weapons with greater power</i>
<i>and precision. And that was guns.</i>

11
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
GUN

12
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
SIAM DURING THE REIGN OF KING RAMA V

13
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
Come on, slowly.

14
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,440
Everyone, listen carefully
to the birdcall. One of our men

15
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,600
will signal us through it.

16
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,920
They're here.

17
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,200
I am Cho-duek. If you don't want to die,

18
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,880
leave the buffalo and run.

19
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,720
I'll only kill the chief.

20
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
You're not Chief Yod.

21
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,720
- Hey!
- Hey!

22
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
- Follow him!
- He's running away.

23
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
This is tiger hair, Chief Yod.

24
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,600
I know about you

25
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,120
and the curse

26
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,760
after you killed that tiger.

27
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,400
I even know that
if even one strand touches you,

28
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,840
you're dead.

29
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,400
Get him.

30
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,760
You're not Chief Yod.

31
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,320
Buffalo-throwing punch!

32
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,240
Who are you?

33
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,160
I'm the daughter of Chief Yod.

34
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,200
A woman chief?

35
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,480
That's right.

36
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,120
I'm the female buffalo caravan leader.

37
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,480
If I were weak,
I wouldn't be here leading the herd.

38
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,960
I am Chief Kamduang!

39
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,400
CHIEF KAMDUANG

40
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Who the hell?! Argh!

41
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,840
Go easy!

42
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,080
You're not dead yet.
You'll get treated at the district hall.

43
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,040
Ugh…

44
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
Doctor,

45
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,520
can you put
some medicine on my wound for me?

46
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,960
I'm a buffalo vet, not a people doctor.

47
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,120
I castrate bulls and buffalo.
Want me to do that to you?

48
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,800
VET YOY

49
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,520
You didn't panic, did you, Yim?

50
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,160
Good boy.

51
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,640
Thank you so much.

52
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,880
Cho-duek knew black magic
to dive into the earth.

53
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
Magic?

54
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,960
He just dug a hole and dove in.

55
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,760
It's no sorcery.

56
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,400
No wonder he kept escaping.

57
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
He's been wanted for ages.

58
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,400
Really?

59
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,880
So, is there a bounty?

60
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,800
- I'm afraid not.
- Whoa.

61
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,240
So, where are you headed?

62
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,760
To deliver buffaloes to a customer

63
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,680
in Thung Yai City.

64
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,440
NORTHEASTERN REGION
THUNG YAI CITY

65
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,000
THUNG YAI CITY HALL

66
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,880
Boonchai,

67
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,800
are you done with the autopsy?
What's the result?

68
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,160
KHUN PRA MEKSAWANPHANSAENG - PRA MEK

69
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,520
Both of them

70
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
died from the same sword.

71
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,400
I suspect their killer

72
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,880
must be a sorcerer.

73
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,880
There are many factions of sorcery.

74
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,680
Can you tell which kind this is?

75
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
KHUN PRA CHUAYCHAIKONLASUEK -
KHUN PRA CHUAY

76
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,400
Whoever it was,

77
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,840
magic is no match for bullets.

78
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,680
Let's put that aside

79
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,760
and focus on arms procurement.

80
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,920
I believe we shouldn't underestimate them.

81
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
If they can kill soldiers,

82
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
they aren't just ordinary thieves.

83
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,960
KHUN AEK ITTHIRIT

84
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,600
Khun Aek, don't derail this.

85
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,120
We're here to discuss gun purchases.

86
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,080
Let's finish that.

87
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,680
Alright, where were we?

88
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,200
The capital

89
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,400
has approved firearms procurement
for defense, within reasonable limits.

90
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,720
I propose my son, Khun Men.

91
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,440
He's meticulous

92
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,720
and ideal for this task.

93
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,640
I am honored to serve the city.

94
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,320
But I think
Khun Aek Itthirit is more suitable.

95
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,720
How is she, Doctor?

96
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,920
PRAYA CHAMROON - CHIEF OF THUNG YAI CITY

97
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
The Lady has passed away, sir.

98
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,840
Mother…

99
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,360
KRUN PRA SAMING
YOUNGEST SON OF PRAYA CHAMROON

100
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,480
Khun Aek has led many important missions.

101
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,360
And most importantly,

102
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
he is fluent in English.

103
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,080
He's the ideal person
to negotiate with Westerners.

104
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,040
But Khun Men is meticulous.

105
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
He may not be fluent in English,

106
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,440
but he can use an interpreter,

107
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,720
or even have Khun Aek interpret for him.

108
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
If Khun Men is so meticulous,

109
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,760
perhaps he'd be better off
as a secretary to Khun Aek.

110
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,680
I'm not as good a secretary

111
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
as Khun Aek is an interpreter.

112
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,680
To interpret for me,

113
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,560
perhaps he wouldn't mind.

114
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,600
Negotiating with Westerners

115
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,880
requires more than a translator.

116
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,160
You need to understand their mindset.

117
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,640
Uncle, Khun Men, have either of you
ever met these foreigners?

118
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,560
I've encountered a few.

119
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,280
And you?

120
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,560
While I was in Phra Nakhon,

121
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,800
I spoke with many foreigners
from different nations.

122
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,600
I understand not just their character,

123
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,640
but also the policies
of different countries.

124
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
I not only learned how they think of Siam,

125
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,600
but also how they think of one another.

126
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,640
That gives us

127
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,800
an edge in the negotiation.

128
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,560
Then let's conclude.

129
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,280
We appoint Khun Aek

130
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,800
as the negotiator for purchasing firearms.

131
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
Any objections?

132
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,720
Then it's settled.

133
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,640
Khun Aek will lead the negotiation.

134
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,960
THE APPOINTED PERSON IS…

135
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,440
THUNG YAI GOVERNOR'S HOUSE

136
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,400
Mother,

137
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,280
may your spirit

138
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,360
watch over Father and me.

139
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Help us protect Thung Yai City.

140
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
Your mother is at peace now.

141
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,880
We must carry on with our duties.

142
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,640
Myself,

143
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,800
you,

144
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,400
and all the officials

145
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,520
and authorities.

146
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,120
Let us pay our respects to Lady Sri.

147
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,920
THE APPOINTED PERSON IS KHUN…

148
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,520
Apologies, Khun Pra Yong.

149
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,640
According to Thung Yai City tradition,

150
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,960
when a noblewoman passes,

151
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,960
the eldest son in every noble family
must enter monkhood

152
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,960
for one month. Is that correct?

153
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,000
That's correct.

154
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,160
Khun Aek is the only son
of Khun Pra Chuay.

155
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,560
He must therefore enter monkhood, right?

156
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,800
You're right.

157
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
My dear nephew,

158
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,200
tradition says you must be ordained first.

159
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,360
As for my family,

160
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Khun Ming,

161
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,480
Khun Men's older brother,
will be ordained.

162
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,760
So you can write Khun Men's name instead.

163
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,920
Wait.

164
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,200
That would be true…

165
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,240
if not for one thing.

166
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,600
My son, Khun Aek, just got married
less than three months ago.

167
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
By tradition, newlyweds are exempt.

168
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,840
Don't joke, Khun Pra Chuay.

169
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,720
When did Khun Aek get married?

170
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,280
Khun Aek is not a nobody.

171
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,200
If he truly married,
why didn't anyone hear of it?

172
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,800
While he was in Phra Nakhon last month,

173
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,040
he was caught in bed with a woman.

174
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,840
Her parents caught him red-handed.

175
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,320
He was forced to marry her.

176
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,640
I didn't say anything because…

177
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
well, it's disgraceful.

178
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,320
- I…
- Alright, alright.

179
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,840
No need to be shy.

180
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,640
Newlyweds are exempt.

181
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
It would only trouble the religion.

182
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,960
The rule understands the newlyweds.

183
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,760
So we proceed with Khun Aek
as the representative.

184
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
- Alright.
- Wait.

185
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,760
You said he just got married.

186
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,880
So that means

187
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,680
this Phra Nakhon bride

188
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,319
must be living here
in Thung Yai City, right?

189
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,599
Of course.

190
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,560
They just got married.
Where else would she be?

191
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
Strange question.

192
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,400
Then it's final.

193
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,599
Khun Aek will represent us
in the gun negotiations.

194
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,520
THE APPOINTED PERSON IS KHUN AEK ITTHIRIT

195
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,560
I will deliver this to the Governor.

196
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,600
The rest of us
should pay our respects to Lady Sri.

197
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,920
Khun Aek, Khun Men, Khun Ming,
you're exempt from this ceremony.

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,640
Only senior nobles may attend.

199
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
Go back.

200
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,320
Take care of your duties.

201
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,320
Yes, Sir.

202
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
About that marriage…

203
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,600
Would you like some?

204
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,280
How much is it?

205
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,880
Hey. I need your help.

206
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,240
What is it?

207
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,880
Will you be my wife? This afternoon.

208
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,720
You're a nobleman,

209
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,000
and handsome too. Sure!

210
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,640
Good. You'll pretend to be
from Phra Nakhon. You can't say "hi."

211
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,680
Don't say "hi."

212
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't say it?

213
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Alright.

214
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,400
I just said you can't say that.
Don't you understand?

215
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,200
Understood.

216
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,240
Whoa.

217
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,200
A Phra Nakhon girl with that accent?
Who'd believe it?

218
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
Jao Sua Kim!

219
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,720
Oh.

220
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,760
Hello.

221
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,680
How have you been?

222
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm good.

223
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,520
I heard your daughter, Nei,

224
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,880
has visited Phra Nakhon.

225
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,640
Yes, quite often.

226
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,840
Ms. Noey,

227
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,080
you don't say "hi," do you?

228
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,080
No, I don't.

229
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm just teasing you.

230
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,800
In that case,
may I marry her this afternoon?

231
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,600
That suddenly?

232
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,040
Very well.

233
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,680
I know Ms. Nei. You can't fool me.

234
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,280
My apologies, Jao Sua Kim.

235
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
I can't marry Ms. Nei.

236
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,080
What? You ask, then refuse?

237
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,440
How rude!

238
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,480
"Everyone in Thung Yai is invited

239
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,720
to come see
Uncle Thip's traveling theatre,

240
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,040
performing in Thung Yai

241
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,600
for the first time."

242
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,520
For the first time?

243
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,520
Only five buffalo left now.

244
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,480
Once we deliver those to
Khun Pra's residence, we'll be all done.

245
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,920
I could finish my first job

246
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,600
because of your help, Uncle Yoy.
Thank you so much.

247
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,440
No need. You're as sharp as your father.

248
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,320
But people say

249
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,720
if you say a job's done
before it really is, it might never be.

250
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,880
There's nothing left now.

251
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,040
Once we finish lunch, we'll go
deliver the buffalo, and it's done.

252
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Oh?

253
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,120
Hm?

254
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
Whoa.

255
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,080
- Hey!
- You jerk!

256
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,080
You slammed into me and knocked me flat.

257
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,080
Won't you apologize?

258
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,360
To be accurate,
we both bumped into each other.

259
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,400
You're lying.

260
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,080
You're the one who hit me.

261
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,520
You hit me. Don't twist it.

262
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I didn't hit you.

263
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
You did! Totally hit me!

264
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,080
No. I didn't.

265
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,200
You did.

266
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,560
I said I didn't.

267
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,920
I said I didn't hit you.

268
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,440
Kamduang, that's enough.

269
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,560
Kamduang?

270
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
You're a woman?

271
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,600
Alright, I apologize. Here's some money.

272
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,480
I'm not a beggar.

273
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't want your money.

274
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,840
Then what do you want?

275
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,600
A proper apology.
Do you know how to give one?

276
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,280
I already apologized. I won't do it again.

277
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
It's fine if you don't want money.

278
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,000
If you ever change your mind, let me know.

279
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,560
Kamduang!

280
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,240
Whoa.

281
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,520
You saw how arrogant he was.
He looked down on people.

282
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,920
I hate people like that.

283
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,760
I saw. But I'm telling you to stop.

284
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,960
You're here to sell buffalo,
not pick fights.

285
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,480
You're a buffalo trader,
not a street thug.

286
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,320
KHUN AEK

287
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,520
Khun Aek.

288
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,640
This looks important to him.

289
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
I'll tie it to a buffalo.

290
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,080
She's as rash as a man.

291
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,680
UNCLE THIP'S TRAVELING THEATER

292
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Uncle Thip, you've never performed
in Thung Yai City before, right?

293
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,240
Never. This is our first time.

294
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
I'd like to hire one of your actresses

295
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,800
for a job.

296
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,680
What kind of job, young man?

297
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
I'll tell you later.

298
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,200
Nothing indecent.

299
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,640
If there's money, sure.

300
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,240
Wait here.

301
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,440
Do you like her?

302
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,320
Yes. Alright.

303
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
I'll hire her.

304
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,600
THUNG YAI GOVERNOR'S HOUSE

305
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,160
Lady Sri left us too soon.

306
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm devastated.

307
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,080
She cared for this house
and the staff so well.

308
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,040
She should've had more years
beside the Governor.

309
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Please excuse me.

310
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,680
Khun Pra Chuay?

311
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,240
Why are you in such a hurry?

312
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,480
Ah, Khun Pra Mek.

313
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,160
Aren't you heading home?

314
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,920
Not yet.

315
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm still grieving over Lady Sri.

316
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,720
I feel so heavy.

317
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,360
Understandable.

318
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,760
So I thought
I'd do something to lift my spirits.

319
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,440
For example,

320
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,800
visiting your daughter-in-law.

321
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,240
Oh, you don't need to.

322
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,640
She's quite shy.

323
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,480
You can't coddle her forever.

324
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,640
She should meet other people

325
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,760
and the elders.

326
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,840
Let's go.

327
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,360
So I'm to play your wife?

328
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,960
That's easy.

329
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,160
I've played the hero's wife
countless times.

330
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,680
Adding one more role

331
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,040
is not hard at all.

332
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I can be any kind of wife you want.

333
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,600
You have to act like a Phra Nakhon lady.

334
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,280
I was born in Phra Nakhon.

335
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,160
I can talk like a Phra Nakhon woman
and curse like one too.

336
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,360
Good.

337
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,280
But you'll need to know details about me,

338
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,000
so we won't get caught in conversation.

339
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,760
Uh-oh!

340
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,400
How personal are we talking?

341
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,360
One warning.

342
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,760
If we get caught,
not only will I be punished,

343
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,440
you will too.

344
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,920
How bad can the punishment be?

345
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,480
Beheading.

346
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm out. I don't want to lose my head.

347
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,120
Paka, wait.

348
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,360
If we're both not suspicious,
we'll be fine.

349
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,600
Will you listen to me?

350
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,800
Alright.

351
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,960
My name is Aek.

352
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm 27 years old, born in Thung Yai City.

353
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,600
My father is Khun Pra Chuaychaikonlasuek.

354
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,520
My mother, Nueang, passed years ago.

355
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I studied at…

356
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,520
Come on. Follow me.

357
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Follow me.

358
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Let's go.

359
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,000
Let's go.

360
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,680
Follow me.

361
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,640
Come on.

362
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,560
Paka, wait here.

363
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,480
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

364
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,200
- Go.
- Go.

365
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,920
- Hurry up.
- Go.

366
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,240
Go inside.

367
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
Go.

368
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,720
- Go.
- Hurry up.

369
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,040
- Go.
- Go.

370
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,880
- Go inside.
- Go.

371
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,800
Go inside.

372
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,840
Hurry up.

373
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,840
- Go.
- Oh?

374
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,320
Yim, why are you so stubborn?

375
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,600
- Go.
- Go.

376
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,560
Hurry up.

377
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,720
Go, Yim.

378
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,080
Hurry up.

379
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,600
- Go inside.
- Hey!

380
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,600
You're the buffalo trader?

381
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,440
You already knew. Why ask?

382
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,960
I'm Khun Aek,

383
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,520
owner of this place.

384
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,480
Get those buffaloes into the pen
and keep quiet.

385
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,920
The buffalo are stubborn.
I'm shouting at them.

386
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
Why is that troubling you?

387
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,600
This is a noble's residence.

388
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,520
You can't be loud.

389
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,520
You have to speak loudly
when herding buffaloes.

390
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,080
Buffalo don't hear whispers, right?

391
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,240
Right, buffalo?

392
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,680
Buffalo! Buffalo! Buffalo!

393
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,360
How insolent of you!

394
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,560
Do you want to be flogged?

395
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,240
Try it, you pale-faced brat!

396
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,680
You think your noble title
gives you power to bully?

397
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,360
I'll report you now.

398
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,880
Mind that wicked tongue.

399
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,800
Sir.

400
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,000
Sir, Khun Pra Chuay is back

401
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,040
with Khun Pra Mek.

402
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,240
They want to see you now.

403
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,360
Greetings, Sir.

404
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,160
Why didn't you bring your wife, Khun Aek?

405
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,720
Khun Pra Mek is eager to meet your wife.

406
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,800
Is she home?

407
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,320
Or out on errands?
Perhaps he can come back next time.

408
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,040
I can wait, Khun Pra Chuay.

409
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,040
Oh.

410
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,120
No need to waste time.
You should head back.

411
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,280
My wife is home.

412
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
Are you sure?

413
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,400
Yes, Sir.

414
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,360
Then go get her
and let her greet Khun Pra Mek.

415
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
Right away, Sir.

416
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,920
- Paka
- Yes?

417
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,640
- Are you ready?
- Very ready.

418
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,640
- Oh no!
- What is it?

419
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,720
I can't do this anymore.

420
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
What?

421
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,040
That's Khun Pra Mek.

422
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,520
You know him?

423
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,400
Besides being a traveling actress,

424
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,640
I take special jobs too.

425
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,800
Special jobs? You mean…

426
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,880
I… also service men.

427
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,240
I used to work near the coastal towns.

428
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,200
Khun Pra Mek was one of my regulars.

429
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,800
He'll definitely recognize me.

430
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,880
What terrible luck.

431
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,280
And…

432
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,400
that's Khun Pra Chuay?

433
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,840
He was more of an occasional customer.

434
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,600
What a relief… What?! My father?

435
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,760
My father too?

436
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,080
Well, most of my clients

437
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
were nobles.

438
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,160
Come here.

439
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,080
Oh.

440
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
Be quiet.

441
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh? Wait.

442
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,240
Where's your wife, Khun Aek?

443
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,200
She's getting dressed, Uncle.

444
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,240
Please don't go in just yet.

445
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,000
I just heard someone screaming.

446
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,000
Aek's wife is getting dressed.

447
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,600
She's from Phra Nakhon.
It takes time to get ready.

448
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,640
Let's go.

449
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,080
Let's go have some warm
Ceylon tea before it cools.

450
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,159
Come on. Let's go.

451
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,480
Paka,

452
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,000
don't leave this room.

453
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,159
I got hurt this bad,

454
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
where could I possibly go?

455
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,960
- Yip.
- Yes, Sir.

456
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,000
Have we hired any new maids lately?

457
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,400
One Khun Pra Mek wouldn't recognize?

458
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,320
Oh… he visits here often.

459
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
None of the girls
would be new to him. Why?

460
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,280
- Nothing. Never mind.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,640
Hey, Mr. Pale Face.

462
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,320
You said this was your house, right?

463
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,920
Yes.

464
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,760
Then pay for the buffalo.

465
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,880
I know. But I'm in a hurry right now.

466
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,600
Hey.

467
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,840
Are you trying to run off without paying?

468
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,920
What are you doing?

469
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,600
Have you ever been
to Thung Yai City before?

470
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,320
It's my first time.

471
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,600
Have you ever serviced men?

472
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,400
My balls…

473
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,280
My balls…

474
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,520
One more word and I'll cut them off

475
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,320
and make sure you're never a man again.

476
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,480
Wait.

477
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,200
Don't punch me.

478
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,600
I have a job…

479
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,000
I have a job for you.

480
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,200
Not interested.
Herding buffalo already wore me out.

481
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,040
Please help me,

482
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,600
just this once. Please.

483
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
What kind of job?

484
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,120
Just pretend to be…

485
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,720
What?!

486
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,080
You want me to be your wife? Are you mad?

487
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,680
Just pretend.

488
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,200
A fake wife.

489
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,960
Oh, I see. You're a scammer.

490
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,480
Who are you trying to fool?

491
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,160
Here's your payment.

492
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,880
Nobles sure toss money about
like it's nothing.

493
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,120
So will you do it? Just for a short while.

494
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,360
Dad.

495
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,560
Are you okay?

496
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,160
It's fine.

497
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,320
This is normal when you've been cursed.

498
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,360
It'll pass.

499
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,080
This is nothing.

500
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,440
I shouldn't have let my guard down

501
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,520
in Phaya Fire Forest.

502
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,200
I shot that tiger

503
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,480
to protect the buffalo,

504
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,320
and ended up cursed.

505
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,120
Now you're stuck looking after me.

506
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,960
Don't say that.

507
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,680
You expelled the curse.

508
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,840
That's why you're weak.

509
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,400
I'll buy you some good medicine.

510
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,320
Thank you, my daughter.

511
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,880
Why is it so little?

512
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,320
Western medicine is expensive.

513
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,640
It's expensive,
but more effective than Thai medicine.

514
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,440
If you want more,

515
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,680
you have to pay more. Do you have money?

516
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,760
That's all I have now. Next time, then.

517
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,600
Do you have any tonic

518
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,840
that helps you recover quickly?

519
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,760
Yes.

520
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,920
There, golden ginseng.

521
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
It's ancient Korean ginseng.

522
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,080
It's just what you want,

523
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,280
but it costs 100 times more
than what you just bought.

524
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,240
Can I get a bit more pay?

525
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,440
I'm not greedy,

526
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,600
but I need money.

527
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,840
Why do you need money?

528
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,240
You don't need to know that.

529
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,520
So you're taking the job?

530
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,800
Hey.

531
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,520
Wait for me right here. Don't go anywhere.

532
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,600
Ouch.

533
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,640
Come on.

534
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,000
Ouch.

535
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,360
Whoa. Alright.

536
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,680
- Paka
- Yes, sir?

537
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,880
Bathe this lady.
Scrub her clean, polish her up.

538
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,920
Yes, Sir.

539
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,280
- I'll bring her my mother's dress
- Understood.

540
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,560
What's your name?

541
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,840
I'm Kamduang.

542
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm Paka. Come with me.

543
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,560
Does it hurt?

544
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,520
Whoa, that water is pitch black.

545
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,240
How much grime did she build up?

546
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,760
Can she really pass
as a lady of Phra Nakhon?

547
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,360
How is she?

548
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,720
All dressed up now, Sir.

549
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,560
What are you staring at?

550
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,240
First of all,

551
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,520
no Isan dialect.

552
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,480
You must speak like a Phra Nakhon lady.

553
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,400
Alright, I won't speak Isan.

554
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,080
Oh.

555
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,440
I won't speak Isan.

556
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,680
I'll speak like a Phra Nakhon woman.

557
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,840
And walk like a proper lady.

558
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,320
Walk like a proper lady? How?

559
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,120
Whoa.

560
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,520
At this rate,
there's no way she'll learn in time.

561
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,720
Listen,

562
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
if you're ever unsure,

563
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,240
just do what I taught you.

564
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,400
Like this, foreigners love this.

565
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,560
Try what I taught you.

566
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,280
And how exactly does

567
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,000
a Phra Nakhon lady walk?

568
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,720
I can't describe it,

569
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,320
but it's not how you walked.

570
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,800
Whoa?

571
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,880
Alright. Don't walk.

572
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,600
Just stand still.

573
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,080
We need to go now.
My uncle's getting suspicious.

574
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,080
Wait, wait,
let me practice just a bit more.

575
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,120
Greetings.

576
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,520
My goodness.

577
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,640
What kind of Phra Nakhon lady
greets like that?

578
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,800
Ugh.

579
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,240
Just follow my lead.

580
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
Now, do it.

581
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
Aek.

582
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,800
Is your wife done dressing yet?

583
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Time to go. Come on.

584
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,840
Thank you.

585
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,800
I think it's taking far too long
for her to dress.

586
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,080
Well, Khun Pra Mek,

587
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,200
you did show up suddenly.

588
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,400
Women need time to get ready.

589
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,760
This isn't long at all.

590
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,680
Wait, wait.

591
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,040
Where are you going?

592
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,080
No offense, Khun Pra Chuay,

593
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,160
but I'm really starting to doubt
that Aek actually has a wife.

594
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,040
- I want to see for myself.
- Khun Pra Mek!

595
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,960
Please.

596
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,480
You'll only end up
startling my daughter-in-law.

597
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,960
I think it's not about her.

598
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,520
Hey, where are you going? Calm down!

599
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,000
Uncle.

600
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
This is my wife…

601
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,200
This is my wife.

602
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,920
Her name is Kamduang.

603
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,680
Oh.

604
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,360
Get up.

605
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,640
I'm so sorry. I'm just nervous, Sir.

606
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,800
No worries.

607
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,200
I am Pra Meksawanphansaeng.

608
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,520
Are you really Aek's wife?

609
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,360
Wonderful! So lovely.

610
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,320
What do you think of
my daughter-in-law now?

611
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,280
Weren't you here to meet and bless her?

612
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,320
I'm well aware.

613
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,560
Kamduang, go receive his blessing.

614
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,080
Go receive his blessing.

615
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,160
May you prosper.
Good health and happiness to you.

616
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,920
Um.

617
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,640
Oh. Thank you, sir.

618
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,520
I've heard Phra Nakhon women

619
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,120
prefer playing the Jakhe these days.

620
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,240
But where I'm from, we prefer the Saw.
I play it for the buffalo.

621
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,960
Kamduang.

622
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,760
I mean… back home,
there are lots of buffaloes.

623
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,040
When I play the saw, it calms them down.

624
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,280
It keeps them from getting wild.

625
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,920
And where exactly
in Phra Nakhon do you live?

626
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,560
Kamduang,

627
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,200
you play so beautifully.
Let's hear more, shall we?

628
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,560
Yes, sir.

629
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,520
But your name, Kamduang,

630
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,800
doesn't sound very Phra Nakhon.

631
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,440
More like Isan, wouldn't you say?

632
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,920
Phra Nakhon's

633
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,760
full of people from many provinces.

634
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,240
So names are diverse, Sir.

635
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,760
Won't you two let Kamduang talk to me?

636
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,520
You say everything for her.

637
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,720
I just get nervous around elders, sir.

638
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,560
You still haven't told me.

639
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,200
Where in Phra Nakhon do you live?
What subdistrict,

640
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,680
what canal, which temple
do you make merit at?

641
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,320
Which monk?

642
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,840
I live in…

643
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,120
Oh no! I'm so sorry, ma'am!

644
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
Yip!

645
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,360
I apologize, Sir.

646
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,560
You're soaked.

647
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,480
Go change now. Go.

648
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,200
My outfit is a mess.

649
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,200
Excuse me.

650
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,640
I'll go check on her.

651
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,840
Well?

652
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,480
Are you satisfied now, Khun Pra Mek?

653
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,040
You've given your blessing
to my daughter-in-law.

654
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,960
Your daughter-in-law
is quite beautiful indeed.

655
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,680
Well then,

656
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,000
I should be on my way before it gets dark.

657
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,400
No need to see me out. Please stay.

658
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,440
Safe travels, Khun Pra.

659
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,920
How could he already have a wife?

660
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,360
I don't get that old man.

661
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,720
What do you mean?

662
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,960
He looks close with you,

663
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,040
but questions every little thing,
like he's trying to catch us in a lie.

664
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,080
Is he a friend or an enemy?

665
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,320
That's just how noble society works.

666
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,080
Here. Take this.

667
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,640
He gave it to you.
That's a blessing for you.

668
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,560
No.

669
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,840
He gave it to me as the daughter-in-law
of this house. But I'm not.

670
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,080
If I keep this, it's like I'm a fraud.

671
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,720
Do you realize that's real gold?

672
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,400
And the amulet is sacred.

673
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,400
I don't care. I'm not keeping it.

674
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,040
That old man's looking at us. Hold me.

675
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,320
Do you want me to kiss you too?
That might sell the act better.

676
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,120
You kiss me, you die.

677
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,520
I don't see him.

678
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,080
Oh wait, now I do.

679
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,080
You've got sharp eyes.

680
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,760
Don't forget I'm a traveling trader.

681
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,080
If he's this sneaky,
he's definitely your enemy.

682
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,120
I've got a plan.

683
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,840
But I need your consent first.

684
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,920
Do you really think

685
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,520
I'll believe you that easily?

686
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,560
I was so scared just now
that Uncle would find out.

687
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,480
If the truth comes out,
we're in big trouble.

688
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,080
No one must ever know
we're hiding the truth.

689
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
Caught you red-handed!

690
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,360
- Oh?
- Help!

691
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,000
Uncle's spying on my chest!

692
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,880
Why would you do such a thing, Uncle?

693
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,440
No, no! I didn't do that.

694
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,920
My chest…

695
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,560
My chest is small. I was so ashamed.

696
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,720
So I used coconut shells to enhance it.

697
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,680
It was my biggest secret.

698
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,920
I just heard you two talking

699
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,800
about hiding the truth.

700
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,080
I was curious.

701
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,520
So you wanted
to see my wife's chest, Uncle?

702
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,720
Khun Pra Mek, we're too old

703
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,840
to be lusting like this.

704
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,600
As a nobleman,
you should have more self-control.

705
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,240
And doing that to my daughter-in-law?

706
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,520
It's disgraceful beyond words.

707
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,080
Father, how will you deal with this?

708
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,280
What do you want me to do?

709
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,480
I want you to report this to the governor.

710
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,400
No, no, please don't!

711
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,240
Alright.

712
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,200
For my sake,

713
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,440
don't let it go that far.

714
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,560
If he's beheaded,

715
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,000
that would only create bad karma.

716
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,560
I won't press charges then.

717
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,600
But from now on,

718
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,560
you must never go near my wife again.

719
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,440
If you do, I won't let it go.

720
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,960
Agreed.

721
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,400
From now on, Khun Pra Mek,

722
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,520
stay far away from my home.

723
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,520
If I see you here again,

724
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,320
I'll report everything to the governor.

725
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,040
Fine. I agree.

726
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,200
I give it back to you.

727
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,720
I can't accept anything
from someone who insulted me.

728
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,080
Kamduang.

729
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,360
Me? Peeping at someone's chest?

730
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,520
What kind of man do they think I am?

731
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,360
Today was so satisfying.

732
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,000
Khun Pra Mek slinked away like a wet dog.

733
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,320
Even if he suspects,
I doubt he'll dare investigate further.

734
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,280
Credit goes to you, Kamduang.

735
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,960
You played the part perfectly.

736
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,360
If you didn't tell me,
I wouldn't know you were a buffalo trader.

737
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,240
I'd have thought
you were really a city wife.

738
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,640
Especially that kiss, wow!

739
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,760
Honestly, I didn't know how.
Someone taught me.

740
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,160
So you're the one

741
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,160
taking my place as Khun Aek's wife?

742
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,520
Have you ever been to Phra Nakhon?

743
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,000
The charm of a Phra Nakhon woman
is like this.

744
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,040
Watch me.

745
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,160
Smile.

746
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,840
What? I'm smiling.

747
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,800
You looked like a ghoul!

748
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,640
Try again.

749
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,320
Smile.

750
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,440
Flirt.

751
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,200
I've never seen someone this strange.

752
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,440
Just a little bit.

753
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,760
That's it! That's it!

754
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,320
Now blow a kiss. A man's there.

755
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,440
You're amazing, Kamduang!

756
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,840
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

757
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,160
I shouldn't have tried to expose them.

758
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,400
It's all a mess now.

759
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,400
Good thing
they didn't report me to the governor,

760
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,080
or I'd be done for.

761
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,360
But not reporting

762
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,840
is exactly why it's suspicious.

763
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,920
Think about it.

764
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,560
They had the chance to bring you down,

765
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,080
but let it go?

766
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,120
That's true.

767
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,760
If this turned into a case,

768
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,320
they'd need to investigate
and gather evidence.

769
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,320
The fake marriage would've been uncovered.

770
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,000
They used karma
as an excuse to end it quickly.

771
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,280
This won't end here.

772
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,440
We still have time before the gun deal.

773
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,200
I say we can still take that deal back.

774
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,400
Even though we got rid of Khun Pra Mek,

775
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,040
and even though I like Kamduang,

776
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,400
she's still our biggest liability.

777
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,080
Yes. Today we got away.

778
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,960
But in the future,
others might grow suspicious again.

779
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,840
We may not be lucky again.

780
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,080
Get rid of Kamduang.

781
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,600
The sooner, the better. No traces.

782
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,240
Yes, Father.

783
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,680
Khun Aek Itthirit.

784
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,480
Who is that?

785
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,200
She is my wife.

786
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,120
You must play the role of my wife
even more convincingly.

787
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,800
The governor has seen your face.

788
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,920
This is my wife, Kamduang.

789
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,840
From now on, call her Madam.

790
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,880
Beautiful.

791
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,040
Do whatever you want.

792
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,520
I'm ready.

793
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,040
My wife.

794
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,560
So clumsy and improper.

795
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,440
I've got a job for you.

796
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,840
Should I kill her or just kidnap her?

797
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,000
Kidnap her.

798
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,880
Hey!

799
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,840
