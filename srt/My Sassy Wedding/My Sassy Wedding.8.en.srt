1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
I want you

2
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
to be my husband.

3
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,440
My husband…

4
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600
I'm here.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,240
Kamduang!

6
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Someone hired me
to curse a woman named Kamduang.

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,560
Is this her?

8
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,640
I know who hired that shaman to curse me.

9
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,600
The gun test is ready, Sir.

10
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,160
Fire!

11
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,960
About the guns,
it might not be entirely your fault.

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,360
What do you mean?

13
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,240
The night before it happened,
I encountered the culprit.

14
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,760
I fought them, but I lost.

15
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
Sergeant Boonchai,
please tell Khun Pra Saming

16
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
I wish to speak with him.

17
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,960
You're saying someone
plotted to make the gun explode,

18
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,240
just to frame you?

19
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,400
You have proof of that?

20
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,400
I have no proof, Sir.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,160
But I'm certain that's what happened.

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,280
And you expect me
to believe you that easily, Khun Aek?

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,400
Please believe me, Sir.

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,120
Are you willing to stake your life on it?

25
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,280
I am, Sir.

26
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,200
If Mr. Chadwick's guns are all junk,

27
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
then every gun in the chest
should be worthless.

28
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Pick any gun to shoot,
and they should all explode.

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
Yes, Sir.

30
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,160
But if it was a swap made by the culprit,

31
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,480
they could only have changed a few.

32
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,160
At that time,
the soldiers picked from the top row.

33
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,720
Which means the guns in the bottom row
might be good ones, like you said, right?

34
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes, Sir.

35
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,839
Then I'll pick five from the bottom row.

36
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,320
If you truly believe they're good,

37
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
you must be willing to fire all five.

38
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,080
Just in case
you're thinking of pulling anything, Sir.

39
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,440
Don't worry, Chadwick.

40
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,760
After I test-fired the guns,

41
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,040
Khun Pra Saming saw the truth

42
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,920
and gave me time

43
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,640
to find the culprit
who tampered with them.

44
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,920
If I can find the proof,

45
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,120
I won't have to go back to prison.

46
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,440
You're mad at me, aren't you?

47
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,440
For the way I spoke to you.

48
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,480
I understand.

49
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,440
You only said that to make me angry,
so I'd hurry home

50
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,280
and not share the punishment as your wife.

51
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry

52
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,720
for hurting you.

53
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,680
Please forgive me.

54
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,480
Yes.

55
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,640
You said you fought the culprit.

56
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,400
Did you get hurt anywhere?

57
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
Just a little.

58
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
Are you sure?

59
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,960
Things are looking better now.

60
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,200
Do you want to go home?

61
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,600
I know you miss home.

62
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
If you do, I'll let you.

63
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,080
And you?

64
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you want me to go home,
or do you want me to stay?

65
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,800
It's up to you.

66
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,800
That's not an answer.

67
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,680
Do you want me to stay or not?

68
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,520
Yes.

69
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,720
I want you to stay.

70
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,200
I may miss home,

71
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,800
but I want to stay and help you.

72
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,600
Thank you.

73
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,880
Let me ask you something else.

74
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
What is it?

75
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
You've been paid,

76
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
and you got the golden ginseng.

77
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,720
Why did you come back to help me?

78
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Integrity.

79
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,560
A buffalo caravan leader
must have integrity.

80
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,040
You're being framed.

81
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,240
How could I let you be punished

82
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,920
for something you didn't do?

83
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,160
I admire your integrity.

84
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,880
Whoa.

85
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,040
I win.

86
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
What?

87
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
Again?

88
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
Let's go.

89
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,240
I don't have more money.

90
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
Whoa.

91
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,640
You've seen my work now, haven't you?

92
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Impressive.

93
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,080
Tonight, you must come with me.

94
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
It may be far.

95
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,200
I don't want anyone to hear gunfire.

96
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,880
A fine gun like this

97
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,840
can't be as cheap as you claim.

98
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,120
True.

99
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,840
This is the gun you'll use
to demonstrate to the Governor.

100
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,520
And this is the one

101
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,120
we'll sell him.

102
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,920
That's enough.

103
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,120
If you fire too many rounds,

104
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,960
I fear for your safety.

105
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,360
- Why?
- It's of poor quality.

106
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,840
It could explode on you any time.

107
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,240
With a gun this bad,

108
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,200
I'd rather fight with a sword.

109
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,840
Alright. Deal.

110
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,440
You get more like this,
and I'll find a way to sell them.

111
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
One more thing.

112
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,840
Khun Aek's wife, Kamduang,

113
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
is no ordinary woman.

114
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
She's skilled and clever.

115
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,920
She could ruin our business.

116
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,240
Khun Aek's wife…

117
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Kamduang.

118
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,960
I know a merchant

119
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,080
who can get us guns
as good as the foreign ones,

120
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,000
but at half the price.

121
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
That much?

122
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,280
Yes, Sir.

123
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,760
They're very good guns.

124
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,000
I mean, we're that lucky?

125
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,160
Normally, gun merchants are hard to find.

126
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,360
But right when we have
trouble with foreign guns,

127
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,120
this merchant suddenly contacts you?

128
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,960
I'm giving Khun Aek time
to prove himself with the foreign guns.

129
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Tell your merchant friend

130
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,280
to wait if he can.

131
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
Yes, Sir.

132
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,200
Kamduang,

133
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,240
I have something to show you.

134
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,080
About the attacker you fought,

135
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,640
I found a notebook
that's quite interesting.

136
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,160
This notebook was written
in the Ayutthaya period.

137
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,320
What are you looking at?

138
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,040
You're such a sight for sore eyes.

139
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,080
Eyes? What's wrong with my eyes?

140
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
Nothing.

141
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,120
Now, what is it you want to show me?

142
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,960
This notebook

143
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,400
says that during that time,

144
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,160
many merchant ships entered Ayutthaya,

145
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,920
and pirate attacks increased.

146
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,480
The one I fought with

147
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,920
dressed just like this.

148
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,800
Pirates came from many nations,
speaking different languages,

149
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,680
and their fighting style was very fierce.

150
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,680
They used locks,

151
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,240
throws,

152
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,560
and also

153
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
strange weapons like these.

154
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,160
Some countries call this fighting

155
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,400
Jiujitsu.

156
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,360
No wonder their moves were strange.

157
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,800
And importantly, this notebook

158
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,960
records ways to counter pirate techniques.

159
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,560
I'm skilled with weapons,
not hand-to-hand.

160
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,240
You can train with it all you want.

161
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,920
Of course, I won't let you fight them.

162
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,880
This time I'll settle the score myself.

163
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,160
But training like this

164
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,960
can't be done alone.

165
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,720
I need a partner.

166
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,360
Seems it's not that easy.

167
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,360
The notebook says to counter Jiujitsu,

168
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,320
I must shift my weight to my feet.

169
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,880
If that's right,

170
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
I should be able to throw you.

171
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,360
Maybe it's wrong.

172
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
How could someone smaller
throw someone bigger?

173
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,960
Let me try again.

174
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,560
Ugh!

175
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,080
That's it. I figured it out now.

176
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,040
My back's broken.

177
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,480
Ugh.

178
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,400
Dear, get up.

179
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,360
Let's do it again, before I forget.

180
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
Again?

181
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,920
This time, let's change the technique.

182
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,200
Change the technique?

183
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,560
Ugh!

184
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,640
Aek must have been stressed lately.

185
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,520
I'll invite him to play chess.

186
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,960
I like this one.

187
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,720
They're shaking the whole house?

188
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
It's not going to break. I held back.

189
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,040
Whoa, Aek.

190
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,560
Didn't you say Kamduang
was only your fake wife?

191
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,720
You'll ruin her reputation!

192
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,080
- Ugh.
- You like this one?

193
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,560
So Kamduang does like Aek too?

194
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,040
Go, son.

195
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,600
Don't let me down.

196
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,160
Argh!

197
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,520
Is it good?

198
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,760
Come on.

199
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
Come on.

200
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,280
Here.

201
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
- I'll open it now.
- Go for it.

202
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,640
Two.

203
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,520
- I win.
- I'm done!

204
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
I have nothing left.

205
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
I quit.

206
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,680
I kept losing.

207
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Come on.

208
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,400
Juan, are you trying
to run from your debt?

209
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,120
Oh, Uncle Hong.

210
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
I almost won.

211
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,080
Then I'd have money to pay you.

212
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,440
But I just missed it by a little.

213
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,200
If you don't have money to pay back,

214
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,400
then you die.

215
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,560
Uncle Hong,

216
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,280
please don't hurt me. I'm scared.

217
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,280
- I'm scared.
- Hey!

218
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,360
Take it elsewhere.

219
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,680
You're ruining business.

220
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,240
You…

221
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,160
You're a servant in Khun Aek's household?

222
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,320
Yes, sir.

223
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,840
My name is Juan, sir.

224
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,360
Please save me.

225
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,080
How much does she owe?

226
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,200
Five taels.

227
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,520
Oh.

228
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,200
Thank you, sir,

229
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,920
for paying my debt for me.

230
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,520
I owe you my life.

231
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm not a saint.

232
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,000
I helped you

233
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,960
because I expect something in return.

234
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,280
What do you want me to do? Please tell me.

235
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,880
I have a job for you.

236
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,200
If you finish it,
I'll give you more money.

237
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,120
Yes, sir. Please tell me.

238
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,360
I'll do my best.

239
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
I want you to find out
about Khun Aek's wife.

240
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,120
Who she really is,

241
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,560
whether she had relations with him before,

242
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,160
and see if she's hiding anything.

243
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
Find out for me.

244
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,680
Yes, sir.

245
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,360
That's not difficult.

246
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,720
I spoke to some nobles.

247
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,120
They say Aek might be acquitted.

248
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,880
The foreign guns aren't that bad.

249
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
It could be a setup.

250
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,440
Then,

251
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
I can see him again?

252
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Yes,

253
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,120
but don't get too involved.

254
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,560
Stay neutral.

255
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,160
If he's cleared,

256
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,680
he'll appreciate

257
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
that we didn't abandon him.

258
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,160
If not,

259
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
we won't be in trouble.

260
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,280
I understand.

261
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,200
May this merit help
the five soldiers and the Governor

262
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,640
recover quickly.

263
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,240
I pray the same.

264
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Sathu.

265
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,440
Be careful.

266
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm sorry.

267
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,520
I slipped on moss.

268
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,160
Good thing I caught you,

269
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,920
or I'd be releasing
my wife into the river too.

270
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
Oh, that'd be a big merit too.

271
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,760
Let's pay respects to the abbot.

272
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,040
Yes.

273
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,720
That Kamduang lied to me.

274
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
She said she'd be leaving town.

275
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,680
And what am I seeing now?

276
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,760
You're so gullible to believe her.

277
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
She knows you like him,

278
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,600
so she's trying to push you out.

279
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,520
I was stupid to believe her.

280
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,520
I won't be stupid anymore.

281
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,880
Next time,

282
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,000
I'll make her pay.

283
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
Why is the bedsheet

284
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,080
only wrinkled on one side?

285
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,320
Could it be that only one person
has been sleeping here?

286
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,040
Alright.

287
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,440
Well? What did you find out?

288
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,080
Here, sir.

289
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,600
In the room, I saw an open notebook.

290
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,760
I thought it might be important,

291
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,760
so I copied it for you.

292
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,440
They've found out about Nok Lek.

293
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,400
Who, sir?

294
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,280
Nothing.

295
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
Anything else?

296
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,280
The bedsheet was wrinkled only
on one side. The other side was untouched.

297
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,160
So only one person sleeps there.

298
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,760
And barely wrinkled, sir.

299
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,360
What does that mean?

300
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,640
It means Khun Aek and his wife
aren't doing the husband-and-wife thing.

301
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,600
Keep watching and report back to me.

302
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,080
Yes, sir.

303
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,320
Who was that?

304
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,920
- Aunt Ouan.
- Yes, dear?

305
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,040
Have you seen any strangers lately,
like sailors?

306
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,800
Our town's by the sea.

307
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,520
Sailors are everywhere, Kamduang.

308
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,840
That's true.

309
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,040
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

310
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,160
Oh.

311
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,480
Hey, Kamduang.

312
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,280
I was hoping to find you.

313
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,440
Paka, how are you?

314
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm well, but I have
something important to tell you.

315
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,920
They're starting to suspect who did it.

316
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,760
Otherwise, they wouldn't be looking
at a pirate logbook like this.

317
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,800
They're smart.

318
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,840
But don't worry,

319
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,000
it'll be a long while

320
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,920
before they can trace it to me.

321
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,800
And you're sharp yourself,

322
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,640
keeping tabs on their moves so quickly.

323
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,480
Don't worry about that.
I've got my own informants.

324
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,400
There's an enemy spy in our house.

325
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
They know
even about the wrinkles on the bed.

326
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,280
Did Paka say who?

327
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,480
She overheard people
talking outside the den

328
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,600
while relieving herself.

329
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,720
At first, she didn't care,

330
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,280
but she caught our names.

331
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,200
By the time she came out, they were gone.

332
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,440
I can guess who bought the information.

333
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,400
But the spy in my house? No idea.

334
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,880
We have so many servants.

335
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,680
So, what do we do?

336
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,200
We're lucky we know an enemy is here.

337
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,960
But that person doesn't know we know.

338
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,960
Since they're spying on our bed life,

339
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,120
then

340
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,280
We need to stage it.
So they think we're husband and wife.

341
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,080
Fast, slow, light, mix it up.

342
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,680
Try it.

343
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,920
Fast.

344
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,280
Light.

345
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,000
Light, then loud, take turns.

346
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,360
Yes.

347
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,000
Open wide.

348
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,120
I'm putting it in now.

349
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,120
Dear!

350
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,760
Aw, dear!

351
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,600
Ah.

352
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,680
I like it, dear.

353
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,360
That's good, dear.

354
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,840
Dear! Dear!

355
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,800
Again?

356
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,000
‪Is it enough?

357
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,120
Is it enough?

358
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,160
I guess I'll have to

359
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,920
invite him to play chess during the day.

360
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,440
He always plays something else at night.

361
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,520
Dear.

362
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,440
Is it enough?

363
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,720
That's enough.

364
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,160
From now on, I'm sleeping in bed with you.

365
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,520
We don't know when the spy will come.

366
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,160
Don't worry.

367
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,400
I'm not an opportunist.

368
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,960
I'm not afraid.

369
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,160
Just don't sleepwalk and hug me.

370
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,280
Buddho…

371
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
Buddho…

372
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,800
Falling…

373
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,800
Rising…

374
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,560
Falling…

375
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,640
Nice skin…

376
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,360
Smooth skin…

377
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,240
Rising…

378
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
I can't do it anymore!

379
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,520
S

380
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,280
Bandit Srichai!

381
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,840
Kill him!

382
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,639
Let's go.

383
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,480
Oh.

384
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,760
Ugh.

385
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,080
I saw this cloth first,
so it should be mine.

386
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,960
So, who will you sell it to?

387
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,880
This lady came first.

388
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,120
Well.

389
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm just a little sad, that's all.

390
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,920
This fabric is really beautiful.

391
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,480
Ah!

392
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,240
For the cloth.

393
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
Oh, Juan.

394
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Lady Yeesoon.

395
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,120
Perfect timing.
I have something to ask you.

396
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,200
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,280
Lately, has Kamduang shown
any signs of going far away?

398
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,200
Not really, ma'am.

399
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,480
Why? Is there something?

400
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,920
Kamduang is truly vicious.

401
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
You know what? She promised me

402
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,960
she'd stay away from Khun Aek.

403
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,840
You've been tricked.

404
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,680
Not only has she not gone anywhere,

405
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,000
but she keeps seducing Khun Aek

406
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,600
day and night.

407
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,360
What? That much?

408
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,360
She wasn't like this before,

410
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,000
but lately it's been often.

411
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,960
So loud,

412
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
like the house might collapse.

413
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,120
Really that much?

414
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,320
Normally, Khun Aek is very proper.

416
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,720
But lately, all this behavior

417
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,200
must be because Kamduang is tempting him.

418
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,840
Worse, she might even be
secretly feeding him

419
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,520
an aphrodisiac to make him more vigorous.

420
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,960
Could it be she wants
to have a child with Khun Aek?

421
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,480
If she has a child, her position as wife

422
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,680
will be even more secure, ma'am.

423
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,800
What should we do, Mother?

424
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,080
This won't do. I have a secret herb.

425
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,320
What is it?

426
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,920
It's called Kradum Yen.

427
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,360
Actually, it has another name,
but I'm too embarrassed to say,

428
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,720
so I call it Kradum Yen.

429
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh, I know. You mean Krado Yen, right?

430
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,760
I'll go get it myself.

431
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,920
You put it in Khun Aek's food.

432
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,400
Maybe his "thing" will stay cold

433
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,680
for months.

434
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,800
If it really works like that,

435
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,360
Madam will be lonely

436
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,280
and won't be able to have a child.

437
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,120
It spilled.

438
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,560
Will it still be enough?

439
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Oh well. Whatever's left will have to do.

440
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,640
Your snacks, Sir.

441
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Eat it.

442
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,400
Eat it.

443
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,720
Eat it.

444
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,760
Eat it.

445
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,160
Do you want some, Juan? Here.

446
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,960
I'd better not, Sir.

447
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,960
I wouldn't dare
put myself on the same level as you.

448
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,440
Kamduang, have a seat.

449
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,280
Let's have some tea and snacks first.

450
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,880
Yes, dear.

451
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,480
Yes, Sir.

452
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,520
Grandma.

453
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,120
Can I ask you something?

454
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,880
Ask what?

455
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,240
Do you know the plant called Kradum Yen?

456
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,200
Kradum Yen…

457
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,600
That's not its name. People call it--

458
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,640
Yeah, yeah, but you know it, right?

459
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,560
Of course.

460
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,000
If a man eats it,

461
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,800
he'll be weak and limp,
lose all his vigor.

462
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,280
He won't be able to perform.

463
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,880
And what if a woman eats it?

464
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,080
Hmm… probably the opposite.

465
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,920
If a woman eats it,

466
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,360
she'll get feisty and lustful,

467
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,960
ready to pounce

468
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
until she's panting hard.

469
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Yeah.

470
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,280
Oh, crap.

471
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
Hey.

472
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,920
- I…
- Are you alright?

473
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,960
- Kamduang…
- Am I beautiful, dear?

474
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,040
Between me and this Thong Phlu…

475
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,520
which one looks more delicious?

476
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,920
Uh… you…

477
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,160
you look more delicious.

478
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,080
Then what are you waiting for, dear?

479
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,000
Be mine!

480
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Kamduang!

481
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,240
Kamduang.

482
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,720
Juan.

483
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,040
- Juan!
- The plan's gone wrong!

484
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,680
What plan?

485
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Plan… what plan?

486
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,560
Nothing. I'm going.

487
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,440
Whoa.

488
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,920
Weird girl.

489
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,280
- Don't eat.
- Kamduang.

490
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,800
Are you going anywhere today?

491
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,880
I think I'll go to the market.
I miss Paka.

492
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,160
Eat it.

493
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
What are you writing?

494
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,040
Some official work.

495
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,280
Juan!

496
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,920
What are you doing here?

497
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,080
Whoa, Grandma! You scared me.
What do you want?

498
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,960
Come press the coconut milk.
Don't skip work.

499
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,200
Oh, Grandma.

500
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,320
- It's so delicious!
- I believe you.

501
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,840
I believe it's delicious.

502
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,960
Here.

503
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,560
Thank you, dear.

504
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,240
Khun Pra Saming.

505
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,440
Khun Men.

506
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,320
Khun Aek, Kamduang, you both look happy.

507
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,000
When will you give me a baby to bless?

508
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,120
You came all the way to my house.

509
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,680
Do you need anything?

510
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,000
Urgent matter.

511
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,520
Yes, Sir.

512
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,840
In the northern forest,

513
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,680
the patrol found many soldiers dead.

514
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,160
All were killed by Bandit Srichai.

515
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,720
Why think it's his doing?

516
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,360
The patrol found his mark near the bodies,

517
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,400
and dried blood
under one soldier's fingernails.

518
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,800
Written before dying to leave a clue?

519
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,280
Yes.

520
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,120
I thought we'd discuss it here
with you and Khun Pra Chuay,

521
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,840
so I needn't summon you to City Hall.

522
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,840
I've ordered patrols

523
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,000
to track him in the forest.

524
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,160
This Bandit Srichai is skilled

525
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,760
in warfare and magic.

526
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,520
Sending patrols

527
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,320
may just lead them into his traps.

528
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,920
I agree.

529
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,280
We must send the Tri-Phop unit.

530
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,080
Shall we go now

531
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,040
to assist the patrol?

532
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,080
I think we'd better not rush.

533
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,520
In weapons, we can defeat him,

534
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,960
but his magic is another matter.

535
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,000
It's nearly nightfall.

536
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,600
You're right.

537
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,160
At dawn, we'll send the Tri-Phop unit.

538
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,600
I'll lead the Eagle unit from the west.

539
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,480
I'll lead the Tiger unit from the east.

540
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,520
I'll lead the Elephant unit
from the south.

541
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,360
Good. That's the plan.

542
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,280
Track him down

543
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,560
as soon as possible.

544
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,080
Try to catch him by daylight.

545
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,480
Yes, Sir.

546
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,040
That's Thong Phlu?

547
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,680
My favorite.

548
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,600
Please try, Sir.

549
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,440
How is it?

550
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,040
Delicious.

551
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,920
I'll be going now.

552
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,360
I'll see you off.

553
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,040
Bandit Srichai…

554
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,840
What's happening to me?

555
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,360
Are you alright?
Why are you acting strange?

556
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,960
Nothing.

557
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,960
I just thought I saw something.

558
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,880
It's working. They're still quiet tonight.

559
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,320
No banging and crashing like before.

560
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,120
Khun Aek must've eaten my snack.

561
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,200
Lady Yeesoon's plan worked!

562
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,320
What are you doing? You scared me.

563
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,440
And what's wrong with you?

564
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

565
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,720
Juan…

566
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,280
What if a woman eats it?

567
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,720
She'll get feisty and lustful,

568
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,160
ready to pounce until she's panting hard.

569
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,200
Yip…

570
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,560
What are you gonna do to me?

571
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,800
I'm feeling lonely tonight.

572
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,560
I can't find anyone else.

573
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,520
How about you?

574
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,000
Aren't you lonely too?

575
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,040
I'm not lonely, Yip.

576
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,920
Oh, come on. You're lonely.

577
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,760
Argh!

578
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,160
Where are you going, Juan?

579
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,080
- My dear.
- I don't want to do this…

580
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,640
With you, Yip!

581
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,000
My dear Juan.

582
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,560
Help me!

583
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,680
Earlier today,
I knew you were eavesdropping.

584
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,640
You must be curious

585
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,520
and want to ask
about Bandit Srichai, right?

586
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,960
Yes.

587
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,320
I want to know
who this Bandit Srichai really is,

588
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,720
and why the city guard
has to mobilize so heavily against him.

589
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,720
Years ago in Isan, there was a notorious
sorcerer-bandit named Kiet Kud.

590
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,680
He gathered men,
raided the governor's house,

591
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,360
killed the governor, and seized power.

592
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,120
He was so strong

593
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,960
that the capital had to send
an army to destroy him.

594
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,680
The gang was executed,

595
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,080
but Bandit Srichai,

596
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,200
his right-hand man, escaped.

597
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,800
Rumor says

598
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,960
he's been recruiting
and is now near Thung Yai City.

599
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,840
Is Bandit Srichai
planning to raid Thung Yai?

600
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,280
Possibly.

601
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,520
The city is strategic.

602
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,800
If Phra Nakhon sends troops,

603
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,440
he can only flee by sea

604
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,760
or across the border.

605
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,000
From what you say,

606
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,360
he's very dangerous.

607
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,040
I can't take him lightly.

608
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,440
Wait.

609
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,600
What does this have to do with you?

610
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,760
Who said you could come?

611
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
I'm going to help you catch him.

612
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,560
I won't let you go with me.

613
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,440
No matter your skill,
you're still a woman.

614
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,280
Don't overestimate yourself.

615
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,520
Truly formidable, worthy of
a former head of the assault squad.

616
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,040
Aek.

617
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,440
Tomorrow you must be careful.

618
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,600
Bandit Srichai is very dangerous.

619
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,760
Yes, Father.

620
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,840
What do you think of Kamduang?

621
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,480
You once told me
Kamduang could break a sorcerer's spell.

622
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,480
Maybe she could help us.

623
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,120
She just asked to come,

624
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,320
but I refused.

625
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,160
Why?

626
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,080
No matter her skill, I won't let her go.

627
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,520
I don't want her to be in danger.

628
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,680
After all this time,

629
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,280
she's suffered enough
because of me already.

630
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,200
Are you sure?

631
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,240
You could lose
to Bandit Srichai's sorcery.

632
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,160
I'm sure, Father.

633
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,920
I'd rather die

634
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,120
than let Kamduang be harmed,
even a fingertip.

635
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,280
Bandit Srichai

636
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,040
is a grave threat. We must stop him.

637
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,560
My Elephant Unit

638
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,400
is ready to die for our city.

639
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,480
My Tiger Unit

640
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,520
will hunt him down.

641
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,400
My Eagle Unit

642
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,640
will lay down our lives
for Thung Yai City.

643
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,280
You are the finest soldiers
of Thung Yai City,

644
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,280
our strongest strike force.

645
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,840
Find Bandit Srichai

646
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,040
and strike before he can react.

647
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,000
His death means our safety.

648
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,960
The time has come.

649
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,280
Hunt him down!

650
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,560
Hunt him down!

651
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,280
S

652
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,080
Fire!

653
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,080
What should we do, Khun Aek?

654
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,720
Khun?

655
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,440
Vanish Spell!

656
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,360
Dear.

657
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,560
Khun.

658
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,640
Dear!

659
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,800
Freeze!

660
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,320
<i>I will kill you both</i>
<i>with the Seven-Metal Sacred Sword.</i>

661
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,800
Both of your souls

662
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,760
will serve me as slaves for all eternity.

663
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,520
Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

664
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,920
If anything happened to you,
do you know how much I'd regret it?

665
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,720
<i>Lady Kamduang's elements are unbalanced,</i>
<i>her body weakened,</i>

666
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,200
<i>so she has developed a fever.</i>

667
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,280
She needs herbal tonics
and plenty of rest.

668
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,680
Doctor!

669
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,800
You have no right
to lay a finger on my Kamduang!

670
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,480
Doctor Num!

671
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,920
You're jealous, aren't you?

672
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,320
<i>What happened?</i>

673
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,440
Who harmed you, Yeesoon?

674
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,160
Kamduang,

675
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,000
why did you harm Yeesoon?

676
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,880
