1
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
So they really did hide the guns here.

2
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,040
Why are you doing this, Ping?

3
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
He's holding my mother hostage.

4
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,080
<i>This is the criminal responsible</i>
<i>for sabotaging the foreign gun test,</i>

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,639
<i>resulting in soldier casualties</i>

6
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,160
<i>and the Governor's injuries.</i>

7
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,400
<i>The damage wasn't your fault.</i>

8
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,080
I declare you not guilty of all charges.

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,600
Fire!

10
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
I sentence you to serve Thung Yai City.

11
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
as an officer
in the secret operations unit,

12
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,840
reporting directly to me
as the current Governor.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Congratulations

14
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,400
on the successful gun contract signing.

15
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,920
<i>Please, everyone, join us in dancing</i>

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,840
<i>to celebrate Thung Yai City.</i>

17
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,240
Nok Lek got caught

18
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,200
by Khun Aek.

19
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,040
We have to break him out of jail.

20
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,520
If he rats me out, I'm done.

21
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,160
And if your master loses me,

22
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,960
forget about raiding the city.

23
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,440
I'll help Nok Lek myself.

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
Whipping

25
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,240
isn't enough for you, is it?

26
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,120
If you won't say who helped you…

27
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
Then try this!

28
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,840
Kamduang,

29
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,720
is something wrong?

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Last night, someone broke into the prison.

31
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
They helped Nok Lek escape.

32
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,680
Prison breaks happen.

33
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,800
The officials
will track him down eventually.

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,640
But Nok Lek isn't just any criminal.

35
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,040
He's smart and capable.

36
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
More importantly,

37
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,680
whoever broke him out…

38
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,920
must be extraordinary.

39
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,960
Security here is tight.

40
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,200
How did Nok Lek manage to escape prison?

41
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,880
Most likely

42
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,240
the work of those with black magic, Sir.

43
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
Don't forget,

44
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,800
Nok Lek's a pirate.
He doesn't know sorcery.

45
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,800
What if it's the Srichai bandits?

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
Are you saying

47
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,040
they're working together?

48
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,200
If that's true…

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,120
Thung Yai City is in serious danger.

50
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
Khun Aek.

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,880
I need a moment of your time.

52
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,440
Can it wait? I'm in a rush.

53
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,240
It's important.

54
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,040
It won't take long.

55
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,320
I heard there was a commotion?

56
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,480
A high-profile prisoner escaped.

57
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,360
Are you going to ask Kamduang to help?

58
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,720
Yes.

59
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
She might find us a lead.

60
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,960
What is it, Kham?

61
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600
Khun Aek…

62
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640
Do you know

63
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
you're being selfish?

64
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
Kham…

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,960
I say this

66
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,440
because you know

67
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
that if you ask Kamduang,

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,120
she would do anything for you.

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,120
She's kind and selfless.

70
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,480
When someone's good to her,
she gives her all in return.

71
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,440
And as far as I know,

72
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,360
she nearly died for you more than once.

73
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
And still, you want her to keep helping.

74
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
That's why I say…

75
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,040
you're selfish.

76
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,840
Am I wrong?

77
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,840
<i>If you ask Kamduang,</i>

78
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,920
<i>she would do anything for you.</i>

79
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,000
<i>She's kind and selfless.</i>

80
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,680
<i>And as far as I know,</i>

81
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,000
she nearly died for you more than once.

82
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,360
Dear.

83
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
What's the situation with Nok Lek?

84
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,440
Four guards were killed.

85
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,520
They helped him escape.

86
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,760
Dear, please let me help you.

87
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,720
I think it could be dark magic…

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,760
or even the Srichai bandits.

89
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
No need.

90
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
This has nothing to do with you.

91
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,280
- But I--
- I said stay out of it.

92
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,920
Our agreement is over.

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,080
Pack your things and leave my house.

94
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,920
What did you just say?

95
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,160
Was I unclear?

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,600
I'll say it again.

97
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,560
Our agreement is over.

98
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,760
You and your kin,

99
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,240
pack your things and leave.

100
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,240
- Are you kicking me out?
- Yes.

101
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,880
I am.

102
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,559
Or will you not leave?

103
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,039
I'll go.

104
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
Then pack your things and go now.

105
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
Now?

106
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,840
What are you waiting for?

107
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
Go.

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,400
Kamduang,

109
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,560
we're nearly out of Thung Yai City.

110
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
Is there anything left you want to do?

111
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,640
No, Dad.

112
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,800
Everything here is over.

113
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
We've been traveling for days.

114
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,400
Let's rest here for a bit.

115
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,840
Footsteps. They're not coming this way.

116
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
Dad.

117
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,360
Just a short break, okay?

118
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,960
I don't want to miss it.

119
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,560
The pigeon message from Srichai said

120
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,040
they'll strike in two days.

121
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,600
If we make it in time…

122
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
- We'll get a cut for sure.
- Srichai gang…

123
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,960
Don't dream about your cut just yet.

124
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,760
This job's not easy.
We could die out there.

125
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,520
I think it's worth the risk.

126
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
If we steal those Western guns,

127
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
Srichai will take over Thung Yai City.

128
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,520
Then we'll get our reward.

129
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,840
- Let's go.
- Let's move.

130
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,320
Let's go, Dad.

131
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,880
Kamduang?

132
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,200
Teacher?

133
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,200
Uncle Yoy, wake up!

134
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,920
- Kamduang and Teacher are gone.
- What?

135
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,320
Kamduang, I woke up
and couldn't find you and Teacher.

136
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,880
Where did you go? What happened?

137
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
Dad and I overheard some bandits talking.

138
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,040
They're planning to rob the foreign guns.

139
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,040
Dad, I must go warn my dear…

140
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,760
I mean, Khun Aek,

141
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,920
so he can prepare
to defend against them in time.

142
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,600
Didn't you say

143
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
it was completely over
between you and Khun Aek?

144
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,920
It is. But how can I just sit back
and pretend nothing's happening,

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,760
knowing he's in danger? I can't do that.

146
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,800
Fine then, Kamduang.

147
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,600
Go warn Khun Aek and come straight back.

148
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,160
If you're doing more than just
warning him, it might take longer.

149
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
What else could I do?

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
You never know.

151
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
I mean it. I'm only going to warn him.

152
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,240
Alright. Go quickly and come back quickly.

153
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll start heading out slowly,

154
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,000
and you can catch up to me tomorrow.

155
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, Dad.

156
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,800
Good thing
you didn't have royal duty today,

157
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,840
so we got to offer alms together.

158
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
They say if a man and woman

159
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,920
offer alms together,
it means they're destined to be together.

160
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,280
You cooked so much food,

161
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,200
but only one monk came.

162
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
You can share the rest with the servants.

163
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Yes.

164
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,960
I have work to do.

165
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,960
Are you heading back now?
I can have Juan take you.

166
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,360
No need. Please go ahead with your work.

167
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,280
Ugh!

168
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,640
Yeesoon.

169
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,360
I was just clumsy, that's all.

170
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,480
Oh my! What happened? Lady Yeesoon!

171
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,600
Lady Yeesoon.

172
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,120
Your clothes are all messy now.

173
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,720
Juan, get her a change of clothes.

174
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,040
Yes, sir.

175
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,040
Let's go, Lady Yeesoon.

176
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,240
Oh my. Let's go, my lady.

177
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,960
Oh.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
What business do you have?

179
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,120
Is my dear, uh, Khun Aek home?

180
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,240
He is.

181
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,160
I think you'd better wait at the pavilion.

182
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,280
I'll go get Khun Aek for you.

183
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,080
But you'll have to wait a while.

184
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,760
I need to give Lady Yeesoon's clothes
to Yip for laundry.

185
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,760
She stayed here last night

186
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,880
with Khun Aek

187
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,280
and didn't bring a change.

188
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,160
Don't just stand there.

189
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Go wait at the pavilion.

190
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,800
Go.

191
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
Lady Yeesoon, wait a moment.

192
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,520
What is it, Juan?

193
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
Kamduang is here.

194
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,240
She says she needs to see Khun Aek.

195
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,800
Well,

196
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,160
I told her

197
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,720
you spent the night here with Khun Aek.

198
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,960
Lady Yeesoon,

199
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
shouldn't you

200
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,560
assert your position now?

201
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,080
Sure.

202
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,680
Let's go, my lady.

203
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,360
Juan told me
you had business with Khun Aek.

204
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,160
Didn't you say you'd never come back?

205
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,680
Did you lie?

206
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,760
I have urgent matters

207
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,800
to tell him about now.

208
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,480
What kind of business?

209
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I can't say. It's classified information.

210
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
Don't give me that.
I think there's no secret.

211
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,680
I think you're just here

212
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,400
to crawl back and be his wife again.

213
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,080
Isn't that shameless?

214
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
- Yeesoon, I didn't think you'd--
- I'll say it plainly.

215
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Last night, I slept with him.

216
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,000
We're husband and wife now.

217
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,079
Don't mess with us.

218
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,560
Go back to where you came from.

219
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,880
Fine.

220
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,400
I don't need to see him.

221
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,400
But let me leave a letter.

222
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,560
<i>I hear the bandits under Srichai</i>

223
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,920
<i>are planning to ambush the foreign guns.</i>

224
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
Please give this to Khun Aek immediately.

225
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,520
It's urgent and dangerous.

226
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,480
Fine.

227
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,640
If you're done, just go.

228
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,680
Throw it away.

229
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,640
Don't you want to read

230
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,480
what she was writing?

231
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,120
No. I don't trust her.

232
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,800
Who knows what kind of spell
she's hidden in it.

233
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,880
She's not ordinary.

234
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,600
You'd better burn it.

235
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,680
Yes, my lady.

236
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,920
Kamduang said it was urgent…

237
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,200
it must be serious.

238
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,760
If I burn it,

239
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
I'll never know the truth.

240
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,600
But Lady Yeesoon

241
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,080
told me to burn it…

242
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,600
Ugh, I'm so curious.

243
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,960
What should It do?

244
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
Let's take a peek.

245
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,800
I HEAR THE BANDITS UNDER SRICHAI
ARE PLANNING TO AMBUSH THE FOREIGN GUNS

246
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,280
What?

247
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
But I can't read.

248
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
How would I know what it says?

249
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,200
Alright, let's burn it.

250
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
Yeesoon? You're still here?

251
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,240
I was just about to leave.

252
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,000
Could you escort me home?

253
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,040
I'd like to borrow your presence,

254
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,040
just in case someone sees me
in borrowed clothes

255
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,680
and starts spreading
false rumors about you and me.

256
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,840
I'll say it plainly.

257
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,600
Last night,

258
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,160
I slept with him.

259
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,280
We're husband and wife now.

260
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,280
Go back to where you came from.

261
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,920
I'll send the foreign guns
to Fort Udon Kampanat

262
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
to defend against those Srichai bandits.

263
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,640
I agree, Sir.

264
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,920
If the Srichai bandits make a move,
they'll most likely be from there.

265
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm assigning you
to lead the transport of them.

266
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,080
Yes, Sir.

267
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,720
This mission is classified.

268
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,320
Do not let the word get out.

269
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,200
If the enemy finds out,

270
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,600
they may intercept and seize the weapons.

271
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
The damage would be catastrophic.

272
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,840
Understood, Sir.

273
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,480
I'll see this mission through

274
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,200
with my life.

275
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,120
Good.

276
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,640
Go prepare.

277
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,920
You depart tonight.

278
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Yes, Sir.

279
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,600
Khun Aek already
sent men to collect the guns.

280
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,240
Forty in total, Sir.

281
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,840
They moved quickly, as I expected.

282
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,440
Where are they being taken?

283
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,560
To Fort Udon Kampanat, Sir.

284
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you.

285
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,520
Be extremely careful.

286
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,240
Even though this operation is top secret,

287
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,640
it's still one of the most dangerous.

288
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,360
I understand, Sir.

289
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,680
May the sacred spirits
of Thung Yai City protect you all.

290
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,400
Yes, Sir.

291
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,080
Let's move.

292
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,120
Stop.

293
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,920
Split the guns into two squads.

294
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,160
Muen Yod, Muen Chum, Muen Mun, Muen Chai,

295
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,320
you come with me.

296
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,560
The rest,

297
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,560
follow the main road
and we'll regroup at Fort Udon Kampanat.

298
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,280
If the Srichai gang ambushes us,

299
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,880
at least we'll be armed.

300
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,800
Yes, Sir.

301
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,640
Hurry.

302
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,040
Pull back.

303
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,840
Don't panic.

304
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,800
This is black magic

305
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,080
from the Srichai bandits.

306
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
It's just an illusion.

307
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,200
Bandit Srichai,

308
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,080
I know that voice.

309
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,760
And I remember you too, Khun Aek Itthirit.

310
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,440
It's time for my revenge.

311
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,720
Come out if you're so brave.

312
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,200
Stop hiding!

313
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,760
Come out!

314
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,800
I want you to secretly follow Khun Aek,

315
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,520
but don't let him know.

316
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,200
Do you

317
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,200
not trust him?

318
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
It's not that.

319
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,920
I just want to ensure his safety.

320
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,680
I need you to protect him
if danger arises.

321
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,360
Understood.

322
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
Show yourself!

323
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,200
It must be that symbol…

324
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,200
that's causing the illusion.

325
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
Who did it?

326
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,840
I'll handle her.

327
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,160
Form the rifle wall!

328
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,200
You're the reason I've grown stronger.

329
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,840
Actually,

330
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,600
I should've died by your hand.

331
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,520
<i>But fate</i>

332
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,640
<i>brought me to the Ghost Field.</i>

333
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,840
Those evil spirits

334
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,720
tried to take me…

335
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,280
Come at me!

336
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,440
But instead, my spell devoured them.

337
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,840
That's how I gained this power.

338
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,960
Fire!

339
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,040
Servant Ghosts, take them!

340
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,800
It's your time to die, Khun Aek.

341
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,320
My sword

342
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,520
is the Seven-Metal Sacred Sword

343
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Your Mystic Ore

344
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,960
is gone now.

345
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,320
Khun Pra!

346
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Khun Pra Saming,

347
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,880
his sword was covered with poison.

348
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,520
If it reaches your heart,

349
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,800
you'll die.

350
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,560
Ping,

351
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,000
stop right now. If you get poisoned,

352
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,440
you'll die too.

353
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,960
I already told you…

354
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,840
I'll be loyal to you

355
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,600
until the day I die.

356
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,440
Khun Pra Saming!

357
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,920
Khun Pra.

358
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,280
Khun Pra Saming!

359
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,040
Khun Pra Saming!

360
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,400
Khun Pra.

361
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Ping?

362
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,160
Oh? Kamduang?

363
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,640
Where are you going?

364
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,800
I'm going back to my father.
What about you?

365
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,840
I was sent to help Khun Aek,

366
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,080
but Nok Lek saw me, so we fought.

367
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,800
Khun Phra Saming came to help

368
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
and got hurt.

369
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,080
And what about Khun Aek?

370
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,600
Khun Aek was sending
the guns to Fort Udon Kampanat,

371
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,720
but got ambushed
by Srichai's men along the way.

372
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,200
I'll go help him.

373
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,520
Where did the ambush happen?

374
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,920
North of here, before the fort.

375
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,960
- What about Phra Saming?
- Don't worry.

376
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,720
I'll take care of him.

377
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,080
You should hurry.

378
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,240
Alright.

379
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,000
Khun Pra Saming.

380
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,600
You're awake.

381
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,200
Water…

382
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Water…

383
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,880
Be careful.

384
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,080
Here's some water.

385
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,719
I'll get more water.

386
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,719
You must drink a lot.

387
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,719
Water helps flush out the poison.

388
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,760
Ping.

389
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,800
Stay with me, please.

390
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,640
Am I dreaming right now?

391
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,680
It's really you.

392
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,200
Kamduang.

393
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Kamduang.

394
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,560
Dear…

395
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Khun Aek, don't forget,

396
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,520
we are nothing to each other now.

397
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,320
Please keep your distance.

398
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,040
What's wrong with you?

399
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,800
You're injured.

400
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,560
I'm fine. The Mystic Ore protected me.

401
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,240
But how did you get here?

402
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,680
I met Ping.

403
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,280
She said you were fighting Bandit Srichai.

404
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
Yes.

405
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,040
I escaped,

406
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,520
and you tackled me to the ground.

407
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,680
If I hadn't,

408
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,480
you would've been done.

409
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,000
They must've laid traps like this
all around their hideout.

410
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,520
That means they're nearby.

411
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,920
Where are the guns?

412
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
They've probably taken them.

413
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
Then I'll help you find them.

414
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,760
It's dangerous.

415
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,200
That's exactly

416
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,800
why I must help.

417
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,920
You're worried about me?

418
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,400
Yes. I'm worried…

419
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,560
about the guns.

420
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,400
They'll use them to attack the city.

421
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
I thought you cared about me.

422
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,280
Let's find their hideout.

423
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,320
Foreign guns…

424
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,720
such deadly power.

425
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,520
Not even steel

426
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,280
can withstand it.

427
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,480
I've got 20 guns.

428
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,080
I'll use their own guns

429
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,760
to slaughter
the soldiers of Thung Yai City.

430
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,720
Did you get her?

431
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm sorry. I couldn't capture Ping.

432
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,080
Someone helped her.

433
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,960
Ping…

434
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,320
She's just a pawn.

435
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,960
I want Khun Aek's head.

436
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,400
Go get it before he returns to the city.

437
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,520
Yes, sir.

438
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,080
I've called for reinforcements.

439
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,800
They'll arrive

440
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,320
in a few days.

441
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,440
Once we're all together,

442
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,880
we'll be ready to attack.

443
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,320
Good.

444
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,240
Well.

445
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,560
Tell Khun Men

446
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,240
to get out

447
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,960
before we raid the city.

448
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,320
Understood.

449
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,800
We've secured the foreign guns.

450
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,000
Your intel

451
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,720
was very helpful.

452
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,160
Here's your reward.

453
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,840
Where's Khun Aek hiding now?

454
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,840
Right now,

455
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,880
Nok Lek is hunting him.

456
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,400
Sir Srichai sent me to warn you

457
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,320
to leave Thung Yai City
as soon as possible.

458
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,200
On the day we march in
to plunder the city,

459
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,720
chaos will consume everything.

460
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm not going anywhere.

461
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,400
I've got unfinished business.

462
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,120
What kind?

463
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
Khun Aek.

464
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,160
I hate that bastard.

465
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,240
If he makes it back to the city,

466
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,040
I'll bury him alive.

467
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,240
They're behind that symbol.

468
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,760
They used a camouflage spell
to hide their lair.

469
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,040
The scent of gunpowder leads that way.

470
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,680
Srichai would never expect me

471
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,800
to strike his hideout.

472
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,400
Thank you, Kamduang.

473
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,880
You can go back now.

474
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,960
What?

475
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,920
You wanted to go home, didn't you?

476
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,960
Yes,

477
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,440
but I told you

478
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,480
I'm worried about the stolen guns.

479
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,440
I'll handle it. Go.

480
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,320
So, Dear--

481
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,640
I mean, Khun Aek,

482
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,840
are you planning to go in alone?

483
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,760
Yes.

484
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,520
How will you retrieve the guns?

485
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,080
Alone?
Who knows how many bandits are in there.

486
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,400
I have my ways.

487
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,280
Just go.

488
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,280
Just leave.

489
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,880
I said go.

490
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,840
Fine.

491
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,040
I'll go.

492
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,640
Farewell, Kamduang…

493
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,880
my heart.

494
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,400
He really went in alone?

495
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,800
That idiot.

496
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,440
Khun Aek…

497
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,280
Srichai.

498
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,800
So you've finally
walked right into my trap.

499
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,160
Are you trying to take the guns back?

500
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,840
Dream on.

501
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,920
Not only will you fail,

502
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,520
but your life ends here.
I'm going to kill you

503
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,440
in the most painful way possible.

504
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,920
What are you smiling at?

505
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,800
Don't move

506
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,800
if you want to live.

507
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,360
You're Bandit Srichai,

508
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,480
the fearsome warlock-bandit,

509
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,520
and yet you made three huge mistakes.

510
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,080
First,

511
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,000
you let me sneak in here.

512
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,960
Second,

513
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,000
you thought I came for the guns.

514
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,840
And third,

515
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,600
you kept the bullets

516
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,080
in the same crate as them.

517
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,680
I'm going to blow up everything in here,

518
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,720
including your life,

519
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,680
and mine.

520
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,640
Khun Aek.

521
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,400
Go ahead.

522
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,560
Light it.

523
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,320
Light it.

524
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,840
You'd rather see your wife die too, right?

525
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,960
Kamduang…

526
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,880
Light it, Dear.

527
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,120
Don't worry about me.

528
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,240
Put the fire down,

529
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,240
and I'll let both of you go.

530
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,760
Let Kamduang go first,

531
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,000
then I'll drop the fire.

532
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,600
You know

533
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,520
the longer you stall,

534
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,560
the closer my reinforcements get.

535
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,000
You won't survive then.

536
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,640
Let's see

537
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,040
who gets here first, your men,

538
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,280
or Thung Yai City's soldiers.

539
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,880
I doubt your soldiers
can even reach this far.

540
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,800
Not everyone

541
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,560
can break through my barrier.

542
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,400
Put it down.

543
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
Hey!

544
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,280
- Ugh!
- Hey!

545
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,960
Hey!

546
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,240
Put it out!

547
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,120
Quick!

548
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,800
Hurry!

549
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,600
Khun Pra Saming,

550
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,280
how are you feeling?

551
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,880
Better now.

552
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,480
Thank you, Ping.

553
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,880
No need to thank me.

554
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,880
You were hurt

555
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,280
because you came to save me.

556
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,560
But why did you follow me, sir?

557
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,960
Be careful.

558
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,680
I was so focused
on having you protect Khun Aek,

559
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,240
that I forgot you could be in danger too.

560
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,240
So I followed you.

561
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,680
You didn't have to go that far.

562
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,000
You're the city's governor.

563
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,880
Your life matters more.

564
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,760
We can talk later.

565
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,560
I must get back to Thung Yai City.

566
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,000
If Bandit Srichai
gets those guns and attacks the city.

567
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,280
that would be a disaster.

568
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,960
Be careful, sir.

569
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,040
Sir,

570
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,760
Khun Aek and Kamduang escaped.

571
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,680
Sir,

572
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,320
I just heard what happened.

573
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,440
Khun Aek and Kamduang humiliated me.

574
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,360
You two, come with me.

575
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,800
We'll take their heads

576
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,400
and mount them at our camp gate.

577
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,680
This time,

578
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,600
I'll let you drink
Khun Aek's blood until you get your fill.

579
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,320
It should be safe here.

580
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,800
I'll part ways with you now.

581
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,160
I may be safe,

582
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,280
but Thung Yai City isn't.

583
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,440
Srichai has the foreign guns.

584
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,400
I think he'll attack soon.

585
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,440
So why are you telling me this?

586
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,360
Because I'm not letting you
go anywhere again.

587
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,480
Let me go.

588
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,080
Dear.

589
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,160
Just hearing you call me "dear"

590
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,400
could make me die happy.

591
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,680
I still don't know

592
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,720
what I did wrong to make you angry.

593
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,800
I'm not angry.

594
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,200
If you're not,

595
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
why are you so cold to me?

596
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,000
Don't forget,

597
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,840
we have no ties

598
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,280
or connections anymore.

599
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,840
Let's just go our separate ways.

600
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,360
That's not true. If we weren't connected,

601
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,440
why did you come back to save me?

602
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,040
Let go.

603
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,840
Buffalo-throwing punch!

604
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,520
Hit me, then.

605
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,720
You think I won't?

606
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,240
Of course, you're not afraid.

607
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,560
You've got someone else
to treat your wound now

608
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,080
That's why you're not afraid.

609
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,320
Who are you talking about?

610
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,800
The one you've already made your wife.

611
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,960
My wife?

612
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,000
Didn't you once say a nobleman

613
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,400
must have dignity and honesty?

614
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,360
And now you play dumb, like you
don't know what I'm talking about?

615
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,560
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

616
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,280
It's Yeesoon.

617
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,160
I don't know what you heard or saw,

618
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,160
but I swear,
nothing happened between Yeesoon and me.

619
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,080
You know me.

620
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,800
Tell me honestly,

621
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,240
do you think I'd lie like that?

622
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,920
Whether you have someone or not

623
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,480
has nothing to do with me.

624
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,680
How could I have someone else

625
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,000
when I still…

626
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,760
think of you?

627
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,960
Why do you still think of me?

628
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,800
Because thinking of you

629
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,920
takes the sorrow away.

630
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,280
Whatever I do,

631
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,760
I keep imagining you by my side.

632
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,920
I see you, I hear your voice everywhere…

633
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,600
I got you!

634
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,920
Does that feel good?

635
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,640
Even for a brief moment…

636
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,400
it makes me happy.

637
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,960
Kamduang,

638
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,280
I…

639
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,400
Come here.

640
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,040
Let's split up and search for them.

641
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,600
What should we do next, Dear?

642
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,480
What are you smiling at again?

643
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,200
I'm just happy you called me "dear" again.

644
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,760
I told you already, it's just a habit.

645
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,960
I think you should run ahead.

646
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,400
Uncle Yod must be worried sick by now.

647
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,240
I'll stay and handle them myself.

648
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,000
If you were facing them alone,

649
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,520
I wouldn't be sure you could win.

650
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,800
But if we fight together,

651
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,720
I believe we can take them down.

652
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,040
I'll fight by your side to the very end.

653
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,160
Then we fight to the end together.

654
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,800
Khun Aek!

655
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,200
Kamduang!

656
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,280
Come out now!

657
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,000
Freeze!

658
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,440
<i>If there is a next life,</i>

659
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,880
I pray we are truly husband and wife,

660
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,240
with no deceit or trickery.

661
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,200
Yes.

662
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,040
<i>If there is a next life,</i>

663
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,840
<i>may we stay side by side forever.</i>

664
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,360
Are you done with your sweet nothings?

665
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,480
Don't even dream of reincarnation,

666
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,840
because your souls

667
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,840
will belong to me as eternal slaves!

668
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,360
Too bad I didn't get to see
Khun Aek die with my own eyes.

669
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,960
Let's just get the money and run.

670
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,360
Yod.

671
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,040
Dad is gone…

672
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,600
