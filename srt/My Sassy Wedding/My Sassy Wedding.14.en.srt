1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,160
Please don't hurt my husband.

2
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,720
Husband?

3
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,600
Yes, I love him.

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,880
You swore to tell the truth.

5
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes. I truly love him.

6
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,160
Kham.

7
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,760
Yes, Teacher?

8
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Kamduang is Khun Aek's wife now.

9
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,080
They are married.

10
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,680
Is that true?

11
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
Yes.

12
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,200
<i>Khun Aek and I are husband and wife.</i>

13
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,520
Buffalo trader versus nobleman.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,320
<i>I want to see.</i>

15
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,240
Teacher, I'll stay here longer.

16
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,400
I'll wait for the day
Kamduang leaves her husband.

17
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,680
And how long will you wait?

18
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,720
Kham,

19
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,480
this morning I heard you telling
my husband that you would wait for me.

20
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,080
But now, I am already Khun Aek's wife.

21
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,600
I know.

22
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Then why would you still wait for me?

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,320
There are so many good women,
practically half the village likes you.

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,960
You need not worry for me, Kamduang.

25
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,840
I will wait no matter what.

26
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
I will wait with hope.

27
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,480
You are worth waiting my whole life for,

28
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Kamduang.

29
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,040
REPORT ON IRREGULARITIES
IN THE TESTING OF FOREIGN GUNS

30
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,560
It's late, Dear. Won't you go to bed?

31
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,920
I haven't finished my report.
You go first.

32
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,480
Yes, Dear.

33
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,560
THE FOREIGN WEAPON TEST WAS A FAILURE.
THE GUN BARREL EXPLODED DURING FIRING,

34
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,960
SEVERELY INJURING MULTIPLE PERSONNEL.
THUS, NO DEAL SHOULD BE MADE WITH THEM.

35
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,160
You have read Khun Aek's report.

36
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
What are your thoughts?

37
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,320
I understand
there are indeed irregularities

38
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,000
in the gun testing, Sir.

39
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,480
I agree with Khun Pra Yong.

40
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
As for me,

41
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,120
I think this report reads like madness.

42
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,840
Baseless. Unfounded.

43
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
This is an official document,

44
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,520
yet you write it
as though it were a fable.

45
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,960
Khun Pra Mek! This is the City Hall.

46
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,160
Don't show your thuggish behavior here.

47
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,360
Enough.

48
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,240
First, tell me

49
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,640
why did you submit this report
earlier than the deadline?

50
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,680
I distrust the current state of affairs
regarding Bandit Srichai.

51
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,960
And I do not trust
this hasty procurement of guns.

52
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,640
If I waited until the deadline,

53
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,560
I feared harm might already be done.

54
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,160
Then, you mean you distrust my judgment.

55
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,600
About Bandit Srichai,
I have already increased patrols.

56
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
As for the guns from Khun Men,
I already made it clear

57
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,840
that I'll decide only after
the Western guns are fully reviewed.

58
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,440
- I--
- Your report holds only conjecture.

59
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,200
But no proof.

60
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,320
As Khun Phra Mek said,

61
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,080
a mere fable.

62
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,880
You are a nobleman.
Matters like these are grave.

63
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,520
How could you work so carelessly?

64
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,280
I think

65
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,600
if the Western guns proved faulty,
then admit it.

66
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,200
To resist would only bring loss upon all.

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,160
Yeah.

68
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,480
Khun Pra, teach your son.

69
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,560
He is grown, yet still witless.

70
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,120
Khun Pra Saming was right.

71
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,560
Your reasoning is sharp,
but there's no evidence.

72
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,800
I could find no proof.

73
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,920
So I relied on logic.

74
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,320
I thought Khun Pra Saming
would see it as I did.

75
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,680
He's the next governor.

76
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,680
Pressure surrounds him.

77
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,080
Every move must be cautious.

78
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,559
I admit

79
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,480
I was reckless.

80
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,720
This is unlike you.

81
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,679
What troubles you so?

82
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,040
This is about Kamduang, isn't it?

83
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Yes.

84
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,280
I only wish this matter ends soon,

85
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,960
so that she will be free

86
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,920
to return to the one she loves.

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
Aek,

88
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,080
you're letting your feelings
ruin your work.

89
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,200
You're doing far too much for Kamduang.

90
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
Anyone here know how to make
seasoned fried fermented fish?

91
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,560
Why ask?

92
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
Oh, Grandma.

93
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,280
Because Yip bought fermented fish
at the market.

94
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,080
She can't cook it. Neither can I.

95
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,200
I also can't. Then why bother buying it?

96
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,480
I didn't mean to.

97
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,880
But Khun Aek loves
seasoned fried fermented fish.

98
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,400
The old cook made it well.

99
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,280
I thought Juan could.

100
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,440
Me?

101
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
- Yes.
- Think again!

102
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,440
Can any of you make it?

103
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,560
No.

104
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,400
- What should we do?
- What should we do?

105
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
What are you going to cook?

106
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,920
Oh, Madam.

107
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,600
We're making
seasoned fried fermented fish.

108
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,280
Khun Aek loves it,
but none of us know how to make it.

109
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,720
I know how.

110
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,800
You do?

111
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,760
Of course.

112
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,560
But you're from Phra Nakhon. Why do you…?

113
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,200
Phra Nakhon or not,
people eat fermented fish everywhere.

114
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,760
I just found out he likes it. Otherwise,
I would've made it for him long ago.

115
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,000
Where is it?

116
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
It's here, ma'am.

117
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,600
Yip, Juan, Aoy,
you all go about your tasks.

118
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,600
I'll handle this.

119
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,600
<i>You're letting your feelings</i>
<i>ruin your work.</i>

121
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,240
<i>You're doing far too much for Kamduang.</i>

122
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,840
- Grandma Aoy.
- Yes, sir?

123
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,640
Who cooked today?

124
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,640
Madam herself, sir.

125
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,640
Juan bought fermented fish.
Once Madam learned

126
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,440
you liked it,

127
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,920
she cooked it herself immediately.

128
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,680
I knew it.

129
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,280
What is it, Kham?

130
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,760
The smell of seasoned
fried fermented fish is familiar.

131
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,160
I missed it so much.

132
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,680
Delicious, just like before.
To taste your cooking again

133
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
is worth coming all the way here.

134
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,960
Come, Kamduang.

135
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Teacher Yod is at the pavilion downstairs.
Let's eat with him.

136
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,920
He wants it too.

137
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,680
Let's go.

138
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,760
Why did I think she cooked for me?

139
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,040
What a fool.

140
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,520
Kham,

141
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,640
you take this to eat with Dad.

142
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,760
Won't you eat with us?

143
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,560
I won't.

144
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,640
Dear,

145
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
I've prepared a meal for you.

146
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,600
It's all my own cooking. My signature
dish. Whoever tastes it praises it.

147
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,320
Lucky me. I got to eat it too.

148
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Leave it there.

149
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,560
Won't you eat it now?

150
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,440
Just leave it there.

151
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
Well, if you don't want
to eat it, then don't.

152
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,600
Where are you going, Dear?

153
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,840
To sleep outside the room.

154
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,600
The servants will start suspecting.

155
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,400
A wife despising her husband
and sending him out looks realistic.

156
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,080
Isn't that similar
to our real life anyway?

157
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,080
Fine. Sleep wherever you want.

158
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,480
Whoa.

159
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,119
- Pay me.
- Alright.

160
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,760
Go.

161
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,160
Khun Men. I'm done playing.

162
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,079
Oh?

163
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,000
Why are you avoiding me, Juan?

164
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,680
Because the talisman
you gave me last time,

165
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,480
you said it was a charm of friendship.

166
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,800
But it wasn't friendly at all.

167
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,000
It almost killed Khun Aek and Madam.

168
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,880
Yes. It was a killing talisman.

169
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,240
You tricked me.

170
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,960
I won't do anything anymore.

171
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm scared. I won't do anything anymore.

172
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Fine. Then I'll tell your master

173
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,520
that you took my money, and that
it was you who put it under their bed.

174
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,120
Sir, don't do that.

175
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,880
Otherwise, I'll be executed for sure.

176
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,040
Then you'll do everything I order.

177
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,560
Tell me. How did Khun Aek survive

178
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,720
that powerful talisman?

179
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,640
It was Madam. She saved Khun Aek

180
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,880
and took the curse into herself instead.

181
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,480
And how did she survive?

182
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,040
She almost didn't. But luckily,
her father arrived just in time

183
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,360
and removed the curse.

184
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,520
Juan, I think your Madam is strange.

185
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,800
What kind
of Phra Nakhon ladies know sorcery?

186
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,520
And her father is skilled enough

187
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
to undo Shaman Dum's spell?

188
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,840
And there's more.

189
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,040
Khun Pra Chuay forbade us servants
from speaking with Madam's father.

190
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,520
Then later, another relative
of hers named Kham arrived,

191
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,920
and we were forbidden from
talking to him too.

192
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,880
I want to meet your Madam's father myself.

193
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,040
I must thank you, Khun Pra Chuay,

194
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,160
for bringing me
to pay respects to the abbot here.

195
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,680
Wherever I go,
I always try to visit the local abbot

196
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,520
for blessings.

197
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,280
Think nothing of it, Yod.

198
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,280
Where's Kham, Dad?
Why didn't he come with us?

199
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,520
He can stay behind on his own.
We're not stuck together.

200
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,920
Why, are you afraid
he'll run back to Isaan?

201
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,760
No, it's not that. I just worry
about him falling ill or something.

202
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,600
Khun Men, are you here to pay respects?

203
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,760
Well,

204
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,000
I had a bad dream about you last night.

205
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,040
I was just about
to ask the abbot about it.

206
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,200
Come along, maybe he can interpret for us.

207
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,360
That's strange,

208
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,600
because I also dreamed last night.
I saw Kamduang, Khun Aek…

209
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
and another man.

210
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,840
He looks just like this uncle.

211
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,360
Let's interpret
all our dreams together then.

212
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,880
Anyway,

213
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,480
You are…

214
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,840
My name is Yod. I am Kamduang's father.

215
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,680
Kamduang's father?

216
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,320
You must've come
a long way from Phra Nakhon.

217
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,400
Which part of Phra Nakhon do you live in?

218
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,760
Even if he tells you,
you wouldn't know it.

219
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,080
Haven't you only been to Phra Nakhon
a handful of times?

220
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,680
Lucky then, that I brought
Khun Pra Saming with me today.

221
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,040
I was talking about Phra Nakhon
with Uncle Yod.

222
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,960
We only spoke briefly the other day.

223
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,840
So, Yod, which street
or canal in Phra Nakhon do you live by?

224
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,000
Well?

225
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,800
Don't make things up, Uncle.

226
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
Khun Pra Saming
knows every corner of Phra Nakhon.

227
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
I live near Wat Sam Pluem.

228
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,840
Oh, Wat Chai Chana Songkram,

229
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,920
the abbot there recently
dug a pond to raise otters, right?

230
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,040
No, no. That's Wat Tuek.

231
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,520
Wat Sam Pluem is actually Wat Chakrawat.

232
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,120
The abbot there
dug a pond for blind crocodiles.

233
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,440
Right, of course. My mistake.

234
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,240
I've even heard bits and pieces
about that from here in Thung Yai City.

235
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,400
Why don't you share
some stories in Phra Nakhon with us?

236
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,000
My neighborhood is full of
Chinese and Westerners. It's chaotic.

237
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,120
There are too many stories.
I'd go on forever if I told them.

238
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,520
But for oddities,
you should see the foreign stores.

239
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,000
They sell bottled soda
that makes your tongue go weirdly numb.

240
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,600
And bicycles, if you don't know how
to ride, you'll crash and split your lip.

241
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,120
But strangest of all,

242
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,280
is the mirror camera
that captures people's faces onto glass.

243
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,800
It's uncanny.

244
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,640
Living in Phra Nakhon
isn't a waste for you.

245
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,960
You've truly kept up with
the changes of Phra Nakhon.

246
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
Honestly, Khun Aek and I
thought we were doomed.

247
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,280
I didn't expect you
to have such sharp wit.

248
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,880
Your answers flowed like a river.

249
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,880
I was amazed. How did you know so much?

250
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,480
It was nothing much.

251
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,800
I often herded buffaloes
to sell in Phra Nakhon.

252
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,800
I met a lot of kind customers

253
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,720
and they would take me around.

254
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
That's how I learned things.

255
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,440
Oh, that's how it is.

256
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,040
Hey, Khun Men clearly tried to expose us.

257
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,160
That's why he brought
Khun Pra Saming along.

258
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,200
Did you see his face? Priceless!

259
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,600
I was satisfied. Let's drink.

260
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,960
To victory,

261
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,480
and also to bid Yod farewell.

262
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
Whoa.

263
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,160
Khun Pra, you really understand me.

264
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,640
Wherever I go,
I must pay respects to the local abbot

265
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,560
and drink the local liquor.

266
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,080
Otherwise, the trip doesn't count.

267
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Let's drink. Come, Vet Yoy.

268
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,320
Come on, Kham. Let's live it up tonight.

269
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,360
What about you two? Won't you join in?

270
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,600
You drink, Father.
Tomorrow I must go to the city hall.

271
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,520
I don't enjoy drinking.

272
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
Shall you sing then?

273
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,320
Singing?

274
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,400
I can do it.

275
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,320
Hold on.

276
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,240
<i>Chuchok arrives in Mae Amitda’s land</i>

277
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,960
<i>A fair young maiden</i>

278
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,880
<i>A fair young maiden</i>

279
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
<i>Just blooming</i>

280
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,920
<i>Into her youthful years</i>

281
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,160
<i>So pure and bright</i>

282
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,200
<i>A lovely girl, around fourteen or fifteen</i>

283
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,440
<i>Young Amitda</i>

284
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
<i>Blossoming</i>

285
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,800
<i>Of beauty</i>

286
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,320
Kamduang is Khun Aek's wife now.

287
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,720
They're husband and wife.
They are married.

288
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,280
Hurry up. Let's get this place in order.

289
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,600
Is this Shaman Chan's place?

290
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,320
Yes.

291
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,720
I've heard that you're skilled in sorcery.

292
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,760
especially in love-binding spells.

293
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,280
They say any couple you bind together
will stay in love until death.

294
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,440
And who do you want me to bind?

295
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,280
Myself and the lady named Kamduang.

296
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,160
Khun Aek's wife?

297
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,800
You know her too?

298
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,560
This man is a fraud.
His spells are useless.

299
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,440
His spell backfired,

300
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,640
nearly making him
sleep with his own disciple.

301
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
Who are you?

302
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,760
Say it again. Who hired you

303
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,080
to curse Kamduang? Is this her?

304
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,720
Tell the truth.

305
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,240
You're the one
Khun Aek brought me to point out.

306
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,800
You're Yeesoon, aren't you?

307
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,680
Then why are you here to shame me?

308
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,920
All my troubles now are because of you.

309
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,320
Then return my money. You failed
at the job, yet dared to blame me.

310
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,680
I won't return it!

311
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,080
I won't accept that. You will return it.

312
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,680
How can I return it?

313
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,520
I don't even have a single coin left.

314
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,280
- I beg you. Yeesoon!
- What? Let go of me.

315
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,600
Please.

316
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,280
What a joke. I came to reclaim money,
not lend you more.

317
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,320
And you? Lend me some.

318
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,840
- Just a little.
- I don't have any.

319
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,440
Please. I swear I'll repay you soon.

320
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,040
- So your name is Kham?
- Yes.

321
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm Yeesoon. I'm Kamduang's friend.

322
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,840
What kind of friend?

323
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,240
I could tell from what Shaman Chan said.

324
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,320
Smart of you.

325
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,400
Good. That saves us
from beating around the bush.

326
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,920
Do you love Kamduang?

327
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,640
Since the days in Phra Nakhon?

328
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,200
If they know she lied,

329
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,720
she'll be humiliated,

330
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,720
<i>maybe even punished by the authorities</i>

331
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,560
for deception.

332
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,640
And right now
she's helping Khun Aek with his duties.

333
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,800
Don't you pity her?

334
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,120
Yes.

335
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,760
I gave her my heart
when we were in Phra Nakhon.

336
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,280
Seems you still can't let her go.

337
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,720
Before Kamduang came along,
I was with Khun Aek.

338
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,680
Then she came and took him from me.

339
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,080
Don't you feel the same,
that your love was stolen?

340
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,120
I do.

341
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,360
And don't you feel the same, that you
won't give up, that you'll take it back?

342
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
- I do.
- Then don't you agree…

343
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,520
We should work together?

344
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,720
Absolutely.

345
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Kham,

346
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,920
where are you going?

347
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,400
I'm going into the forest
to gather some things.

348
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,320
What things?

349
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,840
Some wild fruits. To bring back
for Teacher to snack on the way home.

350
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,720
Oh, that's nice.

351
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,240
I'm not sure what I'll find.

352
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,800
I don't know
the trees around here too well.

353
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,720
Then let me go with you.

354
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,120
Is that okay?

355
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,720
You're Khun Aek's wife now.

356
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,160
If gossip spreads,

357
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,720
people will sneer.

358
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
Aren't you afraid?

359
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,560
If I were afraid, I wouldn't be Kamduang.

360
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,360
You saying that
only makes me want to go more.

361
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,280
Let's go.

362
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,280
Wow…

363
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,760
Arm in arm. Where are they going?

364
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,400
I don't gossip. That's not me.

365
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,840
Sure, high-and-mighty.

366
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,400
Ugh, my tongue's itching to spill it.

367
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,520
No, no.

368
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll be a good servant.

369
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,400
There, itch gone.

370
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,080
One more.

371
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,560
Yeesoon.

372
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,240
Khun Aek, what a coincidence.

373
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,280
Where are you going?

374
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,440
To the forest,
to gather herbs for my mother.

375
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,640
What's wrong with her?

376
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,840
She has a fever.

377
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,440
Why not buy from the apothecary?

378
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,200
The store's closed today,
so I have to gather them myself.

379
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,720
But it's nearly dark.
It's dangerous to go alone.

380
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,320
I know,

381
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,160
but if I'm lucky, I'll find them quickly.

382
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,520
Please excuse me.

383
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,440
Wait.

384
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,000
What if you don't find it?

385
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,600
I don't know.

386
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,440
In that case, I'll help you search.

387
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,880
Are you sure?
Don't you need to hurry back to Kamduang?

388
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,680
That's not necessary.

389
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,040
Then let's go quickly.

390
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,680
I'll get those eggs for Teacher.

391
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,560
Didn't you say you wanted fruit?

392
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,280
Leave the eggs.
Think of the mother bird. It's a sin.

393
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,560
It's fine. I'll sin for Teacher's sake.

394
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,360
Kham.

395
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,120
What's wrong?

396
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,960
I think my ankle's twisted.

397
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,880
I don't know if it's broken.

398
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,800
Can you take me to that hut to rest?

399
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,400
Alright.

400
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,600
Slowly.

401
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Is the herb you need around here?

402
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,000
Yes. I remember it's nearby.

403
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,560
Come in.

404
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,960
Sit here.

405
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,720
Kamduang,

406
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,360
close the door, please.

407
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,000
In forests like this, wandering spirits
may lurk. Teacher always warned me.

408
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,360
Why is it so hot in here?

409
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
How are you feeling?

410
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,200
It still hurts.

411
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,040
Oh, Kamduang,

412
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,760
I just remembered, I have ointment.
I'll massage it.

413
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,280
- I'll do it for you.
- Thank you.

414
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,400
- Here?
- Yes, right there.

415
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,440
Ouch, softer please.

416
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,720
Do you know any hidden forest huts,

417
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,440
the secluded and private kind?

418
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,480
I know a couple.

419
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,080
Pick one perfect for a lovers' tryst.

420
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,080
I'm not planning to defile Kamduang.

421
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,200
But I do want people to think

422
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,680
and believe that we did.

423
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,080
When you bring Khun Aek here,

424
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,920
whistle like a bird to signal me.

425
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,280
And you'll shake the hut,
and make noises, like…

426
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,160
Like this?

427
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,600
Seems like you've never had
any real trysts, have you?

428
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,760
Kamduang,

429
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,160
I feel better now.

430
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,240
Let's head back.

431
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,600
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

432
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,360
Over there, that's where the herbs are.

433
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,320
I don't need to do much.

434
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,520
But will Khun Aek really believe

435
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,400
you and Kamduang did anything?

436
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,040
Of course. The less you see,

437
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,800
the more your mind runs wild.
Especially if it's about the one you love,

438
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,080
your imagination always goes dark.

439
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,120
That's human nature.

440
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,720
What are you doing?

441
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,120
I'm going in.

442
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,320
They might not actually be doing anything.

443
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,760
Do you really believe that?

444
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,280
I'm more afraid you'll lose control
and do something rash.

445
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,400
Then what would you have me do?

446
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,560
If I were you, I'd stay silent.
I wouldn't say it and embarrass them.

447
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,400
What are you doing?

448
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,480
I'm afraid you won't be able to watch.
You'd better not see.

449
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,320
What is it?

450
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,480
I can walk…

451
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,040
but if you hold me, it's easier.

452
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,360
- It's nothing.
- Just tell me.

453
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,280
- Walk slowly.
- Okay.

454
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,120
It's nothing.

455
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,120
I only saw them walk off quietly.

456
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,520
Then Kamduang smiled to herself.

457
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,720
Not surprising.

458
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,680
That's what a happy person looks like.

459
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,760
With good liquor like this,

460
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,200
I'll never back down.

461
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Come on.

462
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Drink up.

463
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,880
Let's drink.

464
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,640
Oh? Thirsty, Aek? Come, drink with us.

465
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,680
Good.

466
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,520
Whoa, what's this?

467
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,760
You have work tomorrow, don't you?

468
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,240
And what right do you have to lecture me?

469
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,200
Oh, right. I forgot who I am.

470
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,440
Kamduang!

471
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,040
Didn't you say you don't drink?

472
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,040
Oh.

473
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,280
Ah, perfect timing, Khun Aek.

474
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,720
I have a legal question.

475
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,400
What is it?

476
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,480
Is adultery

477
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,840
against the law here in Thung Yai City?

478
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,080
Let's say

479
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,720
the man didn't force her.

480
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,720
The woman gave herself willingly.

481
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,920
Would that be illegal?

482
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,880
Yes.

483
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,120
But if they sneak into the forest
like some animals,

484
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,920
then perhaps not,
because there are no witnesses.

485
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,520
Well, well.

486
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,560
No one would do that in the marketplace.

487
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,960
Still, it's immoral.

488
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,800
I think morality is subjective.

489
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,400
When a man and woman love,
they naturally want closeness.

490
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,200
If she strays,
it's because her husband doesn't love

491
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,160
or desire her.

492
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,840
So tell me, if a husband finds out
his wife doesn't love him

493
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,880
or betrays him,

494
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,160
what should the husband do?

495
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,040
Let her continue?

496
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Or… divorce her?

497
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,880
I'll excuse myself.

498
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,080
- Of course, Sir.
- You're not helping.

499
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,560
Whoa.

500
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,000
Father,

501
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,160
I think…

502
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,880
I will divorce Kamduang.

503
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,080
What happened?

504
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,840
Kamduang has been
secretly intimate with Kham.

505
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,160
And how do you know this?

506
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,240
Did you ask her yourself?

507
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,680
I saw it with my own eyes.
No need to waste time asking.

508
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,520
But by logic,

509
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,280
Kamduang hasn't done wrong.

510
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,960
You and she aren't truly husband and wife.

511
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,320
That's true. but…

512
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,200
It hurts.

513
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,440
Well…

514
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,880
Right now,

515
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,080
I think divorcing Kamduang

516
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,440
won't raise suspicion
from Khun Pra Saming anymore.

517
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,200
But Aek,

518
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,840
are you certain?

519
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,280
I am.

520
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,160
Has Khun Aek spoken
of divorcing Kamduang yet?

521
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,880
Not yet.

522
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,320
Then your plan may not work.
I've tried this before,

523
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,440
but he never divorced her.

524
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,760
It will work.
We just haven't seen the result yet.

525
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,320
But a tree that's about to fall

526
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,360
can somehow recover if we leave it be.

527
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,800
We need to strike harder,

528
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,440
give it a push
until it collapses for good.

529
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,320
No need. We've already poisoned his heart.

530
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,920
Now we wait until it festers on its own.

531
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,560
Oh? You're not going home yet?

532
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,480
Khun Pra Yong.

533
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,760
Not yet, Sir. Why are you back?

534
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,000
I forgot a document.

535
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,280
What are you thinking about?

536
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,280
Nothing, Sir.

537
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,680
Wait, Sir.

538
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,480
May I ask you a question?

539
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,000
While we are still
in mourning for Lady Sri,

540
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,560
would it be permissible to divorce?

541
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,880
Yes, it would.
Mourning has nothing to do with divorce.

542
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,920
Wouldn't it be inauspicious?

543
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,160
Not at all.

544
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,800
Staying in a joyless marriage
is more inauspicious.

545
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,440
So divorce is possible.

546
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
Yes.

547
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,760
Tell the one who hesitates
that they can do it.

548
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,120
if they must divorce, then divorce.
No need for excuses.

549
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,040
Alright.

550
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,680
That's right.

551
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,000
if we must, we must.

552
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,520
I'll free you,

553
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,960
Kamduang.

554
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,440
Khun Aek.

555
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,360
Yeesoon, I've urgent matters.
We'll talk another time.

556
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,160
I have something important too.
Just a moment.

557
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,960
Let's talk another day.
I'm in a hurry to see Kamduang.

558
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,080
What I want to say
is about Kamduang as well.

559
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,120
Well,

560
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,240
I've heard troubling rumors about her.

561
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,040
What rumors?

562
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,880
That she's having an affair.

563
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,400
Who dares spread such vile lies?

564
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,240
I can't reveal the source.

565
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,680
But they say Kamduang and a man named Kham

566
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,120
have been secretly together,
many times, many places.

567
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,840
Many times, many places?

568
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,640
Some even heard her say…

569
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,360
Say what? Tell me.

570
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,040
She said,

571
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,840
you fell before it even started.

572
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,560
Now you two will surely part.
Don't call me cruel, Kamduang.

573
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,280
You were in my way, and you deserve this.

574
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,560
I have something important
to discuss with you.

575
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,000
You look furious with me.

576
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,800
If you're upset, just say it.

577
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,640
<i>Yeesoon said</i>
<i>people heard Kamduang mocking me,</i>

578
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
<i>that I fell before it even started.</i>

579
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,240
<i>But I've never even touched her.</i>

580
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,560
<i>And the rumor about her being</i>
<i>with Kham many times? Impossible.</i>

581
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,520
<i>She barely leaves the house.</i>

582
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,360
If you have questions, ask me.

583
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,600
<i>But what about what I saw in the forest?</i>

584
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,160
Kamduang,

585
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,480
I have something to ask.
Answer me honestly.

586
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,920
Sure. Ask away.

587
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,240
What were you doing
at that hut near the forest the other day?

588
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,920
Oh, Kham asked me
to gather fruit for Dad's journey.

589
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,040
That's all?

590
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,280
On the way, he twisted his ankle.

591
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,360
The rain looked ready to fall,

592
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,600
so I helped him rest inside the hut.

593
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,480
<i>With that look, she's not lying.</i>

594
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,760
<i>But what if she is?</i>

595
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,640
By the way, how do you know about this?

596
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,920
<i>How could I forget? This woman</i>
<i>has proven herself time and again.</i>

597
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,360
<i>She is one of the most loyal</i>
<i>and sincere people in my life.</i>

598
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,080
<i>She has risked her life</i>
<i>beside me more than once.</i>

599
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,040
<i>Why do I doubt her so easily?</i>

600
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,640
<i>Is it because…</i>

601
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,560
<i>I love her?</i>

602
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,840
Dear? Are you alright?

603
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,680
Kamduang,

604
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,680
I owe you an apology.

605
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,640
An apology?

606
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,360
For what?

607
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,440
For misjudging you.

608
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,720
And what did I misjudge?

609
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,520
I'll explain another day.

610
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,480
I have one more question.

611
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,480
Answer me plainly.

612
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,120
How do you feel about me?

613
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,640
Honestly,

614
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,880
I think

615
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,440
you're arrogant, fussy, and sharp-tongued.

616
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,640
But you're also responsible,

617
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,440
brave, selfless,

618
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,400
and your love for our country runs deep.

619
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,240
I should be clearer. I'll ask again.

620
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,800
I want to know

621
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,280
what your heart

622
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,920
feels toward me.

623
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
My feelings…

624
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,240
they have nothing to do
with your work on the gun deal.

625
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,040
I'm not asking as an official.

626
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,440
I'm asking as a man…

627
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,160
a man who loves you.

628
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,760
Dear…

629
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,000
That is my pledge.

630
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,280
It means my heart belongs to you now.

631
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,360
One day, when you are certain,

632
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,400
tell me

633
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,360
whether you will accept it,

634
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,080
or return it.

635
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,280
See? No matter
how they shoot, they'll never hit.

636
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,720
It's a smuggled gun.

637
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,360
But how did they know
there was a gun here?

638
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
I'm going too.

639
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,400
This is my enemy. Let me face him.

640
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,080
We'll face him together.

641
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,240
Yes.

642
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,160
We'll go together.

643
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,640
<i>Tonight, I have a dangerous mission.</i>

644
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,000
- <i>It's a risky mission.</i>
- Be careful.

645
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,520
May I give you my blessing, Khun Aek?

646
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,760
<i>Please do. It would be an honor.</i>

647
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,600
<i>I believe something heavy once sat here…</i>

648
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,680
And was dragged away.

649
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,600
Gun crates were stored here.

650
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,840
