1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,840
Do you know

2
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,440
any hidden forest huts?

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,400
Pick one perfect for a lovers' tryst.

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Ouch!

5
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Kham.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Can you take me to that hut to rest?

7
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,480
<i>But will Khun Aek really believe</i>
<i>you and Kamduang did anything?</i>

8
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,960
What are you doing?

9
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,360
I'm going in.

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,560
They might not actually be doing anything.

11
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,240
I have something important
to discuss with you.

12
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,720
If you're upset, just say it.

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
What were you doing
at that hut near the forest?

14
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,400
Kham asked me to gather fruit

15
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,800
for Dad's journey.

16
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,680
<i>With that look, she's not lying.</i>

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,200
I owe you an apology.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,200
For what?

19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,560
<i>I want to know</i>
<i>what your heart feels toward me.</i>

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,320
Dear…

21
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,120
<i>That is my pledge.</i>
<i>It means my heart belongs to you now.</i>

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,080
Your Saw, ma'am.

23
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,400
I haven't seen you play for a long time.

24
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,600
The weather is lovely today,
I felt like playing it.

25
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,480
Khun Aek, are you here to make merit?

26
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,880
You must be troubled…
Is it about Kamduang?

27
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,640
I understand you.

28
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,160
You must be furious.

29
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,200
No man could endure such betrayal.

30
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
The only solution is to end it, right?

31
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
- Well--
- Dear.

32
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,880
I saw a grandma selling herbal balm,
so I bought some for you.

33
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,680
You've been so stressed lately
your lips are dry.

34
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,640
You're right. My lips are really dry.

35
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,840
Then let me apply it for you.

36
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh, Yeesoon!

37
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm so sorry, I didn't see you there.

38
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,040
Have you been standing here long?

39
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,240
About what you told me,

40
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,080
I know everything now.

41
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,240
I've heard troubling rumors about her.

42
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
What rumors?

43
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,200
That she's having an affair.

44
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
Who dares spread such vile lies?

45
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,400
They say Kamduang

46
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,640
and a man named Kham

47
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,080
have been secretly together,
many times, many places.

48
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,000
It was all a misunderstanding.

49
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,880
What is it, Dear?

50
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,000
It's nothing.

51
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,880
Yes. I suppose…

52
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,280
it was all a misunderstanding.

53
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,920
Kamduang and I will be going now.

54
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,800
Yes.

55
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,920
Why didn't it go as planned?

56
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,920
Hey.

57
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,320
Come, come.

58
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,680
I think the buffalo went west.

59
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
Mhm.

60
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,760
Looks like the work of buffalo thieves.

61
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,200
And experienced ones at that.

62
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,320
They must have come in last night
and driven them off.

63
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,760
Who knows how far they've gone by now?

64
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,720
I'll handle it.

65
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,400
But aren't you supposed
to head back soon, Father Yod?

66
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,920
I won't leave

67
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,160
until I bring your buffalo back.

68
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
If I can't track them,

69
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,720
I'll give up
being a buffalo trader for good.

70
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,520
Let's split up and search,
Kamduang, Khun Aek.

71
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,000
We're on the right path.

72
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,159
It's wide and open,
perfect for herding buffalo quickly

73
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,880
so their owners can't catch up.

74
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,120
Let's hurry, they can't be far.

75
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,360
This path is narrow.

76
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,120
I doubt the thieves
would drive buffalo through here.

77
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,760
I smell something in the air.

78
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,960
I smell fermented fish.

79
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
I wasn't insulting you.
I really do smell fermented fish.

80
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,720
You're right!

81
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,280
But it's not just any fermented fish…

82
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,240
It's <i>gourami</i> fermented fish

83
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,600
with toasted rice powder.
So aromatic and rich.

84
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,800
Ugh, my mouth's watering
just thinking about it.

85
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,320
Let's drink. Cheers.

86
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,840
Hey.

87
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,560
Let's eat.

88
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Wow.

89
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,600
Come.

90
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,120
This was way too easy.
We pulled those buffalo out like nothing.

91
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,440
How stupid can they be?

92
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,880
Yeah.

93
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
So easy.

94
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,720
Take some of this.

95
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,000
- Come.
- Here's <i>soi ju.</i>

96
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,600
Here it is.

97
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
Easy.

98
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,800
This <i>gourami</i> fermented fish
is insanely good.

99
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,920
Of course, it's my specialty.

100
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,720
I used a new herbal blend in that incense

101
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,400
to lure the buffalo. Those buffalo traders

102
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,640
would never expect it.

103
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,280
Too bad we didn't run into that Kamduang.

104
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,400
That ugly witch.

105
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
That… What should I call her?

106
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,520
Hideous-face.

107
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,480
Hideous-face!

108
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
Yeah.

109
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
Was her husband cross-eyed or something,
to actually take her as a wife?

110
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Kamduang.

111
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,680
Cho-duek, I'm right here!

112
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,360
Kamduang?

113
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,880
Go ahead, step on my face if you dare!

114
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
Shoot her!

115
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,040
Dear.

116
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
Which way should we go?

117
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,440
I think we've taken the wrong path.

118
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,240
What do you mean?

119
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,080
We haven't seen a single track or clue

120
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,320
since we started.

121
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,600
Exactly, Teacher.

122
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,640
There's not even a footprint.

123
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,960
Then what do we do now?

124
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,240
What's wrong with this gun?
I can't hit anything!

125
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
The sights are misaligned.

126
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,600
It's a smuggled gun.

127
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,720
They have guns.
How are we going to fight back?

128
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,280
I have a plan.

129
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,200
Go. Hey.

130
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,520
Oh?

131
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,920
Where the hell did they go?

132
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,840
- There.
- Follow them.

133
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
There. Shoot.

134
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,360
See?

135
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,600
They can't hit anything.

136
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,320
Useless guns
can't fire repeatedly for long.

137
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,640
They'll explode.

138
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,400
What?

139
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,600
Cho-duek! I'm right here.

140
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,720
Don't come any closer or I'll shoot.

141
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
Your gun is junk. You won't hit anything.

142
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,880
Don't look down on me. I'll kill you!

143
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,880
Good boy, Yim.

144
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,880
All the buffalo are safe and healthy.

145
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,680
Thank you for helping me find them.

146
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,080
What's your name?

147
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,760
I'm Bandit Cho-duek.
If you want to know more,

148
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,920
ask Kamduang.

149
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,160
Answer only what I ask.

150
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,480
Why did you steal buffalo from my home?

151
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,520
I heard

152
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,800
Kamduang was there.

153
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,600
I wanted revenge
for her putting me in jail.

154
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,400
Where did you get the smuggled gun?

155
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,160
- What smuggled gun?
- The one you just used.

156
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,240
- I bought it.
- From who?

157
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,320
I said, from who?

158
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,160
Some mysterious guys.

159
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,640
Where did you meet them?

160
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,960
Around here.

161
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
Don't play games with me.

162
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
I'll tell you.

163
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,640
Dear!

164
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,160
Don't hurt him.

165
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,520
Dear.

166
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
He got away.

167
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,720
That sneaky bastard.

168
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,720
Let's head back.

169
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,400
I'll alert the city guards to track him.

170
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,480
Yes.

171
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,640
They used smoke to lure the buffalo.

172
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,120
But they changed the herbs,
so the scent was different.

173
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,960
Did you get any leads on the illegal guns?

174
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,960
I interrogated them.

175
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
The underlings didn't know anything.

176
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,080
As for Cho-duek, he said he got them
from some mysterious guy.

177
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,520
What a pity.

178
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,720
If we knew who it was,
we might've had a trail to those pirates.

179
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,600
I think so too.

180
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,400
Uncle Yoy said you were looking for me.

181
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,440
Yes.

182
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,480
I've got something important to tell you.

183
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
I don't want anyone else to hear.

184
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,600
What is it?

185
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,960
It's about whether
our family survives or perishes.

186
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,680
I don't understand.

187
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,760
I've kept this to myself for a long time.

188
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,760
But now,

189
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,360
it's time I told you.

190
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
Just tell me. I'm ready.

191
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,760
Listen carefully, Kamduang…

192
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,240
When are you going to have a baby?
I want to hold my grandchild.

193
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,800
A grandchild?

194
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,400
Yeah, a grandchild.

195
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,120
A little one growing in your belly.

196
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,320
Why so hesitant?

197
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,079
- Don't know how to do it?
- I do!

198
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
Then why aren't you pregnant yet?

199
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,280
- Well, I haven't…
- Haven't what?

200
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,560
I haven't gone to the temple
to pray for a baby yet.

201
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,599
Oh, Kamduang.

202
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,880
Why would you be praying for a baby?

203
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,760
What good is that gonna do?

204
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,560
The monks always say,
<i>"Attāhi attano nātho."</i>

205
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,760
You are your own refuge.

206
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,680
I don't know.

207
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,560
It'll come when it comes, Dad.

208
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,760
You're just making excuses.
Or maybe your husband's not functional?

209
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,280
Speechless now?

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
Tell your husband to come see me.

211
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,160
I'll give him some advice.

212
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm done talking with you!

213
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,160
Oh, Kamduang? What's with you?

214
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,760
What?

215
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,960
Looks like I'll need to
find some help for Khun Aek.

216
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,480
What did your father
talk to you about today

217
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,520
in the garden? He looked very serious.

218
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,800
You saw that?

219
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,920
Yes.

220
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,960
If your father wants something,

221
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,760
I'll give him anything. No holding back.

222
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,520
I'll give it my all.

223
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,320
No holding back?

224
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,360
I'll give it to him big time.
I'll make him cry for mercy.

225
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,120
Cry for mercy?

226
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,160
If you don't want me to do it alone,

227
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,320
we can do it together.

228
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,120
Please stop.
Don't say things that make me overthink…

229
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,080
I mean,

230
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,680
please don't worry about my father.

231
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,000
It's really nothing.

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
Well, if you want anything,
just let me know.

233
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,120
Dear, I want to eat…

234
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,000
What do you want to eat?
I'll tell the servants to get it for you.

235
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,360
I want to eat…

236
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,840
you.

237
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,320
Jackfruit?

238
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,040
We'll soon find out

239
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,800
who eats who.

240
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,600
Wait. Something's not right.

241
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,480
It's always weird the first time.

242
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,080
You'll get used to it.

243
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,240
We can't do this. Focus!

244
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,840
What is going on?

245
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,120
Exactly. Why are we like this tonight?

246
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I've wanted you for so long,
but why can't I control myself tonight?

247
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,360
Me too… I've wanted you.

248
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,200
I knew it. It's the aphrodisiac candle.

249
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,840
Aphrodisiac candle?

250
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,280
Dear, don't sniff it like that.

251
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,160
I won't survive the night!

252
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,120
Kamton?

253
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,880
Kamhom?

254
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,640
Kam what?

255
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,920
- Kam…
- What are you mumbling about?

256
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm thinking about my grandchild's names.

257
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,440
Planning ahead for both a boy and a girl.

258
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,840
Yeah.

259
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,880
Hey.

260
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,800
Hm?

261
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,520
Oh.

262
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,080
Hey, the candle's gone.

263
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,120
Don't tell me you lit
the aphrodisiac candle

264
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,040
for Kamduang and Khun Aek?

265
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,680
- That's right.
- You actually thought of that?

266
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,920
That candle is meant

267
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,960
to arouse buffalo for mating.

268
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,240
You actually made humans sniff it?

269
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,400
Even buffalo can't handle it.

270
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,800
They go wild and break the pen.

271
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
What chance do humans have?

272
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,480
None at all.

273
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,240
They're probably seeing stars by now.

274
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,800
That's exactly what I was going for.

275
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,520
Even though we blew out the candle,
its effect hasn't worn off yet.

276
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
It'll fade only in the morning.

277
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,360
You don't need to worry.

278
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,960
I regularly meditate and train my mind.
My awareness and self-control

279
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,080
are stronger than most.

280
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,400
This candle can't affect me.

281
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,080
Don't look at me like that.

282
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,320
I thought you said you had self-control.

283
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,120
Control yourself.

284
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
You're so beautiful.

285
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,520
If you think my face looks beautiful…

286
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,440
would you like to see more?

287
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,920
Yes, please, let me see.

288
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,920
What do you want to do? Just do it.

289
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,640
No! Focus. Focus!

290
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Wait! What are you doing?

291
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,080
I'd rather die than destroy your dignity.

292
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,840
No. Don't do that.

293
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,440
There must be another way.

294
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,840
Heaven is within our reach.

295
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,200
Why hesitate?

296
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,400
Which level of heaven
are you taking me to, Dear?

297
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
You'll see for yourself.

298
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,760
Why is it so quiet?

299
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,960
Yoy…

300
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,080
You think maybe Khun Aek's not capable?

301
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,200
I think he's dead in her arms.

302
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,080
Damn it!

303
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,280
He better have stamina.

304
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,680
Kamduang,

305
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,120
you said there's another way.

306
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,760
Hurry up and tell me
before I lose control.

307
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,000
Quick!

308
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,040
Kamduang,

309
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,400
I don't think I can resist

310
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,840
your father's candle any longer.

311
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,480
Neither can I…

312
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,920
Kamduang…

313
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,560
Our happiness is almost here.

314
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
Finally,

315
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,280
the moment we've waited for.

316
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,680
Be mine, Kamduang.

317
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,840
Be mine,

318
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,640
Dear.

319
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,400
The candle's effects
must have worn off by now.

320
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,960
What a relief.

321
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,760
I've faced countless dangers
and battles in my life,

322
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,840
but last night…

323
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,920
was the most terrifying one.

324
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,600
Am I really that repulsive to you?

325
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,200
I already told you how I feel.

326
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,480
But I'm a man of honor.

327
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,600
No matter how much I love you,
how deeply I desire you,

328
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,400
I would never
take advantage of you like that.

329
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,880
Last night,
if I hadn't stopped you in time,

330
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
would you really have taken your own life?

331
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,920
What are you doing?

332
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,760
Yes.

333
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,280
I'd rather die than dishonor you.

334
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,880
There's something on your eyelid.

335
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,480
That's a thank you

336
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,000
for being a gentleman

337
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,160
who respects and protects me.

338
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,040
I'll remember that thank you

339
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,400
for the rest of my life.

340
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,720
You couldn't neutralize
the aphrodisiac candle.

341
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,680
That means you're still weak.

342
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,720
Well, you never taught me how.

343
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,400
If you were that skilled,
you wouldn't need me to teach you.

344
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,080
You'd figure it out on your own.

345
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,200
I know

346
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm still not even half as good as you.

347
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,160
Fine, then.

348
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,960
I'll teach you everything I know

349
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,800
and give you everything I have.

350
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,240
What? Are you planning to retire already?

351
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,880
You're not that old.

352
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,400
People need to know their limits.

353
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,920
There are still many techniques

354
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,240
I haven't taught you.
It might take years to master them all.

355
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,760
Let's start today. Lesson One…

356
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,480
I want to learn
the buffalo crossbow spell.

357
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,600
I wanna destroy Yeesoon's house.

358
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,760
Hey!

359
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,160
How many times have I told you?
Never use sorcery to hurt anyone!

360
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,880
I was just joking.

361
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,720
Forget the buffalo crossbow.

362
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,840
Today, we're starting
with something simple.

363
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,440
Are you ready?

364
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm ready.

365
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,360
<i>What I taught you today,</i>

366
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,640
you must use it

367
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,280
to track down Bandit Cho-duek.

368
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,720
If you fail, don't bother coming back.

369
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
Uncle Yod told you
to go after Cho-duek, didn't he?

370
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm going too.

371
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,440
But Bandit Cho-duek is my enemy.

372
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,480
Let me face him myself.

373
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Don't forget

374
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,920
he's also the only one who knows
where the illegal guns came from.

375
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,920
That lead could take me to the pirates

376
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,960
who sabotaged our guns.

377
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,600
He matters to me too.

378
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,200
- But--
- No buts.

379
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,840
We'll face him together.

380
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,760
Yes, we'll go together.

381
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,160
Bandit Cho-duek ran this way

382
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,160
and then vanished

383
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,320
even though this forest is wide open.

384
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,640
He's cunning.

385
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,720
But no matter where he's hiding,

386
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,760
I'll find him.

387
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,440
Here.

388
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,560
What's this, Dad?

389
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,240
Buffalo-tracking incense.

390
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,760
What's that?

391
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
Buffalo-tracking incense.

392
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,280
And what are you going to do with it?

393
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,920
Cho-duek once captured your buffalo.

394
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
He should still carry its scent.

395
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,360
This incense can track
the buffalo's scent on him.

396
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,320
Dad said I must channel energy through it.

397
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,440
I must concentrate.

398
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,080
It's not working. The smoke isn't moving.

399
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,920
My spell failed.

400
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,760
I'm not strong enough yet.

401
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,000
Why don't you believe in yourself?

402
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,480
I believe in you.

403
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,480
The smoke isn't moving…

404
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,800
Could Cho-duek be nearby?

405
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,000
That's possible.

406
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,080
Bandit Cho-duek!

407
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,639
We found him.

408
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,080
My spell worked.

409
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,960
Were you hiding, or did you fall in there?

410
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,480
I fell in.

411
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,960
He got away.

412
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,120
That sneaky bastard.

413
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,360
Let's head back.

414
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,720
I'll alert the city guards.

415
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Yes.

416
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,680
Why is it so high?

417
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,240
How the hell do I get out?

418
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,480
What should I do?

419
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,600
Please help me out.

420
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,840
I'm starving and dehydrated.

421
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,120
I'll help you

422
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,600
if you tell me
where you got those illegal guns.

423
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
I don't remember.

424
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,960
Then stay down there and die.

425
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,920
Fine, I'll talk.

426
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,160
I won't hide anything.

427
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,560
I broke out of jail,

428
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,200
wandered aimlessly…

429
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,080
I ended up in a cave

430
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,840
and found a stash of guns.
I stole a bunch.

431
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,840
Want me to draw you a map?

432
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,880
If you're lying, I'll make you regret it.

433
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,520
I'm not lying. Why would I?

434
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,040
I have nothing to gain.

435
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,760
Please help me.

436
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,000
Please help me.

437
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,760
It's done, Dad.

438
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,440
We've sent
that Bandit Cho-duek off to prison.

439
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,880
Is that true, Khun Aek?

440
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,000
Yes, sir.

441
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,440
I interrogated him
and uncovered a crucial secret.

442
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,600
It was all thanks to Kamduang.

443
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,520
How much can we trust Cho-duek?

444
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,680
I believe his intel is solid, Sir.

445
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,360
So when do you plan to act?

446
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,080
Tonight, Sir.

447
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,240
This is dangerous. Take some soldiers.

448
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,240
I'd rather not.

449
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,240
A large group might tip them off

450
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,720
and they'll get away like last time.

451
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,720
I'll go alone.

452
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,920
May you succeed.

453
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,880
Be careful.

454
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes, Sir.

455
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,160
Ugh.

456
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,480
Oh, Khun Aek.

457
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,880
Wanna spar?

458
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,120
I'd rather not.

459
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,760
Tonight, I have a dangerous mission.

460
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
It's a risky mission.

461
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,560
But I haven't told Kamduang.

462
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,680
Why not?

463
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
I'm afraid

464
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,480
she'll insist on coming.

465
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,480
And she'll get hurt protecting me again.

466
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,960
And if she doesn't come,

467
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,880
and something happens to you?

468
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,920
Then so be it.

469
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,240
But if anything happens to me,

470
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,000
please give this letter to Kamduang.

471
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,240
Alright.

472
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,880
I take my leave, sir.

473
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,680
Wait.

474
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,120
If you don't mind

475
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,800
that I'm a nobody from the countryside,

476
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,400
may I give you my blessing, Khun Aek?

477
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,040
Of course.

478
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,520
Please do. I don't mind at all.
It would be an honor.

479
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,600
Still your mind. Close your eyes.

480
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,080
Concentrate.

481
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,600
Focus on the Buddha's grace.
Keep chanting <i>Namo.</i>

482
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,200
Don't worry.

483
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,680
It's a ritual from my hometown.

484
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
That's how it's done.

485
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,520
Alright.

486
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,320
I hope you return with victory.

487
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,840
Thank you, sir.

488
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,280
Hey.

489
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,320
Yod, are you alright?

490
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm fine.

491
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
But I saw it. Why did you--

492
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm old.

493
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
I don't need it anymore.

494
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,680
But why give it to Khun Aek?

495
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,920
Kamduang is a woman.

496
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,960
She can't receive it.

497
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,440
But Kham wanted it.

498
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,040
Khun Aek

499
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,120
is the most worthy
to receive that sacred element.

500
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,080
Khun Aek.

501
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,120
Khun Pra Saming?

502
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,520
I'm coming with you.

503
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,160
Not as the governor or Phra Saming.

504
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
Just as your closest friend.

505
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,800
Very well, Sir.

506
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,440
We've risked our necks together before,
haven't we?

507
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,840
Where did he go?

508
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,800
Are you sure we're in the right place?

509
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,880
The cave entrance is right over there.

510
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,000
How did he even find this place?

511
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,920
Cho-duek said

512
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,080
during his jailbreak, he was on the run

513
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,200
and stumbled on this cave.

514
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,080
He hid inside,

515
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,960
and that's when he found the guns,
so he took some with him.

516
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,560
Let's take a look.

517
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,560
Check thoroughly.

518
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,200
Don't leave a single trace.

519
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,240
Yes, Chief.

520
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,640
All because of that damn bastard.

521
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,600
Chief.

522
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,720
Who the hell is that?

523
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,960
No idea. Doesn't look like a soldier.

524
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,360
Maybe a hunter or forest bandit.

525
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,480
Go kill him

526
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,520
and bring the guns back.

527
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,680
I'll check the rest in the cave.

528
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,960
Yes, Chief.

529
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,640
Damn it!

530
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,720
How'd you let him get away?

531
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,800
He took four guns.

532
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,480
How did he even know they were here?

533
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,960
From the tracks outside,

534
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,680
he was just wandering aimlessly.

535
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
Probably found the cave by accident.

536
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,560
Maybe you're right.

537
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,000
I need to move the rest

538
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,520
and find a new transport.

539
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,000
It'll take days.

540
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,280
Keep this place secure.

541
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,480
Yes, Chief.

542
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,720
Good thing no one saw us move the guns.

543
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,480
Otherwise, it'd be a mess.

544
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,880
Chief, I hear something.

545
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,080
There's nothing here.

546
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,680
I believe something heavy once sat here

547
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,800
and was dragged away.

548
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,160
Gun crates were stored here.

549
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,840
Footprints.

550
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
Fresh ones…

551
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,880
Where are you going, Kamduang?

552
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,240
To find Khun Aek, Dad.
He disappeared last night.

553
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,520
He's off on a mission.

554
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,360
He left quietly.

555
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,480
Maybe he didn't want you to worry.

556
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,080
But it's dangerous going alone.

557
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,520
Don't worry.

558
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,760
I gave him something powerful.

559
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,520
Powerful?

560
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,640
What kind of thing?

561
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,000
What the hell kind of sorcery is this?

562
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,200
Father Yod gave me Mystic Ore?

563
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,800
Mystic Ore?

564
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Ping?

565
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,880
Yes. It's me.

566
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,000
I must apologize to you, Khun Pra Saming.

567
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,560
I'm truly sorry.

568
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,120
Why did you do it?

569
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,120
I'll give you a chance to explain.

570
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,280
I…

571
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,440
Speak, Ping.

572
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,000
I can see you're not a bad person.

573
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,920
What reason did you have?

574
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,760
That pirate is named Nok Lek.

575
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,000
My father died when I was young.

576
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,200
He took me in and raised me.

577
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,440
He taught me how to fight.

578
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,680
He's your teacher?

579
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,720
No, sir.

580
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,600
A teacher shows kindness to their student.

581
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,440
Nok Lek isn't that.

582
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,080
He taught me only because I was useful.

583
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,800
How much did he pay you?

584
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,160
It's not about money.

585
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,120
Money means nothing to me.

586
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,120
If I had really
wanted to harm you earlier,

587
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,720
I would've done it already.

588
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,160
You…

589
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,400
This way,
Nok Lek will believe I lost the fight.

590
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,080
If we have to

591
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,200
face each other again,

592
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,280
I won't hold back.

593
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,600
And you don't have to hold back either.

594
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,600
Khun Aek,

595
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,480
did you catch the culprit?

596
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,200
He escaped, Sir.

597
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,600
And you?

598
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,640
Also got away.

599
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,040
Did you find any clues?

600
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,640
Nothing.

601
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,680
They cleaned up so thoroughly
there's no trace left.

602
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,640
Once again, they've slipped away.

603
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,280
It's a pirate

604
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,920
named Nok Lek.

605
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,960
The one I fought…

606
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,200
was Ping.

607
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,440
Ping?

608
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,080
You're back!

609
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,920
I was so worried about you.

610
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,160
What?

611
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,240
The Mystic Ore you gave me

612
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,200
saved my life, Father Yod.

613
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,400
So it protected you well.

614
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,400
Yes.

615
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,880
Thank me only halfway.

616
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,960
With the other half,

617
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,080
thank yourself.

618
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,560
The Mystic Ore is sacred.

619
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,880
It only stays with the virtuous.

620
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,320
If one is wicked, it abandons them.

621
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,800
It protected you

622
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,680
because you're righteous.

623
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,960
I didn't choose the wrong person.

624
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,200
The Mystic Ore will protect you

625
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,400
as long as you keep your virtue.

626
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,880
Don't forget that.

627
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,640
Yes, Father.

628
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,120
Yod, I served you for so long…

629
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,720
and you gave the Mystic Ore
to someone else?

630
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,760
You old bastard.

631
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,720
I gave him something powerful.

632
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,600
Powerful? What kind of thing?

633
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,680
I gave him the Mystic Ore for protection.

634
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,400
Never in my life

635
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,760
have I hated anyone so much.

636
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,600
After all I did for you for decades…

637
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,760
Ping is a pirate?

638
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,280
Yes.

639
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,200
Khun Pra Saming has sent Sergeant Boonchai
to search her house for evidence.

640
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,000
She probably fled already.

641
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,800
And likely destroyed the proof.

642
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,120
I think so too.

643
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,040
You were close with her.

644
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,960
Do you have any idea
where she might be hiding?

645
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,680
I have no idea.

646
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,120
If you have proof, present it.

647
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,280
I object.

648
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,480
You insolent fool.

649
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,280
Get out of here, you filthy mutt!

650
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,560
Who's the filthy mutt now?

651
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,920
Kamduang and I have sworn with our lives

652
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,440
we will take down Nok Lek
and rescue Ping's mother.

653
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,480
Let's go!

654
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,080
Wait.

655
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,200
You're the most precious thing in my life.

656
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,480
Please be careful.

657
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,320
<i>Your crimes are grave, Ping.</i>

658
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,560
I'm ready to face whatever punishment.

659
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,720
Listen closely to your punishment.

660
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,640
Ten years in prison?

661
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,400
Even though you did it all
for the sake of Thung Yai City?

662
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,920
Our mission is complete.

663
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,240
<i>I want to repay your sacrifice</i>

664
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,840
with all my body and soul.

665
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,680
Hey.

666
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,840
Dear, wait.

667
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,560
