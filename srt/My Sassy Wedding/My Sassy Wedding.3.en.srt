1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,520
<i>Muen Khao faked an illness</i>

2
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,480
<i>to avoid the ordination.</i>

3
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,600
They'll be whipped 30 times.

4
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,960
So what are you two doing
out here at this hour?

5
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,479
You can't go.
The Governor has seen your face.

6
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Is that golden ginseng?

7
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll play your wife for real

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
in exchange for that golden ginseng
as a bonus.

9
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,880
This is my wife,

10
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,880
Kamduang.

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,720
Yes, Sir.

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,120
I've got a job for you.

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,960
I've got questions for her.

14
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,600
Help!

15
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,960
Buffalo-throwing punch!

16
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,640
And now we're friends.

17
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,440
<i>Well done. Stay close to her.</i>

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,200
I'll deliver the book Khun Aek dropped

19
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,000
to the City Hall.

20
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,120
<i>Your wife was shy,</i>

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,280
<i>or is it that</i>
<i>you just didn't want me to meet her?</i>

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,120
<i>I'll arrange for you</i>
<i>to meet Kamduang soon.</i>

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,480
Kamduang?

24
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,120
It's nothing.

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,320
She's my wife.

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
- You can leave.
- Yes, Sir.

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,160
Well, Ai-Yim,

28
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,720
you get to visit City Hall today.

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Just don't poop here, okay?

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Hey.

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,960
I brought your book.

33
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,520
You dropped it.

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
This is what I get for being helpful.

35
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,000
You've given me the book,
now you can go home.

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840
You're tossing me out
once I'm done being useful?

38
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,040
This isn't a market. Why would you stay?

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,960
Fine. I'm leaving.

40
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,600
Hey.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,920
What now?

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,360
Thank you.

43
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
Stop.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,680
How did you ride a buffalo into city hall?

45
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,200
Get off and walk it out.

46
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,200
How dare you?

47
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,920
You bark orders
at a nobleman's wife like me?

48
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,200
I'm Khun Pra Saming.

49
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,480
I outrank every noble in this town.

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,000
If you're Khun Pra,

51
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,760
I must be the Prime Minister.

52
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,360
I'll tell you what.

53
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm Kamduang,

54
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,000
wife of Khun Aek Itthirit.

55
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,400
I heard Khun Aek's wife
came from Phra Nakhon.

56
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,040
But you don't look like you do.

57
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,600
What part do I not
look like I do? Exactly?

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
These parts.

59
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,080
Apart from the appearance,

60
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,480
someone who marries Khun Aek

61
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,520
should be a proper lady,

62
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,280
well-educated,

63
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,960
maybe even able to
speak foreign languages.

64
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,880
I'm a proper lady.

65
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,600
I do speak foreign languages.

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,960
I can dance too.

67
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,920
Are you…

68
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,320
really Khun Aek's wife?

69
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,840
I am. Why would I lie?

70
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,520
Any updates on the gun deal?

71
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
The company has replied.

72
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,240
They're sending
a representative to negotiate.

73
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,640
That's enough for today.

74
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,160
- Khun Aek.
- Yes, Sir?

75
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,120
This Sunday there'll be a grand
merit-making ceremony for my mother.

76
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,960
You must attend.

77
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,360
The gun rep should arrive around then.

78
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,400
Should I invite him?

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,880
Is it a good idea
to invite a foreigner there?

80
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,920
It's alright.

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,640
Knowing each other better
makes negotiations easier.

82
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
You're right.

83
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh.

84
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
And bring your wife, Kamduang.

85
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
She says she speaks foreign languages.

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,280
Pardon? What did you say?

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
Your wife, Kamduang,

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,120
said she speaks fluent English.

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,800
She might help smooth things over.

90
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,480
Plus, a woman's presence
will lighten the mood.

91
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,600
And she also said she could dance.

92
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,720
She speaks sharply and looks smart.

93
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,080
She might be able to help.

94
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,880
Don't forget. Bring Kamduang.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
Kamduang…

96
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
You are…

97
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,560
I didn't know.

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,040
You told me
nobles care a lot about appearances.

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,160
Khun Pra Saming is unwell.

100
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,440
He woke up late, rushed to the meeting,
and didn't dress properly.

101
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,120
But even if it were a servant,

102
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,880
you shouldn't go around
bragging you can speak English

103
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,880
and dance.

104
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,360
I was saving your reputation!

105
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,680
It's hard enough
teaching you to be a lady.

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,840
Now you want to learn
foreign languages too?

107
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm a quick learner.

108
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,240
Teaching you English?

109
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,440
Sion? Ble? What does that mean?

110
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,000
It'll happen in your next life, maybe.

111
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,240
Blood!

112
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,880
Master, Lady Yeesoon is here to see you.

113
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,520
- Lady Yeesoon?
- Yes, Sir.

114
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,480
Let her wait at the pavilion.
I'll be there shortly.

115
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,840
Yes, Sir.

116
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,600
Here's the massage oil you asked for.

117
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,840
Thank you, Uncle.

118
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,640
Did you make this?

119
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,760
Looks like a kid did it.

120
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,080
I don't know why. It's so hard.

121
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,560
No matter how hard I try,
it doesn't turn out well.

122
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,640
Don't think of it as sewing.

123
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Imagine the needle is a sword.

124
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,120
Practice striking precisely.

125
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Mother's been asking about you.

126
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,880
Please give her

127
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,320
my apologies.

128
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,680
I've been busy.

129
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,320
Since then, you haven't visited at all.

130
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,560
I need time.

131
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,480
Time for what?

132
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,640
You're married now.

133
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,040
What do you need time for?

134
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,840
The truth is…

135
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,640
I also wanted to tell you that…

136
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,120
I hear you've taken in a new maid.

137
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,240
Is this her?

138
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,360
No…

139
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,880
This is Kamduang.

140
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,960
She's my wife.

141
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,000
Kamduang! You stole my heart!

142
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,800
Yeesoon?

143
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,080
We can't live on the same Earth!

144
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,040
Yeesoon?

145
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Yeesoon?

146
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,680
Yeesoon?

147
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,920
Yeesoon?

148
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,760
Yeesoon?

149
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,960
- Yes?
- Are you alright?

150
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm sorry. I'm Yeesoon. I'm…

151
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,640
A friend.

152
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
What brings you here, Kamduang?

153
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,720
That garland…

154
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Oh, I made that for Khun Aek.

155
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,200
You made it yourself?

156
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
Yes.

157
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Come sit with us, Kamduang.

158
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,240
Alright.

159
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,720
It's been a while since you came here.

160
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,080
The flowers in the garden
are in full bloom.

161
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
I'll show you around.

162
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,920
It's alright.

163
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Let Kamduang take me.

164
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
I don't know much about flowers…

165
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,360
It's alright. I know some.

166
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,560
I helped Khun Aek

167
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,240
plant most of these.

168
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
Let's go.

169
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Sir, Khun Pra Chuay is looking for you.

170
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Why do you smell so nice?

171
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
It's from my sachet.

172
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,920
Are the flowers in Phra Nakhon beautiful?

173
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,880
Well… yes, they are.

174
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,120
Compared to these?

175
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,320
They're all beautiful, I suppose.

176
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,640
You must not know. Each flower

177
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
has its own kind of beauty.

178
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
When Khun Aek and I
first planted this garden,

179
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,280
we argued a lot because he was impulsive

180
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,040
and grabbed the wrong
wild, promiscuous ones.

181
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,240
And he planted them.

182
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
Like this one.

183
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,880
It's pretty. What is it?

184
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,800
It's golden dendrobium.
Just a wild roadside flower.

185
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,320
It's no comparison to a Yeesoon blossom

186
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,120
This is fragrant,

187
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,360
meaningful, and auspicious.

188
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,040
A wild roadside flower
is nothing compared to it.

189
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,040
What I said

190
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,280
wasn't to criticize Madam, but honestly,

191
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,040
I think Lady Yeesoon

192
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,760
is more suited to Khun Aek than Madam is.

193
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,440
But Khun Aek doesn't think that way.

194
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,240
He clearly loves Madam more.

195
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,920
Whoa. How would you know?

196
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
He only married her

197
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,440
because they had an accident

198
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,760
and were forced to marry.

199
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,880
If you ask me,

200
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
I think he loves Lady Yeesoon.

201
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,640
That's right.

202
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,960
And another thing,
Khun Aek and Lady Yeesoon

203
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,000
have been close forever

204
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,000
and never got physical. Unlike Madam,

205
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,280
who clearly lacks modesty.

206
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,320
Hey now, are you saying

207
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,520
Madam's easy?

208
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,680
Easy or not, I don't know.

209
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,840
All I know is that she isn't hard.

210
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,880
Hey.

211
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,240
Yeah.

212
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,880
Shut up already.

213
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,760
Look, look! She's gone quiet.

214
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,720
What, got nothing to say?

215
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,200
Shut up.

216
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
You're upset
about what they said, aren't you?

217
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,360
Not at all. Why would I be?

218
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,960
I didn't do any of those things
they accused me of.

219
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,840
KHUN AEK

220
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,800
Argh!

221
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,000
Looks like it's important to him.

222
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,800
What's that?

223
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,880
It's a flower sachet

224
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,720
from Yeesoon to Khun Aek.

225
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,840
How do you know it's from her?

226
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,680
I recognize the scent.
They must have been very much in love.

227
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,200
Then why didn't they marry?

228
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,240
Why drag you
into this whole fake-wife mess?

229
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,600
I really don't know.

230
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,840
The golden dendrobium's beautiful.

231
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,040
It rhymes with your name, Kamduang.

232
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,800
And the Yeesoon flower is beautiful too.

233
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
Why did you bring them?

234
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,480
Yeesoon gave them to me.

235
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,880
She's beautiful and very kind.

236
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,280
- Dear.
- What did you and Yeesoon talk about?

237
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
About flowers in the garden.

238
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,240
Did you tell her
about this fake-wife arrangement?

239
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,320
No, I didn't.

240
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,080
Didn't you tell her?

241
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Why not? You two are a thing, aren't you?

242
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,200
We used to be.

243
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,000
For how long?

244
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
A few years.

245
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,720
Then why did you break up?

246
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,880
I heard you were deeply in love.

247
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
I won't answer this question.

248
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
What about now?

249
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,280
Do you still love her?

250
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,400
That's enough questions.

251
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,480
This has nothing to do with you.

252
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,160
I just wanted to know.

253
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,440
Knowing won't change anything.

254
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,880
You're just a fake wife.

255
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,280
You don't need to know
everything about me.

256
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,120
Fine. Not my business, then.

257
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,400
Just remember.

258
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,320
This fake-wife arrangement is top secret.

259
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,560
You must not tell anyone.

260
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,760
I know.

261
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,240
Now go. I want to be alone.

262
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,280
The golden dendrobium's beautiful.

263
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
It rhymes with your name, Kamduang.

264
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,480
When Khun Aek and I
first planted this garden,

265
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,200
we argued a lot because he was impulsive

266
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,960
and grabbed the wrong wild,
promiscuous ones.

267
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,040
And he planted them.

268
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,600
Like this one.

269
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,120
And the Yeesoon flower is beautiful too.

270
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,040
This is fragrant,

271
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,280
meaningful, and auspicious.

272
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,000
A wild roadside flower
is nothing compared to it.

273
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,600
Hey! Wait.

274
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,840
Yeesoon just insulted me.
She said I was promiscuous

275
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,560
while she's so precious.

276
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
Stupid Kamduang!

277
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,360
It took me all night to realize
I was being insulted.

278
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,720
And I even smiled at her.

279
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,760
Has my horn started growing yet?

280
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,640
I'm so mad!
I wanna kick someone in the face!

281
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,640
What's wrong with you?
Are you talking in your sleep?

282
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,280
No. I just suddenly realized something.

283
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,720
Whatever nonsense that is, save it
for the morning. I'm trying to sleep.

284
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,160
You're the reason this happened.

285
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,000
What did I do to you?

286
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,080
Instead of loving someone decent
you went and grabbed a snake!

287
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,480
It means good. It's a compliment.

288
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,800
"Good." Now say it.

289
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,920
"Gued."

290
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,360
- "Gued."
- "Good."

291
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
- "Gued."
- "Good."

292
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,560
It's a greeting for the morning.

293
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,160
Good… ning?

294
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,880
Can you say it one more time?

295
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,600
That means hello in the morning.

296
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,280
Next word.

297
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
"Hao waa you."

298
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,600
Good. Now, if you meet a foreigner,

299
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,400
what will you say?

300
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,080
"Good are you how morning."

301
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,280
Didn't I tell you to stop punching
whenever I pick up the stick?

302
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,040
My hand just moved on its own.
Don't scare me then.

303
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,800
- Then say it properly.
- It's hard.

304
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,960
Sit down. Start over.

305
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,560
That was too fast. Say it again.

306
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,120
So? Am I ladylike enough now?

307
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,120
It's not?

308
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,160
That's not funny! Do you want to die?

309
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,160
When ladies from Phra Nakhon see a snake,

310
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,320
they should scream,

311
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,160
go pale, and faint. Look at you,.

312
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,000
I was caught off guard, okay?
Let me try again.

313
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,800
Snake!

314
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,440
I'm scared! I'm so scared of snakes!

315
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,960
Help me! I'm scared!

316
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,400
Super fake.

317
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,880
- Let me try once more.
- Forget it.

318
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,840
I think you don't need to go
to the merit-making ceremony.

319
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,040
But what if someone asks where I am?

320
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,600
I'll just tell Khun Pra Saming
you're sick.

321
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,720
That'll make people more suspicious.

322
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,080
Then what?

323
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,360
If you go, people will see
right through your act.

324
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,000
I admit, when it comes to English,
yes, you're quick and clever.

325
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,240
But ladylike manners? You've got none.

326
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,080
Not that I blame you.

327
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,000
It's something you have to be born with…

328
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,280
Like Yeesoon.

329
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,520
But you're…

330
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,200
You're comparing me to that snake?

331
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,760
You jerk!

332
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,360
Snake!

333
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,120
UNCLE THIP'S MOVING THEATER

334
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,000
To catch hundreds of fish,

335
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,960
how hard could that be?

336
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,080
Competing with those

337
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,920
wealthy in-laws.

338
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,560
They've got fortune,

339
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,080
no pain or despair.

340
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,600
Just a moment more,
and it'll all be there.

341
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,840
That was amazing.

342
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,000
What brings you all the way here?

343
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,040
I need your help.

344
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,840
I've been a buffalo trader all my life,

345
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,640
but now I have to pretend to be
a Phra Nakhon lady and speak English.

346
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,320
Can you teach me how?

347
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Of course.

348
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,600
Also, I want to become
irresistibly charming.

349
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,240
If I were a flower,
I'd want to be the most beautiful,

350
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
and even more fragrant
than Yeesoon's blossom!

351
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,680
Can you help me with that?

352
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,800
Of course. I'll help you as much as I can.

353
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,800
But…

354
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,800
But what?

355
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,920
Kamduang, you do realize…

356
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,040
Besides being an actress,

357
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,280
I also provide a service to men.

358
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,720
You don't judge me?

359
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,960
Why would I? I think you're a good person.

360
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,480
To me, I think

361
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,120
you're the most charming woman

362
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,000
I've ever met. And I want to be like you.

363
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
I won't ask you to teach me for free.

364
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
I'll pay you.

365
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,640
But there's one condition.

366
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,520
No one can know about this.

367
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,240
No problem.

368
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,200
But first,

369
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,600
I want to test just how charming you are.

370
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,680
You see that young man over there?

371
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,880
That's Tid Thong,

372
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,560
Uncle Thip's nephew.

373
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,440
He's been in the monastery since childhood

374
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,880
and just left monkhood.

375
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,280
Now he's helping out here.

376
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,920
I want you to go charm him.

377
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,720
- Are you sure?
- Sure I am.

378
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,440
Just try. Don't be nervous.

379
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,640
Just remember.

380
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,880
A woman's charm comes from confidence.

381
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,040
Beep, beep, beep.

382
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,040
- Hey! Thong!
- Thong

383
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,800
- Hey?
- Thong? What happened?

384
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,240
Tid Thong!

385
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,480
Thong!

386
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,480
Tid Thong!

387
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,640
Thong, what happened?

388
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,160
Thong.

389
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,080
Thong.

390
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,440
Thank you

391
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,200
for showing me

392
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,400
that the taste of the Dhamma
far surpasses all worldly pleasures.

393
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,160
The joy that comes
from purity and enlightenment

394
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,400
is greater than any happiness.

395
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,560
Sathu.

396
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,880
Can you believe

397
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,760
my charm was strong enough
to send him straight back into monkhood?

398
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,240
I think you'd better
stop trying to be charming,

399
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
and just focus on learning English.

400
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,400
Where have you been?

401
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,600
I was just out running an errand.

402
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,480
Please stay still.

403
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,880
What are you doing?

404
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,840
I'm giving you a massage
to loosen your muscles.

405
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,440
Relax. It might be a bit hot.

406
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,080
This balm is my father's formula.

407
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,520
It helps relieve muscle tension.

408
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,240
Do you have to read all of these?

409
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,920
Yes. Multiple times.

410
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,720
But it's just about buying guns.
Why so much reading?

411
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
Because I need to understand every angle.

412
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,360
It's important to know your counterparts.

413
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,320
And this is about national security.

414
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,760
I can't afford to make mistakes.

415
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,080
Thank you.

416
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,080
Aek has been working nonstop.

417
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,640
He hasn't rested in days.

418
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,080
No wonder his muscles are tight as wire.

419
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,640
At this rate, he'll make himself sick.

420
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,640
He's under stress too.

421
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,080
But why is buying guns so complicated?

422
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,600
The town seems peaceful.

423
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,880
A few days before you came here,

424
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,200
two soldiers were found dead
in the forest outside Thung Yai City.

425
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,000
Killed by bandits.

426
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,680
<i>Both men were slain by the same blade.</i>

427
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,920
But I suspect the killer

428
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,320
was skilled in black magic.

429
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,520
Most people ignored it,

430
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,440
but Aek suspects it may be the prelude

431
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,320
to a raid on Thung Yai City.

432
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,840
Back home, we had something like that.

433
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,640
Sorcerers tricked villagers
into joining them,

434
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,280
then seized the governor's mansion.

435
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,040
Troops from Phra Nakhon had to intervene.

436
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,000
This isn't just about bandits.

437
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,560
There are also foreign threats looming.
Western powers eyeing Siamese territory.

438
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,240
Oh?

439
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,080
Then why are they selling us guns?

440
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,920
Different foreigners.
They're not all allies.

441
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,600
Aek understands all of this.

442
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,680
He even studies the personalities
and politics of foreign nations.

443
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,600
Don't think foreign affairs
are far from you, Kamduang.

444
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Western trade policies

445
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,360
are making Siam grow more rice.

446
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,360
More rice means more buffalo,

447
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,400
which means more buffalo traders like you.

448
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,360
I never knew that's how it all connects.

449
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,000
With both bandits and foreigners,

450
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,520
it's a dangerous time.

451
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,560
We need weapons to protect ourselves.

452
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,000
That's why Aek is so devoted to this task.

453
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,360
And what's the situation with Thong?

454
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,200
He hasn't told anyone what happened.

455
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,840
Good.

456
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,520
That means he can still be trusted.
He didn't expose us.

457
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,520
I don't know if he's keeping quiet

458
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,400
or if he really can't remember anything.

459
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,360
The inmates say he looks dazed all day.

460
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,320
He probably took quite a beating.

461
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,120
This wasn't that Kamduang's doing,
like the rumors say, was it?

462
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,240
That's impossible.

463
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,720
What kind of lady
could take Thong down like that?

464
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,480
I think some skilled fighter
must've helped her.

465
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,240
It makes her even more suspicious.

466
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,600
I bet she's hiding
something we don't know.

467
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,560
Then dig up her secret.

468
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,600
If Khun Aek gets removed

469
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,600
from negotiating the arms deal,

470
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,720
the job will be ours again.

471
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,160
There's a massive budget for those guns.

472
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,480
No way we're letting them
enjoy that money.

473
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,640
- Right?
- Yes.

474
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,520
Sooner or later, Thung Yai City
will fall to the foreigners anyway.

475
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,760
We should grab what we can

476
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,520
and run, set up elsewhere.

477
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Right, Father?

478
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,720
Clever. Just like your father.

479
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,280
I think your fake husband, Khun Aek,

480
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,680
is in serious danger.

481
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,880
Between the bandits, foreigners,
and internal disputes,

482
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,080
it all comes down to power and money.

483
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,160
But from what I see,

484
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,200
Khun Aek still seems like a good person.

485
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,960
It doesn't matter if he's good or bad.

486
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,360
This is deadly serious. Do you understand?

487
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,720
Do your job and leave quickly.

488
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,400
It's not like I want to stay either.

489
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,400
But I've got things I must do.

490
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,320
First, I need to get that golden ginseng.

491
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,280
It's too valuable.

492
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,880
I must bring it back to treat my father.

493
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,880
And second,

494
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,360
I want to become a proper lady

495
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,200
in Khun Aek's eyes.

496
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,480
Is the ritual done?

497
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,360
Yes. The holy thread and water
are taken care of.

498
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,400
The monks are preaching now,
so I slipped out.

499
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,560
Just let the elders talk,
Khun Pra Mek, Khun Pra Chuay, and Father.

500
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,800
This is the merit-making
ceremony for Lady Sri.

501
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,720
But I heard

502
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,840
some foreigners are coming too?

503
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,200
Where's Kamduang?

504
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,720
My wife isn't well.

505
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
She has stomach pains…

506
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,560
womanly kind.

507
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,600
I see. That's a pity.
I'd hoped to meet her.

508
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,120
Then let's visit her after the ceremony.

509
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,080
She's away from home.

510
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,520
It'd be comforting to have company.

511
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,080
That's a good idea.

512
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,000
That won't be necessary.

513
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,120
She gets easily startled.

514
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,200
And when she's in pain,

515
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,800
she can't even walk.

516
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,960
There you are, Dear.

517
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,760
And you are…?

518
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm Kamduang, wife of Khun Aek Itthirit.

519
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,960
Such fragrant tea.

520
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,000
Yes.

521
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,000
Didn't you say your wife had stomach pains

522
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,720
and could barely walk?

523
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,320
She said she took some Chinese medicine
and it helped.

524
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,120
Kamduang

525
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,480
really does outshine
every other noblewoman.

526
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,960
No wonder

527
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,640
they say she's from Phra Nakhon.

528
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
What? Did I say something wrong?

529
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,880
No, Sir.

530
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,600
Not at all.

531
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,880
I think you don't need to go
to the merit-making ceremony.

532
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,080
But what if someone asks where I am?

533
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,640
I'll just tell Khun Pra Saming
you're sick.

534
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,760
That'll make people more suspicious.

535
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,120
Then what?

536
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,400
If you go, people will see
right through your act.

537
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,040
I admit when it comes to English,
yes, you're quick and clever.

538
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,280
But ladylike manners? You've got none.

539
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,680
This is a Phra Nakhon lady's outfit.

540
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,640
I just got it last month.

541
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,800
And if you style your hair like this,

542
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,640
trust me,

543
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,800
no other Phra Nakhon girl

544
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,080
will compare.

545
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,000
You're going to scold me
for disobeying you, aren't you?

546
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,320
So you knew?

547
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,960
Go on, say what you must.

548
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,400
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

549
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,960
Did I hear that right?

550
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,560
You heard correctly.

551
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,280
I'm sorry.

552
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,640
I spoke harshly,

553
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,280
made you angry, and you rebelled.

554
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,360
I'm sorry.

555
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,840
This gun purchase is a critical matter.

556
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,960
I've been too tense,

557
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,880
and I took it out on you.

558
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,440
Please forgive me.

559
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,200
I do.

560
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,280
Thank you.

561
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,680
You look stunning today.

562
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,720
I'm impressed by what you've achieved.

563
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,840
Thank you.

564
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,640
Mr. Chadwick,
the gun dealer, still hasn't arrived.

565
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,400
But it's already quite late.

566
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,840
Exactly.

567
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,920
I think you should go back.

568
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,600
I don't want you encountering him.

569
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,640
You're afraid our secret will be exposed?

570
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,160
You've done great

571
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,640
as a Phra Nakhon lady.

572
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,760
But a foreign language
might be beyond you.

573
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,680
You're speaking like that again!

574
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,520
Don't take it to heart.

575
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,240
I don't mean to insult you.

576
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,680
Of course. I'm just teasing.

577
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,840
I'll go now. See you at home.

578
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,880
Mr. Chadwick?

579
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,200
Chadwick. Yes, I'm Chadwick.

580
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,480
Come this way.

581
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,680
Come this way. Come.

582
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,720
Come.

583
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,720
Good boy.

584
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,320
Can you… speak…

585
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,480
English?

586
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,240
Damn it, Kamduang…

587
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:13,040
I… speak… snake.

588
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,720
Snake-snake, fish-fish.

589
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,600
Yes, that's it.

590
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,400
I got separated from Chadwick.
What do I do?

591
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,600
He's never been to this town before.

592
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,440
Calm down, Lady Maprang. It'll be fine.

593
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,920
I'll go look for him. Don't worry.

594
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,520
Thank you.

595
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,080
Chadwick! Where have you been?

596
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,520
I found him lost.
He said his name was Chadwick,

597
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
so I brought him here.

598
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,520
Thank you so much.

599
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,600
My husband's never seen a buffalo.

600
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,920
He thought it was a wild bull.

601
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,440
Khun Men.

602
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,520
They're giving away blessed charms
from Luang Pu Khao over there.

603
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,800
His talismans are powerful.
You should get one.

604
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,560
Thank you, Khun Pra Saming.

605
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,800
I almost missed out on a great thing.

606
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,960
It means good. It's a compliment.

607
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,000
I've had plenty of foreign clients,

608
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,480
so I picked up some English.

609
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,040
Honestly, it's only a few phrases.

610
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,080
Just memorize them and you're good.

611
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,360
Let's try.

612
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,280
Try it.

613
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,400
It's hard to say.

614
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,080
Good enough.

615
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,080
Honestly, these words don't mean much.

616
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,680
Saying them is like saying nothing.

617
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,520
The key is reading their face

618
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,000
and knowing when to say what.

619
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,760
So if we mess up and they react weirdly,

620
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,600
I just switch to another phrase?

621
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,800
Exactly.

622
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,160
You've got talent, Kamduang.

623
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,840
You'd do well mingling
with foreigners in Phra Nakhon.

624
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,960
I'd like to try.

625
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,720
You're amazing, Kamduang.

626
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,240
You managed to lead a buffalo away.

627
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,040
I would've never dared do that.

628
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,440
Sometimes when it's hot,
buffaloes get a little irritated.

629
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,600
But they won't hurt you.
I have lots of buffalo friends.

630
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
You're funny, Kamduang.

631
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,040
I'm serious.

632
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,560
Lady Kamduang.

633
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,440
My name is Khun Men.

634
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,040
Well, excuse me then.

635
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,800
I heard you're from Phra Nakhon?

636
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,600
Oh, I forgot to mention,

637
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,200
I'm a friend of Khun Aek's.
I'm also the son of Khun Pra Mek.

638
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,960
Khun Pra Mek?

639
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,040
The one who was peeking at my lotus?

640
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,440
Caught red-handed!

641
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,160
Help! Uncle was peeking at my lotus!

642
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,560
I heard you're from Phra Nakhon.

643
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,360
They say
there are big foreign stores there.

644
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,160
Have you ever been?

645
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,760
Do you know what a phonograph is?

646
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,560
I hear the foreigners brought them in.
People in Phra Nakhon love them.

647
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,160
They say it's foldable.
When you open it, music comes out.

648
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,520
Oh, a phonograph?

649
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,960
Phonographs don't fold, you know.

650
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,720
They're made of hard shellac.
If you fold them, they'll break.

651
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,880
And they only play
when placed on a record player.

652
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,000
You must've heard wrong, Khun Men.

653
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,920
I must've misunderstood then.

654
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,320
So Kamduang,
could you tell me about cameras?

655
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,680
- Oh, you mean--
- I want to hear it from Kamduang.

656
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,280
Well, there's nothing to it.

657
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,160
Cameras…

658
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,280
are…

659
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,040
Enemy attack!

660
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,120
- What?
- What enemy?

661
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,080
The enemy in my stomach, of course!

662
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,880
It's breaking through the city walls.

663
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,760
- About to burst out!
- Wait.

664
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,520
You want to see my enemy?

665
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,760
Come then.

666
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,720
Come!

667
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,400
I'll pass.

668
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,320
Then please, excuse me.

669
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,680
Chong!

670
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,360
I've missed you!

671
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,960
If we compare price and quality
based on your prior research,

672
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,840
it's quite a compelling deal.

673
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,520
And he's offering enough guns
to meet our needs.

674
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,040
Then does that mean you approve
of the purchase, Khun Pra Saming?

675
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,280
What was that?

676
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,560
Hey! Stop!

677
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,080
Today's incident startled Mr. Chadwick.

678
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,080
And it has damaged
Thung Yai City's reputation.

679
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,440
So, you don't trust me?

680
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,760
- Khun Pra Saming!
- <i>The bad guys you were talking about…</i>

681
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,480
They could very well be pirates.

682
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,280
What?! Pirates?
Like, ship-plundering pirates?

683
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,320
<i>Are you here to make merit, Khun Aek?</i>

684
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,600
<i>I'm just looking for a bedsheet.</i>

685
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,600
They said it's got flowers,

686
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,200
easy to get on the bed,
and not too pricey.

687
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,880
If you've got something to say,
then say it straight, Yeesoon.

688
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,440
I'm not good at this kind of talk.

689
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,120
<i>Khun Pra Saming,</i>
<i>you suspect me, don't you?</i>

690
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,040
<i>With evidence this strong,</i>

691
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,680
how could I not?

692
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,160
Hey! Dear!

693
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,240
Why take my husband?

694
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,000
<i>He's being taken to the city officials.</i>

695
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,160
Your husband is a murder suspect.

696
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,880
You killed Thong, didn't you?

697
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,560
