1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,840
Good thing no one saw us move the guns.

2
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,480
Otherwise, it'd be a mess.

3
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,440
<i>He's off on a mission.</i>

4
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,480
But it's dangerous going alone.

5
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Don't worry.

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,240
<i>I gave him something powerful.</i>

7
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
What the hell kind of sorcery is this?

8
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,160
I gave him the Mystic Ore for protection.

9
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,240
It's a pirate named Nok Lek.

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,240
<i>The one I fought…</i>

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,640
was Ping.

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,400
Ping is a pirate?

13
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,720
Yes.

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,360
She's probably fled already.

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,120
And likely destroyed the proof.

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,000
You were close with her.

17
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,400
Do you have any idea

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,000
where she might be hiding?

19
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,840
I have no idea.

20
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Khun Aek Itthirit,

21
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,560
the last test of the foreign guns
under your responsibility

22
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,600
ended in serious failure.

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,000
You claimed you were framed,

24
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,160
so we gave you time to find evidence

25
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,680
to prove your claim.

26
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,920
Now that the deadline has passed,

27
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,840
if you have proof, present it.

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,440
I've found some clues,

29
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
but no evidence, Sir.

30
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,560
Of course you haven't.

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,400
The truth is, no one framed you.

32
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,160
The gun was simply faulty,

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,000
and you just won't admit it.

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,880
So, what clues did you find?

35
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,480
I encountered pirates…

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,200
and fought them, Sir.

37
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Oh?

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,360
Pirates?

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,920
How exciting.

40
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
Are you sure you weren't daydreaming?

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
I have a witness.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
And who might that be?

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,280
You could have hired anyone.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm the witness, Khun Men.

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,480
I confirm

46
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,640
that I fought pirates alongside Khun Aek.

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
If Khun Pra Saming confirms

48
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,840
that you fought with the pirates,

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,960
then I'll believe it.

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,920
But don't forget we need evidence

51
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,360
regarding the gun explosion.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
Do you have it?

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
I do not.

54
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,800
I didn't quite catch that.

55
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,160
Say it loud and clear,

56
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,760
like a real soldier.

57
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
So,

58
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
do you or don't you have it?

59
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
Answer!

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
I do not.

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Then your story about being framed

62
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,040
is all a lie.

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
You made the whole thing up.

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
I believe

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
Khun Aek must be punished

66
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,680
for the severe damage he caused.

67
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,680
The Governor

68
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,600
was seriously injured by the explosion.

69
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,320
Let's calm down, Khun Pra Mek.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,280
Even without evidence,

71
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,360
it doesn't mean Khun Aek intended harm.

72
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
You're just

73
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,800
defending your son.

74
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,800
Enough!

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
Khun Aek's punishment
is my decision to make.

76
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,640
Khun Aek,

77
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,360
you may leave.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,560
We'll proceed with other matters.

79
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,360
You're discussing buying guns
from another supplier, right?

80
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,960
I object.

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
You insolent fool.

82
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,520
Don't you realize

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,080
the damage you've caused,

84
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,600
yet you still dare speak up?

85
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,920
Get out, you filthy mutt!

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Who's the filthy mutt now?

87
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,200
Khun Aek.

88
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,480
That's enough.

89
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,440
You still don't know

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
who the real filthy mutt is, do you?

91
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,680
Khun Aek,

92
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,880
wait outside.

93
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I'll decide your punishment.

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Yes, Sir.

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,720
Khun Aek.

96
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,560
Yes, Sir.

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,560
I know your intentions were good,

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
but I must stay neutral.
I must uphold the law.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
I understand, Sir.

100
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,200
You'll stand trial the day after tomorrow.

101
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,840
The charge is negligence

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,360
causing death and injury.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,280
I'll sentence you to ten years in prison.

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,840
If you're going to escape,

105
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
do it now.

106
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,920
I won't pursue you.

107
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,000
Ten years in prison?

108
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,760
Even though you did it all
for the sake of Thung Yai City?

109
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,840
That's not fair.

110
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,240
Good people shouldn't be punished.

111
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
Laws exist to preserve order.

112
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
If officials disobey,

113
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
who will respect the law?

114
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,560
Wouldn't the city fall into chaos?

115
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,680
Our mission is over.

116
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
You and your father

117
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
should pack up and go.

118
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,280
I pity you, my dear.

119
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,000
I want to repay your sacrifice

120
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,800
with all my body and soul.

121
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,040
I want to make you happy.

122
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,640
But I think…

123
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
Please don't reject me.

124
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,080
Thank you for your kindness.

125
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm willing to do it

126
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,120
unless…

127
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,760
you look down on me.

128
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,640
How could I ever look down on you?

129
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,080
My heart

130
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
longs only for you.

131
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Dear, wait. What are you doing?

132
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,360
Didn't you say
you wanted to make me happy?

133
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,000
Not like that!

134
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,280
By saying that,

135
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,520
I meant I'd dedicate myself

136
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,080
to helping you prove your innocence.

137
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,960
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,800
I misunderstood. I thought…

139
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
This stays between us, right?

140
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,640
You crazy! You're the worst!

141
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,120
I'm so embarrassed.

142
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,440
Please stop rubbing it in.

143
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,840
If you're embarrassed,

144
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm a hundred times worse.

145
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,680
Let's forget it.

146
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,840
So,

147
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,400
you said you'd find evidence for me?

148
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,560
What is it?

149
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,200
What I wanted to say is that

150
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,040
I think I have a way to track down

151
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,000
that pirate Nok Lek.

152
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,680
What way?

153
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,080
Using buffalo-tracking incense.

154
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,920
But you said the incense

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,320
only works with someone you're close to.

156
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,680
You know the pirates?

157
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,320
No,

158
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,120
but I know Ping.

159
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,760
We'll trace her.

160
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
The gun dealer told me

161
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
if we don't decide soon,

162
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,080
he'll sell to our neighbors.

163
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,160
Tell him

164
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,440
we'll buy.

165
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,280
But he raised the price.

166
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,040
Looks like he knows our situation,

167
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
that we're desperate.

168
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
He's taking advantage.

169
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,560
If we must blame someone, it's Khun Aek.

170
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,840
Tell him

171
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,360
to bring the guns for testing tomorrow.

172
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes, Sir.

173
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,360
THRIVING AND PROSPEROUS BUSINESS

174
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,720
It's not working.

175
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
The smoke disappeared.

176
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,920
That means Ping and Nok Lek

177
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
are not here anymore.

178
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,400
If I had to guess, they haven't gone far.

179
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,240
The gun deal is happening soon.

180
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,440
Then what do we do next?

181
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
According to the Art of War,

182
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
the most dangerous place

183
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
is the safest.

184
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,640
Where is that?

185
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
The market? Really?

186
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Let's see.

187
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,920
You were right.

188
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
The smoke's over the market.

189
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,720
Let's go and see.

190
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,920
Wait.

191
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,960
You can't just barge in.

192
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,440
If Ping sees us, she'll recognize us.

193
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,160
Then what do we do?

194
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
The smoke's right above that store.

195
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,520
Ping might be there.

196
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
Since when did we have a brick shop here?

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,880
Hey, where are these bricks from?

198
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
Prachinburi.

199
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm building a new stove.

200
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,160
May I take a look at the bricks inside?

201
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,640
Go ahead.

202
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,160
How many do you want?

203
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,640
Don't move, Ping.

204
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,920
So they really did hide the guns here.

205
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,000
Who are you?

206
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,920
It's me, Kamduang.

207
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
Kamduang?

208
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,680
I won't resist.

209
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,440
You don't have to threaten me.

210
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,640
Why are you doing this, Ping?

211
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,440
I can't say.

212
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,040
I didn't want to,

213
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,480
but I had to survive.

214
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,760
Please let me go.

215
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,240
This involves
someone else's life, doesn't it?

216
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,120
Yes, Khun Aek.

217
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,280
Let me guess, someone you love.

218
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,040
Your child?

219
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,920
Husband?

220
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,600
Father?

221
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,280
Or your mother?

222
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Yes…

223
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,240
It's my mother.

224
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,680
I still don't believe
that you lost to Khun Pra Saming.

225
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,960
Remember this.

226
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,280
If you betray me,

227
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,560
your mother will suffer
a slow and painful death.

228
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,920
I swear,

229
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,440
I didn't betray you.

230
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,800
If the gun deal goes smoothly

231
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,160
with no problems,

232
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,600
I'll give you the antidote

233
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,000
and a reward.

234
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,440
You and your mother will be free.

235
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Yes.

236
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,560
But if it fails,

237
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,280
your mother dies.

238
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,480
Mom.

239
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Mom, what's wrong?

240
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,480
My stomach hurts…

241
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,480
Ugh!

242
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,360
They're holding my mother hostage.

243
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
I don't know what to do.

244
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,760
Ping,

245
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,520
get a hold of yourself and listen to me.

246
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll help save your mother.

247
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,480
That's impossible.

248
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,520
Nok Lek is ruthless and dangerous.

249
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm not underestimating him.

250
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,480
But I believe

251
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
I can save your mother.

252
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,240
Don't forget,

253
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
last time I fought Nok Lek,

254
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,600
he had to run from me.

255
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,560
If we plan carefully,

256
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,360
we can definitely save your mother.

257
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,600
But if we fail, my mother will die.

258
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,560
And are you sure, even if you succeed,

259
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,400
Nok Lek will really let you
and your mother go?

260
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
Kamduang and I have sworn with our lives

261
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,720
we will take down Nok Lek

262
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,200
and rescue your mother.

263
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,160
I used to think I would fight him

264
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,320
but never defeat him…

265
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,040
but now I have hope.

266
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Alright.

267
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,000
I won't live under his command anymore.

268
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,040
Is this Mr. Chadwick's house?

269
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,400
Yes.

270
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,120
Nok Lek hid the guns at the brick shop,

271
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,800
then once Mr. Chadwick
and Maprang were imprisoned,

272
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,440
he came to hide here.

273
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,320
He's cunning.

274
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,800
Cunning how?

275
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,920
This is the Governor's
official guest residence.

276
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,240
No one would dare interfere.

277
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
No wonder

278
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,360
we couldn't find him.

279
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,240
That's Ping's signal.

280
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,240
Let's go!

281
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,840
Wait.

282
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,320
Please be careful.

283
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
Are you worried about me?

284
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,920
Yes.

285
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,720
You're the most precious thing in my life.

286
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,320
Alright.

287
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,040
I'll be very careful.

288
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
Don't forget

289
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm no amateur myself.

290
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,280
Yes,

291
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
my brave girl.

292
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,600
Ping, you betrayed me!

293
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,080
Betrayed?

294
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,360
I never worked for you.

295
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,280
How can that be betrayal?

296
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,760
Die, Kamduang.

297
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,280
Kamduang's family
knows secret tracking spells,

298
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,080
using incense smoke to find people.

299
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
We have to bury her

300
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
and let the earth element mask her scent.

301
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
These people
have way too many weird tricks.

302
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,600
Ping's mother…

303
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,600
Nok Lek,

304
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,720
damn you.

305
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,200
Kamduang,

306
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,320
he's onto us.

307
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,960
Nok Lek is cautious and trusts no one.

308
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,560
How can I convince him
I really killed Kamduang?

309
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,320
Just stab me in front of him.

310
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,800
This pouch contains red tree resin.

311
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,560
You just need to hit the right spot.

312
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,280
Isn't that too dangerous, Kamduang?

313
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,840
Just wait for the right moment

314
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,880
and do it yourself.

315
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,680
I trust you, Ping.

316
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Dear.

317
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
Do you know

318
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,600
any weapon that can defeat Mystic Ore?

319
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Mystic Ore is sacred.

320
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,080
No weapon can destroy it,

321
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,000
whether sword,

322
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,120
knife,

323
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,840
or gun.

324
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,680
But everything has a weakness.

325
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,880
What's its weakness?

326
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,160
You just have to suffocate

327
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,840
the one who possesses it.

328
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,280
Even your Mystic Ore can't save you now.

329
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,120
Dear.

330
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,160
You traitor.
If you want your mother to live,

331
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,120
go kill Kamduang.

332
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,120
Ugh!

333
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,320
Stay here and take care of Ping's mother.

334
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,440
Yes.

335
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,960
He got away again.

336
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,400
Khun Aek…

337
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,120
I got you in the end,

338
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,280
Nok Lek.

339
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Mom.

340
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,000
Ping, are you sure this is the antidote?

341
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,080
Yes.

342
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,960
Nok Lek kept it on him all the times.

343
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,560
You think I wouldn't suspect you,

344
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
traitor?

345
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,600
Give me the real antidote

346
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,720
or you die.

347
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,360
If you hand it over,

348
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,720
I'll just banish you from this city.

349
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,400
If not,

350
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,120
I'll make sure
your death is slow and painful.

351
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,920
I'll tell you…

352
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,120
it's a poison with no cure.

353
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,400
Mom.

354
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,520
Mom!

355
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,160
Mom.

356
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Ping,

357
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,480
take her to Khun Aek's house.

358
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,520
My uncle might be able to help.

359
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,880
Ping, I feel so cold.

360
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,160
Please hold on, Mom.

361
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,680
Have your mother take this medicine.

362
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,360
Mom.

363
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
Mom.

364
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Mom?

365
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,680
Mom.

366
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,160
Mom, please wake up.

367
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,680
Mom, it's morning.

368
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,160
Mom.

369
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,800
Uncle Yoy,

370
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,720
do you think Mother Kee

371
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,200
won't make it?

372
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,800
If she doesn't open her eyes
by the count of five,

373
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,760
call the monks to prepare the cremation.

374
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,080
One…

375
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,320
two…

376
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
three…

377
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,400
four…

378
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,159
five.

379
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,040
Ping…

380
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,440
Mom?

381
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,720
You're awake?

382
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,160
My medicine is the real deal.

383
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,320
It's already late.

384
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,600
Why hasn't the gun dealer arrived yet?

385
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,200
He'll be here soon, Sir.

386
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,920
Oh.

387
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,480
Nok Lek is here, Sir.

388
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,280
Khun Aek?

389
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,640
What is the meaning of this?

390
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,720
This is the criminal responsible
for sabotaging the foreign gun test,

391
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,520
resulting in soldier casualties

392
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,080
and the Governor's injuries.

393
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,040
Khun Aek!

394
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,560
You're slandering an innocent man

395
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,840
because you lost your own gains.

396
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,200
How dare you accuse someone innocent?

397
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960
You bastard!

398
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,680
The evidence, Sir.

399
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,400
The foreign gun's blueprint.

400
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
Someone modified the firing mechanism

401
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,400
to cause the gun to explode upon firing.

402
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,800
FIRING A GUN WITH THE MUZZLE SEALED
BY A BOLT CAN CAUSE THE BARREL TO BURST

403
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,160
Here's the income-expense ledger.

404
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,960
It contains records of weapon transactions

405
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,840
and bribes to certain individuals.

406
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
This is a map showing
the route to the gun testing site.

407
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,280
This map was supposed to be confidential.

408
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,560
The pirates
shouldn't have had access to it

409
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,280
unless someone from within

410
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,880
betrayed us.

411
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,480
Who?

412
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,920
I don't know yet, Sir.

413
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,200
I interrogated him all night,

414
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,920
but he hasn't spoken a word.

415
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,880
I'll verify all this evidence myself

416
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,320
and question him further.

417
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,040
Even though this proof
came later than expected,

418
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,960
it clearly shows there was a conspiracy

419
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,520
behind the failed gun test.

420
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,480
The damage wasn't your fault.

421
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,720
Therefore, Khun Aek Itthirit,

422
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,520
I declare you not guilty of all charges.

423
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,520
Khun Men,

424
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,840
you must also be investigated.

425
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,280
You had involvement
in the gun dealings with him.

426
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,920
Here, dried persimmons.

427
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,400
And this is

428
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,880
black chicken soup with golden ginseng.

429
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,640
I brought it for your recovery.

430
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,960
Thank you very much, sir.

431
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,400
Ping, take your mother to rest.

432
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,720
Yes, sir.

433
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,800
I sincerely apologize, Khun Pra Saming,

434
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,240
for aiding Nok Lek
in his treacherous scheme.

435
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,600
Because of me, soldiers died,

436
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,360
and your honorable father

437
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,480
was gravely injured.

438
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,360
Your crimes are grave, Ping.

439
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,800
Even though you repented

440
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,600
and helped us catch the culprit,

441
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,520
your crime remains.

442
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,320
I understand, sir.

443
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm ready to face whatever punishment.

444
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,680
It's just that…

445
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,400
I…

446
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,560
I…

447
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,320
You're still worried
about your mother, aren't you?

448
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,640
Yes, sir.

449
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,920
Very well.

450
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,000
In return for your good deeds,

451
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,520
while you serve your sentence,

452
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,080
I will take care of your mother.

453
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,200
Then,

454
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,040
I accept any punishment,

455
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,920
even if it costs my life,

456
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,880
I won't appeal.

457
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,880
Ping,

458
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,440
listen closely to your punishment.

459
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,240
I sentence you to serve Thung Yai City

460
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
as an officer
in the secret operations unit,

461
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,840
reporting directly to me
as the current Governor.

462
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,720
What do you say?

463
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,560
I thought

464
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,920
you'd behead me.

465
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,920
Or at best, sentence me to life in prison.

466
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,840
Why would I do that?

467
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,960
You're skilled.

468
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,280
And deep down,
I know you're a good person.

469
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,120
Thank you so much for your mercy,
Khun Pra Saming.

470
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,960
I swear

471
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,600
to serve with honesty and integrity.

472
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,640
I will devote my loyalty
and love to you until the day I die.

473
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,880
Good.

474
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,560
Then it's settled.

475
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,280
Meet me at
the Governor's Residence tomorrow.

476
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,800
You start your first day then.

477
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,320
Yes, sir.

478
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,280
W…

479
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,200
Wait…

480
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,480
What did you just say?

481
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,360
Something about loyalty

482
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,280
and love until death?

483
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,600
Uh…

484
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,360
I said

485
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,280
I would be loyal until the day I die, sir.

486
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,440
You've found evidence now,

487
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,240
so does that mean
the gun deal with the foreigners

488
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,440
will happen soon?

489
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,480
Yes.

490
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,080
And we have to hurry.

491
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,360
We've already lost too much time.

492
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,080
Besides, we don't know
when Bandit Srichai will attack.

493
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,640
So, does that mean
the agreement between you and me

494
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,840
will come to an end too?

495
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,080
Yes.

496
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,560
Chadwick.

497
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,080
Oh, Chadwick, my dear.

498
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,880
I missed you so much, Maprang.

499
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,720
I thought about you
every single day, my darling.

500
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,360
Hold on.
Why are you speaking Thai so fluently?

501
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,920
Not just fluently,

502
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,720
he hasn't stopped talking.

503
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,880
What's so strange about that?
I was surrounded by Thai people in prison.

504
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,280
I guarantee,

505
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,360
if any foreigner wants to master Thai,

506
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,440
just go to jail. Fluency guaranteed!

507
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,400
Congratulations, Mr. Chadwick.

508
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,160
You're my ride-or-die friend.

509
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,520
It's all good. The guns are ready for use.

510
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,800
Time to test the guns again.

511
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,600
Gunners!

512
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,520
Ready.

513
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,560
Aim.

514
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,320
Fire!

515
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,160
There have been rumors that
Srichai's bandits plan to raid our city.

516
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,960
Now, we have powerful guns.

517
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,640
If they come,

518
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,080
they won't leave alive.

519
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,600
But they say

520
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,280
the bandits' Eastern guns

521
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,760
can shoot long distances.

522
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,680
How far do you think, Khun Pra Mek?

523
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,840
It must be around that jackfruit tree.

524
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,400
Can your Western guns reach that?

525
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,880
Oh, how about this,

526
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,320
do you see that mango tree over there?

527
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,040
That must be

528
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,640
around five <i>sen.</i>

529
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,960
I'll have Khun Aek shoot it for you.

530
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,360
You're overestimating.

531
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,280
That's beyond bullet range.

532
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,280
Can Khun Aek really hit it?

533
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,400
Father!

534
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
We should've coordinated
before making that challenge.

535
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,680
Dear.

536
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,800
This month, the kite winds

537
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,680
blow from north to south.

538
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,160
The wind

539
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,400
is flowing toward the mango tree.

540
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,000
You can shoot it, trust me.

541
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,040
PRA SAMING, THUNG YAI'S GOVERNOR

542
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,880
PRA SAMING SINGHASURIYA,
THUNG YAI'S GOVERNOR

543
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,400
MR. CHADWICK CHRISTOPHER

544
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,800
Dear.

545
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,680
Congratulations

546
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,040
on the successful gun contract signing.

547
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,840
And I must thank you too,

548
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,880
for always being by my side.

549
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,520
You look beautiful today.

550
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,000
Thank you very much.

551
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,600
Please, everyone, join us in dancing

552
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,960
to celebrate Thung Yai City.

553
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,720
Do you know how to waltz?

554
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,720
I know a little, sir.

555
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,480
Then,

556
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,600
may I have this dance?

557
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,960
Come.

558
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,720
What are you doing?

559
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,520
No, please. I don't know how to dance.

560
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,520
You've managed far more difficult things.

561
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,280
It's just a dance. What are you afraid of?

562
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,120
I'm not afraid. I'm embarrassed.

563
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,200
Embarrassed what?

564
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,200
Or do you not want to dance with me?

565
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,240
It's not that.

566
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,320
It's just… I've never done it before.

567
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,240
Now that Khun Pra Saming
has signed the gun deal,

568
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,680
our contract is over.

569
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,000
Please let me have
one more beautiful moment with you,

570
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,000
Kamduang.

571
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,360
Then please lead me.

572
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,520
How did Nok Lek manage to escape prison?

573
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,600
Most likely the work
of those with black magic, Sir.

574
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,240
I'll send the foreign guns
to Fort Udon Kampanat

575
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,120
to defend against those Srichai bandits.

576
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,400
<i>I'm assigning you</i>
<i>to lead the transport of them.</i>

577
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,000
It's your time to die, Khun Aek.

578
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,080
And what about Khun Aek?

579
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,600
Khun Aek was sending
the guns to Fort Udon Kampanat,

580
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,880
but the caravan was ambushed
by Srichai's men along the way.

581
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,080
I'll use their own guns

582
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,600
to slaughter
the soldiers of Thung Yai City.

583
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,920
On the day we march in
to plunder the city,

584
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,400
chaos will consume everything.

585
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,120
