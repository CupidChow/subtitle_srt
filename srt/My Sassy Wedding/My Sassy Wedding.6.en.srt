1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,640
Thong stole documents from Mr. Chadwick

2
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,640
<i>He was found with a sachet</i>
<i>embroidered with the name Khun Aek.</i>

3
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,160
<i>Got anything to say?</i>

4
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,280
I had nothing to do with Thong's death.

5
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,320
Give this to Khun Pra tomorrow.

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,960
A plan to help Khun Aek.

7
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
<i>That sachet was a token of love.</i>

8
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,120
<i>It's important to Khun Pra Saming.</i>

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
But it was found in Thong's home.

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
So this sachet is unreliable as evidence.

11
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,960
I rule to dismiss the charges.

12
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,880
You risked your life
and got hurt to help me.

13
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>Let me do something for you.</i>

14
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
What happened, Yeesoon?

15
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,360
Mother's necklace is missing.

16
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
Someone greedy might've picked it up
and chosen not to return it.

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,320
If you suspect me, search me,

18
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,320
or check my tent.

19
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Can Khun Pra Saming

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
and Khun Aek do the search?

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,440
Did you find it, Khun Pra Saming?

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Impossible. Someone must have framed me.

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,640
You saw that
I was with you the whole time.

24
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
Don't you remember?

25
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
You followed me in later.

26
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
You don't believe me?

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,920
With such solid evidence,

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,360
and you still dare ask Khun Aek
to take your side?

29
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,160
You're shameless.

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,880
But for a woman who'd easily agree to be
a man's wife, this shouldn't be too hard.

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Hey!

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,800
Dear…

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Stealing from others
and then hurting them?

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
You really are beyond saving.

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,280
Dear…

36
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,720
Nothing.

37
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,400
I just remembered something funny.

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
So, did you find it?

39
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,760
I searched everywhere, but found nothing.

40
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
How's that possible? Because when--

41
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,200
If it's not there, then it isn't.

42
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,080
Thank you for checking.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,600
It must've been lost somewhere.

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,360
Is this the necklace you're looking for?

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,040
Yes. Where did you find it?

46
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,880
I was patrolling

47
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,400
and saw it on the ground,
so I picked it up to find its owner.

48
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,320
Thank you.

49
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,920
Thanks, everyone. Sorry for the fuss.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,920
Let's go, Yeesoon.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,360
Wait.

52
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,640
What now, Kamduang?

53
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,280
You accused me
of stealing in front of everyone,

54
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
and it turns out you were mistaken.

55
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,640
Don't you think you owe me an apology?

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,120
My mother is older than you.

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,280
How could you expect her to apologize?

58
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,760
Where I'm from, even elders

59
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,960
should apologize when they're wrong.

60
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,360
But then again, not everyone's that lucky.

61
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,280
Some people
just never got taught any manners.

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Does this sound familiar?

63
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,880
I'm sorry. Satisfied?

64
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
Glad that misunderstanding is cleared up.

65
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,040
Sorry for wasting your time.

66
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,240
It's fine.

67
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,400
Let's go, Sergeant.

68
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,280
Yes, Sir.

69
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,240
Why didn't you

70
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,160
tell the truth in front of everyone?

71
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
Where's her necklace?

72
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
Stay here. If anyone comes, let me know.

73
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,320
Yes, sir.

74
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
Are Lady Yeesoon and Lady Nam-ob

75
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,240
going to set up Lady Kamduang?

76
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Keep this for now. When the time comes,

77
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,400
bring it.

78
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Yes, Sir.

79
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,000
What did you say?

80
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
I asked

81
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,080
why you didn't tell the truth
in front of everyone.

82
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,360
If I had,

83
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
it would've embarrassed Yeesoon
in front of everyone.

84
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,919
And you won't do anything about it?

85
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,680
This helped me
decide something about Yeesoon.

86
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,920
Thank you.

87
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Keep this between us.

88
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,520
Yes, Sir.

89
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,720
You may leave now.

90
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm so mad. We couldn't take her down.

91
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,520
What are you thinking, Mother?

92
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm wondering

93
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,960
who helped her.

94
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
You're right. I forgot about that.

95
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,640
Sergeant Boonchai found the necklace…

96
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,120
Could it be Khun Pra Saming?

97
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,840
Don't jump to conclusions.
I don't know yet.

98
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,560
But at least whoever helped Kamduang

99
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,520
didn't expose us in front of everyone.

100
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,840
We just need to
be more careful from now on.

101
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,840
Yes, Mother.

102
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,320
I knew Khun Men would spy on us.

103
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,480
What should we do?

104
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,080
Did you play this as a child?

105
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,920
I did.

106
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,880
Have you ever seen a crab?

107
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,280
I'll change it. Guess what this is.

108
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,960
A dog?

109
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,040
Here,

110
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,560
doggie, have some orange.

111
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,960
Just kidding.

112
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,480
Did you just insult me?

113
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,400
Where did you come from?

114
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,280
You, you, you…

115
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
Different breeds of rabbits.

116
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,920
It's another rabbit.

117
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,160
It looks more like a beetle.

118
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Dear.

119
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,960
Khun Men is here.

120
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,960
Has Khun Men left yet?

121
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,160
Not yet.

122
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,920
He's gone.

123
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm too lazy to get up and get dressed.

124
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm exhausted today.

125
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,920
Then…

126
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,760
you should let me go first.

127
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh… you're asleep?

128
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,040
You must be really tired.

129
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,640
What's wrong?

130
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,800
There's a strange sound.

131
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Hey, what are you doing?

132
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,560
You've never seen
the sea before, have you?

133
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,400
It's so beautiful.

134
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,360
It's like heaven.

135
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,880
Is there a sea in heaven?

136
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,200
Good point.

137
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,920
Oh.

138
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Ugh!

139
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,720
It's so salty.

140
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,360
It's like pure salt!

141
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Well, it's seawater, not sugarcane juice.

142
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,000
Are you calling me stupid?
Like I'm some country bumpkin?

143
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,720
No.

144
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
I just find it endearing.

145
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,880
Can I play in the water for a bit?

146
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,880
You can't.

147
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,920
We won't make it to
the ash-scattering ceremony in time.

148
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,840
Let's go.

149
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
Lady Sri…

150
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,920
In this life, today,

151
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,520
we part here.

152
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Wait for me in the next life.

153
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,640
May we be reborn together.

154
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,640
Farewell,

155
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,560
Mother.

156
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,720
Father.

157
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,440
I have something to tell you.

158
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,760
Speak.

159
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,400
I will not propose marriage to Yeesoon,

160
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,200
and I want to end our relationship.

161
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,320
Why?

162
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,640
I don't love her as I should.

163
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,280
Even if we married in the future,
it would be like this.

164
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,640
If you've made up your mind,

165
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,120
so be it.

166
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,240
Thank you, Father.

167
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,960
Khun Pra Saming,

168
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,360
Khun Aek is missing from the procession.

169
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,480
Khun Aek and Kamduang

170
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,280
asked my permission
to take care of something.

171
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Yeesoon,

172
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,800
there's something important
I want to talk to you about.

173
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,360
If we don't hurry back,
we'll miss the procession.

174
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,120
It's fine.

175
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,440
I already got
Khun Pra Saming's permission.

176
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,720
You can enjoy the sea as much as you like.

177
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,600
I can?

178
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,040
It's your first time
seeing the sea, isn't it?

179
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,640
If you want to play in the sand, water,

180
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,520
or do whatever you like, go ahead.

181
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,640
I've got the whole day for you.

182
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
The whole day?

183
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,680
Thank you, husband!

184
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,720
KAMDUANG

185
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,560
KAMDUANG

186
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,040
KAMDUANG KHUN AEK

187
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,240
Thank you so much, Grandpa, Grandma,

188
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,040
for kindly giving me clothes
to change into

189
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,880
and for sharing food and drink with us.

190
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
It's nothing.

191
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,920
Come visit us again if you pass by.

192
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Here's some money

193
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,080
for the food you gave us.

194
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,080
No, Sir. Please, think nothing of it.

195
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,800
Then please accept
this Buddha amulet instead.

196
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,440
Thank you. May you both
prosper as husband and wife.

197
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Wait here.

198
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
I can't just take the amulet
without giving you something in return.

199
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,800
This is a love flower tree.

200
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,760
Please plant it together.

201
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,720
Thank you, Grandpa.

202
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,960
We'll be on our way now.

203
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,800
Alright.

204
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
Goodbye.

205
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,400
<i>Yeesoon,</i>

206
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
<i>there's something important</i>
<i>I want to talk to you about.</i>

207
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,120
I was going to wait
until we returned to the city,

208
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,280
but I'd rather say it now.

209
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,720
We are in a relationship
through our elders' arrangement,

210
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,200
expecting we'd marry one day.

211
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,520
Yes?

212
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,480
But as time passes,

213
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,440
I realize we don't share
the affection of a true couple.

214
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,040
Nowadays, there's no reason to stay
together just because our elders want it.

215
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,600
Do you agree?

216
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,400
As you wish, Khun Pra Saming.

217
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,400
Then…

218
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,680
let's end our relationship.

219
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,240
Ping?

220
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,640
Ping, I'm sorry.

221
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm not hungry yet.
Please feed the fish instead.

222
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,200
<i>Just as rivers full of water</i>
<i>Flow toward and fill the ocean</i>

223
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,760
<i>So too does the merit</i>

224
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,520
<i>Given from here reach the departed</i>

225
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,840
Why did you come alone?

226
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,520
My mother couldn't come,
so I came to make merit for her.

227
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Is your mother unwell?

228
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,720
Yes.

229
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,120
But it's nothing serious.

230
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
What about you, Khun Pra Saming?

231
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,000
You seem to have something on your mind.

232
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
Yes.

233
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,760
I was feeling distracted earlier,

234
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
but now I'm fine.

235
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,040
Because I was startled
when I scattered rice onto you.

236
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,240
Oh,

237
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,360
that reminds me of something.

238
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
There's still plenty of rice left.

239
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,040
Let's go feed the fish.

240
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,440
Yes.

241
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,680
I heard this from Fai,

242
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,560
the maid at Praya Chamroon's household.

243
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,680
And I heard it from Duea,

244
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,880
who lives next to Lady Yeesoon's place.

245
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,600
Are you sure your stories match?

246
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,400
Khun Pra Saming and Lady Yeesoon

247
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,320
are no longer together.

248
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,640
What?

249
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,880
Things are going to get interesting
in this house now.

250
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,080
Interesting how?

251
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,240
Well, Lady Yeesoon
and Khun Aek still love each other.

252
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,120
What happened
between Khun Aek and the Madam

253
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
wasn't intentional.

254
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,000
Khun Aek will surely want to go back

255
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,280
to Lady Yeesoon.

256
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,640
Oh, please. Why would he go back?

257
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,760
Back when Khun Pra Saming
and Lady Yeesoon were together,

258
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,240
you don't know how many times
he docked his boat here.

259
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,200
True.

260
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,000
And why would our Khun Aek

261
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,880
dock there again now?

262
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,080
Yes.

263
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,960
Lady Yeesoon is still young and beautiful,

264
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,800
and her pier is sturdy

265
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,440
and welcoming,

266
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,080
unlike your old, crumbling pier,

267
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,120
Granny Aoi.

268
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,320
I was minding my own business.

269
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Why drag me into this?

270
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,720
My pier may be old,

271
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
but it's been well used.

272
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,080
Trust me,

273
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,520
I'm an expert on piers!

274
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,840
Then let me ask the expert.

275
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,960
Between Lady Yeesoon

276
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,000
and Madam,

277
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,880
which pier is better?

278
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,880
I'd say both are brand-new.

279
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,040
Neither Lady Yeesoon's pier
nor the Madam's

280
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,760
has ever had a boat dock there.

281
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,760
You must be confused, Granny.

282
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,640
If you said Lady Yeesoon's pier was new,

283
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,200
I could believe you.

284
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,960
But Madam's too?

285
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,800
How could you say that?

286
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,520
Yes, exactly.

287
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,640
A boat docked there and they got caught.

288
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,800
So they had to marry. How can that be new?

289
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,240
It can be

290
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,240
if Khun Aek only made it
look like something happened,

291
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
when nothing actually did.

292
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,200
You mean

293
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,720
they're not actually husband and wife?

294
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,480
I believe I'm right.

295
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,440
Oh, that can't be true.

296
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,040
You're just making things up.

297
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,000
I can tell.

298
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,760
Khun Pra Saming has made up his mind.

299
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,680
A man like him won't change it.

300
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,000
And you gave in too easily.

301
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,120
If I'd been there,
I wouldn't have let it happen.

302
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,720
So what now?

303
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,480
Who would want you as a wife?
You've already broken up with two men.

304
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,120
I love Khun Aek.

305
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,280
If not Khun Pra Saming,

306
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,240
Khun Aek could still be an option.

307
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,680
But he already has a wife.
Do you plan to be his mistress?

308
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,840
No. Never.

309
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,840
Then what will you do?

310
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,200
I've been meaning to bring you here
to have new clothes made.

311
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,040
Your mother's clothes are all beautiful.

312
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,000
Why waste money?

313
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,440
Just pick the fabric you like.

314
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,640
Then I'll take the cheapest one.

315
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,440
Aek.

316
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,520
Where are you going?

317
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,560
I'm taking Kamduang to buy fabric.

318
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,320
What a lucky coincidence

319
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,840
to run into you.

320
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,200
Indeed. I happen to be free today.

321
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,560
Oh, I didn't mean you.

322
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,120
I meant Kamduang.

323
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,440
Me?

324
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,480
Why would you want to see me?

325
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,400
We country folk

326
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,160
want some modern clothes.

327
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,720
Since you're from Phra Nakhon,

328
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,600
could you help us choose fabric?

329
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,960
Please, come on.

330
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,880
Let's go.

331
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,200
You must have heard
about me and Khun Pra Saming.

332
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
How do you feel?

333
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,880
I'm sorry for
both you and Khun Pra Saming.

334
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
No need to be sorry.

335
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,600
He didn't love me,

336
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,280
and I didn't love him.

337
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,120
The one I love is still the same person.

338
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,800
Yeesoon…

339
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,920
But I have my pride.

340
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,280
If you want things to go back
to how they were,

341
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,000
you must return to your former position.

342
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,640
I can't do that,

343
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,240
- because--
- Please,

344
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,040
think it over carefully.

345
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,200
Thank you for helping choose fabric.

346
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,040
No problem.

347
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,120
We'll be going now.

348
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,120
Let's pick your fabric.

349
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,480
If you want things to go back
to how they were,

350
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,280
you must return to your former position.

351
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,440
Please think it over carefully.

352
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,080
Are you thinking about Yeesoon, dear?

353
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,120
Yes.

354
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,000
She's already broken up
with Khun Pra Saming.

355
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,600
But a beauty like her
won't be alone for long.

356
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,880
That's what I think too.

357
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,679
You've told her already

358
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,400
that the two of us aren't truly
husband and wife, haven't you?

359
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,000
The more people that know,
the greater the risk.

360
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,680
I've already told you, haven't I?

361
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,320
This matter concerns the fate
of the town. We can't take that risk.

362
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,240
But if I were you, I would tell her.

363
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,200
I've seen you work for the town,

364
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,360
even being framed and tortured in prison,

365
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,000
and now you still
have to sacrifice for love?

366
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,840
You're right.

367
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,560
Until the mission is accomplished,

368
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,200
I can only hope
Yeesoon will wait for me until that day.

369
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,240
Planting a love tree? Ugh.

370
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,120
Lady Nam-ob! Lady Yeesoon!

371
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,200
Long time no see, Juan.

372
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,040
Indeed,

373
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,160
I've missed you so much.

374
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,880
When will you

375
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,440
visit as often as before?

376
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,200
Here.

377
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,840
Consider this a fine

378
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,360
for making you miss me so long.

379
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,040
Look at you.

380
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,240
Lady Yeesoon,

381
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,960
you've always been kind to me,

382
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,000
that's why I love

383
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,920
and admire you.

384
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,880
Where's Aek?

385
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,120
In the garden with Madam…

386
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,160
In the garden with Lady Kamduang,

387
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,840
planting a big love tree.

388
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,360
A big love tree?

389
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,200
Oh my,

390
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,720
if they plant that,

391
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,720
they'll never break up.

392
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,080
Why is that?

393
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,000
There's an old saying.

394
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
If you plant a big love tree together,

395
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
your love will be strong and lasting.

396
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,440
Then should I pour boiling water on it

397
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,720
so it wilts?

398
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,760
If that one dies,
they'll just plant another.

399
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,600
If you really want to help me,
do something else.

400
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,520
What's that?

401
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,080
Go collect a strand
of Kamduang's hair for me.

402
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,160
Why do you need it?

403
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,720
Don't ask. Just do it.

404
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,560
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,600
The gun deal is nearly finalized.

406
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,440
I'd say the negotiation
went quite smoothly.

407
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,600
Before signing,

408
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,440
I'd like to test the gun's performance.

409
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,600
Alright.

410
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,120
Luck's on our side.

411
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,160
This morning,

412
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
I went to the market

413
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,280
and saw Chadwick's wife.

414
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,840
She said in two days,
her husband will be doing secret work.

415
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,360
I think

416
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,200
it must be gun testing.

417
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,600
What's the plan?

418
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,000
Follow him.

419
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,560
When there's a chance, grab the gun,

420
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,320
and take it to Sir Srichai.

421
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,560
I heard Sir Srichai
is planning to raid Thung Yai.

422
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,440
Yes. Soon.

423
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,360
Kill them and take the gun.

424
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,240
Kill them!

425
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,440
Mr. Chadwick.

426
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,680
I interrogated the bandit who survived.

427
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,800
He said he found out about this
from Lady Maprang,

428
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,680
Mr. Chadwick's wife, while she was
chatting with a friend at the market.

429
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,200
Strange. What would
those bandits want with the guns?

430
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,880
I pressed him for a long time,

431
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,520
then he admitted they were going
to give the guns to the Srichai gang.

432
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,520
Srichai? The sorcerer bandit?

433
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,000
Is their hideout somewhere around here?

434
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,920
Even those bandits
don't know the Srichai gang's lair.

435
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,800
I need to urge Khun Pra Saming
to buy the guns from Mr. Chadwick.

436
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,720
Yes.

437
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,480
I'm telling you this

438
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,680
so you can start preparing to head home.

439
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,360
Once the gun contract is signed,

440
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,280
your mission will be considered complete.

441
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,120
I'll pay your wages,

442
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,840
including the golden ginseng.

443
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,480
And what will you tell people

444
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,800
if they ask why your wife
suddenly disappeared?

445
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,120
I'll just tell them the truth,
that you were a fake wife.

446
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,800
I don't like lying.

447
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,360
When there's no more need,
I'll speak the truth.

448
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,360
But you'll be punished.

449
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,000
Let the law take its course.

450
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,800
As long as we have good guns
to protect the town,

451
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,720
I'll be satisfied.

452
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,080
But the punishment won't be light…

453
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,640
- It might be--
- That's why I want you to go home first.

454
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
So you won't share the punishment with me.

455
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,560
You understand, don't you?

456
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,840
I understand.

457
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,400
And this gun purchase…

458
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,120
when will it happen?

459
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,080
Mr. Chadwick has sent word
to the manufacturer.

460
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,880
The shipment is coming by sea.

461
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,320
Once it arrives,

462
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,840
the sale will happen right away.

463
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,680
It won't be long now.

464
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,480
Vet Yoy, Kamduang,

465
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,320
the <i>man-ho-hiao</i> you ordered

466
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,920
has arrived.

467
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,440
Thanks.

468
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,000
- Here you go.
- Here.

469
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,880
Kamduang, are you buying herbs?

470
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,760
Yes.

471
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,120
Uncle, do you have any <i>man-ho-hiao?</i>

472
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,240
It's out of stock.

473
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,320
None at all? I've asked at so many stores.

474
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,920
It's really out of stock.

475
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,600
More will come in,

476
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,840
maybe next week.

477
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,760
Next week?

478
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,440
Give mine to Ping first.

479
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,760
Kamduang…

480
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,040
It's fine, take it.

481
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,200
Thank you so much.

482
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,880
We're friends. We must help each other.

483
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,360
Remember?

484
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,200
Just a moment.

485
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,040
Ping, keep it.

486
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,320
Thank you again.

487
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,160
I'll be going now.

488
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,240
HOK AN MEDICINE

489
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,760
Here, Mother.

490
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Be careful, it's hot.

491
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,000
You'll feel better.

492
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,720
I hope so.

493
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,360
Ping,

494
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,160
I'm sorry.

495
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,080
You've had to suffer because of me.

496
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,240
It's no trouble.

497
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,600
I met a kind person
who gave me the medicine.

498
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,440
I should just die,

499
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,840
so you'll be free.

500
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,520
Mother,

501
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,600
we've talked about this.

502
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,640
You mustn't think
or say such things again.

503
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,880
Don't cry.

504
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,360
Thank you, my child.

505
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,280
What are you doing?

506
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,840
Why so jumpy?

507
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,240
I'm not.

508
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,200
You are. I can see it.

509
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,920
Really, nothing.

510
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,040
What are you hiding?

511
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,120
- There's nothing.
- There's something.

512
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,280
There's really nothing.

513
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,920
Hey.

514
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,960
If you wanted to hug me,
you could just say so.

515
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,080
I didn't want to hug you.

516
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,720
Stubborn.

517
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,120
If you don't dare,
just stay still and don't be stubborn.

518
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,320
Let me do it.

519
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,080
Don't do this with any man.

520
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,440
You might lose your virtue
without knowing it.

521
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,600
Are you jealous?

522
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,280
You…

523
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,680
Yeesoon.

524
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Kamduang.

525
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,560
Is anything wrong?

526
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,480
Nothing.

527
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,480
Are you sure?

528
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,880
I said nothing. Why are you prying?

529
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,720
I was just worried.

530
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,520
I thought you were sick.
You acted strange.

531
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,160
Yeesoon, about Khun Aek and you…

532
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,960
Don't be anxious. Just wait a bit.

533
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,880
When I'm gone, you can come in.

534
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,680
- When you're not at the house?
- Yes.

535
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,720
That way things will be simple.

536
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,240
Perhaps heaven intended it to be this way.

537
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,640
Damn you, Kamduang.

538
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,320
You're telling me to see Khun Aek
when you're away?

539
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,840
Do you want me to be a mistress?

540
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,160
No one's ever insulted me like this.

541
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,240
Shaman Chan is amazing.

542
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,840
He made my husband come back to me.

543
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,480
I really respect him.

544
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,000
I told you Shaman Chan was skilled.

545
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,480
I believe it now.

546
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,360
What do you want me to do?

547
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,520
I want you to get revenge for me.

548
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,520
That woman Kamduang not only stole
my man and made him her husband,

549
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,640
but she also mocked me,
telling me to become his mistress

550
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,480
because my fate
is to only be fit to be a mistress.

551
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,160
And how exactly do you want me
to deal with that woman Kamduang?

552
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,280
Here's her hair.

553
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,600
I want you to make them
fall in love with each other,

554
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,040
so she becomes a shameless harlot,

555
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,680
throwing herself at any man in the market,

556
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,600
living the rest of her life in disgrace.

557
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,560
Sure.

558
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,720
Kamduang…

559
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,360
I want you…

560
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,280
to be my husband.

561
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,400
My husband…

562
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,560
I'm here.

563
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,200
Stop!

564
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,960
I think I've been cursed.

565
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,920
What did you just say?

566
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Someone hired me
to curse a woman named Kamduang.

567
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,440
Is this her?

568
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,160
Khun Aek has set the time

569
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,240
and place for the gun test, Father.

570
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,240
Where?

571
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,680
<i>Tomorrow, once the contract is signed,</i>

572
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,560
<i>we'll go our separate ways.</i>

573
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,520
Will you miss me?

574
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,040
The gun test is ready, Sir.

575
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,560
Fire!

576
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,680
