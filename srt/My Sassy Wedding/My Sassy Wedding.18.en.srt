1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,760
I'll send the foreign guns
to Fort Udon Kampanat

2
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,640
to defend against those Srichai bandits.

3
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,920
<i>I'm assigning you</i>
<i>to lead the transport of them.</i>

4
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,680
Khun Pra Saming,
his sword was covered with poison.

5
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,680
They're behind that symbol.

6
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,560
<i>I'm going to blow up everything in here,</i>

7
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
including your life,

8
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,080
and mine.

9
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey!

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
Khun Aek!

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,560
Kamduang.

12
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,880
Light it, Dear.

13
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,400
Don't worry about me.

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,760
<i>I was so focused</i>
<i>on having you protect Khun Aek,</i>

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
<i>that I forgot you could be in danger too.</i>

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,640
Your life matters more.

17
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,040
Let's split up and search for them.

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,400
I'll fight by your side to the very end.

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,040
Khun Aek!

20
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,920
Kamduang!

21
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
Come out!

22
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,920
No matter what,

23
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,320
you can't escape from me.

24
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,040
Your sword

25
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,440
can't harm my invincibility spell.

26
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,480
Lucky me, I found a good charm.

27
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,320
It must be from a local woman.

28
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,760
Today is your unlucky day,

29
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,080
Srichai.

30
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,600
You're using that filthy thing on me?

31
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,320
It fits
a savage bandit like you perfectly.

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,880
Wrong move.

33
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,320
I've already found a way
to protect against that trick, idiot.

34
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
What are you trying to do?

35
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,240
I know you've got invincibility.

36
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,480
And I know your weakness
lies in your nine orifices.

37
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,080
You!

38
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,880
Kamduang, now!

39
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
Kamduang!

40
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,960
Dear!

41
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,320
Dear.

42
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,480
Freeze!

43
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,520
If there is a next life,

44
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,320
I pray we are truly husband and wife,

45
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,200
with no deceit or trickery.

46
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
Yes.

47
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,760
If there is a next life,

48
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,200
may we stay side by side forever.

49
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,720
Are you done with your sweet nothings?

50
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,200
Don't even dream of reincarnation,

51
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,240
because your souls

52
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,280
will belong to me as eternal slaves!

53
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,320
Ohm… Release.

54
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,600
Dear, Dad's here to save us.

55
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,160
What the hell is that?

56
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,120
Shaman Dum,

57
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,840
what is it?

58
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
The Chakra of Divine Flame.

59
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,240
The most fearsome sacred weapon.

60
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,080
Can you fight it?

61
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,680
Impossible.

62
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,520
I've never seen anything like this.

63
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,200
I think we should run.

64
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
Let's go.

65
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,400
Thank you, Dad.

66
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
If you hadn't come, we'd both be dead.

67
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
Same here.

68
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Uncle Yod, you saved me again.

69
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,640
Luckily, I ran into
Khun Pra Saming and Ping,

70
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,600
so I made it in time.

71
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
What kind of sword is this?

72
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,240
It's the Seven-Metal Sacred Sword.

73
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
It's deadly.

74
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,720
It's the only thing that can fight
the Chakra of Divine Flame.

75
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Look,

76
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,960
it even chipped the chakra.

77
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,120
Chakra of Divine Flame…

78
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
I've never heard of it before.

79
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,080
It's one of the rarest sacred items.

80
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,880
Once every thousand years,
it emerges from the volcanic core.

81
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
When cooled, it becomes the hardest

82
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
and sharpest element.

83
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,440
I've never seen you use it, Dad.

84
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
The Chakra of Divine Flame

85
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,000
is only used in real emergencies.

86
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,480
It's powerful, hard to control,
a sacred weapon worthy of a kingdom.

87
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,200
Anyone who owns one keeps it secret.

88
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,600
It's too dangerous.

89
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,480
Even without saying, I can guess.

90
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Using the chakra

91
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,440
must take immense power.

92
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,040
It nearly drained me completely.

93
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,280
I'm too old now.

94
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,080
It may be time to pass it on…

95
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,080
maybe to Kamduang

96
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,800
or you, Khun Aek.

97
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,520
If you'll excuse me,

98
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,680
I must return to Thung Yai City

99
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
to report to Khun Pra Saming.

100
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,960
Dad, let's escort my dear,

101
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,960
I mean,

102
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,960
Khun Aek.

103
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm afraid Bandit Srichai
might come back to ambush him.

104
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,200
- Yod!
- Teacher!

105
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,960
Are you alright?

106
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,240
You've used too much power.

107
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,280
Let's rest at Khun Aek's house first.

108
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,600
That'd be good.

109
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
Would you mind

110
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,440
if I stay at your place?

111
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,120
I'd be honored.

112
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,360
Teacher,

113
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
have a sip of water.
It'll help you regain strength.

114
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,800
Slowly, Teacher.

115
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,200
Let's go.

116
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Are you alright, Dad?

117
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,040
Yes.

118
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,320
Are you okay?

119
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,880
Dad.

120
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,720
This is strange.

121
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,640
Why did he suddenly fall ill?

122
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Was it because of using
the Chakra of Divine Flame, Uncle Yoy?

123
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,520
That's just how illness is.

124
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,000
It can strike anytime.

125
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,080
Yip. Yip.

126
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,200
Yes, sir?

127
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,280
Yes, sir?

128
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,840
Go prepare a room for Uncle Yod.

129
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,760
Yes, sir.

130
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Teacher,

131
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,560
you must be exhausted.

132
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Please have a sip of water.

133
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,680
I'm going to see Khun Pra Saming
at the City Hall.

134
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,320
You stay here and look after your father.

135
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
But you must be tired too, Dear.

136
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,600
Why not rest a bit before you go?

137
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Just hearing you call me "dear"
makes me feel fully recharged.

138
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,560
Kamduang.

139
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,760
You shameless woman!

140
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,400
Yeesoon.

141
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Please go, Dear.

142
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,280
I'll handle things here.

143
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,960
Khun Aek, I'm not talking to her.

144
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,440
I want you to tell her clearly
that you love me

145
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,040
and tell her to leave.

146
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,320
I can't do that, because--

147
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,920
Please go, Dear.

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
Khun Pra Saming must be waiting.

149
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,560
Don't worry.

150
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,120
I'll speak with her nicely.

151
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Khun Aek.

152
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
What are you doing? Let go!

153
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,920
I said I'd talk nicely.

154
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,280
But honestly,
I really want to punch you in the face.

155
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,240
Go ahead and try.

156
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,280
I'll have the patrols put you in jail.

157
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,440
You lied to me.
You said you slept with him.

158
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
So what?

159
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,200
It's none of your business.

160
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,800
I loved him first.

161
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,080
You came later and stole him from me.

162
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,640
How could I ever be nice with you?

163
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,280
Another lie.

164
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,960
What lie?

165
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,400
That I stole him from you.

166
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,960
The truth is…

167
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,480
he never cared about you at all.

168
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,080
Kamduang!

169
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,000
Go on, try me.

170
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,200
But I'll tell you now.
I hate liars the most.

171
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,800
If you slap me,

172
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,640
I'll beat your face until
it's ruined for the rest of your life.

173
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,000
Kamduang!

174
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,960
Here's what we'll do.

175
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,720
Wait until Khun Aek returns.
Let's ask him directly.

176
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,840
If he says he loves you

177
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,600
and I stole him, I'll leave on my own.

178
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,840
But if he says he doesn't care for you,

179
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,240
you leave. Deal?

180
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,440
No!

181
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,320
No matter what he says,

182
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I will be his only wife.

183
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,960
Sir, Khun Aek requests an audience.

184
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,680
Let him in.

185
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Yes, Sir.

186
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
This way, Sir.

187
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,240
What is this?

188
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,280
What's going on here?

189
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,119
Please don't resist, Sir.

190
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,560
You've got some nerve coming back here.

191
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,359
Do you take me for a fool?

192
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,960
What have I done wrong, Sir?

193
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,000
You gave the foreign guns
to Bandit Srichai.

194
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,120
You are a traitor.

195
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,440
You didn't expect

196
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,840
we'd unmask you so quickly, did you?

197
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

198
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,880
Where are the guns?

199
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,240
I came to report

200
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,720
that they were stolen

201
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,720
by Bandit Srichai.

202
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,920
How could they steal them

203
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,360
when the time and route were classified?

204
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,680
I don't know.

205
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,480
But they used dark magic.

206
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,240
Do you have a witness?

207
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,160
Only I survived.

208
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,800
Enough lies, Khun Aek!

209
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
You shameless liar!

210
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm telling the truth.

211
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,560
You insolent traitor!

212
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,320
I'll show you what the real truth is.

213
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,560
Bring him in.

214
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,680
This morning, someone
tried to steal the foreign bullets.

215
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,520
I caught him.

216
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
S

217
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,680
He's one of Srichai's men.

218
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,080
How did you know where the bullets were?

219
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,920
Khun Aek told me.

220
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
When?

221
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
Yesterday.
He delivered the guns as agreed.

222
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,640
Bandit Srichai wanted more bullets,

223
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,800
so Khun Aek told us where they were
stored. I went to take them.

224
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,800
You dare lie?

225
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,880
Ask him yourself

226
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
if it's true.

227
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,760
Take this scum to jail.

228
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,560
Khun Pra Saming, he framed me.

229
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,560
So much for your cleverness.

230
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
Now that you got caught,

231
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,200
is that the best excuse you've got?

232
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,120
I'm not lying.

233
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,200
That's not the truth.

234
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,280
Take Khun Aek to prison.

235
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,040
Khun Pra Saming, I'm telling the truth.

236
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,040
Someone's framing me!

237
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,440
Please listen to me! Khun Pra Saming!

238
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,160
Yeesoon.

239
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,560
Did you hear?

240
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
What's happened, Mother?

241
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,800
Khun Aek has been arrested for treason.

242
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,440
He's been taken to prison.

243
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
Prison?

244
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,560
What? Khun Aek is a traitor?

245
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,280
Khun Aek is now a disgrace.

246
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,760
Being near him will only bring trouble.

247
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,320
So what?

248
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
You want me to end
the relationship with him again?

249
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,800
I don't know what to tell you.

250
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
You must think clearly,

251
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,320
what's worth it and what's not.

252
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,440
He's a traitor.

253
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,560
He doesn't just lose title and land.

254
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,160
His house,

255
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,520
fields, wealth, everything will be seized.

256
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,880
Then…

257
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,920
he will have nothing left?

258
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,040
That's not all.
If Khun Pra Saming is enraged,

259
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,440
he may order execution
for seven generations.

260
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,960
And what I fear most is…

261
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,240
that we'll be implicated too.

262
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,400
Has that traitor still not woken up?

263
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,560
Not yet, Sir.

264
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,120
Awake now,

265
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
Khun Aek Itthirit?

266
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,200
I trusted you.

267
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,280
Sergeant Boonchai, wait outside.

268
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I'll interrogate Khun Aek myself.

269
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,240
Yes, Sir.

270
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,080
If you're going to execute me, so be it.

271
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,040
But please,

272
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,000
spare my father.

273
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,880
This one's going to be a bit tough.

274
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,920
Actually,

275
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,560
this case is full of suspicious details.

276
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,960
Does that mean…?

277
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

278
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,360
Didn't I tell you before

279
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,280
that I trust you?

280
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
Yes, Sir.

281
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,400
But I had to say this

282
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,800
in case you got upset

283
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,320
that I punished you.

284
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,000
So all this has been an act?

285
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,080
Exactly.

286
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,400
The bait is set.

287
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,520
We're just waiting
for the true culprit to bite.

288
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,080
We just don't know when.

289
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,960
Then we must set a trap, lure them in,

290
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,440
and catch them when they slip up.

291
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
You can't go in.

292
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,640
I said, you can't go in!

293
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,040
Move aside, Sergeant,

294
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
or don't say I didn't warn you.

295
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,160
It's Kamduang.

296
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,440
This is getting messy. I'll handle it.

297
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,840
What's the meaning of this?

298
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,280
You can't go in!

299
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
Let go! If Kamduang can go in,

300
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,720
why can't I? Move aside!

301
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,200
Hey!

302
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,800
This is a government office!

303
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,200
This isn't a place
where just anyone can barge in.

304
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,760
Kamduang came in first, she speaks first.

305
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,000
Let me speak first.

306
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,240
I came to make it clear

307
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,880
there is nothing

308
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,680
between Khun Aek Itthirit and me.

309
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,280
People keep misunderstanding us,
so I had to come clarify myself.

310
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,160
Let me emphasize again.

311
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
There's no relationship

312
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,720
between Khun Aek and me.

313
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,680
We're merely acquaintances.

314
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,880
But this morning,
you brought me breakfast.

315
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,200
You must be mistaken.

316
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,840
There's nothing between us.

317
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,800
And what about you, Kamduang?
What do you have to say?

318
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,280
I have nothing to say.

319
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,680
I came to confront you, Khun Pra Saming.

320
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,600
Right now, I'm the acting governor.

321
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,720
If you insult me, you'll be punished.

322
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,560
I'll gladly take the punishment.

323
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,200
Khun Aek has worked
tirelessly for Thung Yai City

324
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,760
and lived up to his noble position.

325
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,960
He's loyal, dedicated,

326
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,760
risking life for this land.

327
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,040
And you, as his superior,

328
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,120
instead of honoring him, you disgrace him.

329
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,280
You are an unfit governor.

330
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,760
Kamduang, that's enough.

331
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,080
No, I won't stop.

332
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,000
Nothing can stop me now.

333
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,240
If you have any conscience left,

334
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,320
release him now.

335
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,520
I can't just release him.

336
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,720
He's accused of treason.

337
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,600
If you don't release him,

338
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,480
then die!

339
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,160
- Stop.
- Stop, Kamduang.

340
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,680
I said stop.

341
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,000
Hand over the knife.

342
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,040
Hand it over.

343
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,640
Sergeant.

344
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,840
You're reckless, Kamduang.

345
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,760
Even if you're his wife,

346
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,640
you didn't need to go that far.

347
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,520
You're mistaken.

348
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
Mistaken how?

349
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm not doing this as his wife.

350
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,440
I do it as the one who stands beside him.

351
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,400
I've seen that
he always think about this city.

352
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,240
I've seen his struggles with my own eyes.

353
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,440
He's a loyal servant to this land.

354
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,440
I vouch for him with my life.

355
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,600
If you won't let him go,

356
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,040
then take my head along with his.

357
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Kamduang,

358
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,040
go home. Please, listen to me.

359
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,920
Dear,

360
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
I made a vow.

361
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,400
If you die, I'll die with you.

362
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Interrogating traitors

363
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,360
is brutal.

364
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,400
Are you sure

365
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,400
you want to go down with him?

366
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
Yes.

367
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,720
Because the truth is the truth.

368
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,360
He is a good man.

369
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,960
But you are the unworthy governor.

370
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,120
Watch your mouth.

371
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,840
Insulting the governor
is punishable by death.

372
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,680
You only became governor
because of your father.

373
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,720
Left on your own,

374
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,000
you couldn't even herd buffalo.

375
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,480
Say one more word--

376
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,600
You bone-headed, shoe-faced, mangy mutt,

377
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,760
rotten elephant, worthless trash,

378
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,320
flea-ridden gutter rat!

379
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,040
Kamduang!

380
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,440
You insolent wench!

381
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I've got nothing to do with this.
I'm leaving now!

382
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,640
Sir!

383
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,000
Kamduang!

384
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,720
Take these two and behead them!

385
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,960
Yes, Sir.

386
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,640
Yod. Yod.

387
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,680
Why are your nails purple?

388
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,920
Looks like you've been poisoned.

389
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,560
What poison?

390
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,920
Don't just say things, Uncle Yoy.

391
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,120
Yod.

392
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,800
Yod.

393
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,480
Thank you very much.

394
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,440
My informant says

395
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,480
Khun Pra Saming

396
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,400
has ordered the execution
of Khun Aek and Kamduang.

397
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,040
Is that true?

398
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,400
Why so sudden?

399
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,600
Khun Pra Saming
and Khun Aek are close friends.

400
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,840
I can't believe
he'd issue that order so easily.

401
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,360
That Kamduang woman stormed the city hall,

402
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,920
shouted obscenities,

403
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,440
and even drop-kicked Khun Pra Saming.

404
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,840
So,

405
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,120
if that's not a death sentence,

406
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,480
I don't know what is.

407
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,720
Too bad

408
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,040
I didn't get to see
Khun Aek die with my own eyes.

409
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,600
Either way, he's dead.

410
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,360
You've won.

411
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,560
Finally, the day has come.

412
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
In that case, let's not wait any longer.

413
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,080
Let's just get the money and run.

414
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,400
They've made a move?

415
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,440
Yes, Sir.

416
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,480
The father and son
dug up what they had hidden,

417
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,880
packed their things,
and are preparing to leave town.

418
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
Thank you, Ping.

419
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm just doing my duty, Sir.

420
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,040
Where are you going, Khun Pra Mek,

421
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,840
Khun Men?

422
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,600
None of your business.

423
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,520
Who says it's not?

424
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,120
My business is stopping you.

425
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,280
What do you mean?

426
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,560
You two are under arrest.

427
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,920
And what exactly
are we being arrested for?

428
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,640
Come with me. You'll find out soon enough.

429
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,240
My son and I were just visiting relatives.

430
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,080
I hope you have a good reason

431
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,720
for doing this.

432
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,360
Even if it's by city order.

433
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,960
Don't worry.

434
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,680
I wouldn't arrest you on a whim.

435
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,080
Say what you confessed.

436
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,200
Khun Men hired me to spy.

437
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,920
If there was any movement of foreign guns,

438
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,880
I was to report it immediately.

439
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,200
Where are the guns being taken to?

440
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,320
To Fort Udon Kampanat, Sir.

441
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,120
Thank you.

442
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Say what you confessed.

443
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,160
Khun Men and Bandit Srichai
sent me into the city

444
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,360
to stage a fake robbery

445
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,640
and pin it on Khun Aek.

446
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,640
Weren't you afraid of dying?

447
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,080
Khun Men promised I'd only be jailed.

448
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,480
Once Bandit Srichai seized the city,

449
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,880
I'd be released

450
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,680
and paid 20 taels.

451
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,200
What a disgusting lie.

452
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,200
I'm a noble of Thung Yai City.

453
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,800
Why would I conspire with bandits
to betray my own city?

454
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,440
Maybe for this.

455
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,880
S

456
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,080
This belonged to Praya Jade,

457
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,400
our former governor
killed by Bandit Srichai

458
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,920
over ten years ago.

459
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,000
How did it end up with you?

460
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,040
I didn't know.

461
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,800
Someone sold it to me.

462
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,840
I never checked where it came from.

463
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,400
S

464
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,880
And these gold bars?

465
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,960
They bear the city seal.

466
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,880
These can't be legally traded.

467
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
What's your excuse?

468
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,000
Khun Men Maenmueang.

469
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,000
Pra Mek Sawan Phansaeng.

470
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,600
Are you both still denying it?

471
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,040
The evidence is clear.

472
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,880
Fine. Yes.

473
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,320
I conspired with Bandit Srichai.

474
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,040
At least I got the satisfaction

475
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,400
of seeing you

476
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,320
kill your beloved friend Khun Aek.

477
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,840
Without Khun Aek,

478
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,600
you would never beat Bandit Srichai.

479
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,960
Satisfaction?

480
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,680
Why do you hate Khun Aek so much?

481
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,480
I just hate his face.

482
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,240
You're alive?

483
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,960
I don't know why you hate me.

484
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,680
But if you hate me,

485
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,480
attack me.

486
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,120
Why destroy the whole city?

487
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,640
Khun Aek.

488
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,400
You all set me up!

489
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,160
Damn you!

490
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,040
Good deeds bring good.
Evil deeds bring ruin.

491
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,600
Blame yourself, Khun Men.

492
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,720
Khun Men!

493
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,880
I apologize

494
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,480
for my temper, my rudeness,

495
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,480
and for insulting you so badly.

496
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,280
Don't worry.

497
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,720
I forgive you.

498
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,360
Besides, your drop-kick

499
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,920
actually fit my plan perfectly.

500
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,280
I have work to do.
Make yourselves at home.

501
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,320
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

502
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,560
At first, I thought you'd be mad

503
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,240
I pretended to be punished.

504
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,400
Of course I was!

505
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,800
And you let me act like a lunatic
without a word.

506
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,120
I'm sorry, Kamduang.

507
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,640
It's okay.

508
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,680
Once I knew you were safe,

509
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,360
I was just happy.

510
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,760
I'm lucky to have you as my wife.

511
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,080
I believe now

512
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,600
that fate exists.

513
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,120
There you go again, Khun Aek Itthirit.

514
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,600
The husband and wife thing
was just an excuse

515
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,480
so you could finish your gun mission.

516
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,600
What's fate got to do with it?

517
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,760
What if we became
husband and wife for real?

518
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,760
What did

519
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,080
you just say?

520
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,200
When we return home,

521
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,360
I plan to ask Uncle Yod for your hand.

522
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,400
Kamduang!

523
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,200
What happened to me?

524
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,560
You fainted.

525
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,840
I remember now.

526
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,960
I had a strange dream…

527
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,880
that you were going to propose to me.

528
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
It wasn't a dream.

529
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,520
It's true.

530
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
I want you to be my wife.

531
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,280
It's a dream. It's just a dream.

532
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,240
Ah.

533
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,920
It can't be real.

534
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,520
This isn't real.

535
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,400
It is.

536
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,760
It is real.

537
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,640
How can it be,

538
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,880
when I've never once heard

539
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,280
the word "love" from you?

540
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,040
Because before,

541
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,240
I didn't know my own heart.

542
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,120
But now I know

543
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,600
that you're the only one in it.

544
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,640
Kamduang,

545
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,120
I…

546
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,600
Khun Aek, sir!

547
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,200
Come in.

548
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,280
Sir, Madam.

549
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,680
What is it, Yip?

550
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,040
It's Sir Yod…

551
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,800
Yod!

552
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,400
Yod!

553
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,840
- Dad!
- Vet Yoy.

554
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,840
- What's happened?
- What's wrong with him?

555
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,800
His heart stopped beating.

556
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,080
Dad!

557
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,440
But then it started beating again,

558
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,800
very faintly.

559
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,120
Why is he like this?

560
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,440
I don't know.

561
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,240
He showed no signs beforehand.

562
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,480
I'll go fetch the royal physician.

563
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,720
This is a strange case.

564
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,600
I've never seen anything like it.

565
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,520
Could it be something other than illness?

566
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
What do you mean?

567
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,120
I'll go summon the monk.

568
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,720
This isn't a case

569
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,320
of possession.

570
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,960
But I can't say what disease it is either.

571
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,280
What should we do now, Dear?

572
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,920
Stay calm.

573
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,040
As long as Uncle Yod still breathes,

574
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,680
we don't give up.

575
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,120
There must be a way.

576
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,400
There are skilled healers
like Nun Nok from Wat Tai Koh,

577
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,720
or Master Saeng, the miracle doctor.

578
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,880
As for black magic,

579
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,400
it's possible that Yod
was affected by a wandering spirit

580
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,200
and struck by dark magic.

581
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,320
You'll need to consult someone
knowledgeable in that field.

582
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,720
Yes, venerable.

583
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,560
I shall take my leave.

584
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
I'll see you out.

585
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,600
Dad…

586
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,680
please don't leave me.

587
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,400
Don't worry.

588
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,480
I'll send people to find the best experts.

589
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,280
I believe someone will be able to help.

590
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,760
Thank you so much, Dear.

591
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,200
Keep your spirits up.

592
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,440
Don't give in.

593
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,760
Kamduang,

594
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,600
how is Uncle Yod doing?

595
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Dad is gone…

596
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,360
I'm so sorry.

597
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,440
Don't worry.

598
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,840
I loved

599
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,360
and respected Uncle Yod
like my own father.

600
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,720
I'll take care of everything
for him the best I can.

601
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,440
But you must stay strong,

602
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,240
so he can leave without worry.

603
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,680
Uncle Yod,

604
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,760
I pray that…

605
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,600
Uncle Yod is still breathing,

606
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,640
but just barely.

607
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,280
You're right.

608
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,080
He's still breathing, Uncle Yoy.

609
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,120
You're right.

610
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,000
I swear, this morning,
he had no breath at all.

611
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,720
It happened last night too.

612
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,160
Yes.

613
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,000
He stopped breathing,

614
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,880
then slowly started again.

615
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,560
What exactly is happening to him?

616
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,840
Could it be the poison
of the Sleeping Bug?

617
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,320
Sleeping Bug poison?

618
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,080
Kham…

619
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,960
Where's Kham?

620
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,960
That's right.

621
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,600
I haven't seen Kham at all.

622
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,360
Yes,

623
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,960
he disappeared yesterday.

624
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,200
Kham!

625
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,360
Sleeping Bug poison
comes from a mysterious hill tribe.

626
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,280
Almost no one knows it.

627
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,240
It's tasteless, colorless, odorless.

628
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,280
It causes the victim
to linger between life and death,

629
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,840
sometimes breathing, sometimes not.

630
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,200
After two or three days,
they die for real.

631
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,840
Why do you suspect Kham?

632
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,560
Kham's mother was from that tribe.

633
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,200
He's the only one
who knows about that poison.

634
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,080
But why would Kham poison my father?

635
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,000
He had a reason.

636
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,960
What reason?

637
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,880
What did my father do
to deserve that kind of hate?

638
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,240
It's because of me?

639
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,000
Chakra of Divine Flame…

640
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,440
I've never heard of it before.

641
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,880
It's one of the rarest sacred items.

642
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,240
I'm too old now.

643
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,040
It may be time to pass it on…

644
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,000
maybe to Kamduang

645
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,720
or you, Khun Aek.

646
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,480
That's what Yod said.

647
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,760
And that's why Kham bears such hatred.

648
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,400
Where are you going?

649
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,480
To find Kham.

650
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,120
He's the only one who knows
about the Sleeping Bug poison.

651
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,800
He likely didn't make it out before
the city gates closed yesterday evening.

652
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,440
He's probably still here.

653
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,400
- Open the city gate.
- Yes, sir.

654
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,800
Stop!

655
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,920
Close the gate.
I'm here to arrest a criminal.

656
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,240
Is this an order from you or the governor?

657
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,800
My order.

658
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,200
Only the governor can give that command.

659
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,760
You can't. It's against the rules.

660
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,160
Do as I say.

661
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,440
If anything happens,
I'll take full responsibility.

662
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,080
But, Sir, the punishment
is to be flogged 100 times.

663
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,160
I accept that.

664
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,640
But I cannot let the criminal escape.

665
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,640
Close the gate.

666
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,840
Damn it!

667
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,800
You bastard, Khun Aek.

668
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,360
Yeesoon!

669
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,840
I just heard news about Aek from
the market and rushed here to tell you.

670
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,000
Is it about Khun Aek being executed?

671
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,640
That's not the truth.

672
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,280
Then what is the truth?

673
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,280
All those claims about him
committing treason

674
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,840
was a ploy to lure out the real criminal.

675
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,440
Now he's receiving honor

676
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,240
and might even be promoted to Praya.

677
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,880
So I made the wrong decision again?

678
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,720
I'm so sorry.

679
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,560
It's because of me

680
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,920
that you ended up like this.

681
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,200
Because of what happened
between me and Kamduang,

682
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,800
Kham was angry at you.

683
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,160
Without me,

684
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,000
this wouldn't have happened.

685
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,680
I will find Kham
and bring him back to lift the poison.

686
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,720
I hope you forgive him.

687
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,080
And after that,

688
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,360
I'll ask you,

689
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,760
Kham,

690
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,680
and Kamduang

691
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,720
to return to the way you lived
before you knew me.

692
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,080
I'll make that happen

693
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,040
before it's too late.

694
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,520
Kham!

695
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,240
Hey! Stop!

696
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,200
That's the signal. They've found Kham.

697
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,920
I'm going after him.

698
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,960
Yes, sir.

699
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,000
Uncle Yoy,

700
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,040
where is he going in such a rush?

701
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,480
To find Kham.

702
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,000
What?

703
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,640
Why didn't he tell me?

704
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,720
Or…

705
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,080
Or what?

706
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,000
Or is he going to kill Kham?

707
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,680
Why would you think that?

708
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,840
He looked stressed.

709
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,760
I think he's stressed

710
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,440
because he blames himself
for what happened to your father.

711
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,160
What do you mean?

712
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,880
I overheard him talking to Yod.
He feels guilty

713
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,360
and thinks it's his fault
your father is gravely ill.

714
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,640
Kham's hiding in the temple.

715
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,480
I've assigned men to keep watch.

716
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,520
I didn't want to alarm the public.

717
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,640
Good.

718
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,960
I'll go find him myself.

719
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,680
If anyone sees him, do not harm him.
Understood?

720
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,000
Yes, Sir.

721
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,080
Wait, Dear.

722
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,480
Kamduang?

723
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,080
I know what you're trying to do.

724
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,080
You want my father and Kham to reconcile,

725
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,640
so Dad will give me to Kham.

726
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,640
Right?

727
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Yes.

728
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,800
What do you take me for?

729
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,400
Something to be given away so easily?

730
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,200
I don't intend to force you.

731
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,800
If you don't want to go, I won't make you.

732
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,800
You blame yourself

733
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,640
for Dad's poisoning.

734
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,120
Yes, it's my fault.

735
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,880
You're underestimating my father's heart.

736
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,520
He loved and respected you genuinely.

737
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,040
That's why he gave you the sacred item,

738
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,880
to protect righteous men like you.

739
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,720
It's not your fault.

740
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,720
Kham is jealous

741
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,520
because of his own greed.

742
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,200
Why must you blame yourself?

743
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,000
You always stand for justice for others.

744
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,360
You should give yourself
that same justice too.

745
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,440
I'll capture Kham alive

746
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,560
and make him reveal the antidote.

747
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,320
And if he refuses to talk,

748
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,640
what will you do?

749
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,240
Then I'll have to be firm.

750
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,200
And what if he agrees,

751
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,960
but only if I become his wife?

752
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,400
Would you be willing?

753
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,680
If not?

754
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,800
Then I'll still be firm.

755
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,000
What if he forces you to choose

756
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,040
between the antidote and me?

757
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,000
What will you choose?

758
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,040
I won't choose.

759
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,560
I'll take both.

760
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,080
I don't really know Kham.

761
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,560
Do you think he'd truly change
and give us the antidote?

762
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,920
Right now,
I don't think I know him anymore.

763
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,080
Kamduang!

764
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,800
Kham!

765
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,160
Khun Aek.

766
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,680
You forced me to do this.

767
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,160
You stole that from Dad?

768
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Yes.

769
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,520
Why is it with him?

770
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,760
Hey!

771
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,240
Give back the Chakra of Divine Flame.

772
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,000
Keep dreaming, Ping.

773
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,160
What's going on?

774
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,360
Something terrible
has happened at the city office.

775
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,040
That Bandit Srichai

776
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,720
shot a letter tied
to an arrow into the city.

777
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,360
That scoundrel!

778
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,280
We won't let him dictate terms.

779
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,440
<i>Everyone agrees. We'll fight him.</i>

780
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,640
<i>I'll fight alongside you</i>

781
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,160
<i>to protect this land.</i>

782
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,920
You must stay alive

783
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,560
and die after me and Khun Aek.

784
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,200
Spread out.

785
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,080
Open the city gates and burn it all down.

786
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,040
Yes!

787
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,760
