1
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,480
Give me the Chakra of Divine Flame.

2
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,320
- I won't.
- Shoot!

3
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,480
Chakra of Divine Flame?

4
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
How did it end up here?

5
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,840
Ping defeated Nok Lek

6
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>and retrieved it.</i>

7
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,560
Guard it well.

8
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,400
<i>Keep this hidden.</i>

9
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,640
Chakra of Divine Flame.

10
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,280
That scoundrel!

11
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,080
<i>Everyone agrees.</i>

12
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,440
<i>We'll fight him.</i>

13
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,680
Khun Aek sent me
to get the weapons from you.

14
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,320
Split up,

15
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
open the gate
and burn the place to the ground.

16
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
The Chakra of Divine Flame.

17
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,400
It's working.

18
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,280
- Hang in there, Sir!
- Hang in there!

19
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,640
‪Buffalo-throwing punch!

20
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,240
You've saved me just in time again.

21
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,240
With Mr. Chadwick's gun.

22
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
Where is it?

23
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,920
This is the Gatling gun?

24
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
That's a Somdej amulet.

25
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
I put it there

26
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,680
to ward off dark magic.

27
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
We'll fight together, Kamduang.

28
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,640
I'll do my best.

29
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Yim,

30
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,440
let's go.

31
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,240
Grandma.

32
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,200
- The sword broke.
- The sword broke.

33
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,640
It's your time to die, Khun Pra Saming.

34
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,360
Please hang on, sir.

35
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
What kind of gun is that?

36
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,640
The Devil!

37
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,840
What kind of gun is that?

38
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,120
How can it be this powerful?

39
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,320
Oh?

40
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,080
- What?
- Grandma, the Chakra is gone.

41
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,000
Kill them.

42
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,680
Dear!

43
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,640
Dear.

44
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
We won.

45
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
Goodbye,

46
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,720
Bandit Srichai.

47
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,080
Sir Srichai?

48
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,640
S

49
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,280
Why hasn't he

50
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
signaled yet?

51
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,159
Sir Srichai is dead.

52
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,400
What now?

53
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
Run! Every man for himself!

54
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go.

55
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
Go.

56
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,520
This is bad, Father.

57
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Bandit Srichai is dead.

58
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,960
Then we run.

59
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,560
If we just run blindly,

60
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
we'll definitely be caught

61
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
and executed.

62
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
Then what do you suggest?

63
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,600
Sit down!

64
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,080
Sit down!

65
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
- Go!
- Take them here.

66
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,920
They split into small groups
and hid in various spots.

67
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But we've captured

68
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,960
every unit, Sir.

69
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,200
Good work.

70
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
Some remnants are still resisting.

71
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,120
My father is handling them now.

72
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't move.

73
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,800
Drop your sword.

74
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm taking Khun Pra Chuay to the boat.

75
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,320
Once we're there, I'll let him go.

76
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
Khun Pra Mek,

77
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,080
all you ever do
is scheme against the kingdom.

78
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,400
That's why you're so weak and feeble!

79
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,360
Men! Run!

80
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,360
Hurry and escape!

81
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,000
Seize him!

82
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,080
THUNG YAI CITY'S GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE

83
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,960
While I was ill,

84
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
so much chaos happened.

85
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,640
But you handled everything brilliantly.

86
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,480
You protected Thung Yai City

87
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,160
and kept it safe.

88
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,800
Well done, my son.

89
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,640
I could never have done it alone, Father.

90
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
There were so many others

91
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,960
who gave their lives
to protect this land with me.

92
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,640
That others were willing to help you,

93
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
is what makes

94
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,240
a true governor.

95
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,360
I believe the time has come

96
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,920
for me to pass the governorship on

97
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,600
to you.

98
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
I will follow whatever you deem best.

99
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,360
Here's your
Chakra of Divine Flame, Uncle Yod.

100
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,440
It's hard to believe

101
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,880
a Western weapon

102
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,120
could destroy the Chakra of Divine Flame.

103
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,960
It wasn't just the weapon.

104
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,720
It was also Kamduang's faith.

105
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
Mr. Chadwick told me so himself.

106
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
What did he say?

107
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
Chadwick,

108
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,440
I've got a faster way to travel now.

109
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,680
What way?

110
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
I'll have Yim pull me.

111
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,120
<i>That Bandit Srichai</i>

112
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,720
<i>used dark sorcery</i>

113
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
<i>to terrorize innocent villagers.</i>

114
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,880
I, Chief Kamduang,

115
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,000
call upon
the sacred power of Thung Yai City,

116
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,400
born from the ancestors who sacrificed

117
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
to protect this land

118
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,400
with their lives

119
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,360
and unwavering faith

120
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
May this power

121
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
and love for the city

122
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,840
lead us

123
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,640
<i>to vanquish dark magic</i>

124
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,440
<i>and wipe out the evil</i>

125
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,680
<i>once and for all.</i>

126
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Dad,

127
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,600
it's time for your meal.

128
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,040
Dear, I need a word.

129
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,600
There's something
that's been bothering me.

130
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,000
What did I do to upset you again?

131
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,840
I haven't figured out a title for it yet.

132
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,480
Then let me help.

133
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,920
How about

134
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,560
"Kamduang Loves Khun Aek"?

135
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,960
No good. Try again.

136
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,920
Then…

137
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,120
"Khun Aek Loves Kamduang So Much."

138
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,120
If you love me,

139
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,080
then why did you lie to me?

140
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,760
Don't be mad, Kamduang.

141
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,960
I only lied about the timing
of Srichai's attack

142
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,560
because…

143
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,680
Because what?

144
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,240
Because…

145
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,120
I meant well.

146
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,760
And because…

147
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
And what?

148
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,040
I was worried.

149
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,120
And…

150
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,680
I care about you.

151
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
All the way back,

152
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
people kept praising

153
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,520
Khun Aek nonstop.

154
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,960
You don't have to rub it in, Mother.
I heard it all too.

155
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,320
How brave Khun Aek is,
how he defeated the bandits.

156
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
Even his wife is brave,

157
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,200
riding a buffalo into battle.

158
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
They're like a match made in heaven.

159
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,440
I heard it so much I could vomit.

160
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,200
And now I come home
and you're still going on about it.

161
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,840
If only I'd dared to bet everything

162
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,520
on Aek back then…

163
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,040
It's too late for that now, Mother.

164
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,080
Fine, fine.

165
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
Then just let him go and move on.

166
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,080
Let them be together.

167
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,600
I'll find you another fine man.

168
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,080
Not yet.

169
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,360
I'm not giving up on Khun Aek that easily.

170
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,600
Don't tell me

171
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,480
you plan to go beg for him back?

172
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,640
No.

173
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
He doesn't care about me anymore.

174
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,080
But he was mine first.

175
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
If I can't have him, no one can.

176
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
What are you going to do?

177
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll destroy him with my own hands.

178
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,080
Sergeant Boonchai.

179
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,600
You're still not healed.
Why are you up and walking?

180
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
I survived.

181
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm not about to go die again so soon.

182
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,520
But I had to come out…

183
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,840
because I wanted to see
that gun people are talking about.

184
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm on my way there too.

185
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,040
Perfect. Let's go together.

186
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
- Yes, Sir.
- Let's go.

187
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Ah.

188
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,080
Sir,

189
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm covered

190
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,040
in blood and pus.

191
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm filthy.

192
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,280
They're the blood and wounds
of a warrior who fought for his city.

193
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,480
To me,

194
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,080
it's an honor.

195
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,760
Let's go.

196
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Kamduang,

197
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,120
on behalf of the people of Thung Yai City,
I sincerely thank you.

198
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,440
You are truly worthy
of being Khun Aek's wife.

199
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,000
Thank you, sir.

200
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,160
How are you, Sergeant Boonchai?

201
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,880
You're truly protected by divine grace

202
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,480
to have made it out alive.

203
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,480
I truly thank you, Khun Aek.

204
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
I heard about the battle already.

205
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,720
Though I regret

206
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,720
not being there to fight beside you.

207
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,440
Thank you very much, Mr. Chadwick,

208
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,080
for sending the weapons to help.

209
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,840
No need to thank me, sir.

210
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,600
When a friend is in need,

211
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,360
I will always lend a hand.

212
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Mr. Chadwick,

213
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,920
now that Khun Pra Saming is here,

214
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,760
why don't you let him see your gun?

215
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,280
It's truly formidable.

216
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,280
This is the invoice
for ammunition and rental of the gun.

217
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,600
Of course, I'll pay it.

218
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,800
Not just for the ammo,

219
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
I'd like to buy the gun itself.

220
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,120
I'm sorry, sir.

221
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,160
I can't sell it.

222
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Why not?

223
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,520
Phra Nakhon has listed it

224
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,640
as a dangerous weapon,

225
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,840
banned from unauthorized sale.

226
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,320
If you want it,

227
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
you'll have to formally
request it from Phra Nakhon.

228
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm required

229
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,880
to send this one back immediately as well.

230
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,400
Speaking of weapons,

231
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,280
what happened
to the Chakra of Divine Flame?

232
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,200
It shattered into pieces
from the gunfire, Sir.

233
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,320
I don't think

234
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
it poses any threat anymore.

235
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,320
What do you mean by that?

236
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,520
The man who wielded the Chakra, Uncle Yod,

237
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,920
is growing old.

238
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,280
Srichai, the dark sorcerer,

239
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,600
is dead.

240
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,240
Few people now know
how to wield the Chakra.

241
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,560
But this gun,

242
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
it can be mass-produced,

243
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,520
improved,

244
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,160
and used by anyone.

245
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,240
Khun Aek is right.

246
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,160
In the future,

247
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,600
wars will be fought
with Western technology.

248
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,840
In fact,

249
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,760
His Majesty's royal vision
is aligned with this path of progress.

250
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,800
Then the people of Siam
are truly fortunate

251
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,000
to have a visionary ruler

252
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,800
like your king.

253
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,000
<i>People of Thung Yai City,</i>

254
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,440
today I have an important announcement.

255
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,160
I shall step down as governor

256
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,760
and pass the role to someone.

257
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,120
He is the one

258
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
who saved our city

259
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,480
from danger,

260
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,640
someone I believe

261
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,200
will carry Thung Yai City
to greater prosperity.

262
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,480
I hereby pass the title of Governor

263
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
to Khun Pra Saming.

264
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
I swear before
the sacred spirits of our land,

265
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,880
I will fulfill my duties as governor
with all my heart.

266
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,760
Today marks the first day I assume
the role of Governor of Thung Yai City.

267
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,000
I take this opportunity

268
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,080
to appoint new nobles
who will help develop our city.

269
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,920
Starting with Khun Aek Itthirit.

270
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,600
I hereby promote you
to Khun Pra Aek Itthirit Chaikonlasuek.

271
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,120
Please hold on.

272
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,240
I apologize for interrupting, Governor,

273
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,320
but I object to Khun Aek's promotion.

274
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,000
It would tarnish your reputation.

275
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,000
What's the reason, Yeesoon?

276
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,000
What has he done to tarnish me?

277
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Khun Aek has violated the law.

278
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,160
He lied and deceived.

279
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,560
He does not deserve a promotion.

280
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,400
What lies did I tell?

281
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,040
You lied

282
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,600
to the Governor

283
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,560
about being married

284
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,120
to Kamduang

285
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,720
when in fact you're not together at all.

286
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,640
I'm heading back home now,

287
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,960
but there's something
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

288
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,720
Khun Aek and I

289
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,040
are not truly married.

290
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,400
We've never been intimate.

291
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,400
I just came to let you know that.

292
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,760
Is there anything else?

293
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,120
That's all, sir.

294
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,320
Yeesoon,

295
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,160
you've spoken out of turn.

296
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,880
Today is a ceremony
to honor those who've served this land.

297
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,400
I won't punish you,

298
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,600
and I will look into this tomorrow.

299
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,160
For now, you may go.

300
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,520
Yes, sir.

301
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,400
Wonderful, isn't it?

302
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,400
Publicly humiliated
on my first day as governor.

303
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,920
I sincerely apologize, Sir,

304
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,960
for causing this trouble.

305
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,280
The truth is…

306
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,040
- Kamduang and I--
- Stop!

307
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,240
Who said you could speak?

308
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,360
Don't say a word.

309
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,680
I don't want to hear anything.

310
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,040
So now that you're governor,

311
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,240
you've changed completely?

312
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,360
That's enough, Kamduang.

313
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,600
Both of you, enough.

314
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,560
If anyone says another word,

315
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,360
I'll have them shackled.

316
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,520
This is a serious matter.

317
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,840
I will interrogate you tomorrow

318
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,680
and judge the case accordingly.

319
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,160
If you are truly guilty,
punishment will follow.

320
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,640
I will not allow anyone to accuse me
of favoritism on my very first day.

321
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,280
Do you understand?

322
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,960
Yes, Sir.

323
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,360
Then leave.

324
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,360
Governor,

325
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,120
will you really punish Khun Aek?

326
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,280
He's now officially titled Khun Pra Aek.

327
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
Yes, sir.

328
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,960
If he is found guilty,

329
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,400
then he must be punished.

330
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,680
There can be no excuses.

331
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,400
You're so heartless.

332
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,480
If you call that heartless,

333
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,080
then

334
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,680
what I'm about to do next
will be downright brutal.

335
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,800
You've changed.

336
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,120
What are you planning to do?

337
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,160
You'll see soon enough.

338
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,200
And you'll have to help me carry it out.

339
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,480
What will you do

340
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,360
at tomorrow's inquiry?

341
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,440
I'll simply tell the truth
when the governor asks.

342
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,360
But if you do,

343
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
you'll be punished.

344
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,520
If I broke the law,
then I must be punished.

345
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,400
The law is clear.

346
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,920
But don't worry.

347
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,640
I was the one who hired you

348
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,320
to pose as my wife.

349
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
The guilt falls on me alone.

350
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,400
No. I won't allow that.

351
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
If you're punished, I should be too.

352
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,920
We did this together.

353
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,680
I won't let you take the blame alone.

354
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,720
Thank you, Kamduang.

355
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,680
What you've already done for me
is more than enough.

356
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,680
I don't want you
to suffer with me any further.

357
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,720
Who's there?

358
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
Governor?

359
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,440
Ping?

360
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,280
I'm sorry

361
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,240
I had to call you here this way.

362
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,440
But I wanted this matter kept secret.

363
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,160
Then I'll go guard outside.

364
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,600
Regarding the case
of Khun Pra Aek Itthirit

365
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,000
which will be judged tomorrow…

366
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,920
Slay the ox when the plow is finished.

367
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,240
Kill the warrior when the war is won.

368
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,560
Is that your intent?

369
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,440
Can you please let me finish,

370
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Kamduang?

371
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
For Khun Pra Aek's case,

372
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,800
if he truly broke the law,

373
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,160
then he cannot avoid punishment.

374
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,320
But if he is innocent,

375
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,120
he won't be punished.

376
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,360
But we did

377
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,880
break the law.

378
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,120
If you're found guilty,

379
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,440
the punishment is imprisonment.

380
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,680
You two would never see each other again.

381
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,320
So tonight
will be your last night together.

382
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,920
Everything

383
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,199
started with our lie that day.

384
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,639
Yes.

385
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,920
And tomorrow,

386
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,760
it all ends

387
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,600
because of that lie.

388
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,360
But it wasn't all bad.

389
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,120
At least our lie helped us

390
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,880
catch the bandits and protect the city.

391
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,320
And your father was cured
thanks to the golden ginseng.

392
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,320
I once heard of a mysterious technique

393
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,280
that lets you go back in time.

394
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,040
I'll ask my father

395
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,280
if there's a way he can help us.

396
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,040
If I could go back,

397
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,520
I wouldn't change a thing.

398
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,280
If changing the past
means I wouldn't fall in love with you,

399
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,200
then I'd rather not.

400
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,800
I don't think I could love anyone else

401
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,440
but you, my Kamduang.

402
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,160
I will love you

403
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,440
until my last breath.

404
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,360
Even if our lie ends,

405
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,000
my love for you

406
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,640
will never end.

407
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,720
You will forever be in my heart.

408
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
But the thought of losing you…

409
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,320
I can't bear it.

410
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,440
Neither can I.

411
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm so lucky…

412
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,000
to have you as my partner,

413
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,480
as my love.

414
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,840
Thank you…

415
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,680
for loving me.

416
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,080
The governor will soon
pass judgment on me.

417
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,560
If I end up imprisoned,

418
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,840
will you wait for me?

419
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,640
I will.

420
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,080
I could wait for you my whole life.

421
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,760
Yesterday,

422
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,120
Lady Yeesoon filed a complaint

423
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,120
that Khun Pra Aek Itthirit

424
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,120
lied about

425
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,360
being married to Kamduang.

426
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,200
Today, we present the case

427
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,440
to the governor for investigation.

428
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,680
Bring in the accused.

429
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,520
Khun Pra Aek Itthirit,

430
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,840
Lady Kamduang,

431
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,480
please come in.

432
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,720
No need to waste time, Governor.

433
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll speak the truth--

434
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,000
Silence!

435
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,880
Who gave you permission to speak?

436
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,360
Clearly, you've never stood trial before.

437
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,960
You speak only when asked,

438
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,080
and only answer what I ask.

439
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,960
If I don't ask,

440
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,760
you don't speak.

441
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,120
Understood?

442
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,040
Understood, Sir.

443
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,080
You are accused of lying
about having a wife,

444
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,920
to avoid ordaining
in merit of my mother's passing.

445
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,400
She passed several months ago.

446
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,520
For a man and woman

447
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,360
to live together all that time

448
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,840
without consummating would be unnatural.

449
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,920
Now, my question.

450
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,800
Did you and Kamduang

451
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,520
consummate your relationship?

452
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,000
Such probing questions for a trial…

453
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,600
Answer, Khun Pra Aek!

454
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,120
Well…

455
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,160
Yes, we did, Sir.

456
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,920
- Well…
- Only answer what I ask.

457
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,640
Yes, Sir.

458
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,160
You claim you consummated.

459
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,800
Was that a lie?

460
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,000
It is true, Sir.

461
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,520
We'll see.

462
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,240
I'll tell you something.

463
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,760
This morning, I already sent
an investigator to your residence

464
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,520
to find out the truth.

465
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,560
Sergeant Boonchai,

466
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,960
please come in.

467
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,320
Report your findings.

468
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,880
I did

469
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,480
inspect Khun Pra Aek's bed.

470
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,680
I found signs

471
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,360
of the Thunder Giant's Axe
strikes last night, Sir.

472
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,880
Thunder Giant's Axe strikes?

473
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Did it hit the mark?

474
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,240
Direct hit, Sir.

475
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,920
How many times?

476
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,680
I believe

477
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,640
not fewer than three, Sir.

478
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,200
Does the investigation
need to be this detailed?

479
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,240
And how do you know
it was not fewer than three?

480
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,920
From the traces left
on this very bedsheet, Sir.

481
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,560
To bring this out for display…

482
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,600
I'm embarrassed, sir.

483
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,400
It would be strange if you weren't.

484
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,440
But you can't help it.

485
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,000
You're husband and wife.

486
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,120
I object, sir.

487
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,360
They may have done it just last night,

488
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,600
knowing the trial was today.

489
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,560
You raise a valid point.

490
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,760
That might be true.

491
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,040
Then we need further testimony.

492
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,320
Grandma Aoy, Yip,

493
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,720
come in.

494
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,200
You two are servants
close to Khun Pra Aek.

495
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,480
Let me ask you.

496
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,800
Did Khun Pra Aek and Kamduang

497
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,080
ever consummate?

498
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,040
Of course they did, sir.

499
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,560
He's handsome and strong,

500
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,080
she's beautiful and delicate.

501
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,560
Living that close together,

502
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,800
who could resist

503
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,960
such passion?

504
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,920
- That's true.
- Right?

505
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,120
Silence.

506
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,520
This is a court, not a marketplace.

507
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,520
Watch your language, Aoy.

508
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,800
Yes, sir.

509
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,080
Yip, speak.

510
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,200
Khun Pra Aek and Madam did have sex.

511
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,760
They did battle on the bed

512
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,560
many times, sir.

513
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,240
I know because I saw
the crumpled bedsheets.

514
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,160
It looked like a war zone!

515
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,640
The wrinkles weren't even the worst part.

516
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,840
Sometimes

517
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,840
their battles were so fierce,

518
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,240
the whole house shook.

519
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,440
The pillars nearly broke.

520
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,840
Maybe it was just
the Ananta fish turning over.

521
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,640
But there were sounds, sir.

522
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
It was definitely not a fish.

523
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,320
More like an eel sliding through mud.

524
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,040
It sounded like this.

525
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,800
Hey.

526
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,160
I said this is not a marketplace!

527
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,200
You're making things up.

528
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,760
It could've been something else.

529
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,000
Saying that

530
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,160
means you've never done it, have you?

531
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,800
Those who have done it

532
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,320
don't question it.

533
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,560
Thus, it can be concluded…

534
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,480
Khun Pra Aek and Kamduang had sex.

535
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,600
Had intimate relations.

536
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,080
They are indeed husband and wife, right?

537
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,120
Yes, sir.

538
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,480
Yes, sir.

539
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,920
With clear testimony and evidence,

540
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
the verdict is…

541
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,480
Khun Pra Aek

542
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,960
and Kamduang

543
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,680
are not guilty.

544
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,440
Court dismissed.

545
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,880
See?

546
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,400
I told you.

547
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,360
All that sinful business

548
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,160
can actually save lives.
Do you believe me now?

549
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,080
I do, Grandma.

550
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,360
Can you take me to see a battle?

551
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,960
Shall we do it again tonight?

552
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,480
Khun Pra Aek, Kamduang…

553
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,960
I…

554
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,800
I've come to apologize

555
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,560
for accusing you
of not being a real couple.

556
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,400
I realize now I was wrong.

557
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,680
And I understand now

558
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
that nothing

559
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,200
can destroy your love.

560
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,080
I understand.

561
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,120
No need to explain, Yeesoon.

562
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,040
I have to say it

563
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,720
because this will be the last time
we see each other.

564
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,960
I've come to say goodbye.

565
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,720
Where are you going?

566
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,720
My mother and I

567
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,640
are moving to live with my uncle
in Phra Nakhon.

568
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,320
I forgive you, Yeesoon.

569
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,680
I forgive you too.

570
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,880
Paka once told me, in Western culture,

571
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,440
when two people feel good
toward each other, they hug like this.

572
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,360
Right now, I feel good toward you.

573
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,640
I know deep down

574
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,280
you're not a bad person.

575
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,320
You did all of that

576
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,720
out of filial piety to your mother.

577
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,200
Thank you, Kamduang.

578
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,440
I hope you meet a wonderful man,

579
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,400
one who will love you, care for you,

580
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,240
and most importantly,

581
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,400
may he be

582
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,000
handsome like a god.

583
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,960
I wish you well, Yeesoon.

584
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,560
We'll be going now.

585
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,080
Yes.

586
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,320
Yeesoon.

587
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,600
There you are.

588
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,520
I've been looking everywhere.

589
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,400
What is it, Mother?

590
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,680
Have you found Yeesoon?

591
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,160
Greet Perm, dear.

592
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,120
He just graduated abroad

593
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,640
and is about to join
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

594
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,840
He's traveling
to visit relatives in Thung Yai City,

595
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,760
so I asked him to accompany us
to Phra Nakhon.

596
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,200
Kamduang's blessing is divine…

597
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,960
Do you think

598
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,080
I handled that case well?

599
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,520
Ping?

600
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,560
Yes, sir?

601
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,920
Ping,

602
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,240
now that the town's peaceful again,

603
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,920
you can just walk around
like normal people.

604
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,640
Yes, sir.

605
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,640
Honestly, I thought you were
going to punish Khun Pra Aek.

606
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,440
If you call this heartless,

607
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,600
then

608
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,080
what I'm about to do next
will be downright brutal.

609
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,840
If you're found guilty,

610
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,760
the punishment is imprisonment.

611
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,960
You two would never see each other again.

612
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,600
So tonight
will be your last night together.

613
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,960
Make Yeesoon's accusation invalid.

614
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,520
What are you telling me to do, sir?

615
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,200
Can you say it directly?

616
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,440
Go become his real wife.

617
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,560
Are you scared?

618
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,120
I'm scared…

619
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,080
I'd miss it.

620
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,120
Are you mad

621
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,160
I told Kamduang to do that?

622
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,400
How could I be, sir?

623
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,200
You're my superior.

624
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,440
And…

625
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,360
what if I weren't your superior?

626
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,320
I still couldn't be mad, sir.

627
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,440
Because

628
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,000
those two clearly love each other.

629
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,920
They've been through so much.

630
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,000
You simply gave them a little push.

631
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,520
Khun Pra Aek is lucky

632
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,280
to have me giving him that push.

633
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,520
But me…

634
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,160
I have no one to do the same for me.

635
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,400
I suppose I'll be alone forever.

636
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,480
If there's nothing else,

637
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,040
I'll take my leave.

638
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,920
Hold on.

639
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,720
The city may be at peace,

640
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,520
but something else

641
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,560
is in turmoil.

642
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,240
You must stay and help me.

643
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,600
How may I help, sir?

644
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,920
I'd like to ask you to become my wife.

645
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,840
I think I smell flowers in the breeze.

646
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,240
You have a sharp nose.

647
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,440
DEAR

648
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,920
That's my sachet.

649
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,160
But your scent is far sweeter
than any flower inside it.

650
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,760
How did it end up with you?

651
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,800
I noticed it a while back,

652
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,560
and waited for you to give it to me.

653
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,760
But yesterday,
I thought I might lose my head,

654
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,280
so I kept it close.

655
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,280
At least, if I died,

656
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,800
I'd have it with me.

657
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,280
It's not pretty,
so I didn't dare give it to you.

658
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,000
Pretty or not,

659
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,440
it's the most precious thing I own.

660
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,800
Do you know

661
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,000
what I'm thinking?

662
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,360
You're thinking

663
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,320
that tonight,
the moon is at its most beautiful.

664
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,880
Right?

665
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,080
Yes.

666
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,560
But not just that.

667
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,280
Then what are you thinking about?

668
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,400
I think

669
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,280
even if there's no moon,

670
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,480
the dark sky is still beautiful

671
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,840
as long as you're beside me.

672
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,120
I'll be by your side forever.

673
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,880
Even when it's late at night?

674
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,480
Whether it's night or day,

675
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,960
if I have duties,

676
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,160
I may not always be with you.

677
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,600
But you can be certain,

678
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,280
my heart

679
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,560
will stay with you always.

680
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,360
THE END

681
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,720
