1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,920
Farewell…

2
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
<i>I can save her.</i>

3
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey?

4
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,240
- Dad?
- Mhm.

5
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,759
I must thank you, Dad, for saving my life.

6
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,560
Still, I owe thanks to you

7
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,960
and Khun Aek,
for sending the golden ginseng.

8
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,720
Kamduang, what sort of work
are you doing for Khun Aek

9
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,880
that you've earned enemies this ruthless?

10
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,680
This is magic meant to kill. I'd say…

11
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
DIE

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
…there's a traitor inside this household.

13
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,200
I can't imagine
which servant here would be so vile

14
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,080
as to try to murder one of you.

15
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,120
We'll have to secretly watch
and listen the servants.

16
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,760
We might catch a clue.

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,560
I think one of us servants put it there.

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,760
You think the same as me!

19
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,560
As far as I know,

20
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,040
there's the Divine Eye spell.
It lets you see the past.

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,000
The Divine Eye that can see into the past?

22
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,800
Then it can see

23
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,120
who did it?

24
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Exactly.

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,120
But you need corpse-washing water
from seven graveyards

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,920
to cleanse the eyes.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,840
That way,
you'll see the past crystal clear,

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,320
faces and all.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
But you must know the exact time

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,880
when the deed

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,880
was done.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,640
Otherwise, it's very dangerous.

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
Dangerous? How so?

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,760
Well, what if you don't know the timing

35
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,480
and just peek at random times?

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,400
That's the husband and wife's bed.

37
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,240
If you just peek at random times,

38
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,360
you might catch them
doing something in the night.

39
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,880
Oh.

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,320
Or am I wrong?

41
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,320
I mean, Khun Aek and Madam

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,320
are still young.

43
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,520
When they're side-by-side,
bodies touching,

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
of course they'd feel something, right?

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,200
I've got goosebumps!

46
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,800
Enough about the Divine Eye.
It's annoying.

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,840
Let's talk about the nose.

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,440
You two don't have husbands yet,
so you wouldn't know

49
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,399
that men and women

50
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,120
have secret scents.

51
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,880
That scent

52
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,440
is a lust-rousing scent.

53
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
It feels…

54
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,760
strangely tingly.

55
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,680
Not just tingly,

56
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,280
it sends shivers down the spine.

57
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,320
Aw.

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,840
When a man and woman
are pressed together long enough,

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,960
they'll surely catch that scent of desire.

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,400
And then?

61
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,960
Oh? You guys…

62
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,520
always say I'm dirty-minded,

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
so I don't want to say it anymore.

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,640
Oh come on, Grandma.

65
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,800
Finish it. Don't leave us hanging.

66
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,440
What happens when you catch the scent?

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,120
What else?

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,320
After touching each other,

69
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,680
sniffing each other,

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,720
they end up in bed, wrestling!

71
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,760
That's tingling!

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Oh?

73
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
Sir? Madam?

74
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
I want to repair the house.

75
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,280
So I was inspecting the columns,

76
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
to see if the house needed repairs.

77
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes, Dear.

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,360
This door doesn't seem good either.
It needs repairing.

79
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's head back, Dear.

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Mmm.

81
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
Letter for you, ma'am.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Thank you.

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,800
- Uncle Duang, this one's from your son.
- Thanks.

84
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
Phin.

85
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,080
Yes, Yeesoon?

86
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,520
Any letters for me from Phra Nakhon?

87
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
<i>Dearest Uncle Man,</i>
<i>I'm writing this to ask you</i>

88
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
<i>to investigate</i>
<i>what happened in Phra Nakhon.</i>

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,400
<i>You might remember Khun Aek Itthirit,</i>

90
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,800
<i>the son of Khun Pra Chuay Chaikonlaseuk.</i>

91
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,120
<i>Rumor says</i>

92
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,880
<i>he slept with a woman named Kamduang,</i>

93
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,680
<i>forcing them to wed.</i>

94
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,920
<i>I would like you to help confirm</i>

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,960
<i>if this is true or not.</i>

96
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,320
There's one from a relative of yours.

97
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,960
Can I have it now?
Please, I must read it quickly.

98
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,320
Sorry.

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,840
I must deliver it to your house.
If I give it to you here,

100
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,880
it's against the rules.

101
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,200
But the recipient is right here. It's me.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,280
I still can't give it to you.

103
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,000
Please be patient and wait at home.

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,280
What troubles you, Yeesoon?

105
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,960
I wrote to Uncle
about Khun Aek and Kamduang.

106
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm sure they're hiding something.

107
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
Uncle lives in Phra Nakhon.
I'm sure he can uncover the truth.

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,560
Then let's hurry home and wait there.

109
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,720
Yes, Mother.

110
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,640
More trouble for you, poor Kamduang.

111
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
Thank you, Paka, for warning me.

112
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,800
No problem.

113
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,960
But act fast, before it's too late.

114
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Oh?

115
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,520
Guess who…

116
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,280
Khun Pra Chuay!

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,560
Your memory's sharp.

118
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
You know my voice.

119
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,040
I remember something else too.

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh.

121
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,280
So, you know Kamduang well, do you?
I saw you talking to her.

122
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,080
Yes, I've known her for a long time.

123
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,280
- How well do you know her?
- Oh, very well.

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,320
From start to finish.

125
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,720
She's a good woman.

126
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,040
I believe you.

127
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you still live by the river?

128
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes.

129
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,320
I'll visit one day

130
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
and sail a junk boat down.

131
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,160
It's been a while.

132
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,560
I'll be waiting.

133
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
But don't capsize early, like last time.

134
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,640
Paka, that wasn't me.

135
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,920
My boat can ride the waves till dawn.

136
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,880
But the waters in my canal

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,480
are tricky.

138
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,000
Ah, yes. My shirt's torn.

139
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,440
I'll have you mend it later.

140
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,360
Yeesoon asked her kin
in Phra Nakhon to investigate us?

141
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
Yes, Paka overheard that.

142
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,280
What shall we do?

143
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,920
We have no choice but to take the risk.

144
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,920
Here you go.

145
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,400
Thank you, Phin.

146
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,880
TO LADY YEESOON,
DAUGHTER OF PRA CHERD CHERNG CHOOM

147
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,640
We're too late. She has the letter.

148
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,160
What now?

149
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
We can't let Yeesoon read that letter.

150
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,720
Here's the plan. You go see her

151
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,240
and distract her with some errand
while I sneak in for the letter.

152
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,760
Are you crazy?

153
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,360
She despises me.

154
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,320
You need to do it.

155
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
You must use your charm to distract her.

156
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,200
Then I'll slip in and get the letter.

157
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,920
I can't.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
A man doesn't toy with women like that.

159
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,200
Then just talk to her about anything,

160
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,120
the new tax system,

161
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,000
the Three Seals Law

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,360
or meditation.

163
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,000
"To my dear niece Yeesoon,

164
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,320
regarding your request that I investigate
Khun Ak Itthirit in Phra Nakhon,

165
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,720
I have asked around,
and it appears that--"

166
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,240
Yeesoon.

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,520
Khun Aek is here.

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
He's here?

169
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,960
Yes.

170
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,760
Greetings, Khun Aek.

171
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,120
Oh! I forgot

172
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,640
the curry simmering on the stove.
Please excuse me.

173
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,720
Shall I help you, Mother?

174
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,040
No, no, I've got it.

175
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,280
But last time you burned the pot
and almost burned down the house.

176
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,400
Let me help.

177
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,520
Mother, what's wrong with your eye?

178
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,240
Nothing!

179
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Just stay here and talk with Khun Aek.

180
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,480
I'll handle it. Go on.

181
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,160
Talk to him. Make yourself comfortable.

182
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,080
You came all the way here,

183
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,720
do you need anything?

184
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,040
I wished to talk with you…

185
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,920
about…

186
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,080
the Three Seals Law.

187
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,480
The Three Seals Law?

188
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,920
Hmm.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Why does he want to talk
about something serious?

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,160
He should've chosen
something more exciting.

191
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,560
"To my dear niece Yeesoon,

192
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,520
regarding your request that I investigate
Khun Ak Itthirit in Phra Nakhon,

193
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,320
I have asked around, and it appears that

194
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,040
Khun Aek only came to study.
There's nothing about women."

195
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,280
"I asked his kin about marriage.
They denied it."

196
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,440
"Therefore, I conclude

197
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,960
Khun Aek has not been with any woman
in Phra Nakhon, as you suspected."

198
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,960
"There's nothing about women.…"

199
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,080
That he misses.

200
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,360
"I asked his kin about marriage."

201
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,120
"They denied…"

202
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,400
Nothing.

203
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,440
If you are so interested
in the Three Seals Law,

204
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,840
my father keeps some books in my room.

205
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,000
Shall we go see?

206
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,680
In your room?

207
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,920
My daughter is inviting him
straight to her room?

208
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,800
She's as bold as me!

209
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,760
I think it wouldn't be proper.

210
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,560
Where else would law books be
but in my room?

211
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,720
Come, I'll show you.

212
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,240
Let's go.

213
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,680
"Therefore, I conclude Khun Aek

214
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,720
has been with a woman
in Phra Nakhon, as you suspected."

215
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,280
Wait.

216
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,240
Yeesoon.

217
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,800
Oh, Khun Aek,

218
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,800
if someone sees this,
it wouldn't look right.

219
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,840
Why did you shut the door?

220
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,840
So we can discuss thoroughly.

221
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,960
Discuss?

222
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,720
Discuss what, exactly?

223
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,640
The law, of course.

224
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,520
Unless you'd prefer
another kind of discussion.

225
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
We'll discuss this.

226
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,880
You mean to lift my skirt?

227
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,240
No, I…

228
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
I meant your skirt…

229
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,880
looks good.

230
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,760
Sweet talker.

231
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,520
The Three Seals Law book
is in this cabinet.

232
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,240
Yeesoon.

233
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,440
I just feel dizzy.

234
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,960
Let's sit.

235
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,160
Slowly.

236
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,119
How do you feel?

237
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,560
Better now.

238
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,560
Yeesoon,

239
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,920
I have something to show you.

240
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
Close your eyes and count to ten.

241
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,960
I want to see it already.

242
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,480
One, two,

243
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,920
three, four,

244
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,680
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

245
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,640
That was fast.

246
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,960
I was too eager to know.

247
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,080
Oh.

248
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,840
What's wrong?

249
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,880
Ah, I think it's a back strain.

250
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
Then let me massage it for you.

251
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,120
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

252
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,560
Go slowly.

253
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,520
Here?

254
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
- A bit lower.
- Lower?

255
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,960
Here?

256
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,680
A bit lower?

257
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,840
Lower, okay.

258
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,360
That's it.

259
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,800
Can I do it harder?

260
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,320
Sure.

261
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Yes.

262
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,000
Do you like it?

263
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,160
Very much.

264
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,560
Yes, there.

265
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,960
You give the best massages.

266
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,000
Ah. That's good.

267
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,720
Nice hand pressure.

268
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,880
You shouldn't have been
so harsh with Yeesoon.

269
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,800
If I hadn't, you'd already
be wrestling with her by now.

270
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,120
That tone… Are you jealous?

271
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,840
Not at all.

272
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,720
I have no right. I'm just a fake.

273
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
Truthfully,

274
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,320
I've never thought of you as a fake.

275
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,840
I think of us as mates.

276
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,520
Mates?

277
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,560
Foreign words again? What does that mean?

278
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,080
It means

279
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,760
comrades,

280
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,960
confidants, partners in crime,
or something like that.

281
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,280
That sounds like a wife,

282
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,600
not a mate.

283
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,600
Who said you weren't my wife?

284
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,880
Even if just my future wife.

285
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
You really don't remember anything
about what happened?

286
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,920
I vaguely recall
that I was about to finish…

287
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,040
To give Khun Aek a massage, that's all.

288
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,000
After that I can't remember a thing.

289
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,360
Did you see Khun Aek sneaking out, Mother?

290
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,720
No. I have no idea when he left.

291
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,840
I saw this letter,

292
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,360
so I picked it up and read it because
I wanted to know what was going on.

293
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,360
I didn't finish reading it.

294
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,080
What did he say?

295
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,280
Uncle Man confirmed it.

296
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,560
Aek and that Kamduang

297
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,360
really did sleep together in Phra Nakhon.

298
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,360
<i>"Regarding your request that I investigate</i>
<i>Khun Aek Itthirit in Phra Nakhon,</i>

299
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,320
<i>I have asked around, and it appears that</i>

300
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,520
<i>Khun Aek only came to study."</i>

301
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,480
<i>"There's nothing about women</i>
<i>that he misses."</i>

302
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,760
<i>"I asked his kin about marriage.</i>

303
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,240
<i>"They denied nothing.</i>
<i>Therefore, I conclude</i>

304
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,160
<i>Khun Aek has been with a woman</i>
<i>in Phra Nakhon, as you suspected."</i>

305
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
<i>"Uncle Man."</i>

306
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,440
I can't believe
Khun Aek would be that kind of man.

307
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,320
Oh, child. Honey draws ants.

308
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,960
No matter how good a man seems,

309
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,560
if the chance is there, he cannot resist.

310
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,040
What you two did was far too risky.

311
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,800
I know, Father.

312
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,360
But at the time, there was no choice.

313
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,320
At least you made it through.

314
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,560
You must be furious with Kamduang, though.

315
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Why would I be?

316
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,600
Oh?

317
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,960
Yeesoon was just about to massage you,

318
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,200
and Kamduang shot a dart to knock her out.

319
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,480
No, Father.

320
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,120
In that moment,

321
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,400
I only felt uncomfortable

322
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,400
and wanted to get out of that room
as quickly as possible.

323
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,280
Strange, isn't it?

324
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,040
I thought
you still had feelings for Yeesoon.

325
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,840
For men, being close to a woman you like,

326
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,600
you never want it to end.

327
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,200
But you felt uncomfortable
and wanted to escape.

328
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,920
Isn't that strange?

329
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Is it too tight here?

330
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,040
What are you two doing?

331
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,320
Elemental healing massage, Sir.

332
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,040
You can go home. I'll massage my wife.

333
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,440
Go.

334
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,760
You are jealous
and possessive, aren't you?

335
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,400
Answer me.

336
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,920
I think of us as mates.

337
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,960
What does that mean?

338
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,400
It means

339
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,080
comrades,

340
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,280
confidants, partners in crime,
or something like that.

341
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,640
That sounds like a wife,

342
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,200
not a mate.

343
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,320
‪MY DEAR

344
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,360
Oh, you still have the touch.

345
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,440
That feels so good.

346
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,640
This side too.

347
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Much better.

348
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,560
- Dad.
- Hmm?

349
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
I'm already recovered now.

350
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,880
I think you should return home.

351
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,480
Didn't you say you had business at home?

352
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,520
Yeah, I know.

353
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,840
Kamduang.

354
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,280
Where's Dad?
We've been waiting to eat together.

355
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,440
He's gone.

356
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,080
Gone where?

357
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Home.

358
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,440
When? Why didn't he tell me?

359
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,040
He didn't tell me either.
He's angry at you,

360
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,960
said you despised him.

361
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,920
That's not true.

362
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,560
Well, I'm also caught in the middle,

363
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
hiding the truth about you and Khun Aek.

364
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,360
Go after him. He can't have gone far.

365
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,280
- Yes.
- Let's go.

366
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Kamduang, wait for me.

367
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
- Has he been gone for long?
- I don't know.

368
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,080
Whoa, Dad.

369
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,200
He probably didn't pack food.

370
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,720
I've prepared some
for him to eat on the way.

371
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
You did this yourself?

372
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,920
The servants went out, so I did it.

373
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,800
Thank you, Dear.

374
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,080
It's nothing.

375
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,480
When all this is over, I'll travel to him,
explain, and beg forgiveness.

376
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,080
- Go now.
- Alright.

377
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,080
- Let's go.
- Kamduang.

378
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,040
Yes?

379
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,240
Another foreign word? What does it mean?

380
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,520
It means, "Look after yourself."

381
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,320
Then you too, take care of yourself.

382
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,000
And that means?

383
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,560
The same, look after yourself.

384
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,480
I'll go now.

385
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,920
Let's go, Uncle Yoy.

386
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,960
Dad, wait!

387
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,040
What is it?

388
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,880
Why did you leave without telling me?

389
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,640
You wanted me gone, so I left.

390
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,800
No, you misunderstand.

391
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,040
I never despised you.

392
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,880
Kamduang,

393
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,960
you work with high officials.

394
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,960
I'm just a buffalo trader.

395
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,840
Staying here would only shame you.

396
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,280
Sulking, I see.

397
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,400
Dad…

398
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,080
It's work. I can't tell you everything.

399
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,280
Please believe me.

400
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,560
Fine. I'll believe

401
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,440
that you

402
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,920
don't despise me.

403
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,880
Thank you for understanding.

404
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,080
Be careful from now on.

405
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,760
Don't let anyone harm you again.

406
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Yes.

407
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,680
Here. Khun Aek prepared some food for you.

408
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,760
Thank him for me.

409
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,320
I'm going now.

410
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,800
Hello.

411
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,960
Oh.

412
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,880
What would you like?
We've got all kinds of specialty brews.

413
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
Do you have Lady's Lament?

414
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
We only have Lady's Fury.
Do you want to try?

415
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,960
Fury?

416
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,840
- All right, bring it.
- Sure.

417
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,280
Alright.

418
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,520
Khun Aek is such a kind person.

419
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,520
He even sent me food.

420
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,720
Here you go.

421
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,120
Since we're out drinking,

422
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,920
we servants

423
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,120
should have fun
by gossiping about our masters!

424
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,920
Right?

425
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,560
You too, Grandma?

426
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't act so virtuous, Yip.

427
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,600
Listen to me.

428
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,520
First,

429
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,880
Khun Aek must be impotent.

430
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,760
Whoa.

431
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,000
That's harsh.

432
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,120
Then what?

433
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,560
Isn't it true?

434
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,680
Think about it.
They've been together for ages.

435
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,000
Madam Kamduang still shows no sign
of getting pregnant.

436
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,840
Come on, people aren't cats.

437
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,480
Babies don't come that easy.

438
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,480
But they've done it so often.

439
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,400
Yeah.

440
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,720
The house was shaking the other day.

441
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,680
That's right.

442
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,040
And honestly,

443
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm still curious.

444
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,400
After knowing her for a while, I think

445
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,840
Madam isn't interested in such things.

446
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,320
Yeah.

447
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,160
So the first time they slept together,

448
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,280
I wonder…

449
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,000
What?

450
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,680
Maybe he forced her.

451
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,520
What?

452
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,280
Don't joke about that.

453
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,320
A man who forces a woman,

454
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,840
doesn't respect her,

455
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,160
and hurts weaker people

456
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,160
is vile and despicable.

457
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,880
And I think

458
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,120
Khun Aek isn't that sort of man. No way.

459
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,120
Yeah.

460
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
What are you doing?

461
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,080
I'm fixing the mosquito net.

462
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,680
It's torn.
I'm afraid mosquitos will come in.

463
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,640
You're not tall enough.

464
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
I'll do it.

465
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,680
- You--
- You don't need to.

466
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,120
It's okay. Just stay still. I'll do it.

467
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,640
Then do it well.

468
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,280
Dear, aim straight.

469
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,360
Push it in.

470
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,000
A little off is okay. There is it.

471
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,480
It's in.

472
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,760
Good.

473
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,480
It's hard to hold.
Can you help me hold it?

474
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,520
You got it?

475
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,920
There it is. A little bit to the right.

476
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
- Here?
- Push it through.

477
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Does it hurt?

478
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,159
It's bleeding a lot.

479
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,440
Just finish it. I'll clean the blood.

480
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,159
Alright.

481
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,760
Khun Aek, you…

482
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,840
I'll do it fast.

483
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,480
- I can't.
- Yes.

484
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,920
If break in now,

485
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,280
Kamduang might be naked.

486
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
No.

487
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,679
She must be naked.

488
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,960
Almost done.

489
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,400
What should I do?

490
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,520
Finished.

491
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,960
What?

492
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,480
Why is it so fast?

493
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,840
That was tense.

494
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,320
The round may be over,
but the battle isn't.

495
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Who's that?

496
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,920
I asked who it is.

497
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,360
That doesn't seem good.

498
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,560
- What?
- Uncle Yod?

499
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,360
Uncle Yod, what is this?

500
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,640
You violated my daughter.

501
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,240
No, it's not what you think.

502
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,680
Then what is it?

503
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,520
What's going on? Wait, Yod.

504
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,840
Father! Oh, calm down, please.

505
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,600
Uncle Yod, please listen to me.

506
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
I won't.

507
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,960
You deserve my Buffalo-Throwing Punch!

508
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Dad!

509
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,880
Dad.

510
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,040
Please don't hurt my husband.

511
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,920
Husband?

512
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,160
I slept with Khun Aek, so we had to marry.

513
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,080
But we lied to the townsfolk,
saying it happened in Phra Nakhon.

514
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,480
We didn't dare tell the truth,

515
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,320
afraid you'd be angry, Father--

516
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,960
I mean, Uncle.

517
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,960
So we thought to confess later.

518
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,080
But I was the one
who told him to keep it from you.

519
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,840
If you're angry, be angry at me.

520
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,320
Kamduang,

521
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,120
I want to know only one thing.

522
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,200
Did Khun Aek ever force you?

523
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,920
Say it out!

524
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,160
No need to be afraid of anyone here.

525
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,200
I swear

526
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,640
he never violated me.

527
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,200
Then what? You love him?

528
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,120
- I…
- We love each other.

529
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,240
I asked my daughter.

530
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,480
Yes, I love him.

531
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,320
Kamduang.

532
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,680
Don't forget

533
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,000
you swore to tell the truth.

534
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,240
Yes.

535
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,520
I truly love him.

536
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,240
And please don't be angry

537
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,720
that I shot at you earlier.

538
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,400
I knew you'd dodge it,

539
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,160
but if I hadn't,

540
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,480
you might have killed my husband.

541
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,080
Alright.

542
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Well, it's come to this.

543
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,080
Aek, Kamduang, apologize to your father.

544
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,120
Forgive me, Dad.

545
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,040
Forgive me too, Uncle.

546
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,760
Father.

547
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,520
We're family now.

548
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,800
There's no need to hold grudges.

549
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,960
Thank you.

550
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
But I must also
apologize to you, Khun Pra,

551
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,560
for striking you without restraint.

552
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,040
It's nothing.

553
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,280
Honestly,
your punch wasn't all that heavy.

554
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,880
But you were bleeding.

555
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,520
It's normal.

556
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,240
Once my wife swatted
a mosquito on my cheek,

557
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,080
I bled just like this.

558
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,160
Same weight as your fist.

559
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,120
So fragile.

560
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,480
Why didn't you tell
your father the whole truth?

561
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,920
If he knew
we weren't truly husband and wife,

562
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,600
he'd never let me share a room with you.

563
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,400
He'd take me home or make us sleep apart.

564
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,160
Everyone would find out.

565
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,080
You're right.

566
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,200
And what will you tell him
about the gun deal?

567
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,200
That it's your work, and I'm helping.

568
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,920
A wife helping her husband isn't strange.

569
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,160
It's late. Let's sleep.

570
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,040
Yes.

571
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,320
Why are you smiling?

572
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,440
No reason.

573
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Just sleep.

574
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,600
Kamduang, you swore to tell the truth.

575
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,160
Yes.

576
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,120
I truly love him.

577
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,240
Now that all's well,

578
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,520
you can stay longer, Yod.

579
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,760
Do you want to go to the beach?

580
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,960
No, I should go home.

581
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,680
Why, Dad?

582
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,440
I have things to handle at home too.

583
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,720
I left things with Kham too long already.

584
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,160
Father, the fruit here is delicious.

585
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,200
Have you tried any?

586
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,800
Really? Good. Bring some for me.

587
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
I'll take them back for Kham.

588
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,360
Who is this Kham, Father?

589
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,080
Kham's nothing special,
just a village boy, my student.

590
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,120
And he's the one Kamduang had a crush on.

591
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,880
Why would you say that?

592
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,960
Hey, what's with that face?

593
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,800
You're Khun Aek's wife now.

594
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,120
What kind of man is he?

595
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,720
He's serious,

596
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,160
handsome, and tall.

597
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,040
Girls swoon over him, including Kamduang.

598
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,040
Hey,

599
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,800
why did no one get the ball in?

600
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,240
Kamduang,

601
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,840
pass the ball to Aek.

602
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,880
He can show his father-in-law his skills.

603
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,080
Yes, Father.

604
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,040
Kamduang, watch out!

605
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,560
Splendid strike, young man.

606
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,120
Thank you, sir.

607
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,320
Are you alright, Kamduang?

608
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,680
Kham?

609
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,440
Yes, it's me,

610
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,920
your same old Kham.

611
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Kham.

612
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,480
Speak of the devil, and here you are.

613
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,680
Alright.

614
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,720
I was at the market asking for directions

615
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,200
and met a kind lady, Paka.

616
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,600
She brought me here.

617
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,160
Hello.

618
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,560
Mister.

619
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,480
You're not from here, are you?

620
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,080
Where are you from?

621
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,440
From Isaan.

622
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,680
May I ask you something?

623
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,040
Your face is sweet,
and your mouth is sweet.

624
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,160
What would you like to ask?

625
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,960
May I ask the way
to Khun Pra Chuay's house?

626
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,000
Sure.

627
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,720
I know someone there.

628
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,200
Who do you seek?

629
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,520
Kamduang.

630
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,880
Sure, follow me.

631
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,200
- This way.
- Thank you.

632
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,000
Anytime,

633
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,080
young buffalo trader.

634
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,320
I'm going now.

635
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,320
Well, Kham,

636
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,520
this is Khun Aek Itthirit.

637
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,560
- He and Kamduang--
- Dad!

638
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,400
Kham must be tired.

639
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,560
Let him rest first.

640
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Thank you.

641
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,480
Actually, he told me
to take care of things at home.

642
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,840
But I disobeyed and came here.

643
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,960
Do you know why?

644
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,200
You're worried about Father?

645
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,360
That's just the excuse.

646
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,760
Actually, I'm worried about you, Kamduang.

647
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,720
I missed you.

648
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,440
Kham…

649
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,400
I have something to tell you.

650
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,040
What is it?

651
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,560
Well…

652
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,520
You're going to say
you missed me too, aren't you?

653
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,160
Well, I did miss you, but--

654
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,040
That's enough for me.

655
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,960
Kham, listen to me first.

656
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,280
I'm listening.

657
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,600
With all my heart.

658
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,240
Kamduang.

659
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,680
Where's Kham?

660
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,320
Packing his things.

661
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,680
Why keep from him
that Khun Aek is your husband?

662
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,480
I wasn't hiding it.
I just didn't know how to say it.

663
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,120
How? Just open your mouth and tell him.

664
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,480
Kham!

665
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,200
- Yes, Teacher
- Come here.

666
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,280
Yes?

667
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,200
Listen. Kamduang is Khun Aek's wife now.

668
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,600
They are married.

669
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,080
Is that true?

670
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,560
Did he say the truth?

671
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,480
Yes.

672
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,520
Khun Aek and I are husband and wife.

673
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,720
No.

674
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,120
It can't be…

675
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,600
I'm sorry.

676
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,320
Are you upset about Kham?

677
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,480
Yes.

678
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,720
Have you known him long?

679
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,400
His father worked with my father.

680
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,560
After his father died,
my father took him in.

681
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,400
We grew up together.

682
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,880
Does he love you?

683
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,640
I never asked.

684
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,440
And you? Do you love him?

685
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
It's not about love or not love.

686
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,680
I just hate that
things turned out this way.

687
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,680
This way? What way?

688
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,800
Well, I want to tell him the truth.

689
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,280
You care for his feelings.

690
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,600
But I didn't tell him
because I care about you more.

691
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,080
I was worried you'd lose your work.

692
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,640
I'm saying this because I feel bad

693
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,280
lying to Dad and to Kham.

694
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,680
Bear it a little longer.

695
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,840
The gun deal will conclude soon.

696
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,680
Yes.

697
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,000
And if he truly loves you,

698
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,920
he won't go running to another woman.

699
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,160
That will prove his love.

700
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,640
If you're sure it's true,

701
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,840
then there's no need to worry.

702
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,120
Use reason above emotion.

703
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,760
Are you joking? You're teaching me

704
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,840
while worrying about Yeesoon yourself?

705
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,840
If we had to play husband and wife
for ten years,

706
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,320
do you think she'd wait?

707
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,920
Not just ten years.

708
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,120
I can be your husband for 100 more.

709
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,040
Something like that.

710
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,200
Kamduang accidentally slept with Khun Aek.

711
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,360
So she pretended
to be a lady from Phra Nakhon,

712
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,840
to make it fitting
that she's now his wife.

713
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,800
And what if people find out the truth
that she's just a buffalo trader?

714
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,800
What will happen?

715
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,400
If they know she lied,

716
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,760
she'll be humiliated,

717
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,960
maybe even punished by the authorities

718
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,280
for deception.

719
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,320
And right now
she's helping Khun Aek with his duties.

720
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,520
Don't you pity her?

721
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,240
Your father caught the jungle fever.
He's gone to a better place now, Kham.

722
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,360
You'll stay with me.

723
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,680
<i>I want to die and follow my father.</i>

724
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,680
I have no one left.

725
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,760
That's not true.

726
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,920
You still have me,

727
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,680
Dad, and Uncle Yoy.

728
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,000
We won't leave you.

729
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,240
Do you mean it, Kamduang?
You won't leave me?

730
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,920
Yes. I promise.

731
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,000
I'll never leave you.

732
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,440
I'll always be by your side.

733
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,520
You promise?

734
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,880
Yes. I promise I'll never leave you.

735
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,800
Ready, Teacher?

736
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,440
Send it this way.

737
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,680
Why don't you rest a while

738
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,040
before heading home, Kham?

739
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,120
As you wish, Teacher.

740
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,320
Ah.

741
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,240
Oh, Khun Aek, play a round with Kham.

742
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,600
I'm tired.

743
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,440
I'm on my way to work, sir.

744
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,680
Oh.

745
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,040
You don't even know how to play, right?

746
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,720
What did you say?

747
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,840
Exactly what you heard.

748
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,040
Thought you were tough.

749
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,640
Now that's a duel,
buffalo trader versus nobleman.

750
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,680
I want to see it.

751
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,720
Come, let's start.

752
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,560
One to zero now.

753
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,800
Ah.

754
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,200
One to one now.

755
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,240
Come on. Let's continue.

756
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,720
Oh.

757
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,440
You missed. Khun Aek leads two to one.

758
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,880
Come on.

759
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,320
Oh, Khun Aek won this match

760
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,760
three to one.

761
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,480
Khun Aek, care for another round?

762
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,760
That's enough, Kham. I have to go.

763
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,200
Teacher, I'll stay here longer.

764
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,040
For what?

765
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,200
I'll wait for the day
Kamduang leaves her husband.

766
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,720
And how long will you wait?

767
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,240
As long as a river flows,

768
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,600
so shall my waiting.

769
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,680
The day it ends

770
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,920
will be the day my breath does.

771
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,800
I've heard that you're skilled in sorcery.

772
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,720
And who do you want me
to bind in a spell of love?

773
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,640
Myself and the lady named Kamduang.

774
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,320
You are a nobleman.

775
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,960
Matters like these are grave.

776
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,120
How could you work so carelessly?

777
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,040
This is about Kamduang, isn't it?

778
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,080
Dear,

779
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,560
I've prepared a meal for you.
It's all my own cooking.

780
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,760
Just leave it there.

781
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,400
Where are you going, Dear?

782
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,640
To sleep outside the room.

783
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,800
<i>If a husband finds out</i>
<i>that his wife doesn't love him</i>

784
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,280
or betrays him,
what should the husband do?

785
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,560
While we are still
in mourning for Lady Sri,

786
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,960
would it be permissible to divorce?

787
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,760
Yes, it would.

788
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,000
It hurts.

789
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,720
I will divorce Kamduang.

790
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,440
