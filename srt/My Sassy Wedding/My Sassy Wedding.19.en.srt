1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,680
Where are you going,
Khun Pra Mek, Khun Men?

2
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
You two are under arrest.

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,680
Chakra of Divine Flame…
I've never heard of it before.

4
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,759
It's one of the rarest sacred items.

5
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,920
It may be time to pass it on…

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,520
maybe to Kamduang

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
or you, Khun Aek.

8
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,720
<i>Why did he suddenly fall ill?</i>

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Sleeping Bug poison causes the victim
to linger between life and death.

10
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,320
After two or three days,
they die for real.

11
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,040
Why do you suspect Kham?

12
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,240
He's the only one
who knows about that poison.

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>Close the gate.</i>
<i>I'm here to arrest a criminal.</i>

14
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,480
You bastard, Khun Aek.

15
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Kham!

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,920
Khun Aek.

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,200
My life is ruined because of you.

18
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,120
Don't blame me.
We chose this path ourselves.

19
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,920
Whatever happens,
we must accept the consequences!

20
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,120
Easy for you to say.
You're already old, almost done with life.

21
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,880
I still have years left.

22
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,040
I should be out there enjoying them,
but now they're wasted because of you!

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Men! Did you just spit on me?

24
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,280
Damn right I did, you miserable old man!

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,480
Men! You ungrateful son!

26
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,000
You hit me, you old bastard?

27
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,920
Damn right I did! I'll kill you!

28
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,840
Dad, what's happening? Soldiers!

29
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,200
Someone help!

30
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,240
Dad, please don't die.

31
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,920
Dad, please don't die. Soldier!

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,040
Khun Pra Mek, stay with me, Sir!

33
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Khun Pra Mek.

34
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
Please stay calm, Khun Pra Mek.

35
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Kham!

36
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
Kham!

37
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,360
Come out and let's talk.

38
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,920
Khun Aek, tell your soldiers to back off.

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,960
Don't make me use my last resort.

40
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,120
He must be up to something. Be careful.

41
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Yes, Dear.

42
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Kham,

43
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,120
Uncle Yod is waiting for the antidote.

44
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
Give it to me now.

45
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,320
Khun Aek,

46
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,240
here's the antidote.

47
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,440
Tell your soldiers to back off,
or I'll throw it away.

48
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,240
Kham, everyone makes mistakes.

49
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't blame you for what happened
to Dad. Please give me the antidote.

50
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,200
- Don't come any closer.
- Calm down, Kham.

51
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,320
We can talk this through.

52
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't come closer!
Don't think I won't throw it.

53
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,400
Threats won't work on me.

54
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,080
I don't believe you'll actually throw it.

55
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
- Kamduang!
- Kamduang.

56
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,440
What are you doing?

57
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,760
Take me hostage, quick.

58
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
What did you say?

59
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,640
You know Khun Aek has feelings for me.

60
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,800
If you take me hostage,
he won't dare hurt you.

61
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Kamduang… Why are you helping me?

62
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,480
I just realized that
deep down, I've always liked you.

63
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,040
Ever since we were kids.
I can't bear to watch you die.

64
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,040
Kamduang…

65
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,600
Kamduang, what are you doing?

66
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,720
Come back. Let me handle this.

67
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,840
Kham, take me and get out of here. Now.

68
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,760
- Kamduang!
- Clear the way…

69
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,080
Or she dies! I said move!

70
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Let them through.

71
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Wait here.

72
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Yes, Sir.

73
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,400
Yod!

74
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,520
He's not breathing again.

75
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,560
Yod, hang in there.

76
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,240
Khun Aek and Kamduang

77
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,320
are on their way with the antidote.
Hang in there.

78
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,160
It's crowded around here. The soldiers
should have a hard time spotting us now.

79
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,800
Kamduang, why did you help me?

80
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,360
After all I did to Teacher…

81
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,280
I understand you.
I'm not angry at you at all.

82
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,680
You resented Dad
for giving the sacred item to Khun Aek

83
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,160
but not to you, his student.

84
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,360
If I were you, I'd feel the same way.

85
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,840
I did it all
because I was so bitter toward him.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,440
Still, he's my father.

87
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,040
Please, forgive him.

88
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,160
Alright, for your sake.

89
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,640
Then please give me
the antidote for my father.

90
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
Even now, you still don't trust me?

91
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
Kamduang!

92
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,400
You tricked me!

93
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,120
You want this, right?

94
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,720
You were fooled.

95
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
Kham,

96
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Uncle Yod is waiting for the antidote.

97
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,480
Give it to me now.

98
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,200
This isn't even the real antidote.

99
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,600
Get out of the way! Move!

100
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,440
Move! I said move!

101
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Kham, my father loved you like a son.

102
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,080
Are you going to kill him just because he
chose to give the sacred item to Khun Aek?

103
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,320
That's right.

104
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,200
Khun Aek already got the Mystic Ore,

105
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,400
and now the Chakra of Divine Flame.

106
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,360
Give it up, Kham.
You've got nowhere left to run.

107
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Tell me the antidote.

108
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,200
The antidote is in my head.

109
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Let me go and I'll tell you.

110
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,240
Dream on. I'll capture you

111
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,160
and force the antidote out of you.
If you don't talk,

112
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,520
I'll torture you to death.

113
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,560
Khun Aek, you forced me to do this.

114
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,400
Why is it with him?

115
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
You stole that from Dad?

116
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes. And I'll use it to kill you,

117
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,280
and every single villager here too!

118
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,800
Don't, Kham. The villagers
have nothing to do with this.

119
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,840
Please stop, Kham.

120
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,160
Watch out, Dear.

121
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,960
What? What's going on?

122
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,280
See? You never remembered
my father's teachings.

123
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,040
You were lazy
and never practiced the spell.

124
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,680
That's all you're capable of.

125
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,920
So it depends on the spell?

126
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,360
Drop the knife. You've lost.

127
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,800
Not yet!

128
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
If anyone comes closer,

129
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,040
I'll kill myself,
and the antidote dies with me.

130
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,160
Please, Kham, tell me the antidote.

131
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,200
My father has always been kind to you.

132
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,160
I'll tell you if you let me go.

133
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,320
You don't have the guts.

134
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,360
Please don't, Dear.

135
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,720
If Kham dies, so will my father.

136
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
Kamduang…

137
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,520
Your father doesn't have much time left.

138
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
The old man's almost dead?

139
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,320
Time's running out.

140
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,640
What'll it be? Will you let me go or not?

141
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,600
Fine. I'll let you go,

142
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,880
but only if you agree to my terms.

143
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,560
What terms?

144
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
You understand the terms, right?

145
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,320
There are five ingredients
in the antidote.

146
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll ride out
and name one ingredient at a time.

147
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,920
By the time I reach the red flag,
I'll have named all five.

148
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
Then I'll return
the Chakra of Divine Flame.

149
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,040
The red flag marks the range
where I won't miss.

150
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,560
If you cross it
without completing the terms,

151
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,840
I'll have no choice
but to shoot you in the head.

152
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,080
If you don't tell us the antidote,

153
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,440
I swear I will never forgive you.

154
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,000
Hurry up. I'm afraid Yod won't last.

155
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
Begin.

156
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Go.

157
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,440
Go.

158
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,640
First ingredient, Ground Lotus Pollen.

159
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,920
Ground Lotus Pollen.

160
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,240
Second, Black Elephant Root.

161
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,320
Black Elephant Root.

162
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,320
Third, Human-Shaped Ginseng.

163
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,240
Human-Shaped Ginseng.

164
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,720
Fourth.

165
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't shoot him!

166
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,480
I'll go after him.

167
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,480
Hey.

168
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,920
Give me the Chakra of Divine Flame.

169
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,840
I won't.

170
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,480
Fire!

171
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,920
Follow Nok Lek!

172
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,520
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

173
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Go!

174
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,200
Kham! Kham, don't die.

175
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,880
Kamduang…

176
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm not going to make it.

177
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,640
I chose the wrong path.

178
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,920
Teacher warned me, but I was a fool.

179
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,560
I thought I was smart.

180
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
I deserve this.

181
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,120
But Kham,

182
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,520
please tell me the last two ingredients.

183
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,080
Please don't let my father die.

184
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,960
Teacher was like a father to me…

185
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,720
Then do this one last thing for him.

186
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,480
Please, I'm begging you.

187
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Listen carefully…

188
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,600
I will.

189
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,360
If Teacher thought Khun Aek
was better than me…

190
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,160
then let Khun Aek save him.

191
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,160
Kham! Kham!

192
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,440
Kham! Kham! No!

193
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,520
Kham.

194
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,560
Kham.

195
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,360
Kham…

196
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,760
Dear,

197
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,720
why did you order the troops to shoot him?

198
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,160
I had no choice. He was trying to escape.

199
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,440
But I didn't get
the rest of the ingredients.

200
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,480
He was the only one
who could help my father.

201
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,200
I know.

202
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,920
If you knew,

203
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,680
why did you give the order?

204
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,760
You're heartless.

205
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,840
Cruel and merciless!

206
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Ping!

207
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,440
Give back
the Chakra of Divine Flame, Chief.

208
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,040
Keep dreaming, Ping.

209
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,200
I was your master.

210
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,160
You dare betray me?

211
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,760
You never saw me as your student.
You trained me like a dog,

212
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,560
a weapon to hurt others.

213
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,360
Give me the Chakra.

214
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,800
Never!

215
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,800
How is my father, Uncle Yoy?

216
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,520
He's still breathing,
but is weaker by the minute.

217
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,320
He doesn't have much time left.

218
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,240
We got three
of the five ingredients from Kham.

219
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,880
Can you guess the other two?

220
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,600
I can't.

221
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,240
There are hundreds of herbs
that might go with it.

222
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,400
If you hadn't ordered Kham's execution,

223
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,880
we'd know all the ingredients by now.

224
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,840
I accept responsibility.
But let's not argue now.

225
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,080
Saving Uncle Yod is what matters.

226
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,320
Actually,
even if Kham had told us everything,

227
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,800
we wouldn't be able to find them in time.

228
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,840
And the antidote
still takes time to prepare.

229
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,040
I have many herbs at my house.
Have you gone through them all?

230
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,440
Did anything work?

231
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,160
Khun Pra Chuay already brought them.
None are useful.

232
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,960
Think again.
There may be something we overlooked.

233
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,040
You're right.

234
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,320
I shouldn't waste my time
arguing with you.

235
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
I'll stay with my father

236
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,080
until…

237
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,400
And after that…

238
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,960
- I will--
- What?

239
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,160
You'll kill me?

240
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,880
Don't worry.

241
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,040
I take responsibility for my actions.

242
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,720
Dad…

243
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,560
You asked Sergeant Boonchai to summon me.
Do you need anything, Sir?

244
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
The Chakra of Divine Flame?

245
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,240
How did it end up here?

246
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,800
Ping defeated Nok Lek and retrieved it.

247
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,040
So this is the ultimate weapon?

248
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,480
Yes, Sir.

249
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,760
I saw Kham use it,

250
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,800
but it didn't seem that powerful.

251
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,520
Kham lacked the power.

252
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,920
If you'd seen Uncle Yod use it,

253
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
you'd be speechless.

254
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,720
Bandit Srichai is a powerful sorcerer.

255
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,080
If this Chakra ends up in his hands,

256
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
it will become truly devastating.

257
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,880
You did well, Ping, recovering the Chakra.

258
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,320
If Nok Lek hadn't been wounded,

259
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,480
I might not have won, Sir.

260
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,800
Is there anyone else
who can wield this Chakra?

261
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,560
Only Uncle Yod, Sir.
But he's in a critical condition.

262
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,880
If he recovers, we'll return it to him.

263
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,360
But if he dies…

264
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,480
I wish to destroy it.

265
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,520
Very well. Agreed.

266
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,840
Until Yod's fate is clear, guard it well.

267
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,440
Keep this hidden.

268
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes, Sir.

269
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,120
Both Shaman Dum and Nok Lek are dead.

270
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,120
And we have the Chakra of Divine Flame.
I believe Bandit Srichai

271
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,320
will likely retreat
for a while to regroup,

272
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,440
or perhaps even abandon his plan
to attack Thung Yai City.

273
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,520
Even if they do come,

274
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,160
we've got enough Western guns
to deal with them.

275
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,080
Maybe we should use this chance
to wipe them out completely?

276
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,360
You might want to consult
the other ministers first, Sir.

277
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,400
Also,

278
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,040
I think you should take this opportunity

279
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,200
to strengthen our military.

280
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,360
Where do you think we should start?

281
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,360
You might ask Khun Pra Yong

282
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
or even my father, Sir.

283
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,400
Khun Aek, why do you--

284
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
There's something important
I must take care of.

285
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,080
I would like to take this chance

286
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,400
to bid you farewell.

287
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,400
Farewell.

288
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Khun Aek…

289
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Why didn't you wait
until morning to leave?

290
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,640
I hate the people here. I hate this city.

291
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,200
I want to leave as soon as I can.

292
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,040
Your father already issued the gate pass.

293
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,320
I'm truly sorry for what happened.

294
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,520
I really am, Kamduang.

295
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,960
I want you to remember one thing.

296
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,920
You killed my father.

297
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,760
I won't forget

298
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,800
that I killed your father,

299
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,120
nor will I forget
the way you're looking at me now.

300
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
I'll carry it with me
for the rest of my life.

301
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,240
<i>Dearest Father,</i>

302
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,880
<i>What I'm about to do…</i>

303
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,880
<i>I have already thought it through…</i>

304
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,880
I HAVE ALREADY THOUGHT IT THROUGH

305
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
- Ping…
- Kamduang…

306
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,640
What happened?

307
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,760
My father has passed.

308
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,240
Uncle Yoy and I are taking him home.

309
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I'm sorry to hear that, Kamduang.

310
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,440
What about Khun Aek?

311
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,320
Why do you ask?

312
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,280
I was sent by Khun Pra Saming
to check on him.

313
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,680
He has a bad feeling

314
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,440
that Khun Aek might be planning something.

315
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,000
Maybe even to take his own life
out of guilt over you.

316
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,080
Why would Khun Pra Saming think that?

317
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,960
He said it was the way Khun Aek spoke.

318
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,920
I think it's possible, Kamduang.

319
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,280
He feels guilty
for ordering Kham's execution.

320
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,200
Because of that,
we never learned the full antidote.

321
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,920
Do you know
what your father's final words were?

322
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
Yoy…

323
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,240
If you ever get the chance, kill Kham.

324
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,560
Someone like him…

325
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
if he escapes,

326
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,040
he'll sell the Chakra of Divine Flame
to that Bandit Srichai.

327
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,680
And when that happens, Thung Yai City

328
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,200
will be destroyed

329
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,800
because of the Chakra of Divine Flame.

330
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,400
Kill Kham.

331
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,680
Kill Kham.

332
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,400
I believe Khun Aek

333
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,600
made the same decision
your father would have.

334
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,440
I bid farewell to the sacred forces

335
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,960
that have protected Thung Yai City
since our ancestors' time.

336
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,040
Please…

337
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,480
keep this city safe.

338
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,360
Khun Aek!

339
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,520
Why did you come back?

340
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,280
To make sure I'd take responsibility
for Uncle Yod's death, right?

341
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,560
What are you planning to do?

342
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,880
Even if you die,
my father won't come back.

343
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
I don't want you to die for nothing.

344
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,560
Don't repay his life with your own.

345
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,960
Use it to protect this city instead.

346
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,840
You misunderstood me, Kamduang.

347
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,159
I never intended to take my own life.

348
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,000
DEAREST FATHER, WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO,

349
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,840
I'VE THOUGHT IT THROUGH.
IF I DIE, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

350
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,800
PLEASE LET ME BE YOUR SON
AGAIN IN THE NEXT LIFE.

351
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,080
Then what about this letter?

352
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,159
I'm going to spy
on Bandit Srichai's on my own.

353
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,920
This letter was for my father,
in case I lose to him

354
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,360
and don't return.

355
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,000
Are you sure
you're not taking your own life?

356
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,040
Why? Are you that worried about me?

357
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,440
Well, I…

358
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,920
Are you worried about me…
or do you love me?

359
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,960
It's the same thing.

360
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,000
Good.

361
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,760
That means we feel the same way.

362
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,720
What's going on?

363
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,840
Something terrible
has happened at the city office.

364
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,320
- Kamduang! Kamduang!
- What is it, Uncle Yoy?

365
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Khun Pra Saming, what happened?

366
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,360
Ugh… help me.

367
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,440
Help me.

368
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,880
- Help me.
- Khun Pra Mek?

369
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,560
Help me.

370
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,160
What's going on?
How did you escape from prison?

371
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,240
Not so tough now.

372
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,000
Let's go.

373
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,880
I apologize,

374
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,000
Khun Pra Saming.

375
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,600
I failed.

376
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,040
I couldn't protect
the Chakra of Divine Flame.

377
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,200
It's alright, Sergeant.

378
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,480
It's not your fault.

379
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,920
I underestimated them.

380
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,880
Cowards like that
are hard to guard against.

381
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,560
You've ordered the arrest
of those two, haven't you?

382
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,480
Yes.

383
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,720
I've also ordered the gates sealed

384
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
under all circumstances.

385
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,640
But they're high-ranking nobles.

386
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,040
They know all the exits.

387
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,760
They've likely escaped already.

388
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,840
That means we're now at a disadvantage.

389
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,880
I agree.

390
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,880
They're probably heading to trade
the Chakra of Divine Flame to Srichai.

391
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,440
Then what should we do, Khun Aek?

392
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,560
‪S

393
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,720
If I'm not mistaken,

394
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,880
you've changed your mind
about raiding Thung Yai City?

395
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,520
Srichai's name is feared

396
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,120
for brutality and recklessness.
Why retreat so soon?

397
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,280
You backed off…

398
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,120
because of this, didn't you?

399
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,880
The Chakra of Divine Flame…

400
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,160
That Bandit Srichai shot a letter
tied to an arrow into the city.

401
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,840
<i>To the Governor of Thung Yai City,</i>

402
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,360
<i>I, Bandit Srichai, will attack your city.</i>

403
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,280
<i>If you surrender,</i>
<i>lay down your arms and open the gates,</i>

404
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,720
<i>I will plunder only half</i>

405
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,720
<i>and kill no one.</i>

406
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,360
<i>But if you resist,</i>

407
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,520
<i>I will burn the city</i>
<i>and slaughter all within.</i>

408
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,280
That scoundrel!

409
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,880
We won't let him dictate terms.

410
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,240
I won't yield.

411
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,680
We have Western guns.
Even with the Chakra of Divine Flame,

412
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,440
it doesn't mean we can't fight.

413
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Good.

414
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,440
Everyone agrees. We'll fight him.

415
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,760
And this letter is not useless.

416
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,720
It will serve as proof
when I seek aid from other provinces.

417
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,720
By now, the bandits
may have already surrounded us.

418
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,600
I'll send Ping.

419
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,400
They won't let anyone slip out easily.

420
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,800
I believe Ping can.

421
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,600
Message from Acting Governor
Khun Pra Saming of Thung Yai.

422
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,480
"People of Thung Yai, hear this."

423
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,600
"Bandit Srichai
has brought his forces to our gates."

424
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,320
"I and the soldiers
will fight to the last."

425
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,000
"But I cannot promise victory."

426
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,440
"So, people of Thung Yai City,
you can choose."

427
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,640
"If you will fight, meet us at the gate."

428
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,280
"If you will flee, do it now."

429
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,280
Who will stay
and fight for Thung Yai City?

430
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,080
- I will.
- Me too.

431
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,480
Let's run.

432
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,960
- We'll fight!
- We'll fight!

433
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,800
Yeesoon, you can't run off like this.

434
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,800
Why are you carrying so much?

435
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,480
And dressed like that, if bandits see you,
do you think they'll spare you?

436
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,960
Then what should I do, Mother?

437
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,800
Who are you?

438
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,840
A message from Acting Governor
Khun Pra Saming of Thung Yai City,

439
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,800
for the Governor of Chanthaburi.

440
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,360
THUNG YAI CITY

441
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,960
It's urgent.
Bandit Srichai is about to raid the city.

442
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,360
We need reinforcements from Chanthaburi

443
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,320
to help.

444
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Would you see the Governor yourself?

445
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,320
No. I must return to fight.

446
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,320
I'll deliver this at once.

447
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,800
Ping?

448
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,280
Mr. Chadwick…

449
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,120
I heard you say

450
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,600
Thung Yai City is in danger?

451
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,200
Yes.

452
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,560
You are the brave soldiers
of Thung Yai City.

453
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,120
You have more honor than forest bandits.
Are you afraid?

454
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,600
No!

455
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,640
If they breach the city,

456
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,800
they'll kill your parents,

457
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,280
violate your wives and daughters.

458
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,160
Will you allow that?

459
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,840
Never!

460
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,960
Then,

461
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,600
protect our land with your lives.

462
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,080
Fight to the death!

463
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,000
Fight to the death!

464
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,320
Fight to the death!

465
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,640
Hurry up.

466
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,720
Why so slow?

467
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,040
You're so slow.

468
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,840
Watch where you're going, you crazy hag!

469
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,600
Juan!

470
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,440
Don't call me that. Do I even know you?

471
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,760
It's me, Yeesoon.

472
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,880
Ha! My lady is as beautiful as an angel.

473
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,160
Not a filthy beggar like you.

474
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,000
- Get out of my way.
- You ungrateful wretch, Juan!

475
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,400
- Get out of my way.
- Let's go.

476
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,520
- Let's go.
- Look at you, disgusting.

477
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,080
Come on, Yim.

478
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,080
You're too slow. Hurry.

479
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,280
Ping.

480
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,400
Ping.

481
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,000
Are you alright?

482
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,520
I've delivered the message to Chanthaburi.

483
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,440
Khun Aek, I saw Mr. Chadwick.

484
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,200
He said he'll send weapons to aid us.

485
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,760
Thank you, Ping. Go and rest now.

486
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,800
- Ping! Ping!
- She might be so tired she fainted.

487
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,440
Bring a stretcher!

488
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,760
Yes, Sir.

489
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,320
Take her inside,
and fetch the royal doctor.

490
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,360
Yes, Sir.

491
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,240
We'll have both reinforcements
and Mr. Chadwick's weapons.

492
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,880
But I don't know
if they'll arrive in time.

493
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,640
If we fight with all we have,

494
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,760
they should make it in time.

495
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,360
Then so be it. Khun Pra Chuay,

496
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,200
you must stay alive
and die after me and Khun Aek.

497
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,040
If the reinforcements from Chanthaburi
arrive, someone must command.

498
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,120
You are Governor. I'm only a minister.
I should die first.

499
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,960
That's an order.

500
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,840
Yes, Sir.

501
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,800
I will die with you.

502
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,120
Kamduang! Kamduang!

503
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,680
What is it, Uncle Yoy?

504
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,240
Your father's awake.

505
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,200
Then I'll head to the city hall first.

506
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,760
Yes.

507
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,120
- Let's go, Uncle Yoy.
- Let's go.

508
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,160
Dad! Dad!

509
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,760
- Dad…
- Kamduang…

510
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,040
You really woke up.

511
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,400
Uncle Yoy, what did you do?
How did he wake up?

512
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,280
The antidote Ping stole from Nok Lek

513
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
was a hot medicine.

514
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,120
The one I had was cooling,

515
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,760
which doesn't work for the poison.
So I tried Nok Lek's medicine on him.

516
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,320
At first, he stopped breathing.

517
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,960
But when the medicine kicked in,
he came back.

518
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,160
You're amazing, Uncle Yoy.
You're the best.

519
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,040
Kamduang, Yoy told me everything.

520
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,000
You were very angry at Khun Aek.

521
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,720
But listen,

522
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,280
to be a caravan chief,
it's not just about leading buffalo

523
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,440
or magic. The most important thing

524
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,360
is composure.

525
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,400
I understand now.

526
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,200
I must've been so upset about you
that I lost all rational thought.

527
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,520
That's why I made such bad decisions.

528
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,920
Once you realize your mistakes,

529
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,920
fix them.

530
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,760
Yes, Dad.

531
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,160
I'm glad Uncle Yod is safe.

532
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,080
He was truly protected.

533
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,000
Uncle Yoy's now taking him
to rest at your house.

534
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,000
I hope you don't mind.

535
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,840
It would be better
if you took them both out of the city.

536
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,640
Dad and Uncle Yoy insist on staying.

537
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,800
He regrets
not being strong enough to help you,

538
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,760
so he sent me to support you instead.

539
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,040
I'm sorry, Dear.

540
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,760
Sorry for what?

541
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,760
For saying all those harsh things.

542
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,720
If I had just thought more clearly,

543
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,960
I would've realized you were right.

544
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,040
I've always admired you
for being a devoted,

545
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,080
selfless official.

546
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,680
But it's easier said than done.

547
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,160
When I had to make a sacrifice,

548
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,720
I just couldn't.

549
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,920
I don't blame you.

550
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,280
Everyone loves their father.

551
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,080
But duty

552
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,720
must always come before personal matters.

553
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,120
What are you doing? Someone might see us.

554
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,080
I'm just happy

555
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,000
you understand me now…

556
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,360
and your words mean a lot to me.

557
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,280
I'll fight alongside you

558
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,600
to protect this land.

559
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,400
Alright.

560
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,000
I have a very important task for you.

561
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,920
Just tell me, Dear.

562
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,200
Where is Kamduang?

563
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,720
I sent her to get weapons
from Mr. Chadwick

564
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,200
to fight against Bandit Srichai.

565
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,840
I doubt she'll make it back in time.

566
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,840
That's what I'm hoping for.

567
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,120
So it was a trick?

568
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,280
You lied to her?

569
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,640
I didn't want Kamduang to die with me.

570
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,760
If she finds out,

571
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,520
she'll be furious.

572
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,280
<i>I'm sorry, Kamduang.</i>

573
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,800
Mr. Chadwick!

574
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,000
Hi, Kamduang.

575
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,680
Khun Aek sent me
to get the weapons from you.

576
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,640
- What's that?
- A kind of gun.

577
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,280
I've never seen a gun like this before.

578
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,360
Khun Aek said that
Bandit Srichai will attack at dusk.

579
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,120
I have to bring the gun
in time to help him.

580
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,360
My brothers!

581
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,640
It's time we storm the city of Thung Yai.

582
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,760
Let's make it a glorious battle!

583
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:19,400
Yeah!

584
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,920
I'll send the Chakra
of Divine Flame in first.

585
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,520
You all

586
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,080
wait for my signal to attack.

587
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,960
Split up,

588
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,080
open the gate
and burn the place to the ground.

589
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,920
As for me,

590
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,480
I'll handle Khun Aek
and Khun Pra Saming myself.

591
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,280
Yes, Sir!

592
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,200
Yeah!

593
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,040
Yeah!

594
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,280
Go!

595
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Go!

596
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,320
The Chakra of Divine Flame.

597
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,200
Srichai's gang must've attacked already.

598
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,960
I don't think we'll make it in time.

599
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,160
But he said they'd attack at dusk.

600
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,040
He lied to me again…

601
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,200
It's so fast. There's nothing we can do?

602
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,880
All we can do
is try to shoot it down, Sir.

603
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,880
Then do it.

604
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,680
We're all gonna die if we don't hurry!

605
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,760
Hurry up or we'll all die!

606
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,040
You stole Khun Aek's buffalo?

607
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,080
Leave Yim with me,
and I won't turn you in.

608
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,680
Okay, okay.

609
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,320
Chadwick, I think I've found
a faster way to get to the city.

610
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,600
What way?

611
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,960
Watch out!

612
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,240
Protect Khun Pra Saming!

613
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,720
Yes, Sir!

614
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,640
Open the gate! We're here to help!

615
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,440
Open up!

616
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,400
Let's go!

617
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,160
Khun Pra Saming, sir!

618
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,680
We've brought help from the villagers.

619
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,360
Uncle Yod sent this for you.

620
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,680
It's Bandit Srichai's
Seven-Metal Sacred Sword.

621
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,000
He also said this blade

622
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,760
can counter the Chakra of Divine Flame.

623
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,920
Yes, sir.

624
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,640
It's your time to die, Khun Pra Saming.

625
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,360
I will step down.

626
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,000
I hereby pass the title of Governor

627
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,920
to Khun Pra Saming.

628
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,440
<i>I take this opportunity</i>

629
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,160
<i>to appoint new nobles</i>
<i>who will help develop our city.</i>

630
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,200
I object to Khun Aek's promotion.

631
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,040
You lied about being married

632
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,600
to Kamduang

633
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,560
when in fact you're not together at all.

634
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,000
This is a serious matter.

635
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,520
<i>I will interrogate you tomorrow</i>
<i>and judge the case accordingly.</i>

636
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,080
With clear testimony and evidence,
the verdict is…

637
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,240
