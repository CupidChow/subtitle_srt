1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,080
Let's end our relationship.

2
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,600
And you gave in too easily.

3
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
If I'd been there,
I wouldn't have let it happen.

4
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,320
So what now?

5
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,240
<i>If you want things to go back</i>
<i>to how they were,</i>

6
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,560
you must return to your former position.

7
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,400
I can't do that.

8
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,520
Before signing,

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,960
<i>I'd like to test the gun's performance.</i>

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
Kill them!

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,520
About Khun Aek and you…

12
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,080
don't be anxious. Just wait a bit.

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
When I'm gone, you can come in.

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,440
That woman Kamduang also mocked me,

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
telling me to become his mistress

16
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,440
because my fate
is only fit to be a mistress.

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,320
<i>I want you to make them</i>
<i>fall in love with each other.</i>

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
Why are you in such a good mood today

19
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,760
to bring me to the market?

20
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,400
In a few days,
you'll be heading back home.

21
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,040
I thought
I'd buy some gifts for your family.

22
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,280
No need, my dear.

23
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,320
I've already prepared

24
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
everything they might need.

25
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm not talking about necessities.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to give something
that will make your family happy.

27
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
<i>Make them fall in love with each other,</i>

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,120
<i>so she becomes a shameless harlot,</i>

29
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,000
throwing herself at any man in the market,

30
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,640
<i>living the rest of her life in disgrace.</i>

31
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,280
Aiya…

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,000
You're the one!

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,200
My most charming man!

34
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Even if the Earth ends

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,480
or the sky falls, my love

36
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,320
will never fade.

37
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,120
As long as I live under this sky,

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,200
I wish to meet you and never be apart.

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,480
Reciting Sunthorn Phu's poetry
in the middle of the market?

40
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
My love.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Kamduang.

42
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,240
Dear, I think I've been cursed.

43
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
What did you just say?

44
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,360
My love.

45
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,280
Don't come closer,
or you'll get my buffalo-throwing punch!

46
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
- My love.
- Stop!

47
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,120
I am Khun Aek Itthirit.

48
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,120
Itthirit what? Get out of my way.

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
My love,

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,160
be my wife.

51
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
No!

52
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Aiya.

53
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,760
Wait for me.

54
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,600
Wait for me.

55
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
My wife.

56
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,920
My most charming man.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,840
My love.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
Buffalo-throwing punch!

59
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,600
Kamduang!

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
Oh.

61
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry. I know you were cursed,

62
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,720
but I had no choice.

63
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
Hey!

64
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,400
Be my wife.

65
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
Lucky for me…

66
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,480
But unlucky for me!

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Where are you going? Be my wife!

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
My wife!

69
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,880
My wife!

70
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
My wife, wait for me.

71
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
Heng! What are you doing here?

72
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,520
- Wait for me.
- Where is it?

73
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,960
- You can't come in!
- Why not?

74
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,080
I want to see my wife.

75
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,360
- Go home!
- I want to see my wife!

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,200
- There's no wife for you here.
- Get out!

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,080
- Whoa!
- My wife!

78
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
My wife!

79
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,840
I want you to be my husband…

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,120
- My husband…
- I'm here.

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,200
Stop! Kamduang!

82
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,800
Kamduang.

83
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,560
My wife.

84
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,560
My husband.

85
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,840
Kamduang.

86
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,680
Stop.

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,680
Kamduang.

88
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Dear.

89
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,240
Get me my bag.

90
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,240
Hold him!

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
Kamduang.

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,440
My husband.

93
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,720
- Kamduang.
- Get out.

94
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Kamduang.

95
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,520
Oh my goodness!

96
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
‪Ew!

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,800
My wife!

98
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,640
Kamduang,

99
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,160
your spirit's strong, huh?

100
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,960
Khiew, help me.

101
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,280
Where are you?

102
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,240
Does she have something sacred?

103
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,760
What happened to me, sir?

104
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,520
Why can't I remember anything?

105
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
It's nothing, Yip. Heng had a seizure.

106
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
You tried to help him, but got caught
in the commotion and fainted.

107
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,240
Yes, Sir.

108
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,320
Aiya… where am I?

109
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,080
How did I get here?

110
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,080
You had a seizure
and lost control of yourself.

111
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,600
My husband and I
brought you here for treatment.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,280
Now that you're better.
Go back to your stall.

113
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,680
Your customers are waiting.

114
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,800
Alright.

115
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
Thank you.

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,560
Thank you, sir.

117
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
You said someone cast black magic on you?

118
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,840
Yes.

119
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,960
How did you break it?

120
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,400
My father gave me a protective charm

121
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
and taught me how to use it.

122
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
So you know magic?

123
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,200
You practice black magic?

124
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,640
Magic is just knowledge.

125
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,800
But if it's used to harm others,
that's black magic.

126
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,720
I only know enough to protect myself.

127
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,760
A buffalo trader must know these things.

128
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
Then who would want to harm you?

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,640
And why?

130
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,960
I don't know.

131
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,560
But I do know
that the black magic cast on me

132
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,840
is rebounding on its caster.

133
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,360
It won't be hard to find clues.

134
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,720
- Sergeant Boonchai.
- Yes, Sir?

135
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,720
Are there any sorcerers in our city?

136
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
A few, Sir.

137
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,360
Why?

138
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Find out for me

139
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,960
if any of them are acting strangely,
like they've been cursed themselves.

140
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,800
Yes, Sir.

141
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,520
Khun Aek.

142
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,240
Have you decided
on the location for the gun test?

143
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,120
Yes, Sir.

144
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
An abandoned temple,
200 <i>sen</i> north of the city.

145
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,680
Good. I'll inform Father.

146
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
And Mr. Chadwick?

147
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,480
I've told him

148
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,360
this is top secret.
He must not tell anyone,

149
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,920
not even his wife.

150
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,040
If the foreign gun test goes well,

151
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,320
in the end,

152
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800
we'll gain nothing.

153
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,320
It's worse than that. Khun Aek

154
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,240
will earn merit

155
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,080
and rise in rank faster than I will.

156
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,360
No need to panic,

157
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,040
Khun Pra Mek, Khun Men.

158
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,520
I come as a friend.

159
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,880
And what do you want?

160
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,760
To propose a deal.

161
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,840
You look more
like a bandit than a merchant.

162
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,600
My name is Nok Lek.

163
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,920
I have guns to sell you.

164
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,160
And who are you

165
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,840
to be selling us guns?

166
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
I'm a pirate.

167
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
The guns I'm selling are plundered goods.

168
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,160
Pirate Nok Lek,

169
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,400
you dare set foot in a noble's house?

170
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
I dare

171
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,080
because I bring profit to you.

172
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,640
Then tell us.

173
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,920
My guns
cost far less than the foreign ones.

174
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,080
If you buy from me
and resell to Thung Yai City,

175
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,240
you'll profit far more
than by dealing with the foreigners.

176
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,600
And I came because I know
you're the sort who can talk business.

177
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,560
But the big problem is,

178
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Khun Pra Saming

179
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,840
will buy foreign guns in a few days.

180
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,640
If I told you I can stop that purchase,

181
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,680
what would you say?

182
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,280
Khun Aek has set the time
and place for the gun test, Father.

183
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Where?

184
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,760
An abandoned temple north of the city,

185
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,480
200 <i>sen</i> away.

186
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,440
An abandoned temple, north of the city,

187
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,880
200 <i>sen</i> away?

188
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,480
I checked many places.

189
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,320
Only Shaman Chan's acting strangely.

190
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,040
Help me, sir.

191
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,520
I don't want to be like this,
but I can't control myself!

192
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,880
Should we take him to the temple?

193
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,120
The monk might break the curse.

194
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
But you have to tell me

195
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,000
what happened first.

196
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,600
Then I'll help you.

197
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,440
Someone hired me
to curse a woman named Kamduang.

198
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,960
But she's strong.

199
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,560
She broke my spell.

200
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,120
It rebounded on me instead.

201
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Who hired you?

202
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,600
A woman named Yeesoon.

203
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,920
Me? Do such vile, filthy things?

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,760
Just thinking of it makes my skin crawl.

205
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,920
So you deny it?

206
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,560
Yes. Even if you threw me
in a rattan ball for an elephant to kick,

207
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,080
I'd still deny it, because I didn't do it.

208
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,280
Sergeant Boonchai, bring him in.

209
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,080
Say it again.

210
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Who hired you

211
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
to curse Kamduang?

212
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,600
Her name is Yeesoon.

213
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,360
Liar!

214
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
How dare you slander my daughter!

215
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,640
Is this her?

216
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,880
My name's Daoruang. I need your help.

217
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't lie.

218
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,640
My name is Yeesoon.

219
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,120
Tell the truth.

220
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,040
I'm not sure.

221
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
She was dressed like an ordinary villager,

222
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,040
face covered.

223
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,480
I didn't get a good look.

224
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
Then how did you know her name?

225
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
She first told me it was Daoruang.

226
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,280
I asked for her real name,

227
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,280
and she said Yeesoon.

228
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,840
So how did you know she lied?

229
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,119
Women who come to me
rarely give their real names.

230
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,560
If I press them,
they get startled and blurt it out.

231
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,000
And you believe a man like this?

232
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,240
What if someone used my daughter's name?

233
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,520
Actually,
I didn't think Yeesoon would do it.

234
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,760
But I had to test her sincerity,

235
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,240
so no one can accuse you later.

236
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
You're cruel.

237
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,240
Do you know how terrified I've been?

238
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,960
There, there, my dear.

240
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,800
I think someone must be framing Yeesoon.

241
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,080
Believe me, I can vouch for her.

242
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
She isn't that cruel or heartless.

243
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,720
If you insist,

244
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,120
then I have no objection.

245
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,040
You're not angry at Yeesoon, are you?

246
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,680
I'm not.

247
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,720
Are you angry at me?

248
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,360
I'm not angry at all.

249
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
If this is "not angry,"

250
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,800
how bad would it be if you were?

251
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Are you trying to kill me?

252
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Lady Yeesoon,
there's a woman here to see you.

253
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,720
Let her in.

254
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,800
Kamduang.

255
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,960
What brings you here, Kamduang?

256
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,320
I came to tell Yeesoon

257
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,200
that I know
who hired that shaman to curse me.

258
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,160
And why are you telling me?
What does it have to do with me?

259
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,280
I don't want to make enemies.

260
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,840
And I don't want you to make one of me.

261
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
And if I did want to be your enemy?

262
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,120
You'd know the reason, wouldn't you?

263
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,000
If it's about Khun Aek, rest assured.

264
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
I won't be here for much longer.

265
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,560
Why? Planning to die soon or something?

266
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,040
I can't say yet,

267
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,720
but it won't be long.

268
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,760
I'll be gone from here.

269
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Fine. If you keep your word.

270
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,960
Then I'll take my leave.

271
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,200
How could he believe Yeesoon's words?
She's a snake through and through.

272
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,160
They say love makes people blind.

273
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,760
Huh.

274
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,600
And what about you?

275
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,800
What about me?

276
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,080
You love Khun Aek, don't you?

277
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
People who work together
need to stay close, that's all.

278
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,640
It's not about love.

279
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Besides, he's a nobleman

280
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,320
and I'm just a buffalo caravan leader.

281
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
In a few days, we'll go our separate ways.

282
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,920
Who knows
if we'll meet again in this life?

283
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,800
Why think about him?

284
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,880
Let him marry Yeesoon if he wants.

285
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,600
I hope it's as you say.

286
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,400
Have the guns arrived safely?

287
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,440
You knew?

288
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not hard to guess.

289
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,880
I always know what you're up to.

290
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,880
I won't be home tonight.

291
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
I have to guard the guns.

292
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,120
The test is tomorrow,
and I don't want any mistakes.

293
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
Where will the test be?

294
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,560
Not at the city hall?

295
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,960
No.

296
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,320
This is still secret.
Too many people can't know.

297
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,360
Wouldn't it be safer in public?

298
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,040
No.

299
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,960
Remember how I was framed?

300
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,600
Even being careful, they still set me up.

301
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,920
Yes,
but what does that have to do with this?

302
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,960
It means someone
wants to sabotage this gun purchase.

303
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,080
If they knew the test location,

304
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,440
they'd do everything to ruin it.

305
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,960
So the gun test

306
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,840
has to be done
in the most secret place possible.

307
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,320
Then I'll come with you.

308
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
No.

309
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,280
If danger comes,
you'd be risking your life with mine.

310
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,800
But I'm ready to take that risk.

311
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,320
You know I can fight.

312
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,240
I might be able to help.

313
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,880
Besides, if something happened to you,

314
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,240
who would I collect my wages
and the golden ginseng from?

315
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,160
I know you miss home

316
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,240
and want to go back.

317
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,880
Thanks for your good intention,

318
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,960
but don't follow me.

319
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,080
I knew it was you.

320
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,520
You disobeyed me, didn't you?

321
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,480
- You…
- I'm as stubborn as a buffalo, right?

322
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm not offended.

323
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,200
I've been a buffalo trader all my life,

324
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
so I must have picked up
some buffalo habits.

325
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,320
Ah.

326
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Ah.

327
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,520
How was the journey?

328
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
All went smoothly, Sir.

329
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,680
Tomorrow, once the contract is signed,

330
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,920
we'll go our separate ways.

331
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,160
Will you miss me?

332
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,160
Perhaps a little.

333
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,560
You're unlike any woman I've ever met.

334
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,480
What's the instrument

335
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,720
Mr. Chadwick is playing?

336
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,920
A violin.

337
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,760
It's a bowed instrument,
not so different from the saw you play.

338
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,240
A Western saw,
yet it can play a Thai song.

339
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,760
Mr. Chadwick must have heard it
in Phra Nakhon.

340
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,560
Do you like it?

341
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,560
I do.

342
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,000
Tonight, assign guard shifts
so you take turns resting.

343
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,920
Yes, Sir.

344
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
There's nothing…

345
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,680
Maybe I imagined it.

346
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,160
What kind of fighting style is this?

347
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,480
<i>Do you have any</i> man-ho-hiao?

348
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
It's out of stock.

349
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,480
Give mine to Ping first.

350
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,840
Thank you again.

351
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,240
HOK AN MEDICINE

352
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,960
Why give it away?
Your father needs it too.

353
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,960
It's fine. We'll find more later.

354
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,960
She's in need now. I can see it.

355
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,440
Kamduang.

356
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,600
Who stood guard last night?

357
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,680
What's wrong, Khun Aek?

358
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,680
The Governor has arrived, Sir.

359
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,720
The gun test is ready, Sir.

360
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,880
If you're ready,

361
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,120
begin.

362
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,440
Yes, Sir.

363
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,120
Load!

364
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,360
- Ready.
- Ready!

365
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
Steady…

366
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,199
Fire!

367
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,320
Hey?

368
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,640
Governor?

369
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,400
Ugh.

370
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,760
Dear.

371
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,160
THUNG YAI CITY GOVERNOR'S HOUSE

372
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,440
How is my father?

373
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,520
Serious, Sir.

374
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,000
But I've removed the metal
from his forehead

375
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,200
and treated the wound.

376
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,080
Saming…

377
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,160
If I die,

378
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,720
you must take care of this city.

379
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,560
You're still here, Father.

380
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,320
Keep the Governor's ring.

381
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,160
For now, I'll serve
as acting ruler in your place.

382
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,600
Chadwick! Chadwick!

383
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,160
- Khun Aek, help!
- Chadwick.

384
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,040
Khun Aek.

385
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,160
Khun Pra Saming summons you.

386
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,080
THRIVING AND PROSPEROUS BUSINESS

387
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,800
You did well.

388
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,600
But why didn't you kill Kamduang?

389
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,960
I slammed her into a tree.

390
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,840
I thought her neck was broken.

391
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,320
Is that the truth?

392
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,400
It is, Chief.

393
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,560
You were careless!

394
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,360
I'm sorry, Chief.

395
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,520
Don't fail again.

396
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,560
You know what will happen

397
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,280
to your mother if you do.

398
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
I was wrong, Chief.

399
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,120
Please don't harm my mother.

400
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,040
That depends on you.

401
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,760
Do your job well,

402
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,520
and she'll be safe.

403
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,360
Here, the antidote for this month.

404
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,600
Thank you, Chief.

405
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,600
Thank you.

406
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,440
The medicine's here, Mother.

407
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,480
Just a moment.

408
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,560
- Ping…
- Yes.

409
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,240
It hurts.

410
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,320
Ping…

411
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,720
Here, take the medicine, Mother.

412
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Here it is.

413
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,520
Did Nok Lek hurt you again?

414
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,040
No, Mother. I did well. He said nothing.

415
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,720
Lie down, Mother.

416
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,200
You can't enter.

417
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,360
Move. I must see my husband.

418
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,280
I said you can't.

419
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,840
Stay back, or I'll strike.

420
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,640
Stop, Kamduang.

421
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,800
Father.

422
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,640
Where is Khun Aek? Is he hurt?

423
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,280
He's uninjured,

424
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,840
but he's being interrogated inside.

425
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,120
I thought something happened to him…

426
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,440
But wasn't certain.

427
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,080
He survived that incident,

428
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,040
but may die later.

429
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,960
Khun Aek, you said

430
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,680
you'd tested the guns yourself
earlier, correct?

431
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
Yes, Sir.

432
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,280
Then why did this morning's test

433
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,440
go so disastrously?

434
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,240
The soldiers testing your guns

435
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,800
are all gravely injured.

436
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,640
The Governor,

437
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,800
worst of all,

438
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,360
had shrapnel lodged in his forehead.

439
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,800
Normally, at such a private gun test,

440
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,280
the Governor

441
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,240
would never attend.

442
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,120
But he trusted you, Khun Aek.

443
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,120
And you repaid him like this?

444
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,440
I never meant it.

445
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,560
I believe you didn't mean it,

446
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,760
but you were careless.

447
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,760
Whether for commission money

448
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,440
or fame, I don't know,

449
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,800
but you

450
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,520
rushed the test,
and that caused the failure.

451
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,200
- I never wanted money or fame--
- Regardless…

452
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,240
You endangered the Governor's life.

453
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,640
The shrapnel in his forehead

454
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,640
was all because of your greed.

455
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,600
- I told you--
- Don't make excuses.

456
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,480
Five rifles, all exploding,

457
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,920
how is that possible?

458
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,120
You didn't test them beforehand, did you?

459
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,280
- I did.
- You lie!

460
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,640
The Governor appointed you
to procure guns,

461
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,280
and you brought
worthless junk to sell him.

462
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,400
Despicable!

463
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,280
How will you take responsibility?

464
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,520
Even your death…

465
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,960
- wouldn't be enough.
- Enough!

466
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,960
Khun Aek,

467
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,360
you must take responsibility.

468
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,640
- Pra Yong.
- Yes, Sir.

469
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,160
The medical fees and compensation
for the injured soldiers,

470
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,720
take it from Khun Aek.

471
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,960
Yes, Sir.

472
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,480
Strip him
of all dealings in the arms trade,

473
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,600
no more profit or involvement.

474
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,840
Yes, Sir.

475
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,080
For injuring the Governor,

476
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,360
three years' imprisonment.

477
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,920
Yes, Sir.

478
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,720
Question Mr. Chadwick

479
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,360
about the commission and gun quality.

480
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,240
Yes, Sir.

481
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,320
I'm really disappointed in you.

482
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,720
I'll visit you in jail,

483
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,080
because I truly love and care for you.

484
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,360
Things are getting
far too messy now, Kamduang.

485
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,160
I say we head home at once.

486
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,880
Go pack your things.
We're leaving right now.

487
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,520
I can't go.

488
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,560
Your behavior

489
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,160
is very suspicious.

490
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,080
You're worried about Khun Aek, aren't you?

491
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,920
We've worked together.

492
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,800
It's only natural to be concerned for him.

493
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,360
Really?

494
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,040
Concerned, or jealous of him and Yeesoon?

495
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,280
Why would I be jealous?

496
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,920
Because you love Khun Aek.

497
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,840
Don't lie to me.

498
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,080
I'm good at reading people's eyes.

499
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,200
Eyes don't lie.

500
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,400
Hey.

501
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,840
You love Khun Aek, don't you?

502
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,120
Answer me.

503
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,160
- Uh…
- Answer.

504
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,120
Hey, a mosquito's biting your eye.

505
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,040
Ouch! My eye!

506
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,480
Whoa.

507
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,200
I saw a mosquito bite you.

509
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,760
So are you staying or leaving?

510
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,360
I can't leave yet.

511
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,120
I haven't been paid.

512
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,440
And most importantly,

513
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,600
I have to take the golden ginseng
to treat my father.

514
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,160
If you stay, you might die.

515
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,080
But if you run now, there's still time.

516
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,320
Madam!

517
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,160
Madam!

518
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,040
Khun Aek has returned.

519
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,560
Dear. Dear.

520
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,360
Kamduang.

521
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,520
Are you alright?

522
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,120
Worry about yourself. Did that hurt?

523
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,040
I'm fine. It's far from my heart.

524
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,600
Where were you this morning?

525
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,880
You're safe, right?

526
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,320
I'm safe, dear. And you?

527
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,240
I heard rumors you were whipped
until your back was torn open.

528
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,520
I'm fine. Look.

529
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,120
Let's continue later.

530
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,640
I'd like to speak with Kamduang first.

531
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,000
I have to return to City Hall soon.

532
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,960
There's still official business.

533
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,720
I heard the Governor is gravely injured.

534
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,640
Will you be punished?

535
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
Though the gun negotiations failed,

536
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,440
I consider your work finished.

537
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,760
- The truth about the guns--
- It's over.

538
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,880
I'll pay you your wages

539
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,480
and the golden ginseng.

540
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,960
- But the guns--
- It's over!

541
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,080
I was foolish
to be deceived by those foreigners.

542
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,120
- But--
- You're a buffalo trader. Take your pay.

543
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,240
Go back to your buffalo.
Herd them as you know how.

544
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,600
This is a nobleman's house.

545
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,720
There's no work here
for a commoner like you anymore.

546
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,680
Khun Aek told me
to give these to you, Madam.

547
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,360
Yip, don't call me "Madam."

548
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,840
I'm just a commoner,

549
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,920
unworthy of this nobleman's house.

550
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,320
Madam, where are you going?

551
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,360
I can't say.

552
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,880
Thank you, Yip and Granny Aoi,

553
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,040
for always being kind to me.

554
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,000
If luck allows, we'll meet again.

555
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,000
You speak as though
you'll be gone for a long time.

556
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,160
Take this.

557
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,440
- Sathu.
- Sathu.

558
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,080
- Thank you, Madam.
- Thank you, Madam.

559
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,160
I wish you a safe journey.

560
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,040
This way, my hand won't touch you.

561
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,360
You're a buffalo trader. Take your pay.

562
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,480
Go back to your buffalo.
Herd them as you know how.

563
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,880
Why did you speak to Kamduang that way?

564
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,800
I must be firm, Father.

565
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,240
I don't want to cause her trouble later.

566
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,360
If the Governor passes away,

567
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,600
as my wife, Kamduang
would surely be sentenced to death.

568
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,240
You're right.

569
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,320
I myself would not escape
such punishment either.

570
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,960
I beg your pardon, Father.

571
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,920
It was my own foolishness

572
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,000
that allowed Mr. Chadwick
to sell us those worthless guns.

573
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,760
Time's up, Sir.

574
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,920
I'll take my leave, Father.

575
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,760
Thank you, Sergeant Boonchai,

576
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,760
for giving me the time
to take care of matters.

577
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,760
Think nothing of it, Sir.

578
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,240
Go!

579
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,040
- Let go of me!
- Go!

580
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,600
Go!

581
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,280
- Go!
- Let go of me!

582
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,120
- Hurry up!
- Don't take my husband!

583
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,200
Please release my husband.

584
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,360
Go!

585
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,800
Kamduang, what are you looking at?

586
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,240
That's a prisoner in chains.

587
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,360
All of a sudden, I remembered something.

588
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,520
I think Khun Aek is in trouble.

589
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,560
Don't worry about me.

590
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,480
Go wait for me at Khun Aek's house.

591
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,200
What's the situation with Mr. Chadwick?

592
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,160
The soldiers interrogated him.

593
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,040
He insists Khun Aek
really did test the guns,

594
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,680
and that they never discussed
any commission payment, Father.

595
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,440
Bribe him.

596
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,000
Make him change his statement
to incriminate Khun Aek.

597
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,400
I already sent someone to feel him out,

598
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,720
but he refused.

599
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,520
If that foreigner's a fool,
let him stay a fool.

600
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,240
As for Khun Aek,

601
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,680
we can't let him
sit comfortably in prison.

602
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,520
I've bought off the guards.

603
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,680
Whenever we're bored,

604
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,640
we can go in and stomp him for fun.

605
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,640
Please let me speak
with my husband for a moment.

606
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,760
Who told you I was here?

607
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,200
No one had to tell me.
I figured it out myself.

608
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,360
Then why are you here?

609
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,480
I have something important to tell you.

610
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,040
About the guns,
it might not be entirely your fault.

611
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,680
What do you mean?

612
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,560
The night before it happened,
I encountered the culprit.

613
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,440
I fought them, but I lost.

614
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,440
Sergeant Boonchai,

615
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,120
please tell Khun Pra Saming
I wish to speak with him.

616
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,000
About the attacker you fought…

617
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,040
I found a notebook
that's quite interesting.

618
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,320
What are you looking at?

619
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,680
Looking at someone handsome.

620
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,760
I want you to find out
about Khun Aek's wife.

621
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,920
See if she's hiding any secrets.

622
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,520
Yes, sir.

623
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,720
We need to stage it.

624
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,920
- <i>So they think we're husband and wife.</i>
- Aw, dear!

625
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,960
I have a secret herb.

626
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,080
Do you know the plant called <i>Kradum Yen?</i>

627
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,920
Kamduang…

628
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,760
In the northern forest,

629
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,840
<i>the patrol found many soldiers dead.</i>

630
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,160
<i>All were killed by Srichai's gang.</i>

631
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,640
You once told me

632
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,640
Kamduang could break a sorcerer's spell.

633
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,640
Maybe she could help us.

634
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,080
I'd rather die

635
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,520
than let Kamduang be harmed,
even just a fingertip.

636
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,040
Freeze!

637
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,440
