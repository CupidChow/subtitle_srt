1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,640
You're saying someone

2
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,800
plotted to make the gun explode,
just to frame you?

3
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,320
Are you willing to stake your life on it?

4
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,480
I am, Sir.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,560
You must be willing to fire all five.

6
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,479
After I test-fired the guns,

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
Khun Pra Saming saw the truth.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,240
You've seen my work now, haven't you?

9
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,680
Impressive.

10
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,920
In the room, I saw an open notebook.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They've found out about Nok Lek.

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,400
In the northern forest,

13
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>the patrol found many soldiers dead.</i>

14
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
<i>All were killed by Bandit Srichai.</i>

15
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,760
His death means our safety.

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
<i>Hunt him down!</i>

17
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,400
Freeze!

18
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,720
Huh.

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,040
Servant Ghost.

20
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,080
If anyone comes near, tell me immediately.

21
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
So, you're Khun Aek Itthirit.

22
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
You must already know who I am,

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,880
bringing so many people here like this.

24
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,560
Bandit Srichai.

25
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,320
I brought many men

26
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,920
because I thought you'd bring even more.

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,680
Don't worry.

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,240
When the time comes,
we'll come in force for sure.

29
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,600
And don't bother
tricking me with questions.

30
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,560
Right now, you're in my hands.

31
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,160
Consider yourself a dead man.

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,880
In that case, tell me,

33
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,840
when do you plan to attack Thung Yai City?

34
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
I can tell you more than you're asking

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,160
if you agree to join me.

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
I know

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,600
you're an important official
in Thung Yai City.

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,760
But if you help me seize the town,

39
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,880
you'll have more power
than the Governor himself.

40
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,040
I'll never join forces
with a bandit like you.

41
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Don't waste your breath.
I won't work with you no matter what.

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
The scent of spirits…

43
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,480
Servant ghost?

44
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,600
If Father were here,
he'd know how to handle this.

45
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,120
I dedicate this food

46
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
to all wandering spirits

47
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
in these mountains.

48
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,400
Servant ghost?

49
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,480
Servant ghost?

50
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,320
Where has it gone?

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
Dear?

52
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,920
Kamduang… it's you?

53
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,200
You're under a freeze spell.

54
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,480
Worthless fools!

55
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,880
I told you to guard

56
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
against intruders,

57
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,080
and you're here eating offerings?!

58
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,520
Offerings?

59
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,800
Go that way.

60
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,000
You can't escape me, Khun Aek!

61
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,480
I'll kill you both
with the Seven-Metal Sacred Sword.

62
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,400
Both of your souls

63
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,280
will serve me as slaves for all eternity.

64
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,480
Dear, go.

65
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,240
I'll handle him.

66
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,400
I won't abandon you.

67
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,640
You must.

68
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,240
He's got magic. You can't beat him.

69
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,800
Dear!

70
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,520
Your soul is mine, Khun Aek.

71
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,760
Are you sure? Look again.

72
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,400
Khun Aek!

73
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,960
Your soul will be mine, Khun Aek!

74
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,600
Let's go, dear.

75
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,960
She's got some sacred thing.

76
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,920
Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

77
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
You disobeyed my orders?

78
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,960
I saw you had no magic to fight him.

79
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,720
Even so, you nearly died.

80
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,120
If anything happened to you,
do you know how much I'd regret it?

81
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,280
We've come far.

82
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,640
He probably can't catch up now.

83
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,280
Let's rest here.

84
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,600
Yes, dear.

85
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,360
I'll be right back.

86
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
Are you unwell?

87
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,120
It's a woman's thing.

88
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,680
Should we stay here for the night?

89
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,440
No, let's keep going,

90
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,160
to be sure Bandit Srichai won't catch us.

91
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
Let's go.

92
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,480
Kamduang. It's me.

93
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,960
Are we leaving now?

94
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,520
Rest first.

95
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
You still have stomach pain?

96
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,960
Yes.

97
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,160
What are you doing?

98
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,800
I saw my mother use a herbal compress.

99
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,120
Just use this for now.

100
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
Come.

101
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,720
Come here.

102
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,120
Rest your head on my lap.

103
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Dear…

104
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,320
Your fever still hasn't gone down.

105
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm feeling better now.

106
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,080
It's just a woman's thing.

107
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
Have some fruit and water first.

108
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,360
Get your strength back.

109
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,000
You're far too kind to me.

110
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,680
Not nearly as much
as you've helped me before.

111
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you

112
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,720
for taking care of me last night.

113
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,640
Eat some fruit,

114
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
so you'll have strength.

115
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,640
Dear, walk faster,

116
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,480
before Bandit Srichai catches up.

117
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,760
Hey.

118
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Rest a bit.

119
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080
Don't push yourself.

120
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,200
I don't want to slow you down.

121
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,640
Go ahead, then bring soldiers back for me.

122
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,880
If you keep worrying about me like this,

123
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,280
neither of us will make it.

124
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Then we'll do this.

125
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,000
Ah.

126
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,880
We'll go like this. It'll be faster.

127
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,480
I have a woman's thing now. I'm not clean.

128
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,960
If you carry me,

129
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,080
it might bring bad luck.

130
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
I don't care about luck.

131
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,560
I care more about you.

132
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,480
We'll go like this. It'll be quicker.

133
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,880
Hey! Stop!

134
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
I said stop!

135
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,840
Your friends are all dead.
You're the last one.

136
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,720
Tell me where Srichai is,
and I'll spare you.

137
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,880
I'll never tell you.

138
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,720
You'd rather die
than betray your comrades?

139
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,079
Find the others,

140
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,720
and keep hunting Srichai.

141
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,359
Yes, Sir.

142
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
Where do you think
you're running to, Khun Aek?

143
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,480
Freeze!

144
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
You've been hit with the freeze spell.

145
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,920
A protective amulet?

146
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
You don't even have the strength to stand.

147
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,400
Buffalo-Throwing Punch!

148
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,320
Dear!

149
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,480
Hey!

150
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,960
You both

151
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,880
have angered me.

152
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,600
Your souls will be

153
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,080
my slaves forever!

154
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
What happened?

155
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
You're a woman. You're menstruating…

156
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,280
His magic is weakened.

157
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,360
Kamduang.

158
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
Go after him.

159
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,640
- But you--
- Don't worry about me.

160
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
This may be our only chance to defeat him.

161
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,440
We might not get another.

162
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
Take care of yourself.

163
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Kamduang.

164
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,480
Why did you follow me?

165
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm worried about you.

166
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Worry about yourself first.

167
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,360
Kamduang.

168
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,560
Khun Aek?

169
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,120
Kamduang?

170
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,760
What happened to you two?

171
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,400
Have you seen Bandit Srichai?

172
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,480
No.

173
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,920
But you should get Kamduang out of here.

174
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
If not, I'm afraid she'll get worse.

175
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm fine.

176
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Kamduang.

177
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,440
Kamduang.

178
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,480
Stop!

179
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,320
Don't tell me
you're Srichai, the sorcerer-bandit.

180
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,520
And who are you?

181
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm Khun Men Manmueang.

182
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,240
People say you're invincible.

183
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,960
How did you end up like this?

184
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,480
Khun Aek must've given you hell.

185
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,880
If I let you go,

186
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,880
will you come back to raid Thung Yai City?

187
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,920
I'll be back.

188
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll be back to finish my plan.

189
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,320
Good.

190
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,960
Don't overthink it.

191
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,960
Go, before someone else sees you.

192
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,200
Not that way!

193
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,560
My soldiers are there,

194
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,120
and Khun Pra Chuay's troops the other way.

195
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,480
But Khun Aek's after me.

196
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,680
I'll handle him.

197
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,680
Khun Aek…

198
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,200
You wretched woman…

199
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,160
You weakened my magic.

200
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,960
I swear

201
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,520
I'll wash my feet in your blood!

202
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,080
You damned spirits!

203
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,720
Think you can devour me?

204
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
Come if you dare!

205
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,800
Come at me!

206
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,440
Khun Aek, I've brought the doctor.

207
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,560
Thank you.

208
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,480
Doctor Num, please examine Kamduang.

209
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,880
Yes, Sir.

210
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,600
Excuse me.

211
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,960
Please let me past.

212
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,240
Doctor,

213
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,480
how is my wife?

214
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,840
Khun Aek,

215
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,400
is something wrong?

216
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,400
Nothing, Sir.

217
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,600
Don't be alarmed.

218
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,560
My name is Num. I'm a royal physician.

219
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,400
I'll be treating you.

220
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,400
How are you feeling now?

221
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,720
Good.

222
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,200
Her elements are unbalanced,

223
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,920
her body weakened,
so she has developed a fever.

224
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,200
She needs herbal medicine to rebalance
and plenty of rest.

225
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,000
Please prepare it for her.

226
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,000
Yes, Sir.

227
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,320
Thank you very much.

228
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,640
Where is Khun Pra Saming?

229
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,480
He's speaking with Khun Men.

230
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,400
We can't waste time.

231
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,640
We must buy guns
from the merchant I contacted immediately.

232
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,520
Why the rush?

233
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,840
To deal with Bandit Srichai at once.

234
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,080
We don't know when he'll bring
his men to raid our city again.

235
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
But from what Khun Aek said,

236
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,080
Bandit Srichai was badly injured,

237
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,880
maybe even dead.

238
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,400
Or perhaps Khun Aek just said that
to save face.

239
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,640
From what I know,

240
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,560
most of Khun Aek's men were killed,

241
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,560
and he barely made it out alive,

242
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,520
was only spared because his wife
took the blow for him.

243
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,560
Khun Aek, meanwhile, is perfectly fine

244
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,200
and healthy.

245
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,800
Are you implying
my son hid behind a woman?

246
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,560
Hiding would already be shameful.

247
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,760
I fear he may have

248
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,880
pushed his wife in front of the sword.

249
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,720
- Khun Men!
- Anyway…

250
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,600
I'll refrain from speaking
of such disgraceful matters.

251
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,280
The important thing now is Bandit Srichai.

252
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,640
The soldiers reported
he could absorb bullets.

253
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,120
That's because our guns are old and weak.

254
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
If we had the ones I can get,

255
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,440
Bandit Srichai
would be riddled with holes by now.

256
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,520
What you say has merit.

257
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,720
Last time, the Kiet Kud bandits

258
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,280
attacked swiftly, and the city fell

259
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,680
because the previous governor
wasn't prepared.

260
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I believe, with better guns,

261
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,800
we can wipe them out.

262
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,880
In that case--

263
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,800
Don't rush into
buying Khun Men's guns yet.

264
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,560
Our city can't afford to buy twice.

265
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,040
His won't be as good as the foreign ones.

266
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,680
If we're talking about
blowing up in the shooter's face,

267
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,560
I admit

268
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,960
yours can't be beaten.

269
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,560
That's under investigation.

270
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,000
By the time you finish,

271
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,520
Bandit Srichai will have raided us again.

272
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,040
Not everyone can hide
behind their wife like you.

273
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,040
If you're scared, you can hide behind me.

274
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,640
I'll protect you, your family,

275
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,320
and every citizen of Thung Yai City.

276
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,720
As for Bandit Srichai,

277
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,240
I guarantee he won't be back anytime soon.

278
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,840
Why are you so certain?

279
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,440
He's a practitioner of black magic,

280
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
but he's been struck by a counter-curse
that weakened his power.

281
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,360
What counter-curse?

282
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,880
If you don't believe me,
ask the royal physician.

283
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,520
Why all the whispering?

284
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,080
Never mind, Khun Men.

285
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,120
Saying it out loud wouldn't be proper.

286
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,200
I'll trust Khun Aek on this.

287
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
But we mustn't be complacent.

288
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Khun Aek,

289
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,720
Khun Men,

290
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,520
both of you
resolve the gun matter quickly,

291
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,120
before Bandit Srichai returns.

292
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,000
Yes, Sir.

293
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,760
Yip.

294
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,720
Yes, Sir?

295
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
How is Kamduang?

296
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
Much better, Sir.

297
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,280
She went straight to her room
to rest this afternoon.

298
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,680
Doctor Num is examining her now.

299
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,520
I'll go check on her.

300
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,080
What are you two doing?

301
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,360
Elemental healing massage, Sir.

302
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,080
Don't stop yet, Doctor.

303
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,280
It feels so good.

304
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,200
Yes.

305
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,000
Doctor!

306
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,760
Dear!

307
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,200
You have no right
to lay a finger on my Kamduang!

308
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,760
Doctor Num!

309
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,560
Dear?

310
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,240
Dear?

311
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,840
What are you smiling at?

312
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,960
I'm not smiling.

313
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,480
I clearly saw you smile, Sir.

314
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,640
On my way back, I saw storm clouds.

315
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,560
You'd better leave before the storm hits,

316
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,320
or you'll be stuck here.

317
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,080
If he can't leave,

318
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,880
he can just stay the night.

319
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,200
No.

320
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,560
His wife would be worried.

321
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm single, Sir.

322
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,920
This house has no spare rooms.

323
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,840
But there are several empty rooms.

324
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,280
The wood's rotten, the floors unsafe.
No one can stay there.

325
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,760
Lady Kamduang is better now,

326
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,800
but she still needs
elemental healing massage,

327
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,440
or the imbalance may return.

328
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,000
You can go home.

329
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,880
I'll massage my wife.

330
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,440
You'd better go before the rain falls.

331
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Go.

332
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
This way.

333
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,560
I'm sorry, Sir.

334
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,320
It's alright.
My fault for stopping without warning.

335
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,520
You don't look well, Sir.

336
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,880
May I check you?

337
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,640
Have you been having stomachaches
or been bloated lately?

338
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,360
Sometimes,
as expected for someone who works hard.

339
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,840
May I check your abdomen?

340
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,600
Hey.

341
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,920
No need to check that far, Doctor.

342
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,720
My apologies.

343
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,520
No need to examine me. I'm fine.
You should head back.

344
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,320
I'll go take care of my wife.

345
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,360
I'll see you off here.

346
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,600
- Yip.
- Yes, Sir?

347
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,520
Perfect timing. See the doctor off.

348
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,840
Yes, sir.

349
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,800
This way, sir.

350
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,520
Khun Pra Chuay
left this for you as your fee.

351
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
Thank you.

352
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,160
Oh.

353
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,600
Kamduang's imbalance isn't cured yet.

354
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,840
I don't know why Khun Aek
rushed to send me away.

355
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,640
If you don't want to go home,

356
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,280
you can spend the night in my room.

357
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,960
I'd better not.

358
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,240
The room's empty,

359
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,760
and I have nobody next to me.

360
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
It's lonely.

361
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,400
You witch!

362
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,720
Why look for a husband here?

363
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,480
I've got goosebumps!

364
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,640
Go away now! Get out of my sight!

365
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,280
Go! Do you want me to smack you?

366
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,600
Ew!

367
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,760
I'll see you off here.

368
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,000
- Yip.
- Yes, Sir?

369
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,920
Perfect timing. See the doctor off.

370
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,240
Yes, Sir.

371
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,200
This way, sir.

372
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,080
Aw.

373
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,000
So I was jealous of the wrong person?

374
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,160
You have to massage me

375
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,600
just as Dr. Num instructed.

376
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,640
Uh…

377
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
Uh? What?

378
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,520
You're the one who sent Dr. Num away,

379
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,680
saying you'd massage me yourself.

380
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,520
I'll call Yip for you.

381
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,680
She's already busy.

382
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,840
She can't even finish her regular tasks.

383
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,720
Well?

384
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,440
Will you massage me or not?

385
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,360
If not,

386
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,000
I'll bring Dr. Num back myself.

387
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,200
Wait, wait.

388
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,640
I'll do it.

389
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,960
I think it feels weird.

390
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,920
It's…

391
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,280
It's not as comfortable
as when Dr. Num did it.

392
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,200
It works the same.

393
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,280
How is it?

394
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,720
Better?

395
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,480
Yes.

396
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,000
See?

397
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,040
No need for Dr. Num.

398
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,000
I can do it for you.

399
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,520
Are you jealous?

400
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,080
Oh? Silent?

401
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,120
So?

402
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,040
Just admit it.

403
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,240
I'm not jealous.

404
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,840
Then you're possessive.

405
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,520
Yes.

406
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,920
No!

407
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,080
I'm not jealous or possessive.

408
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,400
Look me in the eyes.

409
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,880
You are jealous
and possessive, aren't you?

410
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,520
Answer me.

411
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,280
We can't trust anyone.

412
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,040
For your safety, from now on, no man

413
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,040
can touch you.

414
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,200
Understand?

415
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,880
Yes.

416
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,080
Shall I continue massaging?

417
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,560
Yeesoon.

418
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,400
Khun Aek.

419
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,680
SHUIWEI SHENGNIANG TEMPLE

420
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,880
Where are you headed?

421
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,360
I'm on my way to the market.

422
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,720
And you?

423
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,400
I went to buy medicine for Kamduang.

424
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,920
She's unwell.

425
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,960
I hope she gets well soon.

426
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,960
When I get the chance, I'll visit her.

427
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,440
I'll be going now. Kamduang is waiting.

428
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,680
Yes.

429
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,440
Yeesoon.

430
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,160
Are you alright?

431
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,640
I think I've got heatstroke.

432
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,920
You should hurry back to Kamduang.

433
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,040
Don't worry about me.

434
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,600
I'll take you home.

435
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,040
You can't walk like this.

436
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,320
Sorry to trouble you.

437
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,000
Come on then.

438
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,560
Slowly.

439
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,160
Oh, Yeesoon.

440
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,600
Let me carry you.

441
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,480
Come, I'll take you home.

442
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,240
Thank you

443
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,760
for taking the trouble to bring me home.

444
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,680
If you hadn't helped me,

445
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,640
I might have fainted and been dragged off

446
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,680
by thugs to be assaulted.

447
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,880
My life belongs to you.

448
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,320
Why would you say that?

449
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,800
To me, you've always been important.

450
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,880
You do have a sweet tongue.

451
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,480
I regret

452
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,360
my past mistakes.

453
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,880
Do you think people

454
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,520
deserve a second chance?

455
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,480
Everyone should have
the chance to make things right.

456
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,640
Such a pity.

457
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,240
Some flowers wish to be in the vase,

458
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,960
but it's already filled

459
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,320
with others.

460
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,080
The Yeesoon flower you once liked.

461
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,600
Please help me with this.

462
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,480
Do you like the flowers in the vase more?

463
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,560
The flowers in the vase
are already beautiful.

464
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,800
Let's not mix in another.

465
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,640
I must go now. Kamduang is waiting.

466
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,960
Kamduang!

467
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,360
MY DEAR

468
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,480
Oh, Khun Aek,

469
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,440
aren't we seeing each other
a bit too often lately?

470
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,080
We do see each other a lot.

471
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,800
Are you here to pay respects?

472
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,640
Yes.

473
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,320
I'll wait for you in the hall, dear.

474
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,440
It seems the rumors are true.

475
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,680
Who's been saying what?

476
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,080
They say Kamduang is angry with me
about the other day,

477
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,680
when you helped me
after I fainted from the heat.

478
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,480
No,

479
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,720
you're saying that
because you don't know something.

480
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,680
I don't know what?

481
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,080
Never mind.

482
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,080
Let's just say Kamduang
isn't angry at you like that.

483
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,400
Even so,

484
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,920
I still want to clear the air with her.

485
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,920
Don't you think that's a good idea?

486
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,160
If it'll put your mind at ease,

487
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,800
then go ahead.

488
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,520
I want to talk, woman to woman.

489
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,360
Why isn't she here yet?

490
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,160
Who do you want me to slap, Lady Yeesoon?

491
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,600
Me.

492
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,920
Yes or no?

493
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,000
Yes. Wait.

494
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,320
No. Wait.

495
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,240
- Or yes?
- Then try slapping me.

496
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,240
Lady Yeesoon!

497
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,800
I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

498
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,960
Was that enough?

499
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,200
You nearly knocked my jaw out.

500
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,760
Oh.

501
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,600
But who do you really want me to slap?

502
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,480
I want you to find out

503
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,240
what day Khun Aek and Kamduang
are going to the temple.

504
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,080
I'll lie in wait to provoke her

505
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,720
until she can't take it
and slaps me in front of Khun Aek.

506
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,440
If that fails,
you'll have to slap me instead.

507
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,200
Then I'll tell Khun Aek
it was Kamduang's doing.

508
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,160
Kamduang.

509
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,760
Wait.

510
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,040
What is it?

511
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,400
Well, I'd like to speak
with you for a moment,

512
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,560
about the two of us.

513
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,160
The two of us?

514
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,920
I don't want you to misunderstand me,

515
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,880
but it's hot here in the sun.
Let's talk over there.

516
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,160
Kamduang, let's have an honest talk today.

517
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,560
I know that deep down,

518
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,280
you're just a shameless woman

519
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,480
who lured Khun Aek into bed,

520
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,960
then had your relatives catch you both
so you could marry him.

521
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,320
Your whole family is shameless
and money-hungry, isn't that right?

522
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,720
This is nothing new.

523
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,040
You've always looked at me this way.

524
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,200
Do you even realize

525
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,880
how clumsy and graceless you are?

526
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,040
Like that ugly Kaew Na Ma,

527
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,320
or a lost loris in the forest.

528
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,040
I often go into the forest.
I see lost lorises all the time.

529
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,040
They're cute.

530
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,280
You're like a vulture that refuses to die,

531
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,560
someone whose face
got trampled by a buffalo.

532
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,360
If a buffalo trampled my face,

533
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,200
my father would
probably beat me again for it.

534
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,960
The clothes you're wearing are cheap,

535
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,160
made by some unskilled tailor.
They're embarrassing.

536
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,240
This blouse belonged to the mother

537
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,200
of Khun Aek.

538
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,080
I'll be sure to let him know you think so.

539
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,760
Do you have anything else to call me?

540
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,480
I'll tell you the truth.

541
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,680
I've never been angry with you.

542
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,680
I only feel sympathy,
and I'm sorry you've been unhappy.

543
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,520
And as I've told you before,
I still intend to leave.

544
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,520
But certain coincidences
have forced me to stay a little longer.

545
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,760
Please, don't be angry with me.

546
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,240
Angry? That's not enough.

547
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
I hate you to my very core.

548
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,680
You could try to slap me a hundred times.

549
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,080
You still wouldn't land a hit.

550
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,760
Don't look down on me.

551
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,720
Hey, Yeesoon, watch out.

552
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,480
There's a cobra behind you.

553
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,520
Stay still. Don't move.

554
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,680
Kamduang, help me.

555
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,480
Calm down. Don't be afraid.

556
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,200
Oh, Khun Aek.

557
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,800
Are you here
to pay respects to the Buddha?

558
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,160
Yes, Sir.

559
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,560
Stay still.

560
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,840
I'll take it far away and release it.

561
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,400
There will be a big
merit-making event at my house soon.

562
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,720
I'm coming to invite the abbot in person.

563
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,920
You should come as well.
Consider this your early invitation.

564
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,280
Oh.

565
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,720
Lady Yeesoon.

566
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,320
Lady Yeesoon.

567
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
- Juan, slap me.
- Huh?

568
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,960
Slap me. Now. Hard. As hard as you can.

569
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,280
Slap me now. Hurry up.

570
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,200
What happened?

571
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,640
Yeesoon!

572
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,200
Yeesoon, what happened?

573
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,040
Who harmed you, Yeesoon?

574
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,520
Get up.

575
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,120
What happened? Who did this to you?

576
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,040
I tried to talk to her nicely,

577
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,000
but Kamduang
was still angry and slapped me.

578
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,480
Kamduang…

579
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,160
Please, don't tell anyone.

580
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,800
I'm so embarrassed…

581
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,120
Yeesoon.

582
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,480
- Kamduang.
- Hmm?

583
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,640
Why did you harm Yeesoon?

584
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,480
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now, Kamduang.

585
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,360
Oh?

586
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,920
Lady Yeesoon is quite the actress.

587
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,840
This time, Madam's done for.

588
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,240
<i>The more we can make people</i>

589
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,120
<i>hate Kamduang,</i>

590
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,320
<i>the stronger the pressure will be.</i>

591
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,760
That way, Khun Aek will be
ashamed that he'll want to divorce her.

592
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,640
I am Khun Aek Itthirit.

593
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,320
My word is always my bond.

594
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,880
Then I'll be waiting
to see justice from you.

595
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,720
Go kneel and apologize to Yeesoon.

596
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,480
Kneel down? Is it really necessary?

597
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,200
I want to tell you one thing.

598
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,680
I've raised my niece since she was little.

599
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,840
She's not the type
to slap anyone like you think.

600
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,640
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>Khun Aek always sides with Yeesoon.</i>

601
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,960
I'll get my revenge.

602
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,400
Khun Aek barged in before I even noticed.

603
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,960
You must kill him.

604
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,960
<i>If you fail,</i>

605
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,240
<i>you know exactly who will have to die.</i>

606
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,640
Who is this, Sir?

607
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,120
Her name is Ping.

608
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,560
Are you a friend of Kamduang's?

609
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,080
- Yes, Sir.
- Kamduang?

610
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,400
