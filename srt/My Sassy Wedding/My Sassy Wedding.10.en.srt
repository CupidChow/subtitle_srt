1
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,960
You're a woman. You're menstruating…

2
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
I guarantee

3
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,000
he won't be back anytime soon.

4
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,360
<i>He's a practitioner of black magic,</i>

5
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,360
<i>but he's been struck by a counter-curse</i>
<i>that weakened his power.</i>

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
You can go home.

7
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,560
<i>I'll massage my wife.</i>

8
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,200
You are jealous
and possessive, aren't you?

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,880
<i>For your safety, from now on,</i>
<i>no man can touch you.</i>

10
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,600
Alright.

11
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
I want you to find out what day Khun Aek
and Kamduang are going to the temple.

12
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
<i>I'll provoke her until she can't take it</i>
<i>and slaps me in front of Khun Aek.</i>

13
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,360
Hey, Yeesoon, watch out.
There's a cobra behind you.

14
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
Slap me.

15
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,920
<i>Kamduang,</i>

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,320
why did you harm Yeesoon?

17
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
Ouch.

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,960
It's my fault.

19
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,640
I never thought Kamduang
would actually do this to me.

20
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
I didn't expect it either.

21
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
But you're very lucky
your jaw isn't broken.

22
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,520
Normally, Kamduang's punches are heavy.

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,320
It sounds like you admire her strength.

24
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,600
No.

25
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
Not at all.

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,600
Actually, right now I'm furious with her.

27
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,920
But Kamduang is your wife.

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
How long can you stay angry?

29
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,760
This has to be about right and wrong.

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,480
Justice must come first.

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,560
If Kamduang is truly guilty,
she must be punished.

32
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,960
I fear you won't be able to do as you say.

33
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,640
Yeesoon, trust me.

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I am Khun Aek Itthirit.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
My word is always my bond.

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
I hope that's true.

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll be waiting to see justice from you.

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,920
What?

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,959
Me? Slap Yeesoon?

40
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,760
That's a misunderstanding!

41
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,320
Kamduang,

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,200
you did wrong.

43
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,320
Go kneel and apologize to Yeesoon.

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,280
Kneel down? Is it really necessary?

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,240
Yes. If someone slapped you

46
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,560
and just said sorry,
would you be satisfied?

47
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,120
But I didn't do it.

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
Then how is Yeesoon's mouth full of blood?

49
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,480
If you didn't slap her,
what ghost would have?

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,720
I don't know.
Maybe a ghost slapped her, or a dog.

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,600
I swear I didn't do it.
Take me to any temple to swear it.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,240
- But I saw it.
- With your own eyes?

53
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Yes.

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,680
I saw you lunge at her.

55
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,240
I was grabbing a snake.

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,400
I was trying to save her life.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
What snake?

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,640
There was a cobra on the branch,
hood spread, ready to strike her.

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,240
Kamduang, your lies get bigger every day.

60
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,600
Dear, call me cruel if you must,

61
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
but don't ever call me a liar.

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,680
I've never lied to you.

63
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,520
And what you're saying now,
what should I call it?

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
Call it the truth.

65
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,320
But if you're deaf and blind,
whatever I say will sound like lies.

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Kamduang,

67
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
what you did is against the law.

68
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,240
If Yeesoon takes this to court,

69
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
you'll be punished.

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
Let her! If she wants to sue, then sue!

71
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,840
- Kamduang.
- You believe everything Yeesoon says.

72
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,320
But not me.

73
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,800
If you love her so much, then marry her.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,920
Because our marriage is just a--

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
Kamduang!

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,840
Lady Yeesoon,

77
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,240
I must apologize again.

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,840
It's fine. I asked for it.

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,040
My cheek was just swollen
and I couldn't go out for days.

80
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,000
But if it leads to Khun Aek
and Kamduang separating,

81
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,960
it's worth it.

82
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,080
They argued fiercely,

83
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,120
but neither mentioned divorce.

84
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,560
Normally Khun Aek is strict about justice.

85
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,120
Even if Kamduang is his wife,

86
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,920
after this, he wouldn't let it slide.

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
During the fight, Madam slipped a little.

88
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,520
She said their marriage

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
had something behind it.

90
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
But before she finished,

91
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,280
Khun Pra Chuay stopped them.

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,320
- Really?
- Yes.

93
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
Lady Yeesoon,

94
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,320
I don't know how to dig deeper.

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
In that case, there may be a way.

96
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
Today's dishes look delicious.

97
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,720
In this season, mackerel is the best.

98
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,360
Come, let's eat.

99
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,440
Aren't you hungry?

100
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,440
Hmm?

101
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,040
I'm too angry to eat.

102
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,000
I already choked down
some scolding earlier.

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm too full to eat.

104
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Come on.

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,120
Husband and wife fighting is natural,
like tongue and teeth clashing.

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,840
It's normal.

107
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,280
In fact, it's good.

108
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,880
It means you're both playing your parts.

109
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,320
Don't overthink it. Eat.

110
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,240
I think of the one slapped
in the face and can't eat.

111
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,840
So I can't eat either.

112
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
But not of the one falsely accused.

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,000
I can't eat too.

114
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,360
Come on.

115
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,960
The truth will come out eventually.

116
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
For now, eat.

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,160
Fine.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,320
If you won't eat,

119
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,760
then no one eats, I won't eat either.

120
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,480
Yip! Juan!
Take the food and feed it to the dogs.

121
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,760
You've been framed, haven't you?

122
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Oh, Kamduang,

123
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,280
you're so capable as a buffalo trader.

124
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,240
Why lose like this?

125
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,360
If it were a fair fight face-to-face,
I could handle it.

126
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,880
But this kind of fight, I don't know how,

127
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
and I don't want to.

128
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,920
Why do you say that?

129
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
Just let Yeesoon have her way.

130
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
I'm only hurt because Khun Aek

131
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,080
didn't even doubt
whether I'd do such a thing.

132
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
Bamboo shoots came at dawn today.

133
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,400
Wow, so fresh.

134
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,640
Yeah.

135
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
Hey, Juan, let me ask you something.

136
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,680
What is it?

137
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
They say everywhere

138
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,760
that your madam beat Lady Yeesoon
nearly to death. Is it true?

139
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,640
Who told you that?

140
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,280
Doesn't matter. Someone did.

141
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
That person said they saw

142
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,640
your madam

143
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,160
take off her shoes and slap Lady Yeesoon.

144
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,600
She tried crawling away, but she
grabbed her hair and slapped her again.

145
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,720
Yes, that's right.

146
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,840
I knew it.

147
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,160
I even heard Madam confess to Khun Aek

148
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,480
that after slapping her,
she stomped on her too.

149
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,640
What?

150
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,520
So vicious?

151
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,800
Yes.

152
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,200
Actually,

153
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,160
Lady Yeesoon could have fought back.

154
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,520
But she held back
because fighting in a temple

155
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,320
is improper.

156
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,640
- Yes.
- But Madam didn't care.

157
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,120
Even when the monk intervened,

158
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,560
she cursed at him
and told him to butt out.

159
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,600
Oh?

160
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
And if he kept interfering,

161
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,320
she'd drag Lady Yeesoon

162
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
to slap her in front
of the Buddha image itself!

163
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
Oh my.

164
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,400
What kind of heart does she have?

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
Tell us more.

166
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,360
If I tell you,

167
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
you have to keep it secret.

168
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Yes.

169
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Even I

170
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,480
didn't expect Madam to be so cruel…

171
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,920
How much are these pomelos?

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm not selling to you.

173
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
Huh?

174
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
Are they reserved for someone?

175
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,200
A heartless woman

176
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,320
who dares step on nuns and novices,

177
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,040
get away from my stall.

178
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,560
You'll bring misfortune.

179
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,440
Hey, Um,

180
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
who are you saying
stepped on nuns and novices? Tell me.

181
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,040
Oh? Who else?

182
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,520
It was your madam.

183
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,440
The whole market knows.

184
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,800
Beating Lady Yeesoon was bad enough,

185
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,360
but dragging her

186
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,520
to be beaten in front of the Buddha image?

187
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
She even cursed the monk,

188
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,720
then stomped on

189
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,360
an 80-year-old nun

190
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,720
and kicked little novices.

191
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
Wait, what are you talking about?

192
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,360
Why?

193
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,840
You think being a nobleman's wife
makes you untouchable?

194
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
Go shop somewhere else.

195
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,440
I won't sell to you.

196
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,760
Hey, you're just making things up now.

197
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,680
Where did you hear this lie?

198
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,640
And you believed it so easily?

199
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,280
Did you ever think about
whether it was true?

200
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,200
Of course it's true.

201
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,800
People said they saw it.

202
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
Who? Who told you?

203
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Name them.

204
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
Whoever it was.

205
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,680
- I won't tell you.
- Really?

206
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,680
Forget it, Yip.

207
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,720
If they won't sell, never mind.

208
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,920
You did something wrong and still
strut around like you own the place.

209
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,560
Not a shred of remorse.

210
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,040
Madam…

211
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
Forget it, Yip. Let's go.

212
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,640
How does it feel to be exposed
in the middle of the market?

213
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,760
- I'm so satisfied!
- Kamduang.

214
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,480
Paka.

215
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,800
I heard it already.

216
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,200
The whole market is saying

217
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,000
you rampaged at the temple,

218
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,440
stomping on Yeesoon,
slapping nuns, and kicking novices.

219
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,040
I didn't do any of that.

220
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,600
I believe you.

221
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,120
As a heroine in plays,

222
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,600
I've had to change characters many times.

223
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,480
I can tell people's true nature.

224
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,320
I know what kind of person Yeesoon is.

225
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,480
Thank you, Paka.

226
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
But what will you do now?

227
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,440
You know I'm not really with Khun Aek.

228
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,640
I only pretended
to be his wife out of necessity.

229
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,080
Once it's over, I'll go home.

230
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,840
I don't want to be
caught up in petty quarrels.

231
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,400
No, you can't stay silent.

232
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,080
If you don't fight back,
things will get worse.

233
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,080
Worse? How?

234
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,480
As the heroine,

235
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
I've played many roles. Right now,

236
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,080
you're playing
the role of Khun Aek's wife.

237
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,640
Think about it. If an old flame

238
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,960
came to flirt with your husband,

239
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,720
would any wife stay quiet?

240
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,200
You must fight back,

241
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,400
otherwise,

242
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,840
people will think
you're not truly his wife,

243
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,680
and then things will get messier.

244
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,080
You're right.

245
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,880
If people start doubting,
they'll dig deeper.

246
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,600
Khun Aek could be punished,

247
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,560
the gun deal will collapse,

248
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200
and the city will fall to bandits.

249
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,440
That's serious…

250
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,120
So, I must get back at Yeesoon,

251
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,680
to play my part.

252
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,720
Not just that.

253
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
You must feel the heart of a wife

254
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,920
who's about to lose her husband.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,080
He's your husband.

256
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,520
If someone tries to take your man,

257
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,560
they're insulting you!

258
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,920
Only shameless women

259
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,640
steal other people's husbands. And worse,

260
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,920
she slanders you
and makes people misunderstand you.

261
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,000
More importantly,
she's making your beloved husband

262
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,640
hate you.

263
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,760
Kamduang, your lies get bigger every day.

264
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,960
I think of the one slapped
in the face and can't eat.

265
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,080
But not of the one falsely accused.

266
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,800
Alright.

267
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,160
I'll get my revenge to play my part.

268
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,280
Come on.

269
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,280
Dealer's too slow. Hurry up.

270
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,119
Come on.

271
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,480
Come on.

272
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,680
Go.

273
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,880
You too.

274
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,680
Huh.

275
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,680
- Oh?
- Hey.

276
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,079
You've been coming here a lot lately.

277
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Where'd you get the money?

278
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
Easy money.

279
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,280
Someone hired me to deliver food
to a row house.

280
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,600
Very well-paid.

281
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,520
Who?

282
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,040
I don't know.

283
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,400
He doesn't seem like a local though.

284
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I interrogated him, Sir.

285
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,600
He knows nothing.

286
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,080
He was only hired to deliver food
to someone in the row house.

287
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,160
That sounds suspicious.

288
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,840
Did you check the house yet?

289
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,080
Not yet, Sir.

290
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,480
I feared tipping off
the snake in the grass.

291
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,680
But I know the place.

292
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,760
Then let's go tonight.

293
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,400
Yes, Sir.

294
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,040
Dear…

295
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
He knows we're here.

296
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,720
Sergeant Boonchai!

297
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,720
Go after him, Sir. Don't worry about me.

298
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Khun Aek Itthirit.

299
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,760
Your skills are impressive.

300
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
Not bad at all.

301
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,080
Madam.

302
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,280
It's very late now.

303
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
You haven't eaten yet.

304
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,320
I'm not hungry.

305
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,200
You're waiting for Khun Aek, aren't you?

306
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Hmm.

307
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,920
Yip.

308
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,840
Yes?

309
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,720
Dear, where have you been?
Why are you only just back?

310
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,920
I was chasing criminals.

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,280
Did you catch them?

312
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,600
No.

313
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,480
He's skilled and cunning.

314
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,000
Even you,

315
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,240
with your sword skills,
couldn't catch him,

316
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,200
he must be very good.

317
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,240
Are your burns painful?

318
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,640
Thank you. Don't worry. I'm fine.

319
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,680
Nobody worries about you.

320
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,160
Don't flatter yourself.

321
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,200
I think so too.

322
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,240
Huh.

323
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,840
What is wrong with this couple?

324
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,680
Come in.

325
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Vet Yoy?

326
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,560
Aloe vera medicine.

327
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Apply it on your burns.

328
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,920
That fire that burned you wasn't ordinary.

329
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,320
It contained some tree resin
that made the wound severely inflamed,

330
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,200
and its burning poison
seeped into your body.

331
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,120
It's best
if you apply this medicine first.

332
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,240
You are really knowledgeable.

333
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,760
Thank you.

334
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,520
No need to thank me.

335
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,840
You knew someone told me to do this.

336
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,960
But I'll tell her you said thanks.

337
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,800
I want to tell you one thing.

338
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,640
I've raised my niece since she was little.
I know her well.

339
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,840
I can stake my life on it.

340
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,400
She didn't slap anyone like you think.

341
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,600
Yip, Juan,

342
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,000
come help me.

343
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,560
- Someone's collapsed!
- Yes, Grandma?

344
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,480
What's wrong?

345
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,440
- What happened?
- Oh.

346
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,360
Oh?

347
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
- Grandma, who is this?
- Who is this?

348
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
I don't know.

349
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,440
Get some smelling salts and a fan.

350
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,720
Yes, Grandma.

351
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,840
Oh my. I don't know how she is now.

352
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,040
Come help.

353
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,200
Ping?

354
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Ping, you're awake.

355
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,280
Kamduang?

356
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,320
How did I end up here?

357
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,480
You fainted right in front of my house.

358
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,320
Now I remember.

359
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,960
I was on my way to visit my relatives,

360
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,720
then suddenly everything went dark
and I collapsed.

361
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,280
It must have been the heat.

362
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,680
Thank you.

363
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,400
You could rest a little longer.

364
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,720
When the sun goes down, you can head back.
Do you want to eat something?

365
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,640
No, thank you.

366
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,200
If I rest a little more,
I'll probably feel better.

367
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,400
I'm still a bit tired now.

368
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,120
Then just rest.

369
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,360
Thank you, Kamduang.

370
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,280
Where are you going, Kamduang?

371
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,720
I'll be right back.

372
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,160
Khun Aek barged in before I even noticed.

373
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,480
I don't know if I left any traces behind
when I escaped.

374
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,920
Go and investigate.

375
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,840
Investigate thoroughly.

376
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Khun Aek is clever. You can't fail this.

377
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,280
If he gets even the smallest lead,

378
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,200
he could piece everything together.

379
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
But be careful yourself.

380
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,720
<i>Judging by the indentations on the mat,</i>

381
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,760
<i>this person is slightly smaller than me.</i>

382
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,560
<i>The collected hair strands</i>
<i>include both gray and black,</i>

383
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,720
<i>likely around 50 years old.</i>

384
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,600
<i>The bedding smells of seafarer's sun-oil.</i>

385
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,040
<i>There are footprints outside the house.</i>

386
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,880
<i>The stride length measures</i>
<i>a little over an arm's span.</i>

387
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,560
<i>Arm traces on the desk</i>

388
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,360
<i>suggest a shoulder width of four spans.</i>

389
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,720
<i>From the elbow marks on the wall,</i>
<i>approximate height can be measured.</i>

390
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,960
This is…

391
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,640
This is serious.

392
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,360
Ping.

393
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,560
Ping?

394
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,640
Khun Pra Saming.

395
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,600
Why are you at Khun Pra Chuay's residence?

396
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,120
Oh, it's nothing.

397
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,320
I wasn't feeling well earlier.
I fainted outside,

398
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,080
so Kamduang let me rest here.

399
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,960
A grass flower was stuck in your hair.

400
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,600
Are there more?

401
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,160
No.

402
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,240
But why is your face red?

403
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,160
It must be the fever.

404
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,120
Oh.

405
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,400
Then I'll tell the royal physician
to examine you.

406
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,880
Please don't.

407
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,920
I'm feeling much better already.

408
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,480
Did you come here to see Khun Aek?

409
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,480
Yes.

410
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,680
It seems he has urgent matters
to discuss with me.

411
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,200
Then I won't get in the way.

412
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,000
Business with Khun Aek

413
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,400
can be discussed anywhere.

414
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,320
You should focus on recovering.

415
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,200
Right now, I'm the acting Governor.

416
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,960
If I order you to rest,

417
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,400
you must rest.

418
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,600
Yes,

419
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,040
Acting Governor.

420
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,920
You face is turning red again.

421
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,000
It must be the fever returning.

422
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,000
No fever at all.

423
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,120
Khun Pra Saming.

424
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,680
Oh.

425
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Who is this, Sir?

426
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,160
Her name is Ping. She fainted outside,

427
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,120
so Kamduang let her in.

428
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,080
Are you a friend of Kamduang's?

429
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,920
Yes, sir.

430
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,760
Let's go, Khun Aek. Didn't you say
you had something important to tell me?

431
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,719
This way, Sir.

432
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,560
I saw Khun Aek looking worried.

433
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,920
Did something happen between you and him?

434
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
There's nothing with me.

435
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,480
It must be about work.

436
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,320
Yesterday he almost lost his life.

437
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
That dangerous?

438
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Yes. Right now,
he's searching for the culprit.

439
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,880
They could be the pirates.

440
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,560
Pirates? Are they even real?
I've only ever heard the name.

441
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,960
Of course. I even fought them before.

442
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,800
But this is a secret, Ping.
Don't tell anyone.

443
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,640
Right now our town is in turmoil.

444
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,000
There are Thai bandits like Srichai,

445
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,120
foreigners who want to
plunder our country, and pirates too.

446
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,320
Khun Aek worries so much for the nation.

447
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,280
He's risking his life
for the greater good.

448
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,360
His heart doesn't beat for himself…

449
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,280
It beats for others.

450
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,560
A heart of sacrifice.

451
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,640
THRIVING AND PROSPEROUS BUSINESS

452
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,360
Chief.

453
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,040
You've already entered Khun Aek's house.
What did you find?

454
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,040
I reached his chamber,

455
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,120
but got nothing solid yet.

456
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,800
It seems
Khun Aek still has no clue about us.

457
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,560
Ping…

458
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,920
Are you hungry, Mom?

459
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,560
Slowly.

460
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,520
How are you today?

461
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,240
Eat something.

462
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,080
Be careful, it's hot.

463
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,640
Juan's here, my lady.

464
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,800
Lady Yeesoon.

465
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,200
What is it, Juan? Any news?

466
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,160
Tomorrow, Madam will go to the market.

467
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,080
In case you want to strike her again.

468
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,480
My cheek just healed from swelling.
Do you want it bruised again?

469
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,480
Besides,

470
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,120
fighting her does nothing.

471
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,600
Khun Aek doesn't do anything.

472
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,080
But still,

473
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,000
even if Khun Aek ignores it,

474
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,040
the more we can make people hate Kamduang,

475
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,080
the stronger the pressure will be.

476
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,760
That way, Khun Aek will be ashamed
that he'll want to divorce her

477
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,920
Let the whole town curse her.

478
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,720
Exactly. Spread false rumors,

479
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,920
ruin her reputation
until the whole town talks.

480
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,760
Let's see if Khun Aek
can stay indifferent.

481
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,800
As for me,
I'll use my own ways to strike her.

482
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,600
Yes, Lady Yeesoon.

483
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,920
Yip, I'm going to buy some herbs.

484
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Pick up whatever you ordered,
and we'll meet back here.

485
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,120
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Uncle Ju.

487
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,120
Buying medicine
for the buffalo again, Kamduang?

488
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,160
Not today. This time it's for people.

489
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,800
I need five taels of star anise powder.

490
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,760
Alright.

491
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,480
Star anise… here.

492
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,440
Uncle Ju.

493
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Is the Dong Quai I ordered ready?

494
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,120
Yes.

495
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
Please wait, Kamduang.

496
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,440
Don't worry, Uncle Ju.
You're busy now. I'll scoop it myself.

497
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
Alright then.

498
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Wait a minute.

499
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,240
Oh, Kamduang, here you are.

500
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,080
Are you buying herbs?

501
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
Isn't that the madam
who slapped Lady Yeesoon?

502
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,080
Yes, she didn't just slap her.

503
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,280
She also kicked a novice
and scolded a monk too.

504
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,240
She might think she's high
and mighty because she's a noble's wife.

505
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,040
I wouldn't go near her. She might slap me.

506
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,840
About that misunderstanding the other day,
I'm sorry.

507
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,440
Why don't we go somewhere quiet and talk?
I'll explain the truth to you.

508
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,640
If it's the truth,
it can be told anywhere.

509
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,360
Why must it be in secret?

510
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,800
Please, Kamduang. I am sincere.

511
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,880
Give me a chance
to explain the truth to you.

512
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,320
Very well.

513
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,240
If you are truly sincere.

514
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,120
This way.

515
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,120
Say what you have to say,

516
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,320
Yeesoon.

517
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,760
I will.

518
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,640
I really want to know if you realize

519
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,120
that Khun Aek doesn't love you.

520
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,640
He loves me. He still does.

521
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,880
I'm somewhat aware.

522
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,640
And knowing that, you still
shamelessly stay as his wife?

523
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,480
Yeesoon, there are some things
I just can't speak of.

524
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,240
Calm yourself. Don't rush…

525
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,480
No,

526
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,280
don't be a slut.

527
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,680
What did you just call me?

528
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,720
- Slut.
- What did you just call me?

529
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,440
- Slut.
- You said slut?

530
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,360
Are you deaf?

531
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,080
Slut, slut, slut.

532
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,200
Is it clear?

533
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,760
Oh.

534
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,920
Oops. I wasn't insulting you, Yeesoon.

535
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,520
I was just warning you.

536
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,160
So that's how you want it?

537
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,280
Fine.

538
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,360
Kamduang, no, don't hurt me.

539
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,840
Help me!

540
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Oh.

541
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,000
Goodness!

542
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,640
Lady Yeesoon, what happened?

543
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,920
Kamduang, please stop hurting me.
I'm scared.

544
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,040
I beg you. We're both women.
Why do you have to do this?

545
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,880
All I said was Khun Aek still loves me.
Why did you have to go this far?

546
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,040
What have I done?

547
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,280
You pulled my hair, slapped my face,

548
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,960
yanked out my hair by the handful!

549
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,160
Oh!

550
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,200
She's vicious.

551
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,800
Me?

552
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,240
With what did I slap
and pull your hair with?

553
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,880
With your own hands.

554
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,440
Everyone saw it, didn't you?

555
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,160
Kamduang, wife of a high official,

556
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,640
abusing her privilege to slap
a commoner and then denying it.

557
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,520
With power like hers,

558
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,720
she thinks she can do whatever she wants.
She doesn't see common folk as human.

559
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,560
How could you be so cruel?

560
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,680
Yes.

561
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,520
Hold on. Let me ask you something.

562
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,200
Did you see me hurt Yeesoon

563
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,200
the way she accuses?

564
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,600
Did you see it?

565
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
Even if I didn't,
I can tell by looking at her.

566
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,800
Yes.

567
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,520
Look at her, her lip is busted.

568
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,800
If I really slapped
and pulled Yeesoon's hair,

569
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,520
my hands wouldn't be covered
in star anise powder like this.

570
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,840
Give me a chance
to explain the truth to you.

571
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,320
Very well.

572
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,000
If I did, then this powder

573
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,240
should be on your face and hair.

574
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,160
- Yip.
- Yes, ma'am?

575
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,520
Smell her.

576
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,160
See if there's
any scent of star anise on her.

577
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,320
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,680
There's none, ma'am.

579
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,680
Oh?

580
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,200
Of course you'd side with your mistress.

581
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,120
Then someone else,
please help me prove it.

582
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,360
I'll do it.

583
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,520
Go.

584
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,760
Do it.

585
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,080
‪Let's see.

586
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,800
There's really
no smell of star anise at all.

587
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,080
Then let us smell and prove it too.

588
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,720
- Hey!
- Let me smell.

589
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Hey, get away from me!

590
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,080
Go away!

591
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,480
- Go.
- Stop!

592
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,800
Hey!

593
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,960
Stop right now.

594
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,360
‪Where I come from,
‪we’d call her a mad hag.

595
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,080
Yes.

596
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,640
Yes, yes! A mad hag!

597
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,440
Or maybe she's possessed?

598
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,560
Exactly.

599
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,440
Oh, Lady Yeesoon…

600
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,920
Still, let me smell again.

601
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,160
Let me try.

602
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,760
Let me smell.

603
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,320
- She's crazy.
- Yeah.

604
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,840
Whoa.

605
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,640
- She made us misunderstand Madam.
- Let's go.

606
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,520
Kamduang! I'll get my revenge!

607
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,480
You'll suffer shame
and pain tenfold, a hundredfold,

608
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,080
a thousandfold, a millionfold!

609
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,040
Kamduang!

610
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,120
Oh.

611
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,400
I didn't expect this.

612
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,080
Yeesoon looked like
a folded piece of cloth, neat and proper.

613
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,680
But once you unfold it,

614
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,720
it's torn full of holes.

615
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,200
To pull off something like that…
Oh! Khun Aek.

616
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,920
Khun Pra Yong, Good day, Sir.

617
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,280
I was just talking about you, actually.

618
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,960
Talking about what, Sir?

619
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,720
Your wife, Kamduang.

620
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,920
She clashed with Yeesoon
again at the market.

621
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,360
The townsfolk are gossiping endlessly.

622
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,280
Did Kamduang hurt Yeesoon again, Sir?

623
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
Not at all.

624
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,280
This time, the whole market saw

625
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,640
that Yeesoon hurt herself
to frame Kamduang.

626
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,080
The townsfolk say

627
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,000
she beat herself badly

628
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,120
until her tooth broke
and blood spilled from her mouth,

629
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,560
then claimed Kamduang
had attacked her mercilessly.

630
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,520
Yet both of Kamduang's hands
were still covered in star anise powder.

631
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,280
It was clear as day
she didn't lay a hand on her.

632
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,840
Yeesoon fabricated everything
and lied to the whole market.

633
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,160
Let's set that matter aside for now, Sir.

634
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,440
I have something urgent to request of you.

635
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,440
What is it?

636
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,720
I've drawn an analysis
of the culprit's face.

637
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,360
Khun Pra Saming has reviewed it

638
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,320
and suggested we have it copied
then post wanted notices around the city.

639
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,040
Khun Pra Yong,

640
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,880
please help arrange this.

641
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,480
Very well. I'll handle it immediately.

642
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,000
Thank you, Sir.

643
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,000
WANTED

644
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,120
WANTED

645
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,800
Hey… this face looks familiar.
I've seen him before.

646
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,560
Yes, I thought the same.

647
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,960
Let's go.

648
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,480
Hey! Stop!

649
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,720
You can go.

650
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,160
The authorities
have issued a warrant for me.

651
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,000
You knew that, didn't you?

652
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,120
Khun Aek

653
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,240
has information about me.

654
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,680
Why didn't you tell me?

655
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,200
And you copied my portrait.

656
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,440
Why?

657
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,080
Chief…

658
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
I'm sorry.

659
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,400
Why are you hiding this from me?

660
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,840
I…

661
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,040
I…

662
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,480
I…

663
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,440
You copied my portrait

664
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,800
to bargain for the antidote
for your mother, didn't you?

665
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,920
Yes…

666
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,080
You know

667
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,920
how you'll be punished, don't you?

668
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,680
Mom!

669
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,280
Ping.

670
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,760
Ugh.

671
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Ping.

672
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,120
- Ping.
- Mom.

673
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,800
I'm sorry.

674
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,120
I told him about the paper you hid.

675
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,360
Why, Mom?

676
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,600
I feared

677
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,280
if he discovered it himself,

678
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,040
he would kill you. I was afraid…

679
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,040
Mom.

680
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,240
What did he do to you?

681
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,560
He fed me more poison…

682
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,080
If you want the antidote,

683
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,840
you'll do a job for me first.

684
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,640
What job? Tell me, Chief.

685
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,160
I'll do anything.

686
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,240
Kill Khun Aek.

687
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,680
You must kill him.

688
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,240
Only then will you get the antidote.

689
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,600
If you fail,

690
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,480
you know exactly

691
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,400
who will have to die, don't you?

692
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,080
Help me… My stomach hurts…

693
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,920
Help me.

694
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,240
It hurts so much…

695
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,800
Help…

696
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,800
Mom…

697
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,360
Aoy, Yip.

698
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,840
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

699
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,720
What would you like more of?

700
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,320
What are you two talking about?

701
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,760
We were just chatting idly, Sir.

702
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,760
I feel like I'm living
in a house full of mutes.

703
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,440
Nobody talks.

704
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,240
If you two want to talk
about anything, just go ahead.

705
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,240
At least bring
some voices into this place,

706
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,880
instead of silence like a graveyard.

707
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,200
Yes, Sir.

708
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,400
Well… Yip and I were talking

709
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,800
about the ghost Krasue, Sir.

710
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,600
Aoy said

711
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,120
the Krasue loves hanging around toilets,

712
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,680
eating filth

713
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,680
instead of food.

714
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,280
I don't really believe it though, Sir.

715
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,000
My mother saw it with her own eyes.

716
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,120
Krasue eating
and devouring waste in the toilet.

717
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,160
Then wouldn't the whole village know

718
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,200
who the Krasue is?

719
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,920
The stench would stick
to her face and mouth,

720
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,360
no matter how she washes.

721
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,520
Why wouldn't it wash off?

722
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,880
When you go to the fields,

723
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,680
does the smell
of dung cling to you all day?

724
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,640
It's not the same, Grandma.

725
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,040
- Why not?
- Because inside our mouths…

726
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,600
There are gaps between our teeth.

727
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,320
The filth sticks in those gaps!

728
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,760
Whoa!

729
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,080
Because you two keep fighting
and won't speak to each other,

730
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,720
now I have to sit here listening to this
while I eat. Do you think this is good?

731
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,480
I apologize, Father.

732
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,120
Today Khun Pra Yong told me you fought
with Yeesoon again at the market.

733
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,440
What exactly did Khun Pra Yong say?

734
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,680
He said everyone saw that Yeesoon
hurt herself and falsely accused you.

735
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,120
Finally, you understand me.

736
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,120
Yes.

737
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,800
I understand there must be
some misunderstanding.

738
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,080
Yeesoon is not that kind of woman.

739
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,320
Do you think I really slapped her?

740
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,720
No.

741
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,880
But I still can't figure out
what truly happened.

742
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,080
No matter what happens,
you always side with Yeesoon.

743
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,400
If you've already decided

744
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,240
she's flawless and virtuous,

745
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,040
then don't talk to me about this

746
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,840
because whatever I say

747
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,280
won't reach your ears anyway.

748
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,600
Oh?

749
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,880
Go on then. Tell your Krasue story.

750
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,400
Even if it makes me want to throw up,
it's still easier to bear.

751
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,040
What's wrong with you?
Instead of resting in a fine house,

752
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,880
why would you lie out here like this?

753
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,760
Stop talking. I don't want to hear it.

754
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,760
I thought a Khun
would be smarter than the others.

755
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,400
Did Kamduang hurt Yeesoon again, Sir?

756
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,480
Not at all.
This time, the whole market saw

757
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,520
that Yeesoon hurt herself
to frame Kamduang.

758
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,280
Kamduang?

759
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,400
What's that noise?

760
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,680
Dear!

761
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,120
Hurry up. Run, sir.

762
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,360
I can't leave Kamduang.

763
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,720
Ah!

764
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,520
Kamduang.

765
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,240
I've found a way
to counter your technique.

766
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,360
And you? Can you counter mine?

767
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,320
Vet Yoy, go help Kamduang.

768
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,360
Yes, sir.

769
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,760
Oh no.

770
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,520
Dear!

771
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,480
Does it hurt badly?

772
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,720
<i>My name is Shaman Dum.</i>

773
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,240
Srichai sent me to thank you, Khun Men.

774
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,720
<i>The nobleman handling the gun purchase</i>

775
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,440
<i>is Khun Aek Itthirit.</i>

776
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,840
<i>He's injured now.</i>

777
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,600
Please rest, Dear.

778
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,040
I'll take care of you.

779
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,600
Use your sorcery.

780
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,960
Finish him.

781
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,920
<i>I'll make it look like an illness…</i>

782
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,280
<i>until he dies.</i>

783
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,600
- Ugh!
- <i>What madness is this?</i>

784
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,080
Khun Aek still hasn't recovered
from his strange illness, has he?

785
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,320
Could it be

786
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,480
black magic?

787
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,760
Being attacked by assassins
in your own home is ridiculous enough,

788
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,360
now sorcery too?

789
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,000
If I die,

790
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,920
please take care of Aek for me.

791
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,200
