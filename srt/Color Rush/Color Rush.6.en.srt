No, Aunt. I made a friend.

- Neon
- Neon?

58
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,090
Because the original color was mixed with luminescence.

59
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,860
That is blue mixed with luminescence, so it's neon blue.

[Ultra Marine Masterpiece Special Exhibition]

63
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,700
In the past, ultramarine, a type of blue paint, was an expensive paint.

64
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,390
At that time, Europe had to import lapis lazuli.
(T/N: lapis lazuli is a deep-blue metamorphic rock.)

65
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:50,480
For the reason that it was made from lapis lazuli from beyond the sea, the name ultramarine was given.

66
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,820
It was popular for its vivid blue color before the development of synthetic dye.

67
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,780
If we were to calculate the cost today, it would be about $1,500 for 1 kg.

68
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,790
In the past, due to its expensive cost, noble clients

69
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,290
would buy the paint for painters and inspect to see if they were using it properly.

70
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,220
It must've been an ordeal.

71
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,870
In the painting, the blue color was used to express Virgin Mary's clothes.

72
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,040
And that over there...

73
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,030
The reason why the sky is clear and not blue was to save the paint.

74
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,450
However, lapis lazuli isn't that expensive.

75
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,530
Lapis lazuli?

76
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,030
That's what they call chunggeumsuk now.
(T/N: chunggeumsuk is lapis lazuli in Korean.)

77
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,340
A lot of lapis lazuli was used to make the ultramarine pigment.

78
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,720
At that time, it was expensive because it had to be quarried from Afghanistan.

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,130
Now, well, they don't even consider it a gem or a semi-precious metal.

I have one lying around at my house. Do you want to see it?

Yes, I want to see it.

Then, come over to my house next time.
