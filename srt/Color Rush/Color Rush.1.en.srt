00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,350
My aunt doesn't recall the fact that mom was wearing a headband the day she disappeared.

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,530
But I do.

7
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,870
However, because I'm Mono,

8
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,120
I don't know what color headband it was.

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,210
I see things in the shades of gray, so I can't say.

13
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,580
A man in his forties kidnapped and kept a woman in her thirties captive.

14
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,790
According to the people around him, he is a Mono,

15
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,330
and became obsessed with the kidnapped victim because when he saw her, he was able to identify colors.

16
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:10,580
People with a monochromatic vision, those who see the world only in shades of gray, are called Mono.

17
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,500
We're different from those who have total color blindness.

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,550
Our cone cells aren't impaired, but our brains can't distinguish the colors.
(T/N: cone cells are the cells in the retina that identify colors.)

19
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,470
We are able to see colors if we look at a certain someone.

20
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:33,150
And that person... who opens up the world of colors is known as Probe.

21
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:40,050
The issue is that it's very rare for a Mono and Probe to meet

22
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,820
and there are some who don't ever get a chance to meet.

23
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,830
Monos show strong obsession towards Probes because they worry that they will lose the ability to see colors again

24
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,800
and their obsession results in crimes.

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,140
It's only right for Monos and Probes to never meet one another.

26

You don't even date.

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,730
I hit a boy who teased me about being a Mono, and now I'm transferring to a new school, once again.

34
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,140
I don't know who it is but someone threatened to kill me if I look into the mono case again.

I may not be able to, but I can still feel one's vibe.

104
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,170

Why?

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,750
Is it because you can see colors now?

Still, you should take your medicine.

I was fascinated by how the moonlight could shine on the water.

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:57,320
♫  I never once forgot your words ♫

160
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,860
♫  The words I ♫

161
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,440
[Color Rush]

162
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,800
♫  I'm going to confess to you now  ♫

163
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,460
♫  More than any words  ♫

164
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,980
♫  I can hear your breathing as I close my eyes  ♫

165
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,270
♫  I'm going to remember every word you said  ♫

166
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:28,520
♫  I'll wait for you every day, right here  ♫

167
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,460
♫  The reason nights are brighter  ♫

168
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,850
♫  is because you're here
There is no other reason  ♫

169
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:46,890
♫  In this quiet moment, I'll fall asleep thinking about you  ♫

170
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,940
♫  You probably won't know about my feelings  ♫

171
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,160
♫  My day filled with you  ♫

172
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,930
♫  Now grab my hand and let's fly that sky  ♫
