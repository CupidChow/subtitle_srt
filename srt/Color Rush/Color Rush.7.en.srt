163
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,990
If you're okay looking at me without a mask, doesn't that mean you like me?

164
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,560
Aren't you going to turn the lights off?

165
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,590
Fine, don't turn them off.

166
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,190
I'm fine looking at your face all night.

167
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,970
I'll turn it off.

168
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,360
Honestly, I like your color moving.

169
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,100
I like it when you reach out like a little kid when you see the colors.

170
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,070
When I teach you the colors, your lips open slightly,

171
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,130
and I like the excitement on your face.

172
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,430
I also like it when you get all defensive when teased and sigh as you let things be.

173
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,550
Even how easily you get provoked.

174
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,130
But, I couldn't tell you these things

175
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,410
because I felt like you would run away.

176
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,230
Whenever I saw you, you had an expression you couldn't hide.

177
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,700
It was the same expression trainees had right before they left the agency.

178
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,870
Let go of me!

179
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,390
Why are you acting like this?

180
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,060
I tried to stop having feelings for you

181
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,940
and acted like everything was fine to hide that fact.

182
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,430
Don't I have that same expression on my face right now, too?

183
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,100
What?

184
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,450
I ran away, Yeon Woo.

185
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,210
There's probably an uproar back home in Seoul.

186
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:31,620
♫ This time, this love. I’ll remember this moment I’m with you ♫

187

♫ I’m crush on your eyes ♫

188
