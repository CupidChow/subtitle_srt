I can breathe better now. Before, I felt like I was suffocating.

Don't touch a stranger without permission.

7

No. We're not strangers anymore.

00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,500
I'm sorry to say this but—

10
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,780
You don't look like you're sorry.

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,320
Fine, I'm not sorry. I never wanted to meet my Probe

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,550
nor did I intend to and never will.

13
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,730
Is it because I'm the Probe?

14
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't care about who it is. I just want to live in peace.

You still need to rest.

Can you look at me?

19

Don't look at me like that.

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,680
Should I show you my face? Then, you can see colors.

21

I don't need this!

22
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,860
It's better for you not to get involved with Monos.

23
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,660
- Why?
- Because...

24
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,040
there are cases where Monos kidnapped their Probes, killed those in their lives,

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,430
and ate their Probes after killing them.

26
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,160
Don't you get how serious this situation is?

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,740
No, not really.

I like your eyes when you're experiencing a color rush.

29

Let's make a deal. I'll teach you the colors of this world,

30

and in return, you'll show me the color moving of your eyes.

I'm not interested.

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,360
Are you a Mono?

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes, I am.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,020
I knew it.

36
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,210
For now, we told the others you fainted after seeing a ghost.

37
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,220
A ghost?

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,370
We figured that's better than everyone knowing you're a Mono.

39
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,480
- Did grandpa Min Jae—
- You're right.

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,360
It's the spirit of a grandpa that possessed Min Jae.

41
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,350
Last year, some bullies picked a fight with Min Jae thinking he was a Mono,

42
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,830
and Min Jae went, "Don't you ride that motorcycle!"

43
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,200
to one guy. Then, to those standing beside him, he went,

44
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,520
"Don't you stare at that tree, and don't you get on the back of that motorcycle."

45
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,010
Like that.

46
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,620
At that time, what he said got them all worked up,

47
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,730
however, that very weekend while riding the motorcycle, they collided

48
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,340
with a truck at the intersection.

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,490
One ended up under the truck, while the other was nowhere to be seen.

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,810
As their friends and the police looked everywhere for him.

51
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,730
one of their friends fainted from shock.

52
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,380
It turns out that the one riding on the back flew straight into...

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,720
a tree. His tongue was hanging long.

54
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,650
That's why our school doesn't have bullies anymore.

55

If anyone bothers you, the grandpa spirit of Min Jae...

56

I told you that isn't the case.

57

My grandpa just has the ability to see the future a little, that's all.

58

That's what he said.

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,320
That's true. Even if he's a ghost, how powerful could an old ghost be?

60

Still, if anyone picks a fight with you, we'll be there to fend them off.

Because we're friends. Isn't it obvious?

- Can't you say it quietly?

- Yes.
