00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,640
♫  This time, this love. When the whole world shines on me  ♫

160
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,760
♫  I'll find wherever you go ♫

161
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:50,890
♫ Take me up, where I want. So I can be even freer ♫

162
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,590
♫  This time, this love. I'll remember this moment I'm with you ♫

163
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,330
♫  Just stay with me  ♫

164
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:11,160
♫  This time, this love. When the whole world shines on me  ♫
