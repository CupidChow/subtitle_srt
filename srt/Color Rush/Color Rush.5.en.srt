00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,600
Go Yoo Han said he won't make it to school today.

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,840
Why are you telling me that?

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,680
He told me to tell you.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,940
He said it in a way that made me not want to tell you, but that's what he basically said.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,420
He told me to tell you that he can't come today.

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,020
He could've just told me directly. Why did he ask Jung Joo Haeng to tell me?

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,340
Let go!

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,720
Why are you acting like this?

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,740
I had the thought

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,180
that I wanted to lock you up.

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,680
He must be avoiding me. He realized the dangers of a Mono.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,210
I didn't want to know, but he's using me because I'm the class president.

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,950
I really don't want to know.

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,820
Gosh! I'm suffering from being friends with someone like him.

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,720
Hey, Yeon Woo. Can you hold this? Hurry.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,980
Hurry up and come over here.

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,820
- Like this?
-Yeah.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,960
Let me see...

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,030
- How is it? It's perfect, right?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,360
It's perfect.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,560
Joo Haeng, you're the class president for a reason.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,520
Of course.

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,680
Attention!

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,980
Today, we'll be learning about Korean poems.

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,710
Let's turn to page 171.

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,880
- Class president!
- Yes?

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,590
Wake him up.

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,990
Never mind. Page 171. Class president, can you read it aloud?

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,850
- These are some great friends.
- Yes.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,880
A day without Go Yoo Han was quiet, peaceful,

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,250
and truthfully, boring.

36
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,360
When Go Yoo Han was spitting nonsense, I was hoping he would go away.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,460
♫ Hug me so I’m not alone ♫

♫ Hold me so I won’t fall ♫

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,260
I'm feeling his absence only because I just got used to his presence.

40
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:00,600
When I walked around the school field during lunchtime alone, it was so peaceful that it felt weird.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,450
I felt anxious like I was procrastinating or pushing something off.

My Yeon Woo is the most tender beef.
(T/N: he means that Yeon Woo is tender-hearted.)

47
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,510
Have you ever played with color?

48
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,090
No, I haven't. Why?

How in the world do you play with color?

51
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,570
Rather than never being able to see color again,

52
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,930
I didn't like the feeling of loss the moment the colors started fading.

53
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,960
What do I do if he leaves

54

we were looking at the same world.
