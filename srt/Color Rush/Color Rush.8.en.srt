[Color Rush]
[Episode 8]

5
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,570
What are you talking about? Did you leave your agency?

6
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,610
I don't want to debut.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Because of me...

8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,540
It's not because of you. It's something I've been thinking about for a while now.

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,670
I was so busy thinking about myself that I never once thought about

10
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,730
your worries, your future, and your life.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,100
- Not even once?
- No.

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,380
How could you run away, though? Are you really okay with this?

13
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,800
As you can see,

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,480
to save you, Yeon Woo, who has never once thought about my life,

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,870
I went to the hospital even when I'm on the run.

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,060
With that being said, let's sleep in the same—

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,860
Sorry!

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,640
After hitting me again, you're only sorry?

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,850
But... we can't sleep in the same bed.

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,450
Why?

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,080
I... don't know.

22
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,400
That's right. We're both on the run.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,880
Still, we'll see the ocean tomorrow for the first time as a couple.

24
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,850
Sleep well.

25
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,830
When I was younger, I didn't understand the concept of foam.

26
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,880
Really?

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,440
But as I got older, I realized it was just a bunch of bubbles.

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,660
There's probably more of those, right?

29
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,920
Things that seem like something but are meaningless.

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,490
Nothing's meaningless when I'm with you.

31
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,860
You're so cheesy.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,750
Cheesy?

33
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,520
♫ Hug me so I’m not alone ♫

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,170
♫ Hold me so I won’t fall ♫

35
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,270
What color is this ocean?

36
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,840
Right now?

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,320
Colors don't ever stay the same.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,120
Like you?

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,490
No. Like you.

40
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,580
♫ I’ll remember ♫

41
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,150
Go Yoo Han's eyes are usually caramel-colored, but there are times they shine brightly

42
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,500
and times they fall into a darker shade.

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,450
Wouldn't that be the same for the ocean?

44
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,720
Over there. That dark blue color is cobalt blue.

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,330
The blackish-blue in the middle is Prussian blue.

46
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,540
Over there. That purplish blue is indigo blue.

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,650
Due to its mysteriousness, cobalt blue was often used by Renaissance artists

48
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,420
and indigo blue was often used to dye fabric because people liked the color.

49
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,900
What about the Prussian blue in the middle?

50
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,630
It's the first synthetic pigment.

51
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,420
A chemist in Berlin made the color by accident.

52
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,740
But thanks to him, many can use it because it's cheap.

53
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,580
That's right. You said blue was very valuable... because of lapis lazuli.

54
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,280
I have one at home.

55
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,720
I'll definitely show you sometime later.

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,880
I would love to see it.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,100
Are there a lot of shades of blue?

58
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,120
It has the most shades out of all because blue is a popular color.

59
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,540
The shades that are named after an everyday object are: blue, teal,

60
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,550
water blue, sky blue,

61
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,850
cyan, cerulean blue, pastel blue,

62
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,100
powder blue, sky gray,

63
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,130
ocean blue, mint, Prussian blue,

64
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,690
indigo blue, cobalt blue, sapphire, navy.

65
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,170
There are other shades like azurite blue,

66
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,340
ultramarine, azure,

67
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,970
royal blue, French turquoise, turquoise,

68
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,430
empire blue, Indian blue,

69
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,760
aqua blue, marine blue,

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,230
lavender blue, Prussian blue,

71
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,490
Egyptian blue, Matisse blue,

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,230
lapis lazuli, majolica blue,

73
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,740
midnight blue, moonlight blue,

74
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,310
navy blue, Nile blue,

75
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,360
Spode blue, saxe blue,

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,260
Versailles.

77
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,290
What?

78
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,940
Why? Was there something strange among them?

79
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,180
There's still a lot of shades left.

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,140
Well... I thought I heard a word that didn't belong among the blues.

81
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,870
Which one?

82
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,190
Color names can come from people, regions,

83
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,150
and even countries.

84
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,460
I don't get which one seems misplaced.

85
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,660
- You said "sex" blue.
- Right.
 (T/N: he's talking about saxe blue. They sound the same but have a different spelling.)

86
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,680
That's the actual name?

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,630
It's named after Saxony, a state along Germany's Elbe River.

88
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,260
Sa-xe bl-ue.

89
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,880
S-a-x-e b-l-u-e.

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,700
- Oh, it's named after a region.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,680
It was a good approach.

92
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,720
Out of the seven deadly sins in Christianity, blue is said to symbolize lust.

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,000
So sex blue could exist.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,810
Yeon Woo, what do you think? Could that be my color?

95
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,030
I didn't know there could be this many shades of blue.

96
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,990
The world of color is as infinite as one's love for another.

97
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,990
Go Yoo Han, how did you memorize all of these?

98
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,360
Is that the end?

99
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,630
There's probably more if I search, but that's all I memorized.

100
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,050
That's amazing. How did you memorize all of these?

101
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,620
I can remember them all when I just think of you. All I want is to teach them to you.

102
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,520
♫ The words I kept to myself ♫

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,890
♫ I'm going to confess to you now ♫

104
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:50,210
♫ More than any words, when I close my eyes ♫

105
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,230
Why are you looking at me when you should be looking at the ocean?

106
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,050
It feels like a dream when I look at you.

107
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,240
That's what I wanted to say.

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,150
But he said it first.

109
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,740
- Do you think there's a payphone here?
- Why?

110
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm going to call my aunt.

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,250
If I don't, she might die from worrying.

112
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,460
Let's do that then.

113
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,380
Don't worry.

114
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,810
What? Really?

115
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,320
Then, Yoo Han—

116
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,810
I understand.

117
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,050
I said I understand!

118
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,680
What's wrong?

119
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,040
Why are you acting like this?

120
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,530
Go back to Seoul quickly.

121
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,630
Was your aunt really angry?

122
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,620
It's not my family but yours.

123
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,260
- Is your mom a congresswoman?
- Yes.

124
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,320
Your older sister is a judge, your older brother is a military officer,

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,770
and your dad's the chairman of Taejong Group?

126
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,630
Yes, they are.

127
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,520
What?

128
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,050
I'm hungry!

129
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,800
If you don't return by today, they're going to report me as your kidnapper.

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,230
The political world, the financial world, and the military world. Is there something like that?

131
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,940
Anyway, it seems they are all ready for action.

132
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,840
According to my aunt, the situation seemed like there was an arrest warrant in place for the Mono who kidnapped his Probe.

133
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,290
So, how can you eat?

134
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,580
In a situation like this, we need to eat to gain strength.

135
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,430
Okay.

136
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,340
You should eat a lot.

137
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,830
Here you go.

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,070
I couldn't reach you, and you didn't show up to school, so I asked,

139
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,370
and your aunt told me you will be transferring because you were very obsessed with me.

140
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,380
The congresswoman in my family thinks that since you may have a plan to kidnap me,

141
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,360
she'll stop you from approaching me.

142
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,310
So I thought about it... and there's only one answer.

143
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,580
Finding me and running away?

144
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,030
So that's how we ended up like this.

145
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,370
But, it's dangerous for a Probe to be around a Mono.

146
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,100
Both your mom and my aunt are right.

147
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,150
I shouldn't be allowed to be around you.

148
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,170
That's what is right.

149
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,010
A restraining order is only for when both parties are alive.

150
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,520
Who cares about that when you were willing to die for me?

151
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,100
I like you.

152
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,480
But, I'll obsess over you, I'll doubt you,

153
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,080
and end up killing you.

154
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,210
It's right to stay away from me.

155
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,120
Yeon Woo, do you want to know a secret?

156
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,120
The truth is I can't identify people's faces.

157
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,160
I have prosopagnosia, a condition that prevents me from even recognizing Jung Joo Haeng, a friend since elementary school.
(T/N: prosopagnosia is a neurological condition characterized by the inability to recognize the faces of familiar people.)

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,020
That's me.

159
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,690
I was smart though, so I was able to distinguish them

160
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,210
by their voice, gaits, clothes, and habits.

161
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,980
But, I was able to tell you apart.

162
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,810
It was the first time I could distinguish someone's face.

163
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:14,300
When our eyes meet, and I see your color moving, I can recognize you.

164
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,010
♫ You don’t have to worry ♫

165

166
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,750
♫ When our eyes meet, I am reborn ♫

167
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,940
♫ It feels like the whole world is spreading
Yeah, just like a picture ♫

168
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,940
♫ Take my hand, I’ll let you go ♫

169
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,450
♫ So you can be even more freer ♫

170

♫ This time, this love ♫

171
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,100
So that's why you wanted to see my color moving.

172
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,630

♫ This time, this love ♫

175
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,020
When you look at me... when you look at me...

176
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,180
when you face me, your eyes whisper to me.

177
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,220
They whisper to me.

178
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,800
Then, I can picture your face, and that face is what I see.

179
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,770
When you're not around, I picture you over and over again. Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of times.

180
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
But I can't recognize you when I do that.

181
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,950
But as soon as I see you, I can be sure

182
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,780
♫ On meaningless days ♫

183
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,840
that you're Choi Yeon Woo.

184
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,490
Telling me that I'm the only one he can distinguish.

185
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,880
The fact that he can't picture my face when we're apart.

186
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,320
Why he told me not to run away from him. Why I can't run from him.

187
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,860
It explains everything.

188
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,430
I can't picture colors without you either.

189
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,090
You're one of a kind to me too.

Do I leave your side, or is it okay for me not to?

193
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,850
Is my mom alive, or do I have to give up hope?

194
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,490
Do you like me or curiosity got the best of you?

195
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:30,300
Can you really not distinguish people's faces or is it that you just can't remember them?

196
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,770
Am I obsessed with you because you're my Probe

197

or am I obsessed with my Probe because it's you?

198
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,590
When our eyes meet, is my world changing

199
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,380
or am I being dragged to yours?

200
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,350
Why is it that I want to see your face but can't face you properly?

201
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,410
I hate feeling confused.

Did you talk to them? Is everything okay?

205
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,050
If I return home today, they'll forget everything without questioning it.

206
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,100
That's great!

207
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,720
Everything worked out smoothly when I told them I was going to quit being a trainee and study with you.

208
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,770
I guess we'll only be at the library when we go back to Seoul.

209
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,530
Really?

210
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,290
Then, how about we go study after a meal?

211
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,400
Okay, but I'm not going to study even at the library.

212
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Fine. Let's go.

213
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,860
Auntie! This is my lunch for today! I'm going to eat it with Yoo Han.

214
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,690
Are you playing house with Go Yoo Han with the allowance I'm giving you?

215
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,970
You should know I'm completely against this. I'm going to eat it all. Give me everything.

216
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,810
What?

217
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,110
Eat slowly. You're going to choke.

218
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,460
Here. It's all yours. It's all yours.

219
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm bitter because you said this is Go Yoo Han's lunch box.

220
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,660
I'm your aunt.

221
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,920
Sorry, sorry. I like you more.

222
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,000
We were able to go back to how it was.

223
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,620
For Yoo Han, who has face blindness (prosopagnosia), and for me, who is color-blind,

224
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,820
to be together and live like other ordinary people,

225
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,800
I'm thankful, and it feels like a miracle.

226
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,170
The gray world I see now contains the excitement that I'll see color very soon.

227
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,300
I don't get why our home room teacher had you (Kim Se Hyun) do this when she could've told Jung Joo Haeng to do it.

228
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,190
I'm Jung Joo Haeng, you brat.

229
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,670
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,750
You never unbutton your shirt even in the hottest weather.

231
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,140
Also, what's with your gypsy style hair?

232
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,520
Get lost. You can't even recognize your friend.

233
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,990
Alright. Keep up with the good work.

234
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,100
You saw that, right?

235
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,130
It's a secret that everyone in this school knows, but I was wondering if I should tell you or not.

236
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,460
But I guess you know now.

237
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,170
Go Yoo Han's secret everybody in this school knows?

238
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,970
He has prosopagnosia which prevents him from recognizing even his childhood friend.

239
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,530
He can't distinguish people apart.

240
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,610
I shouldn't be telling you this.

241
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,100
Hey Min Jae.

242

The grandpa is only telling you this so Yeon Woo can play hooky.

Please send my thanks to Grandfather.

I'll definitely buy you a red bean jelly bar later.

246
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,930
- I'm leaving.
- Goodbye.

247
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,330
Let's go.

248
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,130
Where are they going?

What is 2467?

250
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,950
