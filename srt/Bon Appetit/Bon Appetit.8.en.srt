[To Yoonsoo,
I just got home and I ate the leftover kimbap. This is the best kimbap that I've had aside from the one that my mom made for me. Since I was a kid, when I saw my mum make the kimbap, I wondered why she worked so hard to make this. I thought it'd be easier to mix it like bibimbap. It was till today, thanks to you, I found the answer. Because I understood that when making kimbap, the ingredients put onto it are all full of love. Yoonsoo, I'm always grateful to you and I love you.]

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,380
To Yoonsoo.

5
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,170
I just got home and I ate the leftover kimbap.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,370
This is the best kimbap that I've had

7
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,230
aside from the one that my mom made for me.

8
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,320
Since I was a kid, when I saw my mum make the kimbap,

9
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,030
I wondered why she worked so hard to make this.

10
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,590
I thought it'd be easier to mix it like bibimbap.

11
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,240
It was till today, thanks to you, I found the answer.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,289

the ingredients put onto it are all full of love.

14
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,630
Yoonsoo, I'm always grateful to you and I love you.

16
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,169
Is Mr. Han coming today?

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,460
The chair we are setting up is where he will be sitting on.

18
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,410
I guess you didn't make up yesterday.

19
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,170
No, we made up.

20
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,380
But you don't look like it.

21
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,250
I'm tired, that's why.

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,690
You look pale.

23
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,160
Do I?

24
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,260
Yes.

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,700
Mr. Jung.

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,390
What happened to your leg?

27
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,680
I sprained my ankle while dancing.

28
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,810
The lunch will be catered here today, right?

29
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,170
Yes, that's right.

30
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,820
It'd come, right?

31
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,090
What? Are you asking me?

32
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,800
No, it'll come. It has to come.

33
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,260
Okay.

34
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm at fault too. But I'm wronged too.

35
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,120
No matter how much I ignored that person,

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,620
he's still doing what he wants. What can I do?

37
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,290
To someone who tried this hard,

38
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,310
how could Dohoon say that doesn't count as amazing food.

39
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,250
While thinking he's horrible,

40
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,190
I'm also worried that he's too busy to eat...

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,190
I mean. Nowadays, who works so much they don't get to eat?

42
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,890
No?

43
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,250
Yes.

44
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,570
It's a bad habit to skip meals.

45
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,610
Anyway, how could he forget to eat my food?

46
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,940
He's too arrogant.

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,900
I think he went too far.

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,010
I think I'm overreacting.

49
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,000
But I have to keep my word and go cater their food.

50
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,990
If I go, he might apologize to me.

51
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,390
I mean, you have to keep your promise.

52
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,710
If not, I was going to fly to Jeju Island last night.

53
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,020
I guess I will pack this place up after I do the catering

54
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,200
and take the night flight.

55
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,050
Isn't there only a few days left to your restaurant's opening?

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,140
That's why I wanted to clear my mind in Jeju Island

57
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,000
and decide on the menu, as well as the name of the restaurant.

58
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,890
Joowon, I'm sorry.

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,070
But I don't have time to cook for you today.

60
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,620
Come tonight.

61
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,210
Okay.

62
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,190
Leave quickly since you got it.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,420
Okay.

64
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,570
Okay, I'm leaving. Good luck.

65
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,760
Mr. Jung.

66
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,230
You're waiting for the director and the actor, right?

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,230
Sangwoo, can I ask you something on my mind?

68
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,670
Of course.

69
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,580
As long as it's not about love.

70
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,920
As you know, there isn't anyone whom I can talk about my thoughts to.

71
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,060
Please help listen to my worries.

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,380
The misunderstanding between me and Yoon Soo was resolved yesterday,

73
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,030
but I made a mistake.

74
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,650
I don't know how to apologize.

75
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,330
Are you asking me?

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,770
You've gone too far.

77
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,410
I'm sorry. But there's no one else I can talk to about this.

78
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,000
Then let's pretend you didn't hear anything.

79
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,010
Fine.

80
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,490
I'm jealous.

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,340
I will just say it simply and leave out the details.

82
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,190
It's simple.

83
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,560
Gift is the simplest and easy way.

84
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,370
You have to move them with something he really likes.

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,840
You may think that this might not make them stop being angry

86
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,360
but sometimes it works.

87
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,860
Do you know why?

88
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,020
Because it's commendable and cute.

89
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,840
But it's not as easy as it looks.

90
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,480
Because we don't know what they like.

91
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,180
Here's what's important.

92
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,800
You have to be careful not to lose your dignity.

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,300
I don't even know what the person I like likes,

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
what have I been doing?

95
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,990
Am I qualified to love him?

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,710
What am I good at?

97
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,020
When you think about things like that,

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
then it's game over.

99
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,100
Oh. I think they're here.

100
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,440
Okay.

101
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,200
-Show that. -Okay.

102
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,340
Show the exhaustion and desperation.

103
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,300
-Desperation? -Yes.

104
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,430
There will be a twist in the end.

105
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,140
Put the subtitles on.

106
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,770
Okay?

107
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,510
Yes.

108
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,940
Hello.

109
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,530
Please help them with their makeup.

110
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,500
Try to make his nose look higher.

111
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,950
You're so handsome.

112
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,190
Please make it a more harmonious atmosphere.

114
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,270
Okay?

115
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,700
-Thank you. -Yes.

116
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,840
You're so handsome.

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,220
Thank you.

118
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,510
Mr. Jung, he's here to cater food.

119
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,320
Go take a look. Hurry up.

120
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,290
You're here?

121
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,880
Do I just have to bring it in?

122
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,540
Why are you speaking politely?

123
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm worried that I'll make things difficult for you.

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,300
You can just move in.

125
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,500
I can do it myself.

126
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,380
Go ahead with your work. Aren't you busy?

127
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,840
Are you... free tonight?

128
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,720
I have plans tonight.

129
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,830
What time are your plans?

130
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,300
I'm going to the airport around 8 p.m.

131
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,100
Why are you going to the airport?

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,050
There's something I need to do. Do you have anything else to say?

133
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,760
No, go ahead.

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,680
Aren't you going to help him?

135
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,360
He's still mad about what happened yesterday.

136
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,850
Mr. Jung.

137
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,720
You have to be careful right now.

138
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,040
If you say something wrong,

139
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,480
something that can be solved in a few hours

140
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
can become a matter of months.

141
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,270
Do you have an idea of what he might like yet?

142
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750
No, I don't.

143
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,750
Also, this is work,

144
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,990
but if you put something in Mr. Han's mouth,

145
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,180
he'll might take it easier.

146
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,530
Should we buy some cookies or drinks?

147
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,100
There are things that are more easy to eat right?

148
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,780
I think candy or chocolates work.

149
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,810
Right, chocolate.

150
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,340
Yoonsoo likes sweets.

151
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,530
Chocolate and marshmallow. Okay.

152
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,510
I like chocolate too.

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,210
I heard you picked the catering company.

154
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,300
Yes.

155
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,770
I can be sure that it will taste good.

156
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,340
It's not easy to invite him.

157
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,560
Is that handsome guy the chef?

158
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,410
He's so handsome. I'm going crazy.

159
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,380
Okay, since the table has been set, let's have lunch.

160
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,670
Okay.

161
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,530
Let's go. Quick.

162
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,470
Enjoy your meal. Gain strength!

163
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,450
I've gained strength even without eating it.

164
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,340
Enjoy your meal and gain strength.

165
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,400
Thank you.

166
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,790
Enjoy your meal and all the best.

167
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,730
Okay.

168
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,490
I don't care if you eat or not.

169
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,680
Whose dog is barking?

170
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,060
Enjoy your meal and be full of energy.

171
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you.

172
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,750
Dohoon, why aren't you eating?

173
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,700
My stomach's not feeling well today. I'll go out for a while.

174
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,130
Enjoy.

175
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,330
That's weird.

176
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,640
I think I've had this dakkangjeong before.

177
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,940
Mr. Nam.

178
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,080
I think the same thing.

179
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,980
We had dakkanjeong a while ago, didn't we?

180
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,870
It's that taste...

181
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,640
Ah... That spicy dakkanjeong?

182
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,190
The person who packed that dakkanjeong...

183
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,150
So I have the same taste as Mr. Jung.

184
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,940
He's the closest to my ideal type.

185
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,320
Why does it have to be...

186
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,550
It seems you're jumping the gun.

187
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,440
I don't think they're dating yet.

188
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,470
Why? Do you know something?

189
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,750
Mr. Jung is very popular.

190
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,750
There's someone in our company who likes him too.

191
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,160
Really?

192
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
There's no way I wouldn't have known. Who is it?

193
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,200
Could it be...

194
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,390
Me?

195
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,640
I have high standards for men.

196
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,820
No way right?

197
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,330
-Then that's Ms. Sung... -What?

198
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,090
Me? Not me either.

199
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,060
Oh? I don't think it's him.

200
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,930
Someone asked me to give it to you.

201
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,720
Who?

202
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,430
Who else? The chef, of course.

203
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,830
I'm not a puppy.

204
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,850
What kind of gesture was that?

205
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,940
Forget it.

206
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,930
I feel so guilty that I can't eat it anymore.

207
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,560
At this kind of time, you have to eat it.

208
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,890
Open your mouth.

209
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,830
You're eating so well.

210
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,260
You can really eat.

211
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,520
Do you like the food?

212
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,750
Yes.

213
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,230
You're so handsome...

214
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,470
No, it's so good.

215
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,930
It's better than hotel food.

216
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,050
Thank you.

217
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,890
Also... take care of Mr. Jung.

218
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,250
Mr. Jung kept saying it'll be delicious.

219
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,710
I guess what he said wasn't groundless.

220
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,510
What do you like about Mr. Jung?

221
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,340
I'm not sure. I can't pinpoint for sure.

222
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,800
There are too many points.

223
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,920
It's so sweet.

224
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,310
Mr. Han, you're here.

225
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,640
What are you eating outside by yourself?

226
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,600
Let's eat together if you haven't.

227
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,330
-Should we? -Yes.

228
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,030
Are the preparations done?

229
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,280
Mr. Han, did you eat?

230
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,530
Mr. Jung told me it's really delicious and told me to try.

231
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,610
So I'll try it.

232
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,270
It's so good. Go get one.

233
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,790
Where should I sit?

234
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,720
Here.

235
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,630
It's so-so.

236
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,250
What?

237
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,620
It's so bland. Did they not control the taste properly?

238
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,110
Do you not like anything?

239
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
What did you just say?

240
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,510
So it's too bland?

241
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,930
Do you want some salt?

242
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,270
Forget it.

243
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,180
I think it's someone else that should be salted.

244
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,980
When does the filming start?

245
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,570
If you think it's okay, we'll start right away.

246
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,120
In that case, I won't sit here. I'll sit there.

247
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,690
Hello, Director.

248
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,090
Hello.

249
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,120
Get up.

250
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,460
The land is right in front of you. Get up.

251
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,860
Get up, you punk!

252
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,560
How can you protect yourself when you're so weak?

253
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,600
Hey!

254
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,450
Do you have to say that to me? I'm a reserved soldier.

255
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,290
Cut!

256
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,530
I don't feel anything when I look at this scene.

257
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,080
At this stage, is he kidding? I can't even beat him up.

258
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,160
I was talking to myself. Did you hear it?

259
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,910
What did you just say?

260
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,100
I didn't mean to say it. I'm sorry.

261
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,600
As an advertiser,

262
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,670
is it wrong to say that the commercial tagline has no impact?

263
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,210
Also, that script,

264
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,380
"Get your shit together," that's your idea, isn't it?

265
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,470
I picked this cause the CEO said it sounded lively.

266
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,510
To be honest, it's nothing.

267
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,450
If you read it together with our product Taurine 2,

268
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,950
it reads "Taurine is shit," you punk.

269
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,910
Mr. Han, I'm sorry.

270
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,560
My employee made a huge mistake.

271
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,430
Ms. Sung, aren't you going to educate your employees?

272
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,780
Yesterday,

274
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,880
I didn't eat the kimbap that my beloved made for me.

275
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,440
But that person found out.

276
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,700
I said it was not any thing amazing,

277
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,030
why are you making a fuss?

278
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,860
What are you talking about?

279
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,950
Even if it's a common kimbap,

280
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,830
I should thank him for his hard work

281
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,160
and be polite to him.

282
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,470
But I didn't expect that I would say such nonsense.

283
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,080
What do you mean?

284
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,480
Now that you're against me,

285
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,320
I realized how mean I was.

286
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,500
Thanks to you. Thank you.

287
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,200
Are you crazy?

288
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,790
Do you want to leave this industry?

289
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,300
We couldn't sleep well for the past two months,

290
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,490
but you suddenly showed up in front of us,

291
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,530
saying, "Hey, the food is too bland,"

292
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,150
"Hey, your taglines aren't impactful."

293
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,410
It's rude of you to say that

294
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,109
and you look unprofessional.

295
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,240
So? So what?

296
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,480
We're shooting right now.

297
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,810
It'll be hard to change the plan for one person.

298
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,530
Are you crazy?

299
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,280
Who are you?

300
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,940
The person who made this food.

301
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,900
I deserve to be splashed by water for making it too bland.

302
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,760
Are you all in this together?

303
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,790
Are you trying to rebel today?

304
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,790
Stop the shoot!

305
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,500
You all ignored the advertisers' opinions.

306
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,670
This is a breach of contract.

307
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,910
Mr. Han.

308
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,240
Are you taking us as fools just because we are staying quiet?

309
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,020
Do you know what was in the video I just took with my phone?

310
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,550
As an advertiser,

311
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,080
you came to the set to make a scene, cussing at people, and even tried to assault someone.

312
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,210
This is straight up bullying.

313
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,310
With this, we are able to report this to the police.

314
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,540
Ms. Sung,

315
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,700
I won't let you off this time.

316
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,830
The Party A is not you but your company.

317
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,260
How dare you make fun of my best employee? How dare you!

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,060
Okay, just wait and see.

319
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,650
Well done.

320
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,210
Ms. Sung, will you be okay?

321
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,880
It's just cleaning out unnecessary trash at the set.

322
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,090
Good work, everyone.

323
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,590
I'm thirsty.

324
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,080
Mr. Jung, are you okay?

325
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,190
Sangwoo.

326
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,320
I'll go home quietly after looking over the situation later.

327
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,520
Please wrap it up for me.

328
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,800
Okay, don't worry.

329
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,570
Everyone.

330
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,570
I am deeply moved by how you cared for each other just now.

331
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,530
I also felt how we should

332
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,950
"Get our shit together" that we couldn't from the storyboard.

333
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,360
I will also "Get my shit together"!

334
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm going to burn myself with my acting skills today.

335
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,370
Okay, let's start right away.

336
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,700
Okay, get ready.

337
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,760
Action.

338
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,180
Gosh. My arm hurts.

339
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,360
Darn it.

340
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,680
All right.

341
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,370
All right.

342
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,120
Take it out and wrap it up.

343
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,000
Put it in the oven.

344
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,420
I don't have an oven though.

345
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,090
Oh right. I have an air fryer.

346
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,290
180 degrees. Preheat for 20.

347
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,950
And 30 more minutes.

348
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,950
Okay.

349
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Yoonsoo! Did everything go well?

350
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,800
Yes.

351
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,720
Did he apologize to you?

352
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,090
I thought he'd apologize. But he didn't seem like he thought of doing that.

353
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,890
I see. I'll be on my way!

354
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,040
No, let's have dinner together.

355
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,070
Aren't you going to Jeju Island?

356
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,420
I still have time.

357
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,200
Shall we eat ramyun? It's been a while.

358
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,660
Sounds good.

359
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,520
Have a seat.

360
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,700
Darn it. I screwed up, I screwed up.

361
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,240
What time is it?

362
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,020
7:30 p.m.

363
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,720
Damn it. Let's just go first.

364
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,460
Darn it.

365
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,200
[Opening on December 1, please come by then.]

366
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,020
Hello, I just moved in next door.

367
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,250
Nice to meet you.

368
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,700
Have we met before?

369
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,390
Yes, that's right.

370
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,270
I mean, I liked you.

371
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,550
Don't eat outside after work.

372
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,630
But come to my house to eat my food

373
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,920
and give me some comments.

374
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,330
Yoonsoo.

375
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,700
If you can look straight into my eyes, I'll give you a gift.

376
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,820
A gift?

377
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,610
This is the gift.

378
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,990
What are you doing?

379
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,720
I guess you don't like my gift.

380
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,570
Do you want to die?

381
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,240
I thought your hands looked cold.

382
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,360
It's so ambiguous, isn't it?

383
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,010
If you don't want to, just reject me.

384
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,380
Shut your eyes.

385
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,160
Open your mouth.

386
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,670
It's really delicious.

387
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,600
Right?

388
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,050
Forget it.

389
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,050
[Your mom's recipe and Yoonsoo's sincerity]

390
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,260
I'm sorry.

391
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,230
I didn't understand your feelings back then.

392
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,310
And said something wrong.

393
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,260
No. I was very sensitive too.

394
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,840
Are you really going to abandon me and leave this place?

395
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,330
Abandon what?

396
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm just going to go cool off my head for a while.

397
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,020
What are you holding?

398
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,610
It smells like it's burnt.

399
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,040
What is this?

400
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,710
You like chocolate and marshmallow.

401
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,080
So, as an apology,

402
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,500
I made a s'more cookie.

403
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,960
S'more cookie?

404
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,820
This is not the cookie I know.

405
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,610
It looks like a rock from the galaxy.

406
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,420
I didn't set the timer right it seems.

407
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,890
It started smoking,

408
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,370
but I thought I might not see you if I waited for it to cool down

409
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,110
so I carried it and ran here.

410
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,080
I wanted to show you the food I made.

411
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:55,660
I appreciate your kindness. I will forgive all the wrong things you've done.

412
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,470
In this situation, the heat didn't get to the center completely,

413
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,250
so it'll taste better.

414
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,620
Let's break it up and check.

415
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,240
It's cooked through. Shall we try it?

416
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay.

417
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,910
How is it?

418
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,360
It's surprisingly delicious.

419
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,600
Including the chocolate inside, the marshmallow and the flour,

420
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,420
seem to be fighting with each other as to who's softer.

421
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,210
Of course, though it's zero points for a s'more cookie.

422
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,250
But it's full marks for a smooth cookie.

423
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,060
There's something called the smooth cookie?

424
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,810
I just came up with it.

425
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,200
What?

426
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,620
I think the beauty about food is, there isn't a fixed answer.

427
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,850
So food is similar to life.

428
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,450
All the dining tables in the world are filled with life.

429
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,710
Although it's not s'more cookie,

430
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,700
it has birthed smooth cookie,

431
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,470
containing our emotions,

432
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,520
so I really like it. It's the best!

433
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,680
I should make this into a dessert.

434
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,310
No.

435
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,830
Your shop will close down.

436
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,420
Speaking of which, have you decided on the menu?

437
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,580
I thought about it more or less

438
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,160
but I can't figure out a name for the restaurant yet.

439
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,680
Is there a concept you want to go for?

440
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,200
Something that's classic but mordern.

441
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,260
So what you want is an elegant

442
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,540
and novel name, right?

443
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,850
Yes, that's right.

444
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,760
I'm an expert in this.

445
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,290
It a name that suits a Korean course restaurant.

446
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,320
What is it?

447
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,190
Give it to me.

448
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,660
[Bon Appetit]

449
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,510
How is it?

450
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,700
Bon Appetit?

451
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,240
This is French.

452
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,430
Enjoy your food.

453
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,270
You're a genius advertiser.

454
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,810
How did you come up with this idea?

455
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,030
It's a Korean restaurant, but it's in French.

456
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,940
It's a creative idea that breaks common sense.

457
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,020
I'll give you a lifetime free coupon.

458
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,580
Really?

459
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,040
Then I'm quitting.

460
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,730
I'll be a waiter here.

461
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,850
No. Just stay by my side

462
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,730
and enjoy my food.

463
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,000
Thank you.

464
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,060
But you have to wash the dishes.

465
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,540
I love you.

466
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,780
Me too.

467
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,260
[Please enjoy.]
