00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,210
Yoon Soo, I brought you a towel.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,920
I brought you a towel.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,770
What are you doing?

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,740
Dohoon.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,800
If you don't like it, just refuse.

7
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,980
[Choi Minjoon]

8
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,140
Give me a minute.

9
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,820
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

10
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,390
Were you toying with me?

11
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,920
Toying with you? What do you mean?

12
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,470
You said you didn't like me at first,

13
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,610
but then I reciprocated to your flirting...

14
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,490
So is it fun toying with me?

15
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,110
Let me explain. It's...

16
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,130
I don't want to hear your explanation.

17
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,760
Let's talk another time. I'm leaving.

18
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,850
Dohoon.

19
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,390
Every time I smell the scent of lilac,

20
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,190
I think of someone's birthday.

21
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,200
You've finished your improved proposal, right?

22
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,880
Yes, Ms. Sung.

23
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,409
I just sent it to you via email.

24
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,230
Send an email of it to Mr. Han with an additional explanation of the concept.

25
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

26
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,220
I think they'll accept it,

27
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,810
so you can start working on the storyboard.

28
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,690
Yes, I will.

29
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,960
Mr. Jung.

30
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,170
Why do you look so pale?

31
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,300
Are you sick?

32
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,240
No, I'm fine.

33
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,360
Just finish up with what you're doing and go home.

34
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,880
Yes.

35
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,070
Ms. Choi.

36
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,900
Your resignation has been approved today.

37
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,900
Thank you, Ms. Sung.

38
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,300
You can pack up and clear your desk by today, right?

39
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,420
Of course.

40
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,960
I've started clearing my desk since a long time ago.

41
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,890
There's only this one left.

42
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,220
Ms. Sung.

43
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,580
When we meet somewhere else,

44
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,550
I'll greet you warmly too.

45
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,260
Mr. Jung, you know how I feel, right?

46
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,020
Right?

47
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,720
This isn't the only company in this world.

48
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,840
Don't work too hard and devote all your energy here.

49
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,750
If you find a better workplace, move on.

50
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,970
Best of luck.

51
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,140
Mr. Jung.

52
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,810
You don't look well. Are you okay?

53
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,280
I didn't sleep well last night, so I think I caught a cold.

54
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,600
It seems like you have a fever too. Did you take some medicine?

55
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,810
I took one.

56
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,890
Shouldn't you get some rest today?

57
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,030
Sangwoo.

58
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,310
How about this? Let's have dinner together tonight.

59
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,530
It's just right. I've been feeling bad about constantly postponing our meal anyway.

60
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,090
Let's have some drinks too.

61
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,680
Mr. Jung.

62
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,640
You said you'd buy me drinks last time.

63
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,110
Order whatever you want.

64
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,670
Wow.

65
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,130
I want... Dakgangjeong.

66
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,280
I want stir-fried pork belly.

67
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,500
Or grilled mackerel.

68
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,060
Is there nothing you want to eat?

69
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,100
Let me order for you.

70
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,750
-Cheers! 
-Cheers!

71
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,140
Mr. Jung.

72
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,230
I think you're drunk after just one glass of soju bomb.

73
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,429
Right. Hana is not a good drinker.

74
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,960
I'm not drunk.

75
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,330
Hana, are you okay?

76
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,500
Not at all.

77
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,070
Why is nothing going my way?

78
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,380
What do you mean?

79
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,980
Sangwoo, can I like you?

80
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,170
No, there's someone I like.

81
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,640
See? Nothing is going my way.

82
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,590
She seems drunk.

83
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,220
Give her some time. She'll sober up soon.

84
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,780
Mr. Jung, you must like drinking.

85
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,920
No.

86
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,340
But one should drink whenever it calls for it.

87
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,630
Only then can one relieve stress.

88
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,710
By the way, did you know that Hana was fond of you

89
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,300
since the first time she saw you?

90
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,320
Yes, I sort of felt it.

91
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,050
Oh, you have good instincts.

92
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,410
Normally, the person involved never realizes it.

93
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,990
Was there anyone who had a crush on you?

94
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,160
You mean at work?

95
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,580
Even if there was, I wouldn't have known.

96
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,460
I'm a little slow.

97
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,360
It always turned out

98
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,650
that there were a few people around me who liked me.

99
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,070
The problem is that I always realized it too late.

100
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,590
The problem was always that.

101
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,630
I can't figure it out no matter how hard I try.

102
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,360
I don't know why someone would like me.

103
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,060
I think I know why.

104
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,170
When I look at you,

105
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,910
I want to care for you.

106
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,630
It's like you trigger one's maternal love.

107
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,140
Is that why he cooks for me?

108
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,110
What?

109
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,550
Nothing.

110
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,010
You just got here and you already have a ton of work to do.

111
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,590
Someone also quit, so the atmosphere is a bit strange.

112
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,650
You probably don't know this, but I feel reassured thanks to you.

113
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,150
I'll treat you to a lot of delicious food.

114
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,030
So please don't quit.

115
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,290
I won't quit either.

116
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,490
It seems like he isn't back yet.

117
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,830
Aren't you drinking too much?

118
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,010
You're right.

119
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,680
I always go over my limit whenever I drink.

120
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,850
It's a waste to not drink this,

121
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,790
so let's go after this glass.

122
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,150
Cheers.

123
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,510
I think you would have the answer to this.

124
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:26,410
Has it been often for you where friendship developed into romance?

125
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,130
Yes.

126
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,280
That's usually how I got into relationships.

127
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,040
Has there been a time where your lover was still entangled with their ex?

128
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,960
Yes, of course.

129
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,570
How did you overcome it?

130
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,320
There's nothing to overcome.

131
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,920
In my opinion, there are only three situations.

132
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,380
You just need to be aware of where the other person's focus is.

133
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,070
Whether they're over their ex,

134
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,670
trying to get over their ex,

135
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,340
or they're just a two-timer.

136
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,390
You'll just have to act according to the other's focus.

137
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,210
Then what should we do in each situation?

138
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,760
If they're over their ex,

139
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,670
then it's simple.

140
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,620
If they're trying to forget their ex,

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,230
then be good to them so that they'll forget their ex.

142
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,810
If they're two-timing,

143
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,050
then kill them.

144
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,550
If not, you've to be mentally prepared for whatever might come.

145
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,900
That's a great analysis.

146
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,520
Either make them forget their ex,

147
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,890
or kill them. Okay.

148
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm going to kill you.

149
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,940
You deserve to die.

150
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,250
Aren't we going for a second round?

151
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,140
-No. 
-Let's go for a second round.

152
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Please take care of her, sir.

153
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,210
-Yes.
-Let's go for a second round.

154
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,300
A second round...

155
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,400
Are you okay?

156
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,330
I'm fine.

157
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,250
Mr. Jung.

158
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,860
I told you I have a crush on someone, right?

159
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,730
I invited him to dinner so many times

160
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,890
but he kept rejecting me.

161
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,600
But he suddenly asked me to drink with him today.

162
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,580
Isn't this a good signal?

163
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,190
Then it must be one of the three situations you mentioned.

164
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,390
Either he likes you,

165
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,930
or he's starting to have feelings for you

166
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,380
and is interested in dating you,

167
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,360
or he doesn't like you

168
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,790
but there's no one to hang out with.

169
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,820
What if it's the third situation?

170
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,990
Either stay away from him,

171
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,410
or just let him use you.

172
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,270
Come on. I doubt you like someone who's bad.

173
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,780
So you must be in the flirting stage.

174
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
Sangwoo, how are you like in a relationship?

175
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,680
Me? I've never thought about it before.

176
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,690
I think I'm like a woodcutter.

177
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,650
I chop the same tree with my ax relentlessly until it comes down.

178
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,350
You're really manly during times like this.

179
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,680
Sangwoo, I'm sorry,

180
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,730
but can you take me home?

181
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,260
-Alone, I...
-Gosh.

182
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,040
Don't worry.

183
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,350
Mr. Jung, which unit do you live in?

184
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,070
Unit 302, right?

185
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,140
Yoonsoo lives in Unit 302.

186
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,930
I live in Unit 301.

187
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,850
Park Sangwoo.

188
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,440
The person who made you Dakgangjeong is in Room 302.

189
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,540
And you live in Unit 301.

190
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,800
He's not my friend. That jerk...

191
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,530
Mr. Jung, what's the password?

192
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,780
Um... 1004.

193
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,329
1004... give me a moment.

194
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,079
I feel so sick.

195
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,140
The door is open. Mr. Jung, go in.

196
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,590
I'm going to fall...

197
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,580
Are you okay?

198
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,040
Mr. Jung.

199
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,620
I told you I have a crush on someone, right?

200
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,280
The person I like... is you.

201
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,770
I liked you since the first time I saw you.

202
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,170
I know that as colleagues who meet every day,

203
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,540
if I confess like this,

204
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,660
it's inappropriate and will make things awkward between us.

205
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,110
But even so, I'm confessing...

206
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,510
because once I confess, the answer becomes clear...

207
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,650
whether the other person will accept me or not.

208
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,970
Who are you, you scumbag?

209
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,680
Who the heck are you?

210
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,670
Who are you?

211
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,840
I'm his neighbor. Who are you?

212
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,510
You're mistaken. I'm his colleague.

213
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,760
Mr. Jung is drunk so I just took him home.

214
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,790
If he's a colleague, you should've left after bringing him home.

215
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,400
You clearly were trying to kiss him earlier.

216
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,810
You're rude.

217
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,250
Don't just say whatever comes to your mind.

218
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,160
I saw you leaning closer to his face just now.

219
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,660
Mr. Jung seems to be having a fever, so I just wanted to check his temperature.

220
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,190
When did he start having a fever?

221
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,330
He didn't look well since he came to work today.

222
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,320
Did he take his medicine?

223
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,920
How would I know about that?

224
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,330
I think he took one.

225
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,510
Are you Yoonsoo?

226
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,950
It's rude to ask such a question since it's our first meeting.

227
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,890
But let me ask you.

228
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,620
You're not two-timing Dohoon

229
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,800
and your ex, right?

230
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,780
I don't know what you heard,

231
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,890
but it's between us, so stay out of it.

232
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,360
If you keep stressing Dohoon out because of your ex,

233
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,230
I won't just sit back and watch.

234
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,520
Act properly and don't confuse him.

235
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,360
Take good care of him.

236
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,000
Why did you drink so much when you're not feeling well?

237
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,450
What a fool.

238
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,960
You should eat something before taking medicine.

239
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,140
Right, I should make some porridge.

240
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,540
80% of abalone's nutrition is in the organs.

241
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,390
But if you don't cook it well, the porridge will smell fishy.

242
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,820
I realized that the best seasoning for porridge

243
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,510
is sincerity.

244
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,200
The sincerity that stems from the belief

245
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,940
that he'll recover after finishing a bowl of the porridge.

246
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,770
I hope that my sincerity would work.

247
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,330
I made abalone porridge. Get up and have some.

248
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,020
I don't want to.

249
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,940
That won't do, you need to eat it before taking medicine.

250
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,710
I'm too tired to even talk.

251
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,260
Then just open your mouth. I'll feed you.

252
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,460
Why? Is it hard to swallow?

253
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,300
It's hot.

254
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,730
I'm sorry. I'll cool it for you.

255
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,930
Thanks to you, I'm awake.

256
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,880
I'll eat it myself.

257
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
Does it smell fishy?

258
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,850
No, not at all.

259
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,300
You happened to have abalone.

260
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,500
Do you remember that day when I couldn't cook for you

261
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,150
and we had pork belly?

262
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,450
I bought it because I wanted to cook steamed abalone for you then.

263
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,460
You created the trouble and then resolved it for me.

264
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,550
I'm sorry.

265
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,580
I feel bad because it feels like you're unwell

266
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,780
because of me.

267
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,140
You can tell me the truth...

268
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,000
about your relationship with your ex.

269
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,710
You misunderstood. I have nothing to do with him.

270
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,990
I'll explain everything to you after you recover.

271
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,180
Don't be ridiculous.

272
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,320
Why would someone who has nothing to do with you 
wait for you in front of your house?

273
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,620
Who? You saw him?

274
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,450
How did you know it was him?

275
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,190
The bracelet I saw in your photo album

276
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,420
was on that man's wrist.

277
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,010
So he came all the way here?

278
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,940
We broke up a long time ago.

279
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,910
It was just his wishful thinking.

280
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,920
You know I like you, right?

281
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,440
I have something to ask you.

282
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,330
I told you to dodge if you don't want to.

283
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,200
Why didn't you dodge when I kissed you?

284
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,310
I thought about dodging,

285
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,880
but my body wouldn't listen to me.

286
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,040
So did you like it?

287
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,200
You got me all drenched

288
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,610
and then suddenly abandoned me.

289
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,910
When I saw the name on the phone,

290
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,070
I left without realizing it.

291
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,280
I'm sorry.

292
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,660
I've something to ask you too.

293
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,150
You once said that whenever you smell the scent of lilac,

294
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,120
you would think of someone's back and birthday.

295
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,050
You were referring to your ex-boyfriend, right?

296
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,650
His birthday is in spring, right?

297
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,890
Your birthday is in November, right?

298
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,630
Yes, how did you know?

299
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,420
I think it was during the final exams period in November.

300
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,050
Do you remember the stairs that lead to the Student Hall

301
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,780
at our college?

302
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,070
November?

303
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,770
Didn't you see me for the first time in class during the spring semester?

304
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,110
I first met you in November the year before that.

305
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,590
No, that's before I returned to school.

306
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,640
I'm right. You were in your military uniform.

307
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,560
The final exams period is so torturing.

308
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,500
How many subjects do you have left?

309
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,940
Three.

310
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,530
Three?

311
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,580
I only have one subject left.

312
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,190
Seriously.

313
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,590
But I got an F grade for three subjects.

314
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,450
Gosh.

315
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,290
Hey, I'm going to buy cigarettes. Wait for me.

316
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,650
Okay, go ahead.

317
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,530
Okay. Wait for me.

318
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,250
Okay.

319
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,840
Hello, mom.

320
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,850
I'm stopping by the school. Yes.

321
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,220
A birthday celebration?

322
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,850
It's fine, I'm still a soldier.

323
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,410
Yes, I want to return to school.

324
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,620
I'm almost done with my stuff. I'll go to the hospital right after.

325
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,900
Okay. Let's celebrate my birthday there then.

326
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,430
Okay.

327
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,300
Mom, do you want to eat anything? I'll buy it for you.

328
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,930
Right. You can't eat it anyway.

329
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,630
I'll try to get there as soon as possible.

330
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,710
Okay.

331
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,810
You've been waiting for months.

332
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,480
Why can't you wait for a few more hours?

333
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,230
Okay, see you later.

334
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,270
[Jung Dohoon]

335
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,760
Then, I saw your name Jung Dohoon on your uniform.

336
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,520
The next year, I happened to be in the same class as you.

337
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,510
I remember that day.

338
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,260
That day was the day I regret the most in my life.

339
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,660
That day...

340
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,390
I should have just gone straight to the hospital instead of going to school.

341
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,660
Then...

342
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,630
You don't have to hold back in front of me.

343
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,190
You can cry as much as you want.

344
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,660
You have me by your side now.

345
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,740
Open your mouth.

346
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,250
Didn't you say Yoonsoo makes you anxious?

347
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,020
Yoonsoo's not that kind of person.

348
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,390
He's someone who can handle his own relationships well.

349
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,550
Feel free to come back any time if you're having a tough time.

350
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,930
There will always be a spot for you at my restaurant.

351
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,390
What? You still haven't broken up?

352
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,450
No, you misunderstood.

353
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,420
We broke up a long time ago...

354
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,370
He's pestering you because you're so accepting.

355
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,490
What an interesting situation.

356
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,080
So it turns out that everyone has their lover.

357
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,940
Sir.

358
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,000
Please act your age.
