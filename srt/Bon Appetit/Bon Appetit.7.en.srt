1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,500
You're awake?

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,520
Sorry. Was I eating too noisily?

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,480
It's okay. What time is it?

5
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,810
It's still dawn. Sleep more.

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,140
Is it good?

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,570
Totally.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,080
You should have woken me up to heat it up for you.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,760
You're still sick.

10
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,850
I think I'm all recovered thanks to this abalone porridge.

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,540
I don't think it's because of abalone porridge but the power of love.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,780
What are you talking about so early in the morning?

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,470
Close your eyes.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,600
Why?

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,190
Quick. Close your eyes.

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,980
Open your mouth.

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,170
Chew slowly.

18
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,320
You can even feel the abalone.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,630
It tastes different from yesterday, right?

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,640
I can finally taste it now.

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,850
So good.

22
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,000
No matter how delicious the food is made,

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,920
if the person who eats it is sick or unhappy,

24
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,600
it's no different from chewing on sand.

25
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,420
Don't get sick and stay healthy.

26
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,370
And enjoy the food I make for you.

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,620
Only that way can you taste my food and give me comments.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,650
The fever is gone.

29
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,270
You're going to sleep more, right?

30
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,130
It reminds me of when we went camping.

31
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,750
It felt like my heart was going to explode.

32
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,670
Isn't it too peaceful now?

33
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,770
Does that mean I feel at ease when I'm with you?

34
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,050
I want to kiss you,

35
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,870
But I don't want to catch a cold so I can't do it.

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,440
So you mean you love me but not so much you can love my cold too?

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,690
What do you like about me?

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
You're cute.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,720
You're a cute person.

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,310
I'm cute?

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,950
It should be cool.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,490
To be honest, as compared to now,

43
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,670
you were way cuter in college.

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,850
By cute I mean someone

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,270
that enjoys life innocently

46
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,990
and express their feelings directly,

47
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,030
smiles a lot,

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,610
and looks pretty smiling.

49
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,020
Was I like this in college?

50
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,430
Yes.

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,810
But compared to that time,

52
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,210
you've become a lot more worn.

53
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,290
I see.

54
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,940
Sleep more.

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,520
Where are you going?

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,900
I have something to do suddenly. Sleep well.

57
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,320
This is a dish with rice and some ingredients rolled on seaweed.

58
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,890
According to the ingredients put on it,

59
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,910
you can make tuna kimbap, cheese kimbap,

60
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,959
kkongchi kimbap, and make various changes to it.

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,190
It looks simple, but it's actually complicated.

62
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,720
It's rare to see food full of memories like this.

63
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,530
Some people don't even touch kimbap given their memories.

64
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,490
While some people make kimbap for every other occasion.

65
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,690
The more you think about it, it's an amazing food.

66
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,220
What are you doing? You startled me.

67
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,730
Why aren't you sleeping?

68
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,970
I can't sleep. What can I do?

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,700
Can you make some noise when you walk?

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,900
There's pollack roe inside.

71
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,690
How is it?

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,810
Sweet mayonnaise.

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,909
Soft eggs.

74
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,600
With salty pollack roe.

75
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,100
I can taste them all.

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,000
Didn't you say your mom used to make you pollack roe kimbap?

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,330
I thought about that and made this.

78
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,980
I'll pack you lunch. Take it to the company to eat it.

79
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,380
There's not a lot this time so eat yourself.

80
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,460
I'm always grateful to you.

81
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,260
If I let them have a bite this time,

82
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,390
I'm sure they'll praise me like the last time they had dakgangjeong.

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,420
So... I want to ask you for a favor.

84
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,110
What is it?

85
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,530
We're shooting an ad for two days starting tomorrow.

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,330
Can you cater food to the crew on the set?

87
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,610
Me?

88
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,570
About 30 people. Is that possible?

89
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,250
Of course, I'd like to. That's advertising my restaurant too.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,159
Okay.

91
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,610
It's really delicious.

92
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,640
Right?

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,540
Oh! Mr. Jung.

94
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
It's green now. Aren't you going to cross the road?

95
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,260
I'm fine. You should go.

96
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,490
Your body is also in electricity-saving mode, right?

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm not running because I want to look like

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,370
I'm more mature cause I'm older.

99
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm just weak.

100
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,850
How are you feeling?

101
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,350
I drank too much yesterday.

102
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,110
What do you remember about yesterday?

103
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,450
Actually, after drinking yesterday,

104
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,260
I don't remember what happened after that...

105
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,620
I took you home yesterday.

106
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,880
What? Really?

107
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,840
I didn't know.

108
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,670
I thought Yoonsoo came to pick me up.

109
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,650
I thought you had a fever

110
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,760
so I touched your forehead to check.

111
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,550
But that person showed up

112
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,230
and grabbed me by the collar.

113
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,870
What? He didn't say anything about this though?

114
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,210
I'm sorry. He must've misunderstood.

115
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,100
It's him, right? The person you like.

116
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,180
No, you misunderstood.

117
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,970
Do you not remember I said I like you?

118
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,370
What? What are you talking about...

119
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,670
You don't like mint chocolate latte,

120
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,410
but I like you.

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,600
I'll keep waiting

122
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,330
without causing you any trouble.

123
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,670
You must be kidding.

124
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm not.

125
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,650
You said Yoonsoo made you nervous.

126
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,250
Did I say that?

127
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,100
But I don't think you need to worry.

128
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,550
Yoonsoo isn't that kind of person.

129
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,820
He's a person who can deal with relationships by himself.

130
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,670
He must've told you he'd take care of it.

131
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,490
But Mr. Jung,

132
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,130
a really good person

133
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,310
would never have a situation like this.

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,430
It's green light.

135
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't worry and cross the road.

136
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,430
The first concept is an online advertisement plan

137
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,860
targeting youths in their 20s and 30s.

138
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,500
To put it briefly,

139
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,270
[Taurine 2]

140
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
a fully armed soldier is heading towards the high ground.

141
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,130
But he got dehydrated and fainted out of fatigue.

142
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,190
The fierce instructor suddenly comes over

143
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,370
and urges him to move forward.

144
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,490
But afterwards, it was found out that the solder that fainted

145
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,100
was a reserved soldier.

146
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,760
After seeing the instructor, he comforted him instead,

147
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,010
"Hey. You're having a hard time too, right?"

148
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,770
While saying that, he gave him this drink.

149
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,460
"Get your shit together."

150
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,530
At the end the tagline "Get your shit together, power drink,

151
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,260
Taurine 2," will show as subtitles.

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,960
Wow, it's humorous. That's good.

153
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,510
What? It's good?

154
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,400
We'll shoot as planned tomorrow.

155
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,570
I'll remind Mr. Han again.

156
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,210
Is the set ready?

157
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,010
I thought it would be easier to carry out the background with CG

158
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,630
so I've already contacted the set.

159
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,830
Good. Coordinate with the set again, to make sure nothing goes wrong.

160
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,770
Mr. Nam, go check on the production team.

161
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,090
Hana, check if the actors have any issues.

162
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,300
Sangwoo, help Mr. Jung.

163
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,290
Yes, understood.

164
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,420
All right, it's not easy for us to come this far.

165
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,050
Let's stick to the end.

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,260
Get our,

167
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,570
-shit together. -Shit together.

168
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,010
The content is good, right?

169
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,110
Yes.

170
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,250
It's humorous and elegant,

171
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,420
elegant and humorous.

172
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,730
Sir.

173
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,160
Mr. Jung.

174
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,410
Mr. Jung, these are the materials on the set.

175
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,200
Let's go to the set and check it together.

176
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,990
Okay.

177
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,560
Welcome.

178
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,500
I see. So it's this kind of restaurant/

179
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,500
I gave you the address of the cafe nearby.

180
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,960
You did.

181
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,650
When I was walking around,

182
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,630
I found out that you own this restaurant so I came in.

183
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,080
My intuition... Even I am shocked.

184
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,450
Sorry but I don't like you coming in here.

185
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,890
Wait for me at the cafe ahead.

186
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,740
Okay, come over quickly.

187
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,210
I ordered a cup of hot chocolate for you.

188
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,100
With extra cream, right?

189
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,880
It's fine, I'll be leaving soon.

190
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,260
How's business? Aren't you tired doing it yourself?

191
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,130
I'm tired, but I need to get used to it.

192
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,760
I can handle it.

193
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,320
It's not easy to take care of the kitchen and guests.

194
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,890
Come back anytime if you're tired.

195
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,330
Our restaurant will always have a space for you.

196
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,920
If you came to me for this,

197
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,910
you're wasting your time.

198
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,070
Actually, I didn't want to see you.

199
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,310
But I had to return something to you.

200
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,310
Okay. What is it?

201
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,800
I must've taken this along accidentally when I was packing.

202
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,500
A photo album.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,020
I was thinking of throwing it away,

204
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,400
but it's not mine after all.

205
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,060
Yoonsoo, are you really going to be like this?

206
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,270
We dated for three years.

207
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,610
I've apologized to you many times.

208
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,300
Do you think you came make it up just by saying "I'm sorry"?

209
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,410
Thanks to you, that three years of my time

210
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,890
is no different from tossing it into the trash can.

211
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,030
I'll say it again.

212
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,090
I was wrong.

213
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,230
I've been regretting it.

214
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,750
That's what I'm saying.

215
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,200
Who are you to ruin a happy time?

216
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,480
That was a mistake.

217
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,220
Everyone can make a mistake once.

218
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,940
So that's what you've been thinking.

219
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,190
There's someone I like now.

220
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,470
Let's not see each other again.

221
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,590
I know.

222
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,960
That you'll definitely come back to me.

223
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,120
-Hello. -Hello.

224
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,700
We have to go inside from here.

225
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,760
Okay.

226
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,540
Six of them?

227
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,820
Yes.

228
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,000
[Lounge]

229
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,620
This is the actors' lounge.

230
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,290
There are four seats in total.

231
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,780
Okay.

232
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,880
-Sir. -Yes?

233
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,490
Is it okay to finish an hour later tomorrow?

234
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,010
Ah... Got it.

235
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,550
-Thank you. -Sure.

236
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,290
Have this.

237
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,580
Thank you.

238
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,980
Mr. Jung, have some.

239
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,500
Thank you.

240
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
But you don't have to take care of me.

241
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,460
The manager gave this to us.

242
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,020
I see.

243
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,110
Sangwoo told me to give this to you.

244
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,680
I'm off work.

245
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,920
Mr. Jung, are you not hungry?

246
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,770
You didn't even have lunch. Let's have dinner together.

247
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,140
You're right. But I have plans for dinner.

248
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,920
Let's call it a day here.

249
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,350
I'll send you a checklist in the group chat.

250
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,260
Can you give me a ride?

251
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,710
No. I have plans.

252
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,810
You can take me to a train station close by, though?

253
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,810
I'm in a hurry.

254
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,380
Let's go to your house then.

255
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,570
I can take the bus there.

256
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,130
Mr. Jung, should I put this in the back seat?

257
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,220
Oh, right. I should've eaten that.

258
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,760
What's packed in it?

259
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,860
Kimbap.

260
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,460
Yoonsoo made it for you.

261
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,750
Can I have a bite?

262
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,220
No, he asked me to eat it myself.

263
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,630
How petty.

264
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,010
Sangwoo.

265
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,850
I know you have no choice about your feelings.

266
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,100
But I hope you can meet a better person.

267
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,750
I'm frustrated because I can't help it.

268
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,360
When he's done with cleaning up his relationship,

269
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,660
and the two of you date officially, please let me know.

270
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,540
I think I'll have to give up then.

271
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,580
I guess you're really stubborn.

272
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,980
Let's go then.

273
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,620
Have we not set off yet?

274
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,820
You lied about your plans, right?

275
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,330
It's true.

276
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,410
What is it this time?

277
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
Are you a stalker who's following me?

278
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,020
I knew you moved here.

279
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,090
This album isn't mine. It's ours.

280
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,730
Let's go back to the way we used to be.

281
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,870
Don't you understand what I said in the day?

282
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,300
I must've put it too nicely.

283
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,680
Or do you think I'm a joke?

284
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,380
I had no choice.

285
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,980
Can't you think for me?

286
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,740
Okay, fine, give it to me. I'll burn the album.

287
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,550
Isn't it heavy? Let me help you.

288
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,700
It's okay. Go back.

289
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,890
Okay.

290
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,400
Please.

291
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,369
Can't you just forgive me this once?

292
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,680
What? You still haven't broken up?

293
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,370
Why are you holding that?

294
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,830
Who are you to ask him to break up with me?

295
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,690
If you let go, it'll be easy.

296
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,370
I didn't ask you.

297
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,670
Brother, this is a misunderstanding.

298
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,030
I've broken up with him.

299
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,010
But he keeps pestering me.

300
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,660
You're going along with him that's why he's pestering you.

301
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,560
I don't think it's your business.

302
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,570
What an interesting situation.

303
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,120
Everyone has someone they like.

304
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,130
Then just be loyal to your lover and this thing can end.

305
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,400
What a jerk.

306
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,650
Don't fight here.

307
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,510
Let's go up. Let's go up and I'll explain to you.

308
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,980
Is there anything I don't know?

309
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,940
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

310
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,730
You're the third party. How brazen you are.

311
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,810
What? Third party?

312
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,610
Sir. Watch your mouth.

313
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,040
Hey, tell me the truth.

314
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,220
You slept with him, right?

315
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,210
That's why you're hanging around him.

316
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,650
Don't act innocent. Take him and get lost.

317
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,740
That's enough. Doing this will do good to no one.

318
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,330
What? Hit me.

319
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,670
If you want to know the fact that life is about a real fight.

320
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,690
Sangwoo.

321
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,390
Come here.

322
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,310
Aren't you going to prepare for the shoot tomorrow?

323
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,250
I'm fine so you should go.

324
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,520
What are you doing? How embarrassing.

325
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,370
Brother.

326
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,360
Don't make me too disappointed in you.

327
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,260
Yoonsoo.

328
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,120
I hope

329
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,440
you can stay out of my life.

330
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,010
I'm sorry. Things like this happened because of me.

331
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,470
It's nothing. As long as it's been cleaned up.

332
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,840
But why are you here with that intern?

333
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,380
We've been together checking the shooting set.

334
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,320
Because you were together,

335
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,860
so you didn't eat the kimbap I made you?

336
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,800
No.

337
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,920
I was really busy. I didn't have time to eat lunch.

338
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,420
What?

339
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,600
Are you too embarrassed to take out my kimbap

340
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,660
because you were together?

341
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,390
I said that's not it. I was too busy to eat.

342
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,970
I didn't even have lunch today.

343
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,060
And this is the same as what we ate breakfast.

344
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,340
So it makes no difference if you ate it or not?

345
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,830
Cause you know how it tastes?

346
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,310
Gosh.

347
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,780
It's not like it's an amazing meal.

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,680
It's just kimbap. Why are you making a fuss?

349
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,610
What counts as an amazing meal?

350
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,920
Have you ever thought about how much

351
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,310
I think about you and like you when I make food for you?

352
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,640
Do you think it's the same as the kimbap from the convenience store?

353
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,160
Dohoon.

354
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,300
You keep hurting me.

355
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,370
I can't keep getting hurt if we keep talking about it.

356
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,470
Yoonsoo.

357
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,520
Because it's for you,

358
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,350
I don't feel tired even if I had to wake up early in the morning to make it.

359
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,080
But you don't know my thoughts so it hurts me.

360
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,680
We'll fight if we keep talking.

361
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,250
Let's stop talking.

362
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,610
[With your mother's recipe and Yoonsoo's sincerity]

Your mother's recipe and Yoonsoo's sincerity.

[With your mother's recipe and Yoonsoo's sincerity]

365
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,220
To Yoonsoo.

366
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,570
I ate the leftover kimbap as soon as I got home.

367
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,210
This is the best kimbap I've had other than the one

368
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,340
that my mom made for me.

369
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,530
When I was a kid, looking at my mother making kimbap,

370
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,700
I wondered why she worked so hard to make this.

371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,720
I thought it'd be easier to eat it just by mixing it all up like bibimbap.

372
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,870
Thanks to you, I found the answer today.

373
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,890
Because I realized when making the kimbap,

374
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,760
the ingredients you layer on it, are full of sincerity.

375
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm always grateful to you. I love you, Yoonsoo.

377
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,580
Can I ask you something?

378
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,860
I said something wrong to Yoonsoo.

379
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,510
I don't know how to apologize.

380
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,040
You're here.

381
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,360
Do I just move it in?

382
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,610
You have to move him with something he really like.

383
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,230
I don't even know what the person I love likes.

384
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,720
What have I been doing?

385
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,460
Am I qualified to love him?

386
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,370
What am I good at?
