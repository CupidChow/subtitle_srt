1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,870
Thank you for the good meal. You don't have to see me off.

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,500
Wait.

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,060
Let me spray the front too.

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,229
Why aren't you looking at my eyes?

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,200
Do I have to?

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,330
If you look into my eyes, I'll give you a gift.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,670
A gift?

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,890
Here's the gift.

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,400
What are you doing?

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,220
I guess you don't like my gift.

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,160
Gosh, you sprayed into my eyes.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,850
Every time I smell the scent of lilac,

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,580
I think of someone's birthday.

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,020
The scent of lilac?

16
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,740
Are you asleep?

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm getting ready to go to sleep.

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,280
My restaurant will be open tomorrow.

19
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,360
Come over after work.

20
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,560
Okay.

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,430
Good night.

22
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,789
Is this person... lilac?

23
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,790
[Today’s main dish: Dombe boiled pork]

24
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,800
A thick chunk of Jeju black pork boiled whole.

25
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,590
In Jeju, it's called Dombe boiled pork.

26
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,170
Dombe refers to the cutting board.

27
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,720
The accompanying dish is mixed chives.

28
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,130
Chives and pork are a perfect match.

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,450
The sauce has to be made with salted anchovies.

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,660
In Jeju dialect, it's called "mel-jeot".

31
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,900
With these three as a combination,

32
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,410
it's akin to the Avengers.

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,170
But why aren't there any customers?

34
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,460
Welcome. Are you here for a meal?

35
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,850
Why else would we be at a restaurant?

36
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,890
Boss, where should we sit?

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,940
Take a seat here.

38
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,540
Yes.

39
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,850
Today's dish is Dombe boiled pork.

40
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,310
Do you want two servings?

41
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,590
Give me one serving first, please.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Just one?

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,130
I just ate before I came.

44
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,550
Give us one serving of that, and one red cap soju.

45
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,440
A red cap soju?

46
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,040
Okay.

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,670
Enjoy.

48
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,130
Wow, boss. The meat is so tender. It's amazing.

49
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,950
Excuse me, I'd like some Korean green chili pepper and perilla oil.

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,340
Okay. May I ask why you want them?

51
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,370
My hometown is Jeju Island.

52
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,760
But there are two important ingredients missing in this salted anchovies sauce.

53
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,420
Do you want me to mince the chili peppers for you?

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,940
You little brat...

55
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,100
How dare you say that in front of our boss?

56
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,100
You said that to us on purpose, didn't you?

57
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,220
Do you want to die?

58
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,070
No, you misunderstood.

59
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,280
I'll finely cut the Korean green chili pepper...

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,470
No, crushed...

61
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,040
I'll add some Korean green chili pepper and bring it to you again.

62
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,790
Here's what you requested.

63
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,030
Wow, this is it.

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,620
This is the real salted anchovies sauce.

65
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,630
Hey. Can't you see that we used our remaining soju for the sauce?

66
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,560
Can we get a bottle of soju for free?

67
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,010
Okay, one moment, please.

68
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,159
Welcome.

69
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,390
Shalom.

70
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,410
Excuse me brother, but can we have lunch here?

71
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,590
Of course.

72
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,050
A table for three, right?

73
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,340
Maybe you can't see it,

74
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,460
but in fact, God is with us.

75
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,740
Amen.

76
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,290
Okay. A table for four. Please take your seats.

77
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,960
Thank you, brother.

78
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,710
God, please take a seat first.

79
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,090
He's taken his seat.

80
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
Okay, be careful.

81
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,140
Let's pray first.

82
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,740
Mr. Jung. I specially got you a mint chocolate latte.

83
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,150
Thank you.

84
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,020
But you don't have to buy it for me anymore.

85
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,190
Okay. I'll make sure I buy it for you next time.

86
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,030
Sangwoo, thank you for the coffee.

87
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,310
I'm sorry, but this is mine.

88
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,440
You've all read Mr. Jung's proposal this morning, right?

89
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,170
What do you think?

90
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,990
I think we can send it to the client now.

91
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,540
Ms. Choi. Email it to the client

92
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,530
and talk to them on the phone.

93
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,940
I've already sent it and received a reply.

94
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,570
Unexpectedly, they're satisfied with the proposal.

95
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,630
They also want us to prepare a few versions by combining our advertising copies and proposals

96
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,890
and that they'll choose one from them.

97
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,510
What's going on?

98
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,700
It's going unusually well that it's making me uneasy.

99
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,100
Email the details of the call with the client to everyone.

100
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,290
Mr. Jung, did you hear that?

101
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,970
They want us to prepare a few versions by combining our advertising copies and proposals for them to choose from.

102
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,460
Yes, I heard it.

103
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,560
When can it be done?

104
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,750
There's quite a bit of work to do,

105
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,040
so can I send it to you next Wednesday?

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,620
It's too late. Send it to me next Monday.

107
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,720
Monday?

108
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,520
Why? Can’t you do it?

109
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,770
No.

110
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,100
I really want to hit her just once on the forehead.

111
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,950
We're settled with Sales Team 1.

112
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,549
Sales Team 2, how's the progress with the new project of Smile Cosmetics?

113
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,260
I've decided on a theme. Take a look.

114
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,260
Mr. Nam.

115
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,860
This is women's cosmetics.

116
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,380
Isn't it too bold a concept?

117
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,600
In the past, there was an example of a middle-aged actor 
who was chosen as a cosmetics spokesperson,

118
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,430
which was praised for its relatability to middle-aged people.

119
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,410
I think the notion that only young and pretty people

120
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,510
can be cosmetics spokespersons

121
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,630
is too old-fashioned.

122
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,940
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

123
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,550
Mr. Nam, you still have great instincts.

124
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,120
I still have great instincts.

125
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,890
Mr. Jung, aren't you going for lunch?

126
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,830
I'm not feeling well, so I want to take a rest.

127
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,980
Don't bother about me and go have your lunch.

128
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,140
Okay.

129
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,100
Sangwoo.

130
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,340
Do you want to have lunch with me?

131
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,180
Okay.

132
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,270
Okay.

133
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,860
Seven, eight. One, two, three, cha cha. One, two, three, cha cha. One, two...

134
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,900
Oh.

135
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,310
What is it?

136
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,940
That text message just now...

137
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,230
You sent the text message by mistake, right?

138
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,240
Yes, I'm sorry.

139
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,630
Okay. Go have lunch.

140
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,270
Okay.

141
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,380
Mr. Nam.

142
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,370
What is it?

143
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,820
Let's talk.

144
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,660
Why? I'm going to have lunch.

145
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm not going to eat with you.

146
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,350
Then let's have a quick chat at the stairs instead of the rooftop.

147
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,900
Darn it.

148
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,240
You know I'm a democratic person.

149
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,290
I mentioned your opinion during the meeting with my team

150
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,500
and Hana loved it.

151
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,880
So I thought about it for quite a while,

152
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,410
wondering if it was the right decision.

153
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,880
And in the end, I decided to follow your opinion.

154
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,800
How democratic is that?

155
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,620
Well,

156
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,350
didn't you say that funny concepts are incompatible with the cosmetics industry?

157
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,020
But are there really any rules in the industry in this day and age?

158
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,150
I doubt it.

159
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,030
Let's just take it that you were part of my team's meeting.

160
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,680
Isn't a chat also a kind of meeting?

161
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,560
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

162
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,270
I'll buy you drinks too.

163
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,300
Screw you.

164
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,210
That'll do.

165
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,400
Fine. I have something to attend to, so I'll get going.

166
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,960
Come to the advertising copy meeting later.

167
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,330
I have dinner plans tonight.

168
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,670
I see.

169
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,300
It seems that you've fallen hard for the person who made you Dakgangjeong.

170
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,280
Okay. Thank you for your hard work.

171
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,130
Hey, do you want to have lunch together?

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,410
I'll take that as a no.

173
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,210
Mr. Jung.

174
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,470
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

175
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,220
Thank you.

176
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,830
This is... grilled chitterlings.

177
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,350
I had that for lunch with Hana.

178
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,100
Was it good?

179
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,230
No.

180
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,110
I've always liked grilled chitterlings.

181
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,810
But it didn't taste good without you.

182
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,810
Sangwoo.

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
I'll definitely treat you to dinner within this week.

184
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,250
Set a time.

185
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,300
How about tonight?

186
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,120
I have plans tonight.

187
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,450
I see.

188
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
Tell me when you have time then.

189
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,980
Did you like the food?

190
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,160
Yes, it was good.

191
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,240
This is the dessert.

192
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,820
Because you two look great together,

193
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,160
although this is not included in the menu you ordered,

194
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,270
I'm giving it to you.

195
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,740
Really? Thank you.

196
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,870
Enjoy.

197
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,770
It looks delicious.

198
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,400
Eat up. It looks delicious.

199
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,380
Sir, you didn't pay.

200
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,640
It's 52,000 won.

201
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,020
Honey, we forgot to pay.

202
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,410
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,870
I'll give you the card.

204
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,640
Can you settle the bill and bring it over again?

205
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,030
This is a points card. Should I call the police?

206
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,800
What are you talking about? She just gave you the wrong card.

207
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,940
You shouldn't treat a customer like a thief.

208
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,440
You were the ones who dined and dashed.

209
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
Darn you, dined and dashed?

210
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,260
Honey, stop it.

211
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,870
It's just a small amount. Don't make a fuss.

212
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,320
Here.

213
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,710
What a jerk. Darn it.

214
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,420
Yoonsoo.

215
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,250
Where did you go without anyone tending to your restaurant?

216
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,100
It's a long story.

217
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,340
Why didn't you go in and wait for me inside?

218
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,120
Well, I thought something might have happened to you.

219
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,310
Let's go inside and eat.

220
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,620
Right, I told you I'd make you something nice.

221
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,320
Let's go in first.

222
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,520
Okay.

223
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,740
What should I do?

224
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,300
I was too busy to prepare dinner for you.

225
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,460
I can just eat the leftovers from today's menu.

226
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,030
Today's menu was boiled pork, but it's sold out.

227
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,170
I still have some leftover ingredients.

228
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,380
Should I make it quickly now?

229
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,180
Weren't you busy today?

230
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,230
Let's just go have grilled pork belly and soju nearby.

231
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,410
Nearby?

232
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,810
I'd rather eat here if we're going to another restaurant nearby.

233
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,870
I have all the ingredients anyway.

234
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,280
Or since it's Friday,

235
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,660
why don't we have a barbecue at a nearby campsite?

236
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,210
Camping?

237
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,200
Camping is good.

238
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,430
I'll prepare some meat and some side dishes.

239
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,380
Do you need my help?

240
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,040
No need. Go and start the car.

241
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,550
Okay.

242
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,610
Have you always liked camping?

243
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,270
It's my first time. The equipment is all new.

244
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,480
I wanted to go camping on the weekend,

245
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,490
so I bought one equipment every time I got my salary.

246
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,850
But I never got the time.

247
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,839
I still thought I'd go camping sooner or later, so I kept them in the car.

248
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,089
To think I'd get to use them today.

249
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,550
I'm hungry so let's set it up quickly.

250
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,980
Where's the blow torch?

251
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,720
Give me a second.

252
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,859
Your hands are freezing, right?

253
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,400
Stop playing around.

254
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,830
Your hands seemed cold. Light the fire for me.

255
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,860
Okay.

256
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,800
What were you going to cook for me today?

257
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,970
I wanted to cook a special dish for you

258
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,860
so I bought some abalone.

259
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,200
I'll just freeze them and eat them later.

260
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,620
Abalone...

261
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,170
I like pork belly more now.

262
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,230
When I'm cooking, I sometimes have the thought

263
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,440
that instead of rare ingredients

264
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,080
and unique recipes,

265
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
the real secret to good food

266
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,440
is when and who you eat it with.

267
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,740
Do you mean that food tastes better

268
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,800
when you're eating with others?

269
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,370
Exactly.

270
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,420
It's getting burnt.

271
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,210
It looks delicious.

272
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,650
What is this?

273
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,190
Mel-jeot.

274
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,110
A customer today told me

275
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,360
that the salted anchovies sauce will taste better 
with some Korean green chili peppers, perilla oil, and soju.

276
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,610
Let me try it.

277
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,640
It's surprisingly delicious.

278
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,260
What do you think, food taster?

279
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,910
Not bad.

280
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,430
There's really no fishy smell at all.

281
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,180
It's slightly spicy and salty.

282
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,180
It's a perfect combination.

283
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,790
Cheers.

284
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,960
Cheers.

285
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,210
This is nice.

286
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,080
By the way, do you remember back then

287
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,410
when two to three couples were formed

288
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,350
after we played the Truth Game at the freshman orientation?

289
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,780
Yes.

290
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,140
This is the power of the Truth Game.

291
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,000
Actually, you can just lie.

292
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,020
But once you get into that atmosphere,

293
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,800
you can only tell the truth.

294
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,610
It's boring. Let's play the Truth Game.

295
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,620
Sure. Sounds good.

296
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,960
Okay.

297
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,070
You must tell the truth.

298
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,990
If you can't answer,

299
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,490
you'll take a shot of soju.

300
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,160
You can go first.

301
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,340
Recently, have you been looking forward to my cooking every evening?

302
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,220
Of course. Your food's so delicious.

303
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,250
It's my turn.

304
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,480
Honestly, isn't it tiring

305
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,880
to cook for me after work?

306
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,600
Not at all.

307
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,030
It's my turn again.

308
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,120
Have you been growing fond of me lately?

309
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,860
Well, it's not like I'm growing to dislike you.

310
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,860
Is it the same as me growing fond of you?

311
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,260
I guess so.

312
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,620
Then...

313
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,760
do you like me?

314
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,250
Yes.

315
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,050
I really like you as a brother.

316
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,720
Then I'll ask the same question.

317
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,860
Do you like me?

318
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,880
It's raining.

319
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,210
Did you get wet?

320
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,730
Let's clean up before we go in.

321
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,380
Let's just go in.

322
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,250
That was such a close call, wasn't it?

323
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,260
You haven't answered my question.

324
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,900
Do you like me?

325
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,210
The game is over.

326
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,740
Was this space always so narrow?

327
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,990
I remember it being spacious.

328
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,990
It's better this way. Let's just go to sleep.

329
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,550
Go to sleep first.

330
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,940
In such a narrow space, what's the point of taking turns to sleep?

331
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,830
I'm fine. I'm really not sleepy. Go to sleep first.

332
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,820
You're making me even more uncomfortable by being like that.

333
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,240
Then I'll just lie down like this.

334
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,050
I won't eat you, so just lie down properly.

335
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,660
It's too narrow. Lie on your side.

336
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,640
Don't face me.

337
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,590
Gosh.

338
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,190
Sleep like this.

339
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,960
Okay. Good night.

340
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,170
Good night.

341
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,660
I'm too excited to sleep,

342
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,590
but you're sleeping so soundly.

343
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,390
Did I upset you?

344
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,620
How could that be? I'll call you again.

345
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,070
Okay.

346
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,610
I think you're very mature.

347
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,450
You control your emotions well and you're always calm.

348
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,570
No, you're wrong.

349
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,940
Yoonsoo.

350
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,760
Joowon.

351
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,960
He's Lee Joowon, a part-timer at the restaurant next door.

352
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,580
Don't go to all the trouble to cook for me.

353
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,930
I enjoy cooking for you.

354
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,990
If you don't want to, just refuse it.
