1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey!

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,100
I'm sure I've seen your face before.

4
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,330
Our pitch got selected.

5
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,860
Good work. Have a good sleep. Keep up the good work tomorrow.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,140
Gosh. We got it!

7
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,850
My idea got selected!

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,910
I don't know what's going on, but congratulations anyway.

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,680
Thank you so much.

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,040
I didn't do anything.

11
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,890
That rice punch–

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,310
No... That sentence you wrote on the amazake,

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,210
"I hope you can get your shit together."

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,530
That sounds like a cuss, but it's not.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,250
No. You really helped me out a big time.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,460
Did I help you?

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,060
That's great.

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,610
What's in it for you if you get selected?

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,310
That's true. What's in it?

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,560
It's only good for the company. They won't give me a raise.

21
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,780
I need to go home and sleep. So that I can work overtime tomorrow.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,740
To congratulate,

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,960
I'll make you something delicious with the raw chicken you brought.

24
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,759
What are you going to make?

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,390
Since we're not close enough to eat fried chicken,

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
we're too unfamiliar to eat raw chicken together,

27
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,590
I'll make you something that fits right in the middle.

28
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,009
If you make it, of course I'd like it.

29
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:48,680
Cheers!

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,310
Cheers.

31
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,810
I just can't remember it.

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,520
I should ask him for his name.

33
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,950
Gosh. Whatever.

34
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,260
One chili? That's too little. One more.

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,380
Dakgangjeong.

36
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,470
This is a dish that is not seen cooked at home as much

37
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,310
as Yangnyeom Chicken gained more popularity.

38
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,740
The preparation, ingredients, and way to make it is very similar to Yangnyeom Chicken.

39
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,590
But the difference is

40
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,820
we need to put the fried chicken in the sauce and slowly stir fry it.

41
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,829
The most important thing is to add enough cooking syrup

42
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,250
so that the chicken can absorb sauce to make it covered with sauce.

43
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,710
Just like Korean snacks,

44
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,520
just eating it cold is still delicious.

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,860
It's a dish that is suitable as a snack, side dishes, ,

46
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,370
and also bar bites.

47
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,970
Just like someone.

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,040
You might have to work overtime after all.

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
My goodness. That scared me.

50
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,070
What's this? Unit 302?

51
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,940
It's the food that's between raw chicken and fried chicken.

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,990
I smelled something strange this morning.

53
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,710
So this was it.

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,480
You don't want to eat, do you?

55
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,910
Wait. We are you doing?

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,530
I will eat it well.

57
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,660
Your shoelaces are loose.

58
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,220
Thank you.

59
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,810
I'm running late so I'll get going.

60
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,140
Okay.

61
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,810
He's still the same.

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,950
What's going on? Is that all?

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,290
It's okay. Just say anything.

64
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,540
Well...

65
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,050
Bacas has already taken the friendly image.

66
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,850
Let's just win it strongly with our pun.

67
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,840
In the rice punch commercial that Kim Bosung endorsed,

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,690
where he yelled out "For locally produced products!"

69
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,850
I thought we should at least go this far.

70
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,030
Or we can use a special commercial song.

71
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,170
As you all know, like...

72
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,100
That kind of music.

73
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,500
I told you to say anything.

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,750
But you can't just say nonsense like this.

75
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,780
Right...

76
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,980
Didn't she tell us to just say anything.

77
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,730
We're not idea machines.

78
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,580
I can't anymore. I'm going to scream "Get your shit together!" today and quit.

79
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,030
If you're serious about that, I'll give you 10,000 won.

80
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,890
Let's make a group chat. Other teams have it too.

81
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,970
Mr. Jung, make one.

82
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,310
Okay. Got it.

83
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,980
Looks like everyone had a deep sleep.

84
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,940
Everyone's brains' still sleeping.

85
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,590
Why don't we all think a little deeper

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,580
and have a meeting... at 6 p.m.?

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,120
Can we listen to Ms. Sung's idea?

88
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,350
Ms. Choi.

89
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,700
I'm the person who help you choose and decide the direction.

90
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm not the person to come up with ideas.

91
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,380
That's what all of you have to do.

92
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,170
What is this, Unit 302?

93
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,020
It's the food between raw chicken and fried chicken.

94
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,350
The food between raw chicken and fried chicken.

95
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:56,180
[The food between raw chicken and fried chicken. I'm nothing but curious.]

96
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm nothing but curious.

97
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,330
Mr. Jung. Why are you so quiet? You're the person in charge.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
What? I'm curious too.

99
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,290
Our department is doing really well.

100
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,660
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,070
We need to come up with five ideas within this week.

102
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,970
We need to get the advertisers' first confirmation.

103
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,760
So from tonight on,

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,310
let's hold another idea meeting.

105
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,600
Dismissed.

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,170
Gosh. So frustrating.

107
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,770
Overtime tonight again.

108
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,890
It's going past working overtime, but working overnight.

109
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,659
Does anyone know what the food between raw chicken and fried chicken is?

110
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,790
It's Spicy Dakgangjeong.

111
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,100
So it's Spicy Dakgangjeong.

112
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,020
Wow, someone even prepared a lunchbox for you.

113
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,770
Someone must have fallen for you.

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,159
Head over hells.

115
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,880
No.

116
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,440
Dating is fun. Marriage is just crazy.

117
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,280
So someone's getting married.

118
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,520
Congratulations.

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,650
Don't make assumptions.

120
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,620
Marriage aside, I haven't even dated before.

121
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,250
Then who prepared the lunch for you?

122
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,110
My friend who lives next door gave it to me.

123
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,040
What? Didn't they just move in?

124
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,230
You're already this close?

125
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,060
Well, that's how love begins.

126
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,420
I envy you.

127
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,880
Dating a neighbor is fun.

128
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,830
And marriage is crazy.

129
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,940
So you're marrying your neighbor. Congratulations.

130
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,260
Mr. Jung, are you getting married?

131
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,860
No.

132
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,799
What is this?

133
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,030
Your wife must've prepared this for you.

134
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,990
They're just a friend of mine.

135
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,720
-Oh, it's Dakgangjeong. 
-Yes.

136
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,500
-Ah. -Ah.

137
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,160
I didn't even prepare chopsticks for him.

138
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,620
Who did I learn this from?

139
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,340
How long do I have to open my mouth for?

140
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,020
Delicious.

141
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,600
I think I've eaten this before.

142
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,870
Isn't it that restaurant that sells Dakgangjeong

143
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,440
and made enough money to buy a building at Sokcho?

144
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,810
It's spicier than expected, so it's really delicious.

145
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,750
My stomach is getting hot as I eat.

146
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,530
It'd be so delicious when eaten together with rice.

147
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,120
It's good.

148
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,540
Putting two will make it spicy.

149
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,960
It's too spicy. Are you okay?

150
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,630
Isn't it spicy?

151
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,270
I need a Taurine 2. It's too spicy.

152
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,430
So spicy.

153
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,950
I... c-can have another one.

154
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,130
No, this is mine.

155
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,960
Gosh, it's spicy.

156
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,030
I don't get paid much, but I have a lot of work to do.

157
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,860
Whatever it is, it's only natural for you to do well.

158
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,020
If you don't do well, you'll become a fool.

159
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,470
I'm too busy to even think about dating.

160
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,010
I don't even have time to drink with my friends.

161
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,980
There are too many steps on this stairs.

162
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,920
Was the Dakgangjeong good?

163
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,830
Yes. I was going to return the lunchbox to you.

164
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,890
Hey. Come in and have some Dakgangjeong and beer.

165
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,460
Do you still have Dakgangjeong left?

166
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,600
Of course.

167
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,700
You must be cooking.

168
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,500
That's my job.

169
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,250
Wait.

170
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,560
This is the VIP room.

171
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,450
Whoa, amazing.

172
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,450
How did the Dakgangjeong taste?

173
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,600
It was sweet and spicy.

174
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,890
But a little spicy.

175
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,980
That's so superficial.

176
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,170
Be more detailed.

177
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,310
Actually, I didn't eat much.

178
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,800
My colleagues came and ate them all.

179
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,270
Can I eat some first before telling you?

180
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,440
This tastes different from what you ate during the day.

181
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,200
There are no chopsticks. Give me a moment.

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,480
It's really different from what I ate during the day.

183
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,530
It's crispy and tender on the outside.

184
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,660
It's best with beer.

185
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,410
Use this.

186
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,030
What were you thinking about?

187
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,170
Oh... It's nothing.

188
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,210
Have a drink.

189
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,510
Oh, I remember now!

190
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,910
I don't know which segment I remembered,

191
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,960
but it was... that class.

192
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,740
Customer Behavior Analysis.

193
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,960
[Classroom 302]

194
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,440
I told you in the first class.

195
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,190
If you're later than me, you're late.

196
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,380
If you're late twice, it means you're absent.

197
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,510
All right. Everyone's here for the "Customer Behavior Analysis" class, right?

198
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,880
Yes.

199
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,750
It sounds a bit grand.

200
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,760
But it's not hard to analyze consumers' behaviors.

201
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,420
-Why do we need to understand consumers?
-Yeah! I'm in the same class as Sohee.

202
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,070
The first step to marketing is to understand the consumers.

203
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,940
If you know their environment or culture,

204
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,740
I can make them fall in love with me more easily.

205
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,410
Now,

206
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,270
you have to choose your group members that you will be spending this semester with.

207
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,130
Three in a group.

208
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,620
No matter what, I have to be in the same group as Sohee.

209
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,910
What is he doing?

210
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,620
Do you want to form a team with me?

211
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,010
Okay.

212
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,130
Can I join you?

213
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,740
What is this?

214
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,720
What is it?

215
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,320
It's nothing, senior.

216
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,140
Let's focus on our research.

217
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,020
Annoying bastard.

218
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,420
You're Lee Yoonsoo, right?

219
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,220
Thank you for remembering me.

220
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,200
Do you think I interfered with Sohee getting together with you?

221
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,730
What? Is that not it?

222
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,530
How could your memory be like this?

223
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,760
How narrow-minded.

224
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,920
How did you remember it then?

225
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,370
Forget it. Why do I have to spell it out for you?

226
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,710
What is it?

227
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,410
It's fine. Just tell me more in detail.

228
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,860
Student. What's your name?

229
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,480
Jung Dohoon.

230
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,780
I can't hear you.

231
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,540
My name is Jung Dohoon.

232
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,380
I've said this.

233
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,070
If you're later than me, you're late.

234
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,080
So, Jung Dohoon,

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,800
you're late since the start of school.

236
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,910
All right. Everyone's here for the "Customer Behavior Analysis" class, right?

237
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,610
Yes.

238
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,790
All right. Three in a group.

239
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,450
Do you want to form a team with me?

240
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,270
Yes, I do.

241
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,300
Count me in.

242
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,619
Hello.

243
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,839
You're early.

244
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,020
Please speak to me casually.

245
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,589
When we get closer, I will drop the honorifics.

246
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,970
Have this.

247
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,680
I don't drink coffee.

248
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,040
Really?

249
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,220
Should I go buy a herbal tea near here then?

250
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,830
No. It's fine.

251
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,160
Just in case, do you like me?

252
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,850
No.

253
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,140
Actually...

254
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,260
Rather than like,

255
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,610
I love you.

256
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,350
I appreciate your feelings.

257
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,560
But I already have someone I like.

258
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,140
Liar.

259
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,150
Who is it?

260
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,910
Jung Dohoon.

261
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,300
No way.

262
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,310
It's true.

263
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,800
I don't think I can sit here today.

264
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,160
Explain it to Dohoon.

265
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,840
Okay.

266
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,630
I understand how you feel. Go have a good rest.

267
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,750
Okay.

268
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,150
Hello.

269
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,210
Where is Sohee going?

270
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,410
She said it's her 100th day anniversary with her boyfriend.

271
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,000
I told her to go home and celebrate.

272
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,090
S-Sohee has a boyfriend?

273
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,570
Seems like it.

274
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,890
She felt sorry, so she bought you coffee.

275
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,090
I organized the presentation with the theme we came up with today.

276
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,180
Take a look.

277
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,100
Okay, we have to study.

278
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,320
You did well.

279
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,500
When doing the presentation,

280
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,420
the design concept is also very important.

281
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,130
The colors of each page,

282
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,150
how to match each page,

283
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,040
and the overall color and style...

284
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,890
You did a good job.

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,360
Senior, are you hungry?

286
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,230
Let's order food delivery.

287
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,700
I brought kimbap. Do you want some?

288
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,970
Kimbap? I love that.

289
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,550
Then let's eat outside instead of here.

290
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,000
Sure, if that's what you want.

291
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,080
Wow. Can I eat it?

292
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,220
Yes.

293
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,620
I didn't bring any chopsticks.

294
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,600
I will just eat with my hands.

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,740
Wait.

296
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,620
What are you doing? It's okay.

297
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,400
Okay, you can eat now.

298
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,760
It's so delicious.

299
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,430
Where did you buy it?

300
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
I made it.

301
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,270
You're really something.

302
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,080
Let's do business together in the future.

303
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,700
I want to learn how to cook a little more when I have the opportunity to.

304
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,650
It's my dream to open a restaurant.

305
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,850
You must like cooking.

306
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,900
When someone likes the food I make,

307
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,970
I feel accomplished.

308
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,330
The bigger the dream, the better.

309
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,780
You can open a course menu restaurant.

310
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,220
I'll go too.

311
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,260
Delicious!

312
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,450
Do you like the ends?

313
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
When I eat the ends, it reminds me of the past. It's nice.

314
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,890
Every time I went on a picnic, the ends that my mom gave me

315
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,730
were really delicious.

316
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,960
And my mom's Kimbap is a bit special.

317
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
How so?

318
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,420
My mom's Kimbap

319
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,270
has an egg roll with pollack roe at the bottom

320
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,590
that she'd put in the Kimbap

321
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,280
and with shredded cucumber strips with mayonnaise on it.

322
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,270
When you take a bite, it's crispy and soft at the same time.

323
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,360
Crispy. Soft.

324
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,960
What are you writing?

325
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,790
Can I try your mother's Kimbap next time?

326
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,970
The one that my mom makes?

327
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,980
Unfortunately, you can't.

328
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,210
My mom is no longer around.

329
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,470
I see.

330
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,070
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,700
It's nothing.

332
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,420
You'll let me have a bite when you make it, right?

333
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,250
Of course.

334
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,020
Do you have water.

335
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,920
No. I don't have water and chopsticks.

336
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,440
Did we get along so well?

337
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,780
You don't remember anything?

338
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,860
Well, I remember the Kimbap.

339
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,810
I don't know about anything else.

340
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,410
Did you drop out to learn cooking?

341
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,280
You knew I dropped out?

342
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,800
Of course.

343
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,590
The person I saw every day suddenly disappeared.

344
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,290
It's strange so I asked around.

345
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,990
I did learn cooking after dropping out,

346
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,260
but I didn't quit because of cooking.

347
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,430
Can I ask why you dropped out?

348
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,920
I liked someone.

349
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,290
But I wanted to avoid them.

350
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,500
Then just forget about them. Why did you have to drop out?

351
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,610
Instead of that,

352
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,990
dropping out will make me not seem them for real.

353
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,130
Who is the person you like?

354
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,310
Brother.

355
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,210
What's wrong?

356
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,260
I mean... Brother.

357
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,140
Is it inconvenient if I know?

358
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,290
No. I mean I liked you, you!

359
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,020
You don't think that I still have the same thoughts as Yoonsoo then, right?

360
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,870
Yoonsoo!

361
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,210
No, Dohoon,

362
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,160
don't panic. Just be natural.

363
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,450
Goodness.

364
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Are you hurt?

365
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,650
No, I'm fine.

366
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,690
What? Who's that handsome guy?

367
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,070
I gave you my number.

368
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,410
How could you follow me here?

369
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,990
He's the intern that will be working at our department for three months, Park Sangwoo.

370
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,590
Thank you for the food.

371
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,970
I've heard this at the office

372
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,870
but the person who made you the Dakgangjeong

373
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,720
is your lover, right?
