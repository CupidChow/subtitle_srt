00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,270
What are you doing outside when it's so cold?

3
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,840
I'll freeze to death if I keep sleeping here.

4
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,550
Let's go now.

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,900
Why is it so dark in the morning?

6
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,670
It's as dark as my future.

7
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,580
What's wrong with your future?

8
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,979
Look ahead. The sun is coming out.

9
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,550
There're only good things coming your way from now on.

10
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,020
The sun is so bright.

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,080
Yes.

12
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,210
You don't have to go to the office today, right?

13
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,950
Yeah, it's the weekend.

14
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,820
That's nice. I'll have to get to my restaurant right after a shower.

15
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,400
You must be tired.

16
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,900
Did I upset you?

17
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,370
No, not at all.

18
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,090
We're really fine, right?

19
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,830
Of course.

20
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,320
I'll call you again.

21
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,450
Okay.

22
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,880
No matter what, I shouldn't have kissed him.

23
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,670
Dohoon, come to your senses.

24
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,880
Gosh. What a mess.

25
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,270
Gosh.

26
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,630
It's already 10 a.m.?

27
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,540
[Lee Yoonsoo]

28
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,460
Hello? What is it?

29
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,810
I'm sorry to trouble you,

30
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,820
but I didn't turn off the stove before I left home.

31
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,590
Can you take a look for me?

32
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,430
Okay.

33
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,520
It was a close call.

34
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,660
Gosh.

35
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,560
Gosh, thank you so much.

36
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,450
Come to the restaurant for dinner tonight.

37
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,920
I'll make you something delicious.

38
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,409
[Dohoon- 
It was tender inside. He ate with his eyes closed. No special reaction.]

39
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,690
It was tender inside. He ate with his eyes closed.

40
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,010
No special reaction.

41
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,640
Was my feedback so insincere?

42
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,930
He liked sweets when he was in college too.

43
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,470
The client didn't like the proposal, so get to the office right away.

44
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,700
Gosh.

45
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,480
How can they change their mind so suddenly?

46
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,400
When it's cold, it's natural to want some hot soup.

47
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,000
The delicious meat stock made with soybean paste

48
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,409
and dried cabbage that's in season during the kimchi-making period
make up the perfect combination

49
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,309
to make the dried cabbage short rib soup

50
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,500
that can help you easily overcome the cold.

51
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,910
Wow, it's so charming.

52
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
Wow, it's so charming.

53
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,860
This is the best food I've ever had.

54
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,450
I should've ordered an upsized portion.

55
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,550
I'm not lying. It's really good.

56
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,000
Right?

57
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,160
The door's opening.

58
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,590
Isn't it good?

59
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,570
It's the weekend. This is too much.

60
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,410
I finally got my wife's permission for a day out.

61
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,860
I was practically rolling down the mountain

62
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,580
to get here.

63
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,270
I was in a Pilates session just now.

64
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,090
I finally decided to enroll in the class today and this happens.

65
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,910
Luckily, I finished the first half of my game.

66
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,480
Mr. Jung. You're dressed casually too.

67
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,930
All my clothes are in the laundry.

68
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,250
Ms. Sung should be dressed as usual.

69
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,810
I guess she only works at home too,

70
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,310
wearing her usual black turtleneck.

71
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,960
Wow, everyone's here early.

72
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,140
Mr. Han is here. I'll go get him.

73
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,690
Gather in the meeting room.

74
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,070
Hello.

75
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,020
You must have been enjoying your hobbies.

76
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,150
How idle.

77
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,420
Mr. Han.

78
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,560
What is the chairman not satisfied with?

79
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,420
About the proposal you sent me via email,

80
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,270
it looked fine on the phone

81
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,910
but when we saw it on the big screen in the meeting room,

82
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,330
it didn't look good.

83
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,740
It looked familiar too.

84
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,660
Yes, that's right.

85
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,810
If you want to subvert the cliché,

86
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,170
you have to reference the cliché to a certain extent...

87
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,210
Don't you think I know that?

88
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,090
The problem is that even the portions meant to subvert the norm felt familiar.

89
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,820
What's with his tone?

90
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,300
We don't even know each other. Why is he talking down to me?

91
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,530
I feel like it's not enough. It doesn't have a punch.

92
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,870
It's like it can be more interesting,

93
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,080
but it ended before anything interesting happened.

94
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,130
That's why it has been bugging me.

95
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,800
You're right.

96
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,180
Since I already opened it, should I have just read everything?

97
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,590
It's really bugging me.

98
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,020
Previously, I mentioned that it should be meme-able

99
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,220
but also be elegant,

100
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,450
in hopes that you would

101
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,830
improve upon your original idea.

102
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,760
But I think it didn't meet my expectations.

103
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,570
I've already emphasized that we need to make it more elegant.

104
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,540
Please give us more time

105
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,250
to revise it according to your critique and submit it again.

106
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,560
It's not like this is our first time working together,

107
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,190
so of course we trust you.

108
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,670
I won't set a deadline, 
but try to send an improved version to me as soon as possible.

109
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,220
Yes, sir.

110
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,930
I'll get going then.

111
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,770
What? Is this all?

112
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,590
No.

113
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,780
I can't let you waste your precious weekend, right?

114
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Enjoy your own hobbies.

115
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,850
Take care.

116
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,680
Come up with some ideas, okay?

117
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,480
I have to go now. Let's talk again next Monday.

118
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,480
Why did he call us over for this?

119
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,790
It's enough to discuss it through a phone call on Monday.

120
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,330
Hana. Mr. Han did it on purpose.

121
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,440
Darn it.

122
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,390
Ms. Choi!

123
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,960
Didn't I tell you to wait until I get new employees?

124
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,730
All the projects are going well and we're so busy right now.

125
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,230
How can I accept your resignation at a time like this?

126
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,790
It's been almost a month since I told you about my resignation.

127
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,270
Besides, from my perspective,

128
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,300
I'm already resigning. 
Do I have to take into account everything about how the company operates?

129
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,240
Please agree to my resignation by next Monday.

130
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,980
Babe.

131
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,350
That's why I asked you to stay until this project is over.

132
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,160
Now I've realized that you're quite irresponsible.

133
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,810
Ms. Choi.

134
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,530
You've heard that, right?

135
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,960
She's so loud.

136
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,780
You're the one whom I'm most sorry towards.

137
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,920
But you've been doing well,

138
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,910
so I feel at ease about resigning.

139
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,050
Why are you suddenly quitting?

140
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,420
You can lead the project well even without me, right?

141
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,700
Good luck.

142
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,310
Mr. Jung, did I interrupt you?

143
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,780
No.

144
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,330
After shouting, I feel much better.

145
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,300
It's nice.

146
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,920
So this is how you relieve stress on your own.

147
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,750
Here, Mr. Jung.

148
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,220
Thank you.

149
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,030
This isn't mint chocolate latte.

150
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,520
You said you didn't like it,

151
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,590
so I bought you a hot Americano.

152
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,220
I didn't really like

153
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,800
mint chocolate latte at first,

154
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
but thanks to you, I've had it several times.

155
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,690
And now, sometimes, I sort of crave it.

156
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,380
That's how everyone falls in love with the mint chocolate flavor.

157
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,960
Sangwoo. Did you like mint chocolate latte from the beginning?

158
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,970
I went on a trip to Venice in Italy.

159
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,280
There was a cafe called Florian.

160
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,690
I heard that Casanova always got the mint chocolate latte there.

161
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,590
That's why I tried it too, and guess what?

162
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,050
I felt like I could relate to Casanova.

163
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,510
So you're saying that you're quite the playboy like Casanova?

164
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,610
Let's get back to business.

165
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,740
Did Ms. Choi betray you?

166
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,210
How are you able to change the topic so quickly?

167
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,900
I wish she had told me earlier.

168
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,060
I'm quite disappointed.

169
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,180
If I were you, in such a situation,

170
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,730
I would have fought with her just now.

171
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,170
You seem very mature.

172
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,000
You can control your emotions well and you're always calm.

173
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,530
No, you're wrong.

174
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,900
I don't get angry easily

175
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,520
because I'm exhausted

176
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,240
and in my power-saving mode.

177
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,010
Was the food good?

178
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,800
Yes, thank you.

179
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,670
Now that the weather's cold, the food tastes even better.

180
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,220
I drank yesterday

181
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,070
and this soup was perfect for nursing a hangover.

182
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,500
Thank you.

183
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,480
Excuse me, but can you take a photo with us?

184
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,440
Of course.

185
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,100
Come on.

186
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,080
Okay.

187
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,340
-Thank you. 
-Thank you.

188
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,520
Please come often when we open officially.

189
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,700
Yes, we will.

190
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,900
Thank you.

191
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,930
Bye.

192
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,900
Bye.

193
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,700
You're here. It's cold, right?

194
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,940
It's cold outside but it's warm in here.

195
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,260
They're customers.

196
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,150
Your outfit is so cute.

197
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,500
It's a long story.

198
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,520
You look good in that too.

199
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,750
-Have a seat. 
-It's okay.

200
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,920
You want to eat right away, right?

201
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,260
Yes. Shall we eat together?

202
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,910
Okay. I want to eat too.

203
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,920
Looks good.

204
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,180
Yoonsoo.

205
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,980
Joowon.

206
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,760
Is there food for me too?

207
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,920
We were just about to eat. Come sit down.

208
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,970
He's Lee Joowon, a part-timer at the restaurant next door.

209
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,510
Introduce yourself properly to him. He was my college senior.

210
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,580
Hello.

211
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,720
I'm Lee Joowon, who comes here often to get free food.

212
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,080
Nice to meet you.

213
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,890
Nice to meet you too.

214
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,710
You must come here often.

215
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,500
He often makes new dishes here

216
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,660
and I come here sometimes to try them and give him feedback. 
That's how we became close.

217
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,030
The name of this dish is dried cabbage short rib soup.

218
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,220
It's also known as the Energizing Meal.

219
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,250
Short rib soup sure is energizing.

220
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,840
Let's eat.

221
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,340
Thank you for the food.

222
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,290
You can't call this just food.

223
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,640
It's a masterpiece.

224
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,770
Yoonsoo.

225
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,860
Are you going to keep creating masterpieces?

226
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,750
My appetite is raging because of you.

227
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,070
What should I do?

228
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,920
He exaggerates a lot.

229
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,150
I'm not exaggerating.

230
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,810
It's unbelievable how deep and refreshing this soup is.

231
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,450
Even with just a sip, I already feel like I'm full of energy.

232
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,240
And how did you

233
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,270
make the short ribs so tender?

234
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,180
Wow. It's amazing.

235
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,990
What about you? Do you like the food?

236
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,050
Wow, it's so charming.

237
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,050
This is the best food I've ever had.

238
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm not lying. It's really good, right?

239
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,950
I thought he was Baek Jongwon from the show Alley Restaurant.

240
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,860
Right! The beef is so thick and juicy...

241
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,340
Come on. The beef was boiled, not grilled.

242
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,210
You're exaggerating by saying it's juicy.

243
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,490
Right?

244
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,030
What a punk.

245
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,010
Fantastic.

246
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,120
This is the Energizing Meal,

247
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,420
but it feels like he was the only one energized.

248
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,840
He just went on and on.

249
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,970
He is indeed talkative and noisy,

250
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,630
but he's kind.

251
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,010
He's quite helpful to me.

252
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,760
He must come here quite a lot.

253
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Sometimes.

254
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,930
You should bring your colleagues here for a meal sometimes too.

255
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,710
Okay.

256
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,570
But I don't really like that that guy comes here often.

257
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,480
What? Are you jealous?

258
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,300
I don't think I can provide feedback as well as he can,

259
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,300
so don't go to all the trouble to cook for me.

260
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,680
I enjoy cooking for you.

261
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,510
I cook for you because you like my food.

262
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,270
It makes me happy too.

263
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,800
I told you before,

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,470
that you can refuse if you don't like it.

265
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,740
You can eat now.

266
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,480
Thank you for the food.

267
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,270
This will taste different from what you ate during the day.

268
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,130
I remember now.

269
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,710
What?

270
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,690
Although you make common home-cooked dishes,

271
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,350
it tastes different from other food.

272
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,190
It feels like there's some special ingredient in your food.

273
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,120
Even I don't understand what I'm saying,

274
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,540
but now, I don't want to eat food made by others.

275
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,450
Let's finish this up quickly

276
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,520
and go have a drink at my place.

277
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,270
It's the weekend. Let's drink to celebrate.

278
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,790
It seems like the pot was really burnt. There's still a burnt smell at home.

279
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,010
If it weren't for me, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

280
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,730
Thank you so much,

281
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,240
but can you spray this for me?

282
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,700
I'll go wash up first.

283
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,680
Okay.

284
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,820
But I have to spray it on you first.

285
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,370
Chefs can't help it that they smell of food.

286
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll go wash up quickly.

287
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,950
Okay.

288
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,520
We're close enough for me to read it.

289
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,630
No.

290
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,680
This is still something private after all.

291
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,960
But I'm sure it'll be okay to just take a look.

292
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,580
Dohoon. Don't do anything that goes against your conscience.

293
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,370
I'm sorry,

294
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,900
but can you get me a towel from the drawer?

295
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,570
Okay.

296
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,350
Yoonsoo, I brought you a towel.

297
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,950
I brought you a towel.

298
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,710
What are you doing?

299
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,720
If you don't like it, just refuse.

300
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,500
Let me explain. It's...

301
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,200
Dohoon.

302
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,560
I'm sorry, but can you take me home?

303
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,040
Who are you, you scumbag?

304
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,000
Who the heck are you?
