1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,350
Everyone.

3
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,220
It's time to get off work. Let's have an enjoyable meeting.

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,920
Gosh.

5
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,130
According to my research, while Taurine 2 is the rising star of the health drinks market,

6
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,010
but but the market is still in the rise

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,680
and youths take up a very small market share.

8
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,050
So the main target of this campaign is customers in their 20s and 30s.

9
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,010
To carve the image of a youthful drink,

10
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,580
we came up with some ideas.

11
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,260
The creative concept drawn from yesterday's meeting

12
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,420
is "Fill up the youth! Pick me up!" this tagline...

13
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,830
Seems like you'll have to bathe the kids by yourself.

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,420
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,729
Go for the dinner without me guys...

16
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,970
Adios...

17
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,690
Honey, I struck the lottery.

18
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,370
The overtime lottery.

19
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,140
Mm... Pick me, pick me, pick me up.

20
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,730
Yes. "Pick me up" means to get things together...

21
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,710
Change the copy.

22
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,820
You said it was trendy and good yesterday.

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,910
Mr. Jung, is there something you want to tell me?

24
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,200
Oh... No.

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,620
I got it.

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,070
Ms. Sung,

27
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,000
the problem is tomorrow is the pitch.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,150
If we change the copy now, we need make necessary arrangements.

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,400
It's too risky.

30
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,270
Then just hurry up.

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,160
Let's stay here all night

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,950
and go to the pitching venue tomorrow.

33
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,910
Get your pretty clothes

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,210
and see you here at 10 p.m. tonight.

35
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,520
Okay, dismissed.

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,590
What's wrong with her?

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,090
Is she going through menopause?

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,579
Even someone in puberty, wouldn't act like her.

39
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,100
I told you that I had a bad feeling yesterday, right?

40
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,670
Ha... I'm hungry.

41
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,160
[Ha... I'm hungry.]

42
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,010
Mr. Jung, it must be tough.

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,810
Let's pull through.

44
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,900
Prepare three copies before the meeting tonight.

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,880
Okay, Ms. Choi.

46
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,820
As an advertisement planner,

47
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,400
you're too rigid.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,240
Mr. Jung, I will take responsibility for you,

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,730
so think of as many as you can.

50
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,480
In the end, you're in charge anyway.

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,740
Mr. Nam, don't make fun of me.

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,570
Mr. Jung.

53
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,620
Should I give you some reference materials

54
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,860
that'd help you with the new copies?

55
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,790
Of course, as the second runners, we are also very busy.

56
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,220
But as the first runner, it's more urgent for you now.

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,410
So I'm telling you out of kindness.

58
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,070
Tell me... Tell me one by one.

59
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,360
I can't think well.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,440
Oh, right! My instant noodles...

61
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,700
Are you Sohee?

62
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,620
Oh, hello!

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,350
Yes. L-long time no see.

64
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,590
For real.

65
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,070
Did we meet in the church...

66
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,050
No. We were in the same major in university.

67
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,870
That's right, that's right! My major's senior!

68
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,230
Your name is Choi...

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,140
Jung Dohoon.

70
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,750
Oh right, Dohoon!

71
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,440
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,909
My boyfriend works on the 5th floor.

73
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,260
Boyfriend?

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
But this is the 6th floor.

75
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,370
You're right.

76
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,220
See you then, Dohoon.

77
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,350
Okay.

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,950
It was nice to meet you.

79
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,870
Okay.

80
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,790
Hey, Mr. Jung. Dohoon!

81
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,230
Do you still have a long way to go?

82
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,650
I want to be alone.

83
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,250
Come out, you punk! Gosh!

84
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,020
Hold it back. Don't come out.

85
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,800
Come out! Come out!

86
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,800
The last one.

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,240
That's all.

88
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,080
It's heavy, isn't it?

89
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,060
Is there a rock inside?

90
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,230
It's not a stone. It's iron.

91
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,890
Don't drink this.

92
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,040
Drink this.

93
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,750
Okay.

94
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,510
It tastes a little sour, but it's not that it has gone bad.

95
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,830
Okay, thank you.

96
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,790
Have a rest.

97
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,530
Ramyeon and lunchbox?

98
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,010
Amazake. Also known as sweet wine in our language.

99
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,190
Rice wine and amazake are different.

100
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,050
The rice punch is fermented with maltose,

101
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,780
and amazake is fermented with fermentation starter.

102
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,460
So after fermentation, alcohol will be produced,

103
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,250
eventually making it makgeolli.

104
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,360
If you don't control the fermentation time, it will just become alcohol.

105
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,909
But when the timing is right,

106
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,640
it will be sweet and refreshing amazake.

107
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,590
It tastes like makgeolli,

108
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,430
but it tastes good.

109
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,200
Thank you.

110
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,330
I have to work in three hours.

111
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,510
Is that reality?

112
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,510
I need to go back quickly to get some sleep even if it's just an hour.

113
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,850
I'm sleepy.

114
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,960
Who is it?

115
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,910
Hello. I just moved in next door.

116
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,190
Please take care of me in the future.

117
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,110
I mean... I'm really busy today.

118
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,790
It hasn't even been three seconds since I came home and laid down.

119
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,320
But you rang the doorbell and woke me up.

120
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,140
I thought it would be rude to come to you as soon as you got home

121
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,640
so I rang the doorbell two hours after.

122
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,490
What are you talking about? I just got home...

123
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,290
What time is it now?

124
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,460
Half past eight.

125
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,730
What's that?

126
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,000
Whatever.

127
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,760
Hey, Jung Dohoon. You're late.

128
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,070
What?

129
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,250
What are you holding?

130
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,120
Why did you buy something?

131
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,490
-Cheers! -Cheers!

132
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,100
Let's listen to Mr. Jung's idea after we drink.

133
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,220
There must be a reason why you're late.

134
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,740
This is rice punch, right?

135
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,020
It's sweet, but it's a bit weird.

136
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,030
You're right. It's a little sour.

137
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,720
Sweet.

138
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,940
Sour.

139
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,380
Bitter?

140
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,660
Did it ferment it too much?

141
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,450
Why are your cheeks red?

142
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,310
Red?

143
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,190
Mr. Jung, where did you get this?

144
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,800
I didn't buy it. Someone gave it to me.

145
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,780
Right? It tastes like someone made it themselves.

146
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,720
[I hope you will get your shit together after drinking this amazake]

147
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,150
I hope you will get your shit together after drinking this amazake.

148
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,590
What the? Is he cussing at me?

149
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,740
Was I too harsh with my words just now?

150
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,620
Get your shit together...

151
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,570
Get... your... shit... together...

152
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,490
All right, since we've already drank it,

153
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,580
shall we listen to Mr. Jung's idea?

154
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,830
Get your! Shit together!

155
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,650
Mr. Jung, are you crazy?

156
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,430
No matter how much you hate Ms. Sung,

157
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,710
you can't cuss at her!

158
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,830
-You punk. You think you can say anything just because you're an assistant manager?
-No.

159
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,750
Come out!

160
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,770
No, t-that's not what I meant.

161
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,650
It's actually a pun!

162
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,130
It sounds like a cuss but it actually means

163
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,950
to get your life together!

164
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,990
So to put it nicely,

165
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,470
it just means "Get it together!"

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,180
So it's an encouragement...

167
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,320
Uh... How should I put it...

168
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,320
A young man was all tired out.

169
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,710
But at this moment, we gave them our drink,

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,870
saying, "Hey, young man.

171
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,190
Get it together."

172
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,280
T-that's what I mean.

173
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,470
Am I being too imaginative? Sorry.

174
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,500
Get your shit together...

175
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,350
You all heard Mr. Jung's idea, right?

176
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Don't you think it'd be great if we add a narrative to it?

177
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,020
Get your shit together!

178
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,830
We have 12 hours left to the pitch.

179
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,480
Get your... shit together!

180
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,540
Mr. Nam will come with me later.

181
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,850
Get your... shit together!

182
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,560
-Get your shit together. -Yes

183
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,060
Get it together!

184
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,690
[Get your shit together!]

185
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,260
[Get it together]

186
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,260
Get it together.

187
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,350
It means to pick yourself up.

188
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,060
A new start.

189
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,910
In other words, it also means

190
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,470
[Get it together Challenge Cheer]

191
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,590
to challenge and cheer on.

192
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,460
Get your shit together

193
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,120
injects a layer of liveliness to it.

194
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,500
It's something that the youths need to hear the most nowadays

195
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,430
but it's became something weird to say.

196
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,640
So we want to say to our target customers in their 20s and 30s

197
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,830
to get their shit together.

198
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,830
Did I scare you?

199
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,220
It's not a cuss.

200
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,140
It means life is starting.

201
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,760
This is the topic idea to help youths challenge with a lively health drink,

202
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,420
that Gogo Communications has came.

203
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,300
Thank you for your hard work.

204
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,910
Go home and get some rest.

205
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,420
Good work, Mr. Jung.

206
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,290
As expected of our ace. See you tomorrow.

207
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,270
See you.

208
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,740
[I hope you will get your shit together after drinking this amazake]

209
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,470
Didn't you ring the doorbell?

210
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,950
I did.

211
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,540
The rice punch you gave me yesterday was delicious.

212
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,420
I wanted to repay you with this.

213
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,100
Come in.

214
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,150
No, it's okay. I will leave after giving you this.

215
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,710
It's rude to just let the guest leave.

216
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,060
Come in.

217
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,460
What is this?

218
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,450
It's a chicken. Raw chicken

219
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,040
Why are you giving me chicken?

220
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,340
I wanted to buy you fried chicken,

221
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,810
but I don't think we're close enough to eat chicken together.

222
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,460
So I thought raw chicken is better.

223
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,170
When we get closer, let's have fried chicken and beer together.

224
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
You must be a good cook.

225
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,890
How do you know that?

226
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,770
I mean your kitchen tools are really extensive.

227
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,430
The rice punch you made yesterday must've been made by yourself too.

228
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,060
You're quite observant.

229
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,570
But that's not rice punch but amazake.

230
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,600
Isn't rice punch just amazake?

231
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,820
That's not it.

232
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,410
The rice punch is fermented with maltose,

233
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,840
and amazake is fermented with fermentation starter.

234
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,190
Oh... Is there a difference?

235
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,420
Amazake contains protein and amino acid.

236
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,350
It's good for health recovery.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,690
But if you ferment it too much, it will become makgeolli.

238
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,120
That's a kind of wine.

239
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,010
That's why for amazake, timing is very important.

240
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,390
Timing?

241
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,730
Can I ask you a question now?

242
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,920
Have we met before?

243
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,630
We met yesterday.

244
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,910
No. I meant if we've met way before yesterday.

245
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,270
I wonder.

246
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,330
Do you remember something?

247
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,170
Are you from Dongil University?

248
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,790
Yes, I am.

249
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,700
How old are you?

250
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,640
28.

251
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,390
I'm one year older than you.

252
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,550
Did we take classes together?

253
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,010
Class?

254
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,490
It's an elective.

255
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,860
I think it's "Marriage and Love."

256
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,050
Marriage and Love?

257
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,780
Go on.

258
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,150
So...

259
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,530
That's why... you're still single.

260
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,200
Trust me and go to this class.

261
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,670
Let's go.

262
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,490
Wow.

263
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,130
Senior, there are so many boys here.

264
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,220
Just wait. There are four more students.

265
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,770
It's a girl.

266
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,040
Calm down. She's a professor.

267
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,130
Hello everyone.

268
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,980
We're here to learn about love techniques

269
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,440
through dating. Welcome to

270
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,720
"Marriage and Love."

271
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,380
As you all know, this is a class where girls and guys are partnered toegether.

272
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,480
It's a little embarrassing to say this

273
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,770
but this course has been evaluated as the hottest class for five years in a row.

274
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,560
So today's lesson's most important part is to choose a partner.

275
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,590
Since there are fewer girls,

276
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,330
let the girls choose first.

277
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,140
Once you have a partner, you can go have lunch.

278
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,190
One more thing. Boys coupling up with boys is fine too.

279
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,700
All right. Let’s start.

280
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,980
Smile.

281
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,190
I am smiling.

282
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,530
Over there.

283
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,240
What should we do?

284
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,860
Over there!

285
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,330
I'm dropping this class.

286
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,390
Are you two going to be partners or drop the class?

287
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,310
We're dropping it.

288
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,760
Do you think I took "Marriage and Love"

289
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,940
because I wanted to find a partner on campus?

290
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,750
Not only in the major,

291
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,550
I'm a famous campus hottie within the school too.

292
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,850
By the way, during college, didn't you drink a lot?

293
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,440
In "The World of Wine,"

294
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,180
the first thing we should drink is wine.

295
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,740
There's a word called wind and earth conditions.

296
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:12,060
It's a word that means the climate, temperature, and soil.

297
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,570
Even if they are the same type of grapes,

298
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,900
according to the conditions, the taste will be different.

299
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,020
The red wine in front of you is Cabernet Sauvignon.

300
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,010
It's a basic wine.

301
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,670
-You bought new clothes?
-Not only in Korea.

302
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,110
-How did you know?
-This is also a world-renowned wine.

303
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,360
You haven't removed the tag yet.

304
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
-Gosh.
-French, Chile,

305
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,490
-How much did you drink?
-and America. It is famous in these places too.

306
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,870
I was just drinking.

307
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,060
Why don't you skip class and go to bed?

308
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,780
-The texture is more or less thick, deep, and strong.
-No, I'll get an F if I don't come to class.

309
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,360
So those who are trying wine for the first time might not be accustomed to it. I'm forewarning you.

310
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, since you've heard the introduction,

311
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,370
let's have a taste.

312
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,410
And before you smell it, swirl it like this.

313
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,930
Stick your nose into the glass and smell it.

314
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,610
Now, you have to taste it.

315
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,510
Drink half a mouthful of wine, and hold it like it's a mouthwash.

316
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,180
Don't, never, drink it all.

317
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,460
Spit every drop in the paper cup.

318
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,770
You threw up on me during class

319
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,230
and then took a leave of absence.

320
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,690
That was you, right?

321
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,520
Is this a real experience you had?

322
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,700
I didn't drink at all during school, okay?

323
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,510
Really?

324
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,870
Do you want some more amazake?

325
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,690
Do you not have beer?

326
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,500
I do. Hold on.

327
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,060
Who is this in the photo?

328
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,050
Don't you know him?

329
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,880
He's famous. His name is Yoo Junghoon.

330
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,760
He's an actor I like.

331
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,420
He's just okay looking.

332
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,670
What do you like about him?

333
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,790
When I first saw him on TV,

334
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,790
his eyes were sad, but he was handsome.

335
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,500
I wasn't attracted to him at first.

336
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,750
But somehow...

337
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,430
What do you think? Is it similar?

338
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,420
Gosh.

339
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,550
What's this? Room 302.

340
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,980
Someone's making lunchboxes for you Mr. Jung.

341
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,600
Someone must've fallen for you.

342
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,210
He's just a friend who lives next door.

343
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,980
Can I eat some first before I tell you?

344
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,860
I remember that class now! It's... It's that class!
