1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,660
Can I ask why you dropped out of school?

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,120
I liked someone,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,940
but I didn't want to affect him.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,120
Then you could have just forgotten about him. Why did you have to drop out?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,310
Rather than that,

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,900
I thought it'd be better not having to see him if I dropped out.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,340
Who was the person you liked?

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,680
Bro.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,740
Yeah?

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,190
No, bro.

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,549
Is it inconvenient if I know?

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,980
I meant that you were the one I liked.

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,290
Gosh. It was seven years ago.

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,740
Don't tell me you think I'd still

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,270
have the exact same feelings as my old self right now?

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,630
Wait, Dohoon.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't panic. Act natural.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,370
Of course not.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,480
Then w-w-why did you move here?

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,330
It sure took you long to ask this.

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,490
I'm going to open a restaurant nearby soon.

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,260
Wow, you're a real chef now.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,430
I guess so.

25
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,510
But it's not a big restaurant. There will only be one table in my shop.

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,610
Can one table keep the business running?

27
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,030
I'm thinking about a Korean cuisine full course meal for the menu.

28
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm still considering the specific dishes,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,570
but it's not been easy.

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,950
So I want to ask you.

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,080
How do you usually have dinner?

32
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,350
When I work late, I eat at the office.

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,930
When I don't, I eat at the convenience store.

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,110
I have a favor to ask. I don't know if it's too much to ask of you,

35
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,430
but after you get off work, instead of eating outside,

36
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,000
can you come to my house to eat my cooking

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,880
and give me some feedback?

38
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:54,350
I think it might help me decide my menu.

39
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,229
Of course I'd love to, I get to even save up on food expenses.

40
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,740
Do I just have to provide honest feedback?

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,680
Yes.

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
I just need your honest feedback. Deal?

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,670
Deal.

44
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,900
Stamp it. Copy it. The contract is signed.

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,420
Lastly, cheers!

46
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,970
There's no more...

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,530
I'll get it.

48
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,490
Hey, I really didn't expect that you'd move in next door.

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,610
So you're saying that Unit 301 isn't to your liking, right?

50
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,310
Yes. I prefer a bigger kitchen.

51
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,520
Gosh.

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,110
This is the first time I'm rejected by a male client because of a small kitchen.

53
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,880
Okay. Let's see.

54
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,210
I have a place that I really value.

55
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,010
I'm sure you'll like it.

56
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,480
If you don't like that place,

57
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,579
then you'll have to find another neighborhood to live in.

58
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,470
Do you smoke?

59
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,820
No, go ahead.

60
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,970
Okay.

61
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,180
Hey, the tenant of Unit 302. You got off work so early?

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,160
I'm getting off work indeed, but from yesterday's shift.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,900
Poor thing. The house is spacious and good, isn't it?

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,710
Aside from the expensive rent, it's good.

65
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,540
I see.

66
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,720
I told you that this house is nice.

67
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,410
Your shoelaces are undone.

68
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,690
I'm done smoking. Let's go.

69
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,310
What's wrong? Let's go.

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,410
Does that person live in Unit 302?

71
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,100
Yes. The one next to the house you just saw.

72
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,740
Then I'll take it.

73
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,190
Yoonsoo, where's the bottle opener?

74
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,790
Yoonsoo.

75
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,690
Didn't you ask me for the bottle opener?

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,010
Gosh, my body aches.

77
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,459
What were you expecting?

78
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,769
I'm leaving.

79
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,040
Aren't you going to finish drinking?

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,329
I'm full.

81
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,030
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,550
Darn it.

83
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,690
Gosh.

84
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,380
I'm screwed. How am I going to face him now?

85
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,890
Good morning.

86
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,530
Who is it?

87
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,020
I'm Yoonsoo. Your phone number hasn't changed.

88
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,050
Yes, it hasn't changed.

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,250
You know we're having dinner tonight, right?

90
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,560
Is 7 p.m. okay?

91
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,250
I haven't been off work on time for a long time.

92
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,730
I'll try to get off work on time.

93
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,940
Okay, see you tonight.

94
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,580
Are you okay?

95
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,590
Yes, I'm fine.

96
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,010
If you're okay, can you get up?

97
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,090
Gosh.

98
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,240
Are you hurt?

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,630
No, I'm fine.

100
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,450
Can we exchange phone numbers just in case?

101
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,490
Of course.

102
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,340
Please contact me if you're hurt.

103
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,650
Okay, I will.

104
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,760
Hold the elevator, please... goodness!

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,480
Gosh. What a wacko.

106
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,150
Good morning.

107
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,400
What happened?

108
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,380
Gosh. I think the client has contacted us.

109
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,240
And?

110
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,060
They said it's good because it's meme-able,

111
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,860
but they'd like it to be less crass.

112
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,290
Gosh.

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,380
Wow. Who's that handsome guy?

114
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,240
Didn't I already give you my number?

115
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,850
Why did you follow me all the way here?

116
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,020
What's going on? Did you already get to know each other?

117
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,680
Come on. Introduce yourself.

118
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,780
Everyone.

119
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,660
This is Park Sangwoo. He'll be interning for three months starting today.

120
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,580
Introduce yourself.

121
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,230
Hello, I'm Park Sangwoo.

122
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,020
My hobby is loving,

123
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,680
and my specialties are acting cute and being cute.

124
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,420
I look forward to working with you.

125
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,030
Let's give him a round of applause.

126
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,600
Mr. Jung, show him around.

127
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,240
I'll do my best, Mr. Jung.

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,270
Okay.

129
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,630
Photocopying is an essential work skill.

130
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,130
You must have used a photocopy machine before, right?

131
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,039
Of course.

132
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,020
I used to be a member of a church choir,

133
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,720
where I photocopied sheet music every day.

134
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,340
Now, I can do it even with my eyes closed.

135
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,770
Watch me.

136
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,420
Mr. Jung, where are you going?

137
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,020
Since we start and end the day with meetings,

138
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,690
there must be a meeting room.

139
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,440
By the way,

140
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,920
you'll be in charge of keeping the meeting room clean before and after meetings.

141
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,910
Wow. This place sure is enclosed.

142
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,900
I think it'd be nice and refreshing to have occasional meetings

143
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,580
at cafes or bars.

144
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,010
Gosh.

145
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,890
Why do you keep leaving?

146
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,970
If you suddenly feel suffocated midway through a meeting,

147
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,160
where should you go?

148
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,180
I know! The hospital ER.

149
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,620
Are you going to spend your annual leave days on going to the ER?

150
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,910
There's an ER you can go without using your annual leave days,

151
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,050
that is this break room.

152
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,440
The prescription includes coffee and chocolate.

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,650
But you can't eat too much.

154
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,320
The company doesn't replenish them that quickly.

155
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,560
It's just food. Why are the rules so strict?

156
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,460
Should I suggest something to the boss?

157
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,020
No, don't do that.

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,790
I'll teach you how to use the coffee machine while I make you a cup...

159
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,200
Let me make it for you.

160
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,940
I've been working part-time at the Starbucks across of this company for a long time.

161
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,920
No wonder you look familiar.

162
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,950
To think that you've drunk the coffee I made.

163
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,440
It feels sort of strange.

164
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,870
I don't really like coffee.

165
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,600
Whatever it is, don't you think we're fated?

166
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,070
I also saved you when you were in danger today.

167
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,350
I'm so happy that I have you

168
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,920
as my superior.

169
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,510
That's a relief then.

170
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,960
Smells good.

171
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,270
Right, you don't like coffee.

172
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,260
It smells good.

173
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,070
This is just the beginning. Why am I already drained?

174
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,560
We compile our researched references into something called the Fact Book.

175
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,350
That'll be your main job from now on.

176
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,600
The materials of each project are in their respective folders.

177
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,440
You can refer to them.

178
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,200
Then should I

179
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,780
start making the intimidating Fact Book now?

180
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,380
Yes.

181
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,330
Search for designs and advertising copies with similar references

and compile them into the Fact Book.

183
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,970
By the way,

184
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,480
did I do something wrong?

185
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,500
No.

186
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,920
You're so cold like ice.

187
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,650
I-Ice?

188
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,750
[Taurine 2]

189
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,500
Mr. Jung, would you like a cookie?

190
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,790
Sure.

191
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,350
The one whose hobby is loving

192
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,430
and whose specialty is acting cute, Sangwoo, do you want one too?

193
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,440
Yes.

194
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,950
-Thank you. 
-You're welcome.

195
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,210
There's chocolate on the marshmallows.

196
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,510
What kind of cookie is this?

197
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,080
It's the S'mores cookie that's been trending lately.

198
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,860
Sangwoo, cherish it.

199
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,430
It's my first time receiving food from Hana ever since I started working here.

200
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,160
Mr. Jung. I gave you gum last time.

201
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,570
Gum isn't food. It's just for chewing.

202
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,940
I swallow gum too.

203
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,410
Mr. Han who's in charge of Taurine 2 has just sent us an email.

204
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,890
He chose us because he liked that it's meme-able,

205
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,010
but it's too meme-able that it's childish, so his boss might not like it.

206
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,650
He hopes it'd be meme-able, not crass, and with a retro touch.

207
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,080
Those are the valuable opinions we got from him.

208
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,510
Since the budget is low,

209
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,100
we can't hire a big shot as our model.

210
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,230
How about we hire a popular rookie

211
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,900
and go with a series format?

212
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,670
We can promote our theme "Get your shit together"

213
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,460
by appealing to the three categories of

214
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,020
people preparing for employment, office workers, and newlyweds.

215
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,950
Of course, all three will be based on the meme-able concept.

216
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,320
Sounds good.

217
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Then first prepare three proposals for the first target group,

218
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,820
the people preparing for employment.

219
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,690
Wow, Ms. Choi.

220
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,480
It feels like I'm seeing the former version of you when you were an assistant manager.

221
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,340
So full of creative ideas.

222
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,380
That idea just now was Mr. Jung's idea.

223
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,720
And I think Mr. Jung is the backbone of this project.

224
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,670
He knows this project better than anyone else

225
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,260
and he also works really hard.

226
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,160
Okay, we're done with Sales Team 1.

227
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,280
As for Sales Team 2,

228
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,920
I heard Smile Cosmetics is launching a new product.

229
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,670
Take a look at the materials and send me a few advertising copies.

230
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,680
Send them to me before you get off work, okay?

231
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,270
Come on. I don't need to check on you every time.

232
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,610
It's something you do all the time anyway.

233
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,800
Sure.

234
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,510
Meeting's over.

235
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,830
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

236
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,250
It's time to smoke. Give me five minutes of your time.

237
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,550
I'm busy.

238
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,280
Come to the rooftop. I'll wait for you there.

239
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,500
Sangwoo, what are you doing?

240
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm going to clean up the meeting room and then go to the cafe.

241
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,700
Why? Is there no more coffee in the office?

242
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,170
I'm craving for a mint chocolate latte.

243
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,020
Then

244
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,740
go to the rooftop in ten minutes.

245
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,180
Ten minutes later?

246
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,660
-I'll try my best. 
-Okay.

247
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,620
I'm so busy.

248
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,050
Have you seen the new product of Smile Cosmetics?

249
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,190
It's pink again this time. It's the same as before.

250
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,960
How can I make something different out of it?

251
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,630
How?

252
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,190
Then leave this to Hana.

253
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,670
God? But I'm a Buddhist.

254
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,610
[Note: "Hana-nim" is "God" in Korean]

255
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,190
I meant Kang Hana.

256
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,530
She seems to be interested in cosmetics.

257
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,470
No way.

258
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,510
How can I let her handle such an important matter?

259
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,110
I'll have to take care of it.

260
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,870
This is driving me crazy.

261
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,920
The theme of this new product

262
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,700
is maintaining moisturized skin in any environment, right?

263
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,610
Yes.

264
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,590
Then why don't you hire actors or female comedians who use a lot of makeup

265
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,190
and go with a funny concept?

266
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,140
Gosh, seriously?

267
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,530
Do you still not know the rules of the industry?

268
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,260
Funny concepts aren't compatible with the cosmetics industry.

269
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,170
We only need pretty models or actors to advertise cosmetics.

270
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,060
Well, I meant that you could go for an unexpected plot twist.

271
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,690
Instead of that,

272
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,470
stay back and help me just for today.

273
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,690
I have plans tonight.

274
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,840
Right. You're in a relationship now, right?

275
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,110
The person who made you Dakgangjeong.

276
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,370
Dating is fun indeed. Marriage is...

277
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,320
Darn it.

278
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Mr. Jung.

279
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,340
Hello.

280
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,300
Ms. Choi's looking for you to work on the advertising proposals.

281
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,570
Right now?

282
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,380
Yes, now.

283
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,280
Look, how do I have the time to help you?

284
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,500
I can't even handle my own business.

285
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,310
Hurry. Let's go.

286
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,790
Dohoon.

287
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,680
There are three types of tuna.

288
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,000
There are three flavors, and it's thrice as big and thrice as fast.

289
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,700
Compared to its similar alternative the mackerel, it's less fishy,

290
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,790
has a lighter taste and is more tender,

291
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,190
but it's more expensive.

292
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,670
It's an ordinary but also unique type of seafood.

293
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,840
I can't take it anymore.

294
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,700
Firstly, if you add beef brisket to soybean paste stew,

295
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,270
the taste will be deeper.

296
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,610
But because of the fragrance, people can’t help

297
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,760
but eat all the meat while cooking.

298
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,070
We must overcome the temptation

299
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,810
to finish the beef brisket soybean paste stew.

300
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,410
Mr. Jung, it's 6 p.m. Aren't you going home?

301
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,250
Wait.

302
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,110
What's wrong?

303
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,940
Lower your head.

304
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,640
Hey.

305
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,040
You have to take the stairs when you get off work on time.

306
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,460
You'll get caught if you wait for the elevator.

307
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,750
I didn't know about that.

308
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,930
Every time I get off work, I look for the moon in the sky first.

309
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,700
So I'm not used to the sun today.

310
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,740
What you said just now

311
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,380
was like a poem by Paul Verlaine.

312
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,410
Every time I get off work, I look for the moon in the sky first.

313
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,650
How was your first day at work?

314
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,460
It was so hectic.

315
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,800
I was saved by the mint chocolate latte.

316
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,120
How about you?

317
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,800
I don't think you're my type.

318
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,520
No, I meant to ask how your day went.

319
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,960
It's the same every day.

320
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,840
But it's refreshing to get off work on time.

321
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,470
Shall we have dinner together tonight?

322
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,000
Since you also helped me today,

323
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,010
I should treat you to dinner.

324
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,430
But I have an appointment with someone important.

325
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,700
I'll buy you dinner some other time.

326
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,510
On the rooftop, I overheard

327
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,240
that the person called Dakgangjeong

328
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,110
is your lover, right?

329
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,010
No, he's just a friend.

330
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,880
Everyone's just finding things to gossip about.

331
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,220
Don't walk on eggshells and get off work on time

332
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,490
and have dinner with your lover.

333
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,310
I'm not seeing anyone either.

334
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,290
What's going on?

335
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,570
Didn't you say your hobby is loving?

336
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,550
To be precise, my hobby is unrequited love.

337
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,560
But I think there's someone I like now.

338
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,390
Unrequited love?

339
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,590
Did you invite them to dinner?

340
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,000
I did, but he turned me down.

341
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,340
He said we should eat some other day.

342
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,790
I can't believe they rejected a handsome guy like you.

343
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,350
They have horrible taste in men.

344
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,370
Still, I should keep trying.

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,870
It turns out that you're more manly than I thought.

346
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,080
You have a certain aura,

347
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,340
like you're really energetic.

348
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,930
I'm going this way.

349
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,690
I'm going that way.

350
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,040
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

351
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,290
Are you almost here?

352
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,240
My house password is 0104. Come in by yourself.

353
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,460
What? When did you arrive?

354
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,470
Just now.

355
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,350
You must be hungry. The grilled tuna is done.

356
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,700
Can you bring it to the table?

357
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,550
Okay.

358
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,950
Wow.

359
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,640
You can eat now.

360
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,290
Thank you for the meal.

361
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,450
You know this, right?

362
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,010
People don't usually separate perilla leaves or get rid of fish bones

363
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,200
for just anyone.

364
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,350
It's my honor.

365
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,570
It's delicious.

366
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,040
That's it? Stop fooling around.

367
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,570
It's really delicious.

368
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,020
It's well-seasoned, the fish is tender, and...

369
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,530
Whatever. It's just like a home-cooked dish.

370
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,730
You're an employee at an advertising company.

371
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,610
How is your feedback so simple?

372
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,210
Don't make me use my brain after work.

373
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,220
I just switched off my brain.

374
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,110
Fine, let's just eat.

375
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
It's my first time having a proper meal

376
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,660
for dinner today.

377
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,170
You're going to cry if you say any more.

378
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,280
Eat up. You're not the Jung Dohoon I used to know.

379
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,770
You're not as energetic as before.

380
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,510
Energetic?

381
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,620
We had an intern today.

382
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,200
Gosh, he's so energetic

383
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,140
that I'm drained.

384
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,790
An intern? A girl?

385
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,730
No, a guy.

386
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,190
But it felt nice.

387
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,320
It reminded me of my past too.

388
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,450
I also made soybean paste stew and grilled tuna

389
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,490
because I was reminded of the past.

390
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,170
Every time you ate instant noodles,

391
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,850
you always said you wanted home-cooked food.

392
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,240
And when I asked you what your mom cooked for you at home,

393
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,680
you said she'd make soybean paste stew and grilled mackerel.

394
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,490
You even remember that?

395
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,710
Most of the time, when someone is asked about their home-cooked food,

396
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,440
they'd usually say soybean paste stew or kimchi stew.

397
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,870
It's all because of the smell.

398
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,730
Because the sense of smell remembers that nostalgic feeling too.

399
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,190
There was even someone I know

400
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,660
who said that even after his wife passed away,

401
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,490
he smelled soybean stew whenever he came home.

402
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,630
Then do you have a similar experience?

403
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,180
Well...

404
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,420
Every time I smell the scent of lilac,

405
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
I think of someone's birthday.

406
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,490
What's wrong? Why aren't you eating?

407
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,230
Uh...

408
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,500
It's delicious.

409
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,920
Thanks for the good meal. You don't have to see me off.

410
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,750
Wait.

411
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,580
Your clothes have absorbed the food smell.

412
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,680
Let me spray the front too.

413
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,660
Why aren't you looking at my eyes?

414
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,720
Do I have to?

415
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,680
If you can look into my eyes, I'll give you a gift.

416
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,730
A gift?

417
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,390
Mr. Jung, you haven't had lunch yet, right?

418
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,690
Have this.

419
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,030
Wow.

420
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,410
What should I do?

421
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,130
I was too busy today to prepare food.

422
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,780
Why don't we go to the nearby campsite and have a barbecue?

423
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,080
Camping?

424
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,630
Camping is good.

425
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,120
I really like you as a brother.

426
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,900
That was such a close call, wasn't it?

427
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,170
You haven't answered my question just now.

428
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,790
Do you like me?
