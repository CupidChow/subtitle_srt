[To Ship Someone]

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,000
[Episode 14]

4
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,100
What?

5
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,470
Are you done?

6
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,740
Have you been to the resort?

7
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,180
No.

8
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
Me either.

9
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,780
It takes an hour to get there.

10
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,900
Yes.

11
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,590
There's also a traffic jam.

12
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,540
Come on. One, two, three.

13
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,660
Let me see.

14
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,660
How is it?

15
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,780
Lu Qiyu, what kind of picture did you take?

16
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,020
My legs look so short.

17
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,300
And this one.

18
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,990
Why did you put me in the middle of the picture?

19
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,980
The structure of the picture looks so bad.

20
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,640
Do you know how to take photos?

21
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,460
Is it that bad?

22
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,460
I think it's good.

23
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,340
What you think doesn't matter. What I think matters.

24
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,540
It doesn't look good.

25
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,780
Fine, tell me what to do.

26
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,300
Xingxing.

27
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,100
You're here too?

28
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,980
Yes.

29
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,860
Are you surprised?

30
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,100
Did you make an appointment?

31
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,850
Of course.

32
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,910
But don't worry.

33
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,220
I won't be your third wheel.

34
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,300
Take the opportunity this weekend

35
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
to make a step forward

36
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,100
and get closer between you two.

37
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,420
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,340
Why are you shy?

39
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,480
Isn't that normal?

40
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
Let's not talk about Lu Qiyu.

41
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,220
He's bad at taking pictures.

42
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,900
He made me look like 1.4 meters tall.

43
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,660
Take photos for me.

44
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,020
It has to be me. Beg me.

45
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,190
You're the best, gorgeous.

46
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,460
Ji, I didn't realize

47
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,830
that you're quite cunning.

48
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,100
Remember what Xingxing said?

49
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,779
An excellent hunter

50
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,220
usually appear in the form of a prey.

51
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,980
How is it? Did your prey take the bait?

52
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,180
Sooner or later.

53
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,300
Sooner or later.

54
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,340
Okay, I'll wait and see.

55
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,650
Ji,

56
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,620
you hunter

57
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,480
will become someone else's prey.

58
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,860
Someone must be after you.

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,420
But how did she know you would come here?

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,220
What a coincidence.

61
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,420
You are also here.

62
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,860
What a coincidence.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,960
Do you mind hanging out together?

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Qi, you're here too?

65
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,580
I didn’t see you just now.

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,460
We are so obvious.

67
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,659
You didn't see us?

68
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,659
Qi.

69
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,420
Is there any problems with his eyes?

70
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,940
Maybe he's far-sighted.

71
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,980
Far-sighted?

72
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,660
Then we must be considerate of you.

73
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,920
After all, we need to respect the old and care for the young.

74
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,540
Ji, I bet these two women

75
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,660
are very aggressive now.

76
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,460
They can tear the enemies apart.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,460
Take care.

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,340
Ji Shu,

79
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,900
the last time we went on a picnic together

80
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,980
was when we graduated from high school, right?

81
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,860
Qi.

82
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,980
Who do you think

83
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,000
always reminisce about the past?

84
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,620
We young people like to look forward.

85
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,460
That's right.

86
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,620
Let me show you the room.

87
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,220
I've arranged your rooms well.

88
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,980
Really?

89
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,610
Let's go.

90
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,460
You said you wanted to come to the resort hotel.

91
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,520
Was it because you knew Ji Shu is here?

92
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,220
No.

93
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,780
The photo looks nice.

94
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,700
What are you thinking about?

95
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,220
Nothing.

96
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,830
Fu Xingxing.

97
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,620
Are you going to say

98
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,150
there's only one room left?

99
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,060
I'm a novel editor.

100
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,100
Even if I want to,

101
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,540
would I use such an old-fashioned plot?

102
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,140
I really want to promote you.

103
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,930
Well,

104
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,460
let you marry.

105
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,860
But I wouldn't

106
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,700
let a wolf like you

107
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,460
get close to a sheep so soon.

108
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,190
Who's a wolf?

109
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,220
I'm a wolf.

110
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,850
Sheep.

111
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
You are a sheep.

112
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,620
How can I let a sheep like you

113
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,460
get close to a wolf so soon?

114
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,620
Although you two won't live in the same room,

115
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,580
don't worry,

116
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,060
you live next door to each other.

117
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,980
Fu Xingxing.

118
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,580
As an excellent novel editor,

119
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,940
this kind of coincidence is inevitable.

120
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,620
I've figured out

121
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,950
how to develop the plot.

122
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,310
It's normal to have bugs

123
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,100
in this old forest.

124
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,220
You can shout at his room

125
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,950
that there are bugs in your room

126
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,740
and ask Ji Shu to come and help.

127
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
Ji Shu.

128
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,860
You're amazing.

129
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,820
Don't worry.

130
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm here.

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,830
That's so pretentious.

132
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,250
How big is the bug to scare me?

133
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,980
Bugs are so small. How can I be scared?

134
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,460
Can't I ask the receptionist to change a room for me?

135
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,140
This is a typical bitchy tactic.

136
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,140
Since you're not an ordinary bitch,

137
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,860
I've prepared a plan B for you.

138
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,100
Tell me.

139
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,060
When night comes,

140
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,220
you pretend there was no water in your room.

141
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,060
Then put on a sexy pajamas

142
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,620
and knock on his door.

143
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,670
I've prepared the pajamas for you.

144
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,850
Then you two will not be able

145
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,670
to hold it back anymore.

146
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,820
When did you start to like me?

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,860
When I first met you.

148
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,740
Me too.

149
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,340
What are you thinking about?

150
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,980
Your ears have turned red.

151
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,620
No.

152
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,960
What bad idea did you come up with?

153
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,680
I'm afraid he'll think I'm too hefty.

154
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,220
Song Yanqi.

155
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,580
You're hopeless.

156
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,100
Or I’ll ask Lu Qiyu

157
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,860
to take Ji Shu to the hot spring.

158
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,980
Pretend you don't know

159
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,910
and follow them.

160
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,860
Then you two

161
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,920
will see each other naked.

162
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,740
Fu Xingxing, what nonsense are you talking about?

163
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,340
Alright, I'm just kidding.

164
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,540
Keep your voice down.

165
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,100
It'll be awkward if they hear it.

166
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,220
Okay. I’ll keep it down.

167
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,100
Qi, this is your room.

168
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,340
Ji, you're the one ahead.

169
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,860
Let's meet in the lobby later

170
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,820
and have dinner.

171
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,950
Let's go, Xingxing.

172
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,460
Qi, remember to dress up nicely.

173
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,220
We'll have dinner together.

174
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,860
What are you talking about?

175
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,460
Why are you alone?

176
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,460
Where are Lu Qiyu and Xingxing?

177
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,910
Have a seat.

178
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,480
They have other plans.

179
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,500
So beautiful.

180
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,140
What?

181
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,860
I mean

182
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,100
the restaurant is beautiful.

183
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,460
It's really nice.

184
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,930
The food is also good.

185
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,460
Yes, it is.

186
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,980
You look gorgeous today.

187
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,220
What are you waiting for?

188
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,740
Order.

189
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,140
You mean I used to look bad?

190
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,340
You were different before.

191
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,100
How?

192
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,820
You were rude,

193
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,160
impulsive,

194
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,220
and unreasonable.

195
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,950
No, I wasn't.

196
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,260
What about now?

197
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Now?

198
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,130
Pretty much the same.

199
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,100
No, I'm not.

200
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,900
Just kidding.

201
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,500
You've always been cute.

202
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,100
What did you just say?

203
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,220
I didn't hear that clearly.

204
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,980
Say it again.

205
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,980
Waiter.

206
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,260
I'd like to order.

207
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
Not this one.

208
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,700
It's almost the same as before.

209
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,980
Not this one.

210
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,990
I didn't say anything else.

211
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,380
Order.

212
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,620
I'll bring it here.

213
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,820
Okay.

214
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,190
The rest is mine.

215
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,500
Ji Shu.

216
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,950
Why are you here?

217
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,580
Song Yanqi didn't come.

218
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,740
It's me.

219
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,720
You're disappointed, right?

220
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,920
What's the matter?

221
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,340
I want to talk to you.

222
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,780
There's nothing to talk about between us.

223
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,700
Just a few words.

224
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,350
Go ahead.

225
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,860
I saw you and Song Yanqi have dinner

226
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,260
at the restaurant today.

227
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,980
The first sentence.

228
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,040
I had never seen you smile so happily.

229
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,380
Even when we were in a relationship,

230
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,910
you didn't smile like that.

231
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,660
The second sentence.

232
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,940
Ji Shu.

233
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,980
What do you want?

234
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,350
To be honest,

235
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,460
ever since I met you again,

236
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,940
I've been thinking of you.

237
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,740
Lin Qingmiao,

238
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,060
you've already had a boyfriend.

239
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,860
I know.

240
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,340
I'm a jerk, right?

241
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,380
Right,

242
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,940
but I can't lie to myself.

243
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,100
Although I promised Shan Hang

244
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,140
I wouldn't have anything to do with you anymore,

245
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
but I can't do it.

246
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,940
I can't fool my heart.

247
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,460
There used to be

248
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,220
so many misunderstandings between us.

249
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,140
Now I just want to get our feelings back.

250
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,620

right?

255
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,660
Three.

256
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,420
Two.

257
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,580
One.

258
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,100
Good.

259
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,860
Sorry.

260
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,860
It's you.

261
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,780
Sorry.

262
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,820
Is it okay?

263
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,620
It's okay.

264
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,850
That's good.

265

I can break up with him.

267
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,860
Actually, we've been tired of each other.

268
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,260
I still have you in my heart.

269
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,340
If you're not suitable, just break up,

270
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,070
but it has nothing to do with me.

271

Ji Shu.

272

Qingmiao.

273
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,420
It came to me that there's no sweets in your bag.

274
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,750
I was afraid you might have hypoglycemia.

275
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,600
Where do you want to go?

276
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,750
I'll go with you.

277
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,900
No, thanks.

278
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,860
I'm not feeling well.

279
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,850
I'm going back to the room.

280
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,340
You're either stupid

281
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,860
or blind.

Do you like her that much?

283
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,420
Why should I chase you?

284
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,610
I don't want to be

285
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,940

288
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,900
I can't believe

289
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,630
you would be so dramatic one day

290
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,950
and shout at the sea.

291

No.

292
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,060
You should have gone straight to them.

293

Why did you run away?

294
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,530

She went to the bathroom.

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,900
We are waiting for you.

381
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,860
Coming.

382
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,470
[Bifengge.com]

383
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,210
[Qin Hai]

384
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Ji Shu.

385
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,300
I'm gonna let you experience once again

386
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,470
what it feels like to lose everything.

387
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,860
Cut.

388
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,500
Come on.

389
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,430
What's going on?

390
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,230
Help!

391
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,180
They came out. Someone's coming over.

392
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,060
Hand.

393
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,460
Okay.

394
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,660
-Okay. -Are you okay?

395
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,260
Everybody, be careful in the future.

396
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,500
Okay.

397
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,340
Thank God, she's saved.

398
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm freaked out.

399
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,340
Put it on.

400
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,580
-Are you okay? -I'm okay.

401
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,900
Xining, are you okay?

402
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,050
I'm fine. I just had a cramp in my leg.

403
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,740
How did I get in here?

404
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,820
I didn't open the website.

405
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,950
How did I get in here?

406
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
Am I dead?

407
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,110
Okay, Director.

408
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,660
Qi.

409
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,900
Why are you here?

410
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,820
I…

411
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,430
I’m here for a visit on behalf of Mr. Ji.

412
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,100
Thank you for saving me.

413
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,420
Have a rest.

414
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,580
I'll get changed.

415
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,580
Ji Shu,

416
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,140
I'll wait for you to come

417
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,540
and see her disappear

418
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,090
in front of you.

419
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,700
Xining.

420
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,580
What are you shooting for?

421
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,340
The Track

422
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,440
or something else?

423
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,250
You don't know what I'm shooting for,

424
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,910
then how did you know I'm here?

425
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Here’s the thing.

426
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,330
Mr. Ji sent me the address.

427
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,930
I didn’t check it carefully.

428
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,100
I'm shooting for Ziheng's music video.

429
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,940
Music video?

430
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,100
It's weird.

431
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,140
When I left last time,

432
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,620
didn't I just solve the break-up of their contractual relationship

433
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,860
and get attacked with the supporting actor?

434
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,940
Why have I skipped so many plots?

435
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,180
What's wrong?

436
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,060
Oh no.

437
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,940
I don't know the plot this time.

438
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,380
They've already broken up.

439
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,860
What else could happen?

440
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,940
Will he want to ask her back?

441
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,660
Right.

442
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,030
They broke up so early.

443
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,620
Isn't it a story of the male lead

444
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,020
chasing his ex back?

445
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,060
Xining.

446
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,810
How's everything going?

447
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
I mean,

448
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,620
did Yu Le come to you?

449
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,620
Qi.

450
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,420
It’s over between us.

451
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,620
Hasn't Yu Le realized that?

452
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,180
Xining.

453
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,260
I know Yu Le gave you that bracelet.

454
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,660
If you've got over it,

455
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,940
why did you pick it up immediately

456
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,620
when the bracelet fell off?

457
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,660
You risked your life to get it.

458
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,340
Qi.

459
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,870
Have you ever lied to yourself?

460
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,860
To be honest,

461
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,140
I've been living in the lies I made up.

462
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,020
I kept telling myself

463
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,820
although he didn’t forget Sun Xitian,

464
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,100
at least he liked me,

465
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,100
until I was proved wrong

466
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,020
at the day of the live stream.

467
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,260
Yu Le is deceived by Sun Xitian.

468
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,100
He can’t see the truth at all.

469
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,340
When he sees the truth,

470
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,420
he will regret it.

471
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,300
Do I need to wait for him

472
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,140
until he thinks it through?

473
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,380
Qi.

474
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,460
I know it’s hard for you to accept our break-up,

475
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,860
but we were not as good as you think.

476
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,920
When we were together,

477
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,940
he had his purpose,

478
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,770
and I had mine.

479
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,340
This relationship was not pure from the beginning.

480
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,270
If something doesn't belong to me,

481
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,870
no matter how hard I try, I still can't keep it.

482
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,050
Xining.

483
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,420
I know you still like each other.

484
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,900
You still love him.

485
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,570
I think

486
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,380
if you like each other, you should be together.

487
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,340
Maybe you're right,

488
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,140
but I've figured it out.

489
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,940
I don't want to be distracted.

490
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,480
I just want to focus on work and live a good life.

491
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,940
Mr. Ji, why are you here?

492
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,420
We’re going to change the scene.

493
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,260
I came here for a visit.

494
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,720
Carry on with your work. Don't care about me.

495
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,860
Ji Shu.

496
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,060
Mr. Ji, why are you here?

497
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,780
Qi.

498
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,620
Where did you go?

499
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,620
Do you know we're worried about you?

500
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,300
You mean falling into the water?

501
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,780
Don't worry. I'm good at swimming.

502
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,840
Xining is okay too.

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,830
Let's go.

504
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,530
Let's find a way to go back.

505
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,060
Go back?

506
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,620
Where?

507
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,940
Back to the company.

508
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,400
Xining is shooting. Don't you want to watch?

509
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,220
No.

510
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,180
Mr. Ji,

511
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,780
are you really not going to pursue Xining?

512
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,620
No.

513
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,660
Wonders will never cease.

514
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,300
Xining, I'm really sorry.

515
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,620
Something came up with Mr. Wang.

516
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,680
He can't come over.

517
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,940
We won't shoot the outdoor scene this afternoon.

518
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,000
Let's call it a day.

519
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,340
Thank you, Director.

520
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,620
Let's go. I'll take you home.

521
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,340
Thanks, but we can take a taxi.

522
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,260
You can pay me for the ride.

523
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,020
You bastard!

524
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
You're already a president.

525
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,160
Why do you still care about the money?

526
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,860
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

527
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Your clothes are wet.

528
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,950
Go back and get changed.

529
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,780
I'm fine.

530
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,950
Let's go.

531
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,020
I heard that

532
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,820
Ye Xining's boss likes her.

533
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,260
Why does he care so much about an assistant?

534
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,900
What do you know?

535
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,260
This is called playing hard to get.

536
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,860
How about this?

537
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,570
Ye Xining and Mr. Ji look like a good couple.

538
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,140
What an odd couple you're shipping?

539
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,700
They're not married. What if it becomes true?

540
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,570
No way.

541
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,140
They are just employer and employee.

542
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,070
[Yu Le]

543
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,420
Come to Xining's house now.

544
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
The enemy is attacking the crystal.

545
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,220
Mr. Ji,

546
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,900
I feel carsick.

547
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,580
Do you mind if I sit in the front?

548
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,370
No.

549
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,120
The supporting actor seems weird this time.

550
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,380
He's taking me home.

551
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,250
Where?

552
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,220
Did she forget what happened

553
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,500
after she got drunk that day?

554
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,780
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

555
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,580
Qi, you should go back and get changed.

556
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,620
Don't catch a cold.

557
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,530
It's a little cold.

558
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,340
Can I take a warm bath at your place?

559
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,620
Sure. Let's go.

560
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,860
You've been wearing wet clothes for so long.

561
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,930
It doesn’t matter if you wear it for a little longer.

562
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,940
Mr. Ji, you are a man.

563
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,060
Don’t you know how to take care of girls?

564
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,580
You'll be destined to be alone.

565
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,100
Are you incense or jade?

566
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,860
I'm neither incense nor jade,

567
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,100
but I'm a woman.

568
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,260
Let go of me.

569
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:42,780
Let go…

570
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,180
Mr. Ji, why don’t you wait for a moment

571
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,580
and let her get changed?

572
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,290
No, go back with me now.

573
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,770
I have something to tell you.

574
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,500
Excuses.

575
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
Mr. Ji, you’re pursuing Xining.

576
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,660
I don’t care.

577
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,610
But won't your behavior

578
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,660
make others think

579
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,380
you're flirting with another woman on purpose

580
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,500
in front of someone you like?

581
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,700
I don't like Ye Xining.

582
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,410
You don't like her?

583
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,420
You sent Xining back all the way here.

584
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,260
I went there specially to...

585
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,860
Xining.

586
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,100
Why are you here?

587
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,260
Qi said you got drowned.

588
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,780
I was worried about you.

589
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,610
Are you okay?

590
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,660
Good job, Yu Le.

591
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,120
Just be straightforward.

592
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,500
Oh no.

593
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,860
The supporting actor saw the lovey-dovey scene.

594
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,660
Lovey-dovey?

595
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,220
Song Yanqi, I'm worried about you.

596
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,750
How can you say me like that?

597
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,380
You can't take back

598
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,860
what you said.

599
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,250
I regret it now, okay?

600
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,140
Mr. Ji.

601
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,820
It’s late.

602
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,300
Thank you for sending Xining back.

603
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,930
It’s my pleasure.

604
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,780
Yu Le, don’t get it wrong.

605
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,620
He means

606
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,300
it's his duty as a boss

607
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,020
to send Xining back.

608
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,500
I went to visit her

609
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,100
and pick her up.

610
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,500
Shut up.

611
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,900
Seems like I can’t hide it anymore.

612
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,500
Yu Le.

613
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,230
Let go of me.

614
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,660
Actually Mr. Ji sent me back.

615
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,010
We’ve already…

616
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,100
So Mr. Ji didn’t finish his words?

617
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,620
Yes.

618
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,100
The woman he mentioned

619
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,500
was actually me.

620
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,140
It was me.

621
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,620
I was embarrassed to make it public,

622
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,500
so he used Xining as a cover.

623
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,260
I'm sorry.

624
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,180
Am I right?

625
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,060
If you dare to deny it,

626
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,620
I'll make your image

627
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,100
into a real jerk

628
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,140
and let Xining think

629
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,670
you're a disloyal scumbag.

630
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,580
No.

631
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,790
Let go of me.

632
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,530
Let go…

633
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,620
I really have something to tell you.

634
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,220
Just tell me now.

635
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,140
I really have something to tell you.

636
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,930
What is it?

637
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:47,740
Hello.

638
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,340
Just say it.

639
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,130
Got it.

640
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,030
I’ll get ready for it. Don’t worry.

641
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,340
Was it Yu Le who pushed me into the water?

642
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,580
Why is he in the real world?

643
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,580
Come with me.

644
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,140
Xining.

645
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,580
Let's talk.

646
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,380
-You first. -You go first.

647
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,420
How are you doing?

648
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,780
I'm busy at work.

649
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,420
I don't have time to think about other things.

650
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,490
That's good.

651
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,780
I'm not that busy recently.

652
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,620
I have more time to experience life.

653
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,890
I worked as a food delivery guy today.

654
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,900
It’s good.

655
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,460
-We… -Yu Le.

656
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,220
I just want to focus on my work.

657
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,820
Okay.

658
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,220
Why there's a scar on Yu Le’s hand?

659
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,720
I don’t remember it was there before.

660
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,180
If it was Yu Le who pushed me into the water,

661
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,180
why did he do that?

662
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,620
Was he trying to change their plot?

663
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,580
But how did he appear in the real world?

664
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,190
Mr. Ji, why are you pulling over here?

665
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,380
What's wrong with the scar on Yu Le’s hand?

666
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,820
Who pushed you into the water?

667
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,050
How did he know?

668
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,620
Did I say it accidentally?

669
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,100
Tell me.

670
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,460
How did you hear that?

671
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,610
What happened?

672
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,580
Nothing.

673
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,140
I saw a scar on Yu Le’s hand.

674
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,260
I’m curious.

675
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,040
Who pushed you into the water?

676
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,210
Nothing.

677
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,940
I saw Xining was in danger,

678
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,179
so I went to pull her up.

679
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,110
No one pushed me.

680
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,130
Okay.

681
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,699
If you don't want to tell me, I won't force you.

682
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,500
But to prevent

683
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,659
what happened last time at the fountain,

684
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,620
you must stay by my side 24 hours a day

685
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,530
during this period of time.

686
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,440
Don't let your guard down.

687
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:30,989
Besides,

688
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,719
-I have something... -Mr. Ji.

689
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,030
You want me to follow you 24 hours a day?

690
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,659
Why?

691
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,380
Don't tell me

692
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,300
you have other motives?

693
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,139
Or,

694
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,820
are you haunted?

695
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,580
No.

696
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:45,980
Mr. Ji,

697
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,810
who do you think has a light ring around their head?

698
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,179
Angel.

699
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,179
Who else?

700
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,659
Cupid!

701
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,680
That's all?

702
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,620
That's all.

703
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,500
What the heck.

704
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,140
How did Ji Shu

705
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,020
think of Buddha in a second?

706
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,700
My ears are so big.

707
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,100
Why didn't I think of it?

708
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,340
Is it because

709
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,470
I've succeeded in my secret love plot?

710
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,180
Oh, no. What should I do?

711
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,820
Qi.

712
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,110
I have something to…

713
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,660
Qi.

714
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,380
Mr. Ji.

715
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,980
We'd better keep a distance.

716
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,980
Qi, listen.

717
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,610
Mr. Ji, let’s keep a distance.

718
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,150
Actually, I…

719
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,380
Is it this foot?

720
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,940
Oh no.

721
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,420
I've really become the scumbag I hate the most.

722
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,910
Do you feel better now?

723
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,580
I'm fine. Thank you.

724
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,180
Did I really fall in love with the supporting actor?

725
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,540
What about my feelings for Ji Shu?

726
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,630
Did I change the plot and get myself involved?

727
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,900
Or will I fall in love

728
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,260
with whoever has this face?

729
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,580
What did you say?

730
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,180
I didn't say anything.

731
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,660
You did.

732
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,960
You said you're cheating.

733
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,260
Mr. Ji, are you kidding me?

734
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,140
Why would I say that?

735
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,620
Look at his angry expression.

736
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Did my secret love script work?

737
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,940
What about me?

738
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Do I like Ji Shu because of the supporting actor

739
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,060
or do I like the supporting actor because of Ji Shu?

740
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,420
According to the order,

741
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,140
I met Ji Shu first,

742
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,780
but he looked cold back then.

743
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,910
How could I like him?

744
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,820
So,

745
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,140
I must have fallen in love with the supporting actor first.

746
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,980
That's why I have a crush on Ji Shu

747
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,260
in reality.

748
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,700
Your coat!

749
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,740
Why do I like this kind of person?

750
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,780
Where can I get a taxi this late?
