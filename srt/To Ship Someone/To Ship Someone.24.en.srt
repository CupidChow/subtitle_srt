00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,430
It's just not my day.

192
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,830
♫Your smile by the beach made my day♫

193
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,850
♫I'm a bit disappointed in the darkness♫

194
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,000
♫I'll stay by your side until you put an end to our love♫

195
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,840
♫Our story is like a dream♫

196
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,990
♫I woke up and it's gone♫

197
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,480
♫Lean on me when you're sad♫

198
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,080
You got wet.

199
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,010
♫What are you thinking under the fireworks♫

200
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,940
Does it hurt?

201
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,580
♫Those romantic moments♫

202
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,900
Is it you?

203
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,620
♫Are just like yesterday♫

204
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,980
It's me.

205
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,450
♫I loved you♫

206
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,120

207

208
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,090
♫Our love is a once-in-a-lifetime experience♫

209
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,080
♫I think too much♫

210
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,020
♫But you never care♫

♫I'm a fool♫

213
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,400
♫How can I become your light♫

♫Lean on me when you're sad♫

♫I loved you♫

219
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,820
Song... Song Yanqi.

♫So I want to give you more♫

221
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,060
I'm sorry.

222
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
I'm late.

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560

♫Forget the past and move forward?♫

231

Ji Shu.

232
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,060
Ji Shu.

233
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,750
I'm here.

234
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,700
What's wrong?

235
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
I thought

236
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,780
I had a hallucination again.

237
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,340
It's not a hallucination.

238
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,060
I'm back.

239
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm the same Ji Shu who never changed.

240
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,980
Thank goodness.

241
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,220
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,060
It's my fault.

243
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,900
You bought this sofa?

244
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,140
Have a seat.

245
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,660
I came and slept here

246
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,740
every time I missed you.

247
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,960
This is super soft.

248
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,460
Don't cry.

249
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,140
Wipe yourself.

250
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,660
It's okay. I'm happy.

251
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:08,980
Ji Shu.

252
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,420
What took you so long to get back?

253
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:12,980
Shan Hang and I

254
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,579
were locked in a black room.

255
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,619
Black room?

256
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,150
I think I was once locked up too.

257
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,660
That day,

258
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,839
after we fell into the black room,

259
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,460
he wanted to die with me.

260
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,420
Ji Shu.

261
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,820
Today,

262
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,630
let's die together.

263
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,040
[Self-destruction program is activated. Countdown.]

264
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,340
One is the real world,

265
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,010
and the other is the world of fan fiction.

266
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,340
You can only choose one.

267
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,380
If you open the door to one of the worlds,

268
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,840
the other will disappear.

269
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,340
Shan Hang,

270
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
do you really not want to go back to the real world?

271
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,020
What for?

272
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,900
Jail?

273
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,260
Are you willing to abandon everything in the real world

274
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,060
and stay in another world alone?

275
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,420
No one wants me to go back.

276
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,280
There's no place for me in that world.

277
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,860
Shan Hang.

278
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,240
Actually, we are the same kind of people.

279
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,020
We have many similarities.

280
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,120
Then why am I not as good as you?

281
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,100
Why?

282
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,660
Why?

283
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,660
I've tried my best,

284
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,060
but I still can't get recognition.

285
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,650
[Self-destruction program is activated. Countdown.]

286
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,340
There is a lot of unfairness

287
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,860
in this world.

288
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,740
There are things you can never get

289
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,200
no matter how hard you try.

290
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,520
But if you don't work hard,

291
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,060
you'll lose everything.

292
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,180
I was once

293
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,540
trapped like you.

294
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,900
It's her.

295
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Her cheerfulness

296
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,390
and optimism

297
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,660
healed me.

298
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,060
She told me

299
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,500
no matter

300
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,180
it was right or wrong,

301
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,510
it was one's own choice.

302
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,980
But I have nothing.

303
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,530
I have nothing.

304
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,390
Right.

305
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,890
You have nothing now,

306
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,580
but you mustn't lose the courage to start over.

307
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,460
Qingmiao is still waiting for you to go back.

308
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,230
She's waiting for you to return to the original Shan Hang.

309
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:57,970
Really?

310
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,250
She's really waiting for me to go back?

311
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,090
Yes.

312
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,070
Otherwise, why would she

313
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,500
bother to act with me?

314
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,060
She hoped you'd return.

315
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,210
I let her down.

316
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,430
You'll really let her down

317
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,330
if you don't go back.

318
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,720
Guess who I am.

319
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,170
Qingmiao.

320
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,860
What's wrong?

321
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,460
Did your mother scold you again?

322
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,450
She's not satisfied with my job.

323
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,470
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

324
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,470
The most important thing is to do what you like.

325
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,770
Your happiness is the most important thing.

326
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,250
If you are so unhappy to go on a date with me,

327
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,760
I'll be upset too.

328
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,360
Okay.

329
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,710
I see.

330
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,720
Do those wounds on you

331
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,980
hurt?

332
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,990
I'm fine.

333
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,770
In the end, Shan Hang returned to the real world

334
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,300
and sent me to the hospital.

335
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,640
How is Shan Hang?

336
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,700
Don't worry.

337
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,160
He's changed.

341
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,880

Nice to meet you.

you finally start thinking about your marriage.

362
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,050

-Let's go.

-Yes.

right?

371
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,050
Tell me if you want them to stay.

372
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,650
Forget it.

373
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,640

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,320
Ji Shu might be tired all the way coming back.

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,230
his temper.

379
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,490
Qi,

380
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,620
Shu

381
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,680
has some prejudice

382
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,450
against marriage

383
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,250
because of my relationship with his father.

384
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,680
But we hope

385
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,280
you can be happily together.

386
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,110
Mrs. Ji, don't worry.

387
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
We will.

388
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,440
Mrs. Ji,

389
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,680
can you do me a favour?

390
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,740
What is it?

391
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,840
Actually, I know about Ji Fei.

392
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,820
Ji Fei?

393
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,960
Who is Ji Fei?

394
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,230
Don't you remember?

395
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,840
That child

396
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,640
who wasn't born.

397
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,690
How do you know that?

398
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,190
Ji Shu has been blaming himself for that.

399
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,790
He thought

400
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,310
he caused that accident back then

401
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,400
and got you

402
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,210
and that unborn child

403
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,800
into trouble.

404
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,310
Mrs. Ji,

405
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,630
I hope you can tell him

406
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,960
you don't blame him for what happened back then.

407
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,880
Even if you do blame him,

408
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,010
I hope you can tell a white lie.

409
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,760
Qi,

410
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,160
how can parents hate their children?

411
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,270
Besides,

412
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,160
I forgot about it

413
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
long time ago.

414
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,590
Don't worry.

415
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
I'll talk to him later.

416
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,940
Thank you.

417
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,790
We should thank you.

418
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,630
Thank you, Qi.

419
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,010
We’re gonna go.

420
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,550
When did you take these pictures of me?

421
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,030
I did it when I wanted to.

422
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,680
So many photos.

423
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,530
Even I don't have so many photos of myself.

424
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,350
You did a good job.

425
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,040
I used to

426
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,640
stay here

427
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,210
when I felt bad.

428
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,690
Qi,

429
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,460
thank you.

430
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,330
What for?

431
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,350
Thank you

432
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,370
for staying by my side

433
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,600
even after I rejected you.

434
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,830
Thank you

435
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,150
for waiting for me to come back.

436
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,440
Now you know

437
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,830
how cruel you were.

438
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,820
It's not a big deal.

439
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,290
I'm invincible.

440
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,140
What's wrong?

441
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,620
Nothing.

442
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,150
Ji Shu.

443
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,950
I'm here.

444
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,090
From now on,

445
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,820
if you have your feelings hurt,

446
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,290
remember,

447
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,070
I'll always be with you.

448
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,380
If you want to say something

449
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,220
that you can't say,

450
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,070
I can say it for you.

451
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,840
If you

452
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,020
can't cry,

453
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,490
I can cry for you.

454
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,050
Qi.

455
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,850
Yes.

456
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,280
Did you count it clearly?

457
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,920
No.

458
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,010
Count it clearly.

459
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,330
I'm going to be late.

460
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,070
What are you talking about?

461
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,040
Thank you

462
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,510
for what you did during this period.

463
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,560
If you want to thank me,

464
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,820
you can take care of me.

465
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,950
Let me think about it.

466
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,900
You're unemployed. How can you take care of me?

467
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,510
Mr. Ji Shu, I should be the one to say that.

468
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,770
How about I take care of you in the future?

469
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
That works for me.

470
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,200
I said I'm going to be late.

471
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:36,960
Ji,

472
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,730
I misunderstood you before.

473
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,320
No.

474
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,270
It was my fault.

475
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,640
Are we

476
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,360
still good friends?

477
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,450
Of course.

478
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,460
You're finally back.

479
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,800
Song Yanqi must be happy about it.

480
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,530
I'm relieved that Ji Shu came back.

481
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,240
You have no idea how much I worried about you.

482
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,580
Xingxing.

483
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,750
I want to be committed to him.

484
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,890
I want to marry him.

485
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,440
What's wrong?

486
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,750
You just came back.

487
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,160
Shouldn't you be happy?

488
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,060
I want...

489
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,830
I want to get married.

490
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,510
Did he propose to you?

491
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,540
No.

492
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,930
In my opinion,

493
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,650
you two are so close.

494
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,030
Either of you can propose.

495
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,690
Who says only men can propose?

496
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,370
Women can also propose to men.

497
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,000
Right?

498
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:37,990
Then...

499
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,500
What if he rejects me?

500
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,010
He rejects you?

501
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,990
Since you two started dating,

502
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,250
he's been agreeing to whatever you said.

503
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,820
Lu Qiyu complained to me many times

504
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,790
that Ji Shu had put a lot of pressure on him

505
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,800
with a rat race.

506
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,530
But you don't know what to do

507
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,910
because you're afraid of being rejected, right?

508
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,510
Qi won’t reject me.

509
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,190
That's it

510
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,270
Then get married.

511
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,600
Let me help you.

512
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,370
Go for it.

513
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,790
Didn't you say

514
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,800
Ji Shu confessed his love to you first?

515
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,200
Then it's your turn this time.

516
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,520
Let him see what a shock is.

517
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,220
Then what should I do?

518
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,630
It's a deal then.

519
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,150
Lu Qiyu probably knows Ji Shu is back.

520
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,620
We have reached a consensus.

521
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,080
As long as you get married,

522
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,200
we'll get married.

523
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,370
That's why you're so active.

524
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,360
You just want to get married soon.

525
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,310
Who said that?

526
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,030
I'm doing this for your happiness,

527
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,580
okay?

528
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,470
But

529
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,740
will it be too hasty today?

530
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,310
I...

531
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,420
I haven't prepared anything.

532
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,170
The first drumming can boost the morale of the soldiers.

533
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,430
The second time, the morale of the soldiers starts to decline. The third time, the morale of the soldiers runs out.

534
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,290
Now is the time.

535
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,080
Don't you want to get married with me?

536
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,480
You have to know that marriage requires a lot of preparation.

537
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,450
Of course I want.

538
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,410
Then what are you waiting for?

539
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,130
Let's go.

540
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:54,640
Where?

541
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,160
My bag.

542
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
No, they don't match.

543
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,540
No.

544
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,350
I can't put it here.

545
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,990
Let me change somewhere else.

546
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,920
Aren't you tired after shopping all day?

547
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,510
No.

548
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,030
Don't you think

549
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,690
our house is too cheerless?

550
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,820
So we spent the whole day

551
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,910
buying these flowers

552
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,710
just to make the house more cozy?

553
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,270
Don't you think

554
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,000
it makes the home lively?

555
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,990
Haven't you heard a saying?

556
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,210
What is it?

557
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,140
Love begins with a flower.

558
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,300
Fine.

559
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,070
Then just put it somewhere.

560
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,130
How can I put it anywhere?

561
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,199
Well,

562
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,840
where do you want to put it?

563
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
It's not about where I want to put it.

564
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,889
Isn't it?

565
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,620
No.

566
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,630
Then what's it about?

567
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,639
It's about you.

568
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,940
Why did you ask me?

569

Why are you laughing?

570
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,920
Fine, it's my fault.

571

I won't laugh anymore.

It's not about laughing.

573
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,840
It took us so much effort to buy these flowers.

574

How can you not be serious about it?

575
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,400
Did you randomly

576
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,449
put in a relationship plot

577
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,880
because you create a supporting actor for yourself?

578
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,300
What does this have to do with the vase?

579
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,150
Why did you write that you liked Xining?

580
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,210
You're her father.

581
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,880
It was not a relationship.

582
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,679
Anyway, you ruined it in the end.

583
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,510
So it was my fault?

584
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,389
That was not what I meant.

Why are you asking me about such a trivial thing?

599

No.

Fantasy, time travel.

616
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,760
It's about two main characters.

617
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,000
The main characters of the story were originally Yu Le and Ye Xining.

618
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,550
Who else?

619
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,750
And the real protagonist of this story.

620
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,800
It's quite interesting to adapt it this way.

621
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,120
You didn't delete the scenes of the main characters,

622
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,570
but also added the shipping trend.

623
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,880
The new two main characters are also very interesting.

624
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,980
One is pessimistic,

625
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,110
and the other is optimistic.

626
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,670
When these two people meet,

627
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,930
they will have special sparks.

628
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,140

Dramatic?

642
