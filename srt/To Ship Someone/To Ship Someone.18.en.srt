00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,020
has a crush on you,

193
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,140
what would you do?

194
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,070
Are you talking about

195
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,350
a fugitive criminal?

196
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,700
No.

197
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,510
It's quite complicated.

198
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,590
Anyway,

199
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,590
it will affect many people's fate.

200
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,540
But he does it for your own good.

201
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,870
Will you stop him or not?

202
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,950
Of course I will stop him.

203
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,060
This is not the only way to solve the problem.

204
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,740
If

205
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,460
you can't find a solution at present,

206
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,190
you can see

207
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,100
how the problem started.

208
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,260
And solve it from its source.

209
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,830
You can definitely find the reason.

210
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,230
At the very beginning...

211
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,880
What about his confession?

212
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,740
It depends on your feelings for him.

213
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,660
If you like him, accept it.

214
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,340
But if you don't like him,

215
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,380
don't be hesitant

216
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,260
and affect him pursuing the next one.

217
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,790
He will pursue another one?

218
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,180
Qi, fresh eye never hurts.

219
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,180
If you were me,

220
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,860
you would have known how jealous

221
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,390
you were when you said this.

222
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,150
Really?

223
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,820
Yes.

224
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,710
Think about it.

225
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,380
Don't hesitate too much.

226
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,030
Or,

227
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,270
after you refuse him,

228
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,190
he might give up easily.

229
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,950
Before you get off work,

230
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,220
write a complete revision proposal

231
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,030
based on the feedback of the platform.

232
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,230
Give it to Feng Liu to communicate with the scriptwriter.

233
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,900
Mr. Jia didn't ask me to work on this project.

234
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,420
You haven't got the copyright yet.

235
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,990
You don't even want to do this?

236
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,720
Don't forget

237
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,510
now that the project teams has been merged,

238
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,590
and I'm in charge of the whole project team.

239
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,790
And everyone is busy.

240
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,140
You are the only one who's idle.

241
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,300
Do you think it's appropriate

242
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,560
to slack off everyday?

243
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,740
Okay.

244
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,110
I'll give it to you by the end of the day.

245
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,690
Let me review it first.

246
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,190
Redo it!

247
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Your revision proposal is too dull.

248
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,790
The audience will know the ending after watching the beginning.

249
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,780
How do you know

250
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,420
the ending is the same as you expected?

251
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,060
I've written this kind of project many times.

252
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,830
So I know it.

253
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,180
If you don't want to do it,

254
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,660
you can

255
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,860
tell Mr. Jia

256
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,280
to set up an independent project team.

257
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,070
OK. I'll redo it.

258
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,990
Qi.

259
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,400
Aren't you going home?

260
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,300
You go first.

261
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,260
l have to finish it first.

262
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,670
OK.

263
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,060
Ji Shu,

264
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,960
it's all because of you.

265
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,590
Qingmiao.

266
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,920
Where are you going?

267
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,830
I told you

268
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,350
we were not suitable for each other.

269
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,210
Let's break up.

270
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,560
Did Song Yanqi tell you something?

271
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,350
Is it her?

272
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,080
How do you know Song Yanqi?

273
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,910
Didn't we meet at the resort?

274
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,580
I've known her since then.

275
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,550
You asked

276
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,680
whether Song Yanqi told me something?

277
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,420
What did you do

278
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,820
that you don't want me to know?

279
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,020
I didn't do anything.

280
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,030
Fine.

281
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,460
I won't ask

282
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,590
if you don't want me to know.

283
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,270
I don't care about your things either.

284
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,730
Give my luggage back to me.

285
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,230
You can't leave.

286
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,960
Are you going to find Ji Shu?

287
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,340
His reputation has been ruined.

288
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,940
Is there anything of him that you can't forget?

289
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,520
-Don't touch me. -Are you okay?

290
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,750
Do you want to know

291
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,870
the things about Ji Shu that I can't forget?

292
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,670
He never gets jealous of others.

293
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,940
He never hates others

294
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,800
because they are better than him.

295
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,700
Qingmiao.

296
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,190
I didn't mean it.

297
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,830
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,440
I just didn't want you to leave.

299
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,020
I didn't want to hurt you.

300
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,590
Shan Hang.

301
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,860
I knew

302
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,580
it was you who stole the USB from me,

303
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,620
plagiarized Ji Shu's design

304
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,630
and framed him

305
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,990
back then!

306
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,460
So what?

307
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,340
Would I have a chance if I didn't take it?

308
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,260
It was really you.

309
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,310
I was very touched

310
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,770
that you could stay by my side and comfort me.

311
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,160
But it was all because you felt guilty.

312
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,310
That's not true, Qingmiao.

313
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,710
I really love you.

314
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,820
You do?

315
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,750
Do you love me?

316
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,180
You just love

317
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,840
the feeling of taking everything away from him.

318
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,470
Believe it or not,

319
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,870
stop dreaming.

320
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,740
Even if you beg him with all your heart and soul,

321
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,510
he won't accept you.

322
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,910
So what?

323
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,360
I've had enough of being with a lunatic like you.

324
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,580
I'm a lunatic?

325
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,430
Yes.

326
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,430
I'm a lunatic.

327
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,140
You want to leave me because of him, right?

328
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,990
Then I'll let him never have the chance

329
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,320
to take you away from me.

330
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,710
Never!

331
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,310
You're really a lunatic!

332
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,710
Qingmiao.

333
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,030
Do you hate Song Yanqi very much?

334
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,710
Xingxing.

335
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,990
I've endured it all day.

336
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,850
I've been watching Ji Shu's workstation today.

337
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,150
I was afraid he would suddenly apply for giving up his pen name.

338
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,580
Did you persuade him successfully?

339
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,510
He won't delete his novels for now?

340
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,590
No.

341
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,380
Why didn't you persuade him?

342
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:21,980
By the way,

343
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,550
Ji Shu told me

344
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,830
you traveled into your fan fiction.

345
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,230
Is it true?

346
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,980
I told you, long ago.

347
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,190
It's true.

348
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,750
Oh my god.

349
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,830
Although my sense told me

350
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,830
Ji Shu wouldn't tell a lie like this,

351
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,630
how is

352
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,030
it possible ?

353
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,910
The truth is that it really happened.

354
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,550
And it happened to me.

355
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,590
He also said

356
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,140
if you are in danger in the fan fiction,

357
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,500
you might not be able to come back if something happens to you.

358
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,340
Is that true?

359
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,780
As for the danger,

360
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,860
it happened from time to time.

361
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,750
[COMING SOON]

362
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,150
I don't know

363
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,430
if I can come back.

364
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,310
Maybe I can. But maybe not.

365
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,349
Why are you hesitating?

366
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,900
I'll contact Ji Shu

367
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,220
and let him delete the novel immediately.

368
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,819
Xingxing.

369
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,430
I...

370
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,690
I can't stop everything from happening.

371
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,990
But I can't

372
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,650
watch him deleting the novel.

373
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,670
Do you know?

374
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,950
People in the world of the fan fiction,

375
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,740
they are not just characters in fictions.

376
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,230
They are living people.

377
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,880
If we delete our novels,

378
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,750
my life will be saved.

379
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,050

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,430
He's arriving.

568
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,210
Live streaming

569
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,230
isn't as exciting as watching on the scene.

570
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,080
You're a lunatic.

571
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,750
A lunatic?

572
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,200
Since you said so,

573
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,430
I have to live up to my title.

574
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,880
Shan Hang.

575
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,720
Stop!

576
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,270
I didn't expect you to drive so fast!

577
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,550
Stop it!

578
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,470
Ji Shu!

579
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,070
No!

580
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,110
Damn author.

581
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,830
I haven't recovered yet.

582
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,430
If you hold me harder,

583
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,680
I will faint.

584
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,050
Song Yanqi,

585
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,670
do you know

586
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,910
you were going to die just now?

587
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,110
What if something happened to you?

588
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,570
Have you thought about me?

589
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,860
The second time I entered this world,

590
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,670
I found as long as I got hurt,

591
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,440
there would appear a message box.

592
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,350
I just wanted to

593
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,430
give it a try.

594
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,840
I won't die anyway.

595
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,320
Over there...

596
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,930
There's a CCTV over there.

597
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,950
If

598
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,200
we can't find any evidence in the real world,

599
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,840
we can take the videos back.

600
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,950
For the sake of my injury,

601
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,470
don't be angry.

602
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,540
Song Yanqi!

603
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,940
[Emergency]

604
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,150
Where am I now?

605
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,150
Oh my god, you're finally awake.

606
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Ji Feng?

607
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,620
Be careful.

608
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,300
Let me help you.

609
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,960
I'm not back yet?

610
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,290
You're in the hospital.

611
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,480
What's wrong with you?

612
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,140
Why is your anemia so serious?

613
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,470
Do you know how long you have been sleeping?

614
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,510
From yesterday afternoon till now,

615
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,040
you slept for the whole day.

616
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,440
Ji...

617
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,330
Where is Ji Shu?

618
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,030
I don't know.

619
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,750
Brother.

620
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,480
You're here.

621
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,760
You two talk.

622
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,090
I'll wait outside.

623
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,550
Have you found the surveillance videos?

624
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,720
You're badly injured.

625
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,520
Why do you still care about this?

626
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,480
I'm sorry.

627
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,360
You don't need to apologize me.

628
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:24,920
Ji Shu,

629
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,910
I know I was reckless.

630
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,430
But my self-healing ability

631
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,090
was the only thing I could rely on at that moment.

632
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,070
I could only use it

633
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,950
to survive in the soup.

634
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,360
I saw you being hit,

635
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,910
but there was nothing I could do.

636
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,840
Do you know how much I hated myself?

637
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,300
Then you passed out in my arms.

638
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,120
Do you know how scared I was?

639
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,160
But

640
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,550
if we miss this chance,

641
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,630
I don't know

642
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,830
whether we'll have the chance next time.

643
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,350
I'd rather spend more time looking for new evidence

644
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,810
than let you take the risk.

645
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,720
Ji Shu.

646
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,520
I know.

647
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,160
I was wrong.

648
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,600
I...

649
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,200
I know I was wrong.

650
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,430
I won't do it again.

651
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,480
Have a good rest.

652
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,130
I'll go deal with things first.

653
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,720
My brother looks angry.

654
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,160
Did you quarrel?

655
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,150
Don't be mad at him.

656
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,920
You have no idea.

657
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,200
When he called me here,

658
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,350
I was frightened by how he looked.

659
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,550
He was covered in blood all over.

660
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,510
He didn't say anything when I asked him.

661
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,550
He didn't even blink

662
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,880
but kept staring at you,

663
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,070
as if you were going to disappear in the next second.

664
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,670
By the way,

665
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,030
you were there to visit Ye Xining on the scene, weren't you?

666
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,290
Why did you have blood all over your body?

667
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,280
Nothing.

668
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,830
It was just an accident.

669
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,430
The blood bags were spilled.

670
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,630
Blood bags?

671
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,470
That's fake?

672
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
But it looked real.

673
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,200
Ji Fei.

674
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,270
When can I be discharged?

675
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,510
I don't know.

676
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,240
Help me ask the nurse.

677
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,350
Okay.

678
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,550
I'll ask them for you.

679
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,199
Qi.

680
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,280
Remember

681
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,880
to take the medicine on time.

682
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,400
Take care.

683
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,350
I'm not a little kid.

684
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,630
See you.

685
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,489
Here you are.

686
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,230
Help me check

687
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,610
if your brother is home.

688
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,639
If you want to see him,

689
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,360
why don't you find him yourself?

690
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,440
We had a fight.

691
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,350
You know that.

692
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,159
Since you're a patient,

693
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,520
I'll help you this time.

694
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,280
Let me check for you.

695
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,949
Hurry up.

696
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,469
He's not home.

697
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Okay.

698
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,949
Thanks.

699
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:53,830
Brother.

700
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,560
You're back.

701
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,020
Qi was looking for you.

702
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,110
I see.

703
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,080
Go in first.

704
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,720
Ji Shu,

705
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,480
I have something to tell you.

706
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,120
If you want to know things about Ye Xining's issue,

707
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,030
I've taken care of it.

708
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,690
She's filming in the crew now.

709
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,590
No.

710
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,450
Yu Le's problem

711
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,610
has been solved too.

712
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,990
I'm not asking about them.

713
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,250
I'm asking how you are.

714
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,710
I'm fine.

715
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,920
Go home and have a good rest.

716
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,390
What's wrong?

717
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,150
I think I hurt my knees.

718
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,760
Men in love

719
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,840
are really

720
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,880
stupid.

721
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,500
Does it still hurt?

722
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,110
I know I was wrong.

723
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,430
Can you stop being angry?

724
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,930
From now on,

725
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,390
I will protect myself.

726
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,520
I won't risk my life.

727
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,990
Don't be angry.

728
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,280
When we go back,

729
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,940
I'll return the amulet to you.

730
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,640
What does it have to do with it?

731
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,000
Do you think

732
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,040
I was in danger

733
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,240
because I gave you the amulet?

734
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,760
Ji Shu,

735
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,620
you can't be that superstitious.

736
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,390
Do whatever you want.

737
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,200
But

738
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,120
there's no reason

739
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,400
to take the present back.

740
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,120
How about

741
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,770
giving me another one?

742
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,320
OK.

743
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,310
Be good.

744
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,880
One should always spoil her boyfriend.

745
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,030
Did I promise you

746
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,680
to be your boyfriend?

747
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,830
Ji Shu,

748
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,720
don't you want to take the responsibility?

749
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,000
I clearly remember

750
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,710
some drunkard said

751
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,870
she wouldn't be responsible.

752
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,440
You said she's a drunkard.

753
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,110
Can you believe what a drunkard said?

754
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,970
Of course I can.

755
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,560
You...

756
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,670
I find that

757
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,380
you're also being unreasonable sometimes.

758
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,270
I'll be responsible, okay?

759
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,800
I will.

760
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,210
You sound reluctantly.

761
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,110
Then how can I make you think I'm willingly?

762
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,310
♫I loved you♫

763
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,560
You need to compensate me.

764
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,990
♫So I want to give you more♫

765
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,990
♫Space brings silence♫

766
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,920
Brother, our parents knew you were back.

767
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,250
I couldn't stop them...

768
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,320
Why are you still with this girl?

769
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,450
Come out with me!

770
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,150
I really set myself up.

771
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,860
It's none of your business

772
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,760
whom I am with.

773
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,640
When did you become so rude?

774
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,000
Don't get mad.

775
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,340
Young lady.

776
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,560
What's your name?

777
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
You can call me Qi.

778
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,120
Qi.

779
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,590
Didn't you promise us

780
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,030
to break up with my son before?

781
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,630
Why did you change your mind?

782
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,480
Is it because

783
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,430
we didn't pay you enough?

784
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,400
No, Auntie.

785
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,280
I was thinking...

786
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,480
She gave me the money.

787
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,760
Yes, I returned the money to Ji Shu.

788
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,480
There was a misunderstanding.

789
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,410
We were kidding.

790
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,030
You were forcing him with your life.

791
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,160
You call this a joke?

792
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,760
Shoulda

793
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,160
coulda woulda.

794
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,770
I don't care if you were joking.

795
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,070
I've made a deal with Mr. Xu.

796
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,600
You will marry their daughter.

797
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,440
Break up with her immediately.

798
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,230
I disagree.

799
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,350
Ji Shu!

800
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,160
Dad.

801
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,190
Don't be angry.

802
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm telling you

803
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,080
Qi is a nice girl.

804
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,120
Besides,

805
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,310
my mom and you shouldn't

806
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,880
be feudal.

807
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,140
I can prove that

808
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,440
they were

809
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,640
just joking.

810
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,430
I don't want to embarrass you.

811
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,480
You'd better break up.

812
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,240
Why?

813
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,520
Just because you are my dad?

814
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:04,840
Yes.

815
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,520
Brother.

816
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
No, Uncle, Aunty.

817
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,230
It's not Ji Shu's fault.

818
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,880
I wanted to break up with him.

819
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,750
He didn't agree.

820
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,320
I thought since you've talked to me,

821
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,200
if you didn't like me,

822
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,240
he would give up.

823
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,360
So you don't want to break up with him now?

824
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,320
I know what I do

825
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,080
will make you think

826
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,560
I'm not serious in love

827
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,320
and I don't respect Ji Shu.

828
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,400
Anyway,

829
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,160
it's all my fault.

830
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,910
It has nothing to do with him.

831
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,840
I don't care whether you're willing or not.

832
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,670
I don't care if you two are in a relationship or not.

833
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,870
Break up with him now.

834
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,720
I'll tell Ji Shu.

835
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,000
Song Yanqi!

836
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,760
Don't worry.

837
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,760
I'll deal with the difficulties in front of us first.

838
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,950
So you agreed?

839
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,960
Yes.

840
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,960
Why?

841
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,040
Relationship

842
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,310
is between two people before marriage.

843
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,760
But after getting married, it's about two families.

844
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,510
I don't want Ji Shu

845
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,240
to be in the middle of us one day.

846
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,360
OK.

847
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,600
Since you've made up your mind,

848
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,800
you should break up with him at once.

849
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,400
Uncle, please give me some time

850
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,060
so that I can explain to Ji Shu.

851
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,560
OK.

852
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,040
Now!
