[Episode 3]

4
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,740
He's really here.

5
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,140
Mr. Ji, I…

6
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,980
Can I buy a bottle of water from the convenience store?

7
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,710
Be back soon.

8
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,900
[A paparazzo Mr. Ba is hiding in the corner, taking photos of Yu Le and Sun Xitian in secret.]

9
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,660
I remember the paparazzo of the original novel should be there.

10
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,740
Why isn't he here?

11
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,620
Here he comes.

12
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,060
Bastard!

13
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,670
You took sneak photos of me!

14
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,900
Don't talk nonsense.

15
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,540
I didn't.

16
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,820
I saw it with my both eyes.

17
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,380
You were following me

18
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220
and kept taking photos.

19
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,900
It's you.

20
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,020
Don't slander me.

21
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,100
You can prove your innocence

22
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,560
by taking out your camera.

23
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,450
That's right.

24
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,500
If you're innocent,

25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
just show her the photos you took.

26
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,579
We'll know if you did it.

27
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,940
I think you're just afraid to show me the photos.

28
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,300
Take it out if you dare.

29
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,980
Show me the photos!

30
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,110
I don't want to talk to you. Step aside.

31
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,410
What are you doing?

32
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,620
You are an adult man.

33
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,620
How could you bully a little girl in front of so many people?

34
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,540
You call yourself a man?

35
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,860
Yes, you call yourself a man?

36
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,420
Sir.

37
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,130
Do you know that taking photos of others,

38
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,900
especially of girls,

39
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,380
is the infringement of others' portrait rights.

40
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,620
Why did this happen to me? I just came out.

41
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,380
Fine.

42
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,900
I'll show you.

43
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,380
Give it to me.

44
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,820
Sorry, sir.

45
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,020
I was wrong.

46
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,700
Sorry, everyone.

47
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,160
It's a misunderstanding.

48
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,380
You're wasting our time!

49
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,640
Aren't you going to buy water?

50
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,660
Mr. Ji.

51
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,450
I'm fine. I don't need to go to the hospital.

52
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,130
You'd better see a doctor.

53
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
If I find out

54
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,780
you lied to me,

55
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,590
I'll fire you immediately.

56
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,779
How could I lie to you?

57
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm just healthy.

58
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,940
I can recover quickly.

59
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,380
It'll be a waste of money to see a doctor.

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,980
I must take you to the hospital safely.

61
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,300
Before you die,

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,120
you have to see me all the time.

63
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:30,860
No.

64
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,960
You deleted my photos!

65
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,100
What photos?

66
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,620
You...

67
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,290
The photos in my camera.

68
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,659
I didn't delete them!

69
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,060
Did you not keep them well?

70
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,790
Impossible.

71
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,460
Come with me to the hospital.

72
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,390
Come with me to the police station.

73
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,780
Wait a sec.

74
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,340
Are you kidding?

75
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,420
Don't think I don't know you're a paparazzo.

76
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,140
You're the Gossip Mr. Ba.

77
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,260
You posted the photos,

78
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,260
but do you know the truth

79
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,460
before posting them?

80
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,700
Do you know as a media,

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,380
you should be responsible for your words and behaviors?

82
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,420
You're so funny.

83
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,000
Who cares about the truth?

84
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,100
Everyone only cares about the rumors.

85
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,140
It's all because of you unscrupulous media.

86
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,670
People can't see the truth.

87
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,290
Do you know how much these public comments

88
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,300
hurt the people involved?

89
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,460
So what? Does it have anything to do with me?

90
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,540
It's none of my business.

91
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,490
Cut the crap.

92
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Pay me for my lost,

93
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,700
or go to the police station with me.

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Compensate you? No way.

95
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,300
Then you can't leave.

96
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,220
Aren't you going to the police station?

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,460
I'm going there too.

98
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,780
I'll sue you for violation of people's privacy

99
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,020
and defamation.

100
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,540
If the rumor has been spread over 500 times,

101
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,140
how long will you be sentenced?

102
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,780
Up to three years in prison.

103
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,680
As an entertainment blogger,

104
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,040
you'll stay in prison for several years.

105
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,380
Good for you!

106
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:50,860
Fine.

107
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,200
Let's wait and see.

108
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,020
Wait.

109
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,420
Okay.

110
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,659
I'll wait for you at the police station.

111
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,580
You're still here?

112
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,060
You were really pretending.

113
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,140
You saw it too.

114
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,340
Where are they?

115
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,220
It's all your fault. They had left.

116
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,980
Pay me back!

117
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,580
For what?

118
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,580
According to the plot of the novel,

119
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,900
they must have gone to the restaurant.

120
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,630
Dine with me.

121
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,260
I felt dizzy because of hypoglycemia.

122
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,580
Okay, I'm hungry too.

123
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,350
Let's have lunch together.

124
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,450
It seems that

125
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,710
I can't escape from the plot of the novel.

126
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,750
Squeeze some for me.

127
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,380
This kind of dramatic plot

128
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,260
can never appear in my world.

129
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,460
Have more.

130
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,460
Okay.

131
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,140
Let me wipe your mouth for you.

132
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,740
Thank you.

133
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,860
My goodness.

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,100
What a coincidence.

135
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,060
Mr. Ji. Qi.

136
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,220
Since it's fate, why don't we

137
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,220
eat together?

138
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,300
Okay.

139
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,220
Have a seat.

140
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,540
Xitian, let me introduce.

141
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,600
This is Mr. Ji from Sheng'an Entertainment.

142
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,540
Gosh.

143
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,180
The way she looks at Ji Shu is so attractive.

144
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,180
Looks like she wants to put Ji Shu as her backup.

145
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,780
This is the dance teacher

146
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,740
from abroad,

147
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,460
Sun Xitian.

148
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,020
She is also the dance teacher in my studio.

149
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,140
Hello, Mr. Ji.

150
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,920
I didn't expect you to be so young and promising.

151
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,900
I thought the president of Sheng'an Entertainment

152
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,810
was an uncle.

153
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,900
I've heard so much about you before.

154
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,220
People say you are

155
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,390
very professional.

156
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,260
My dance skills have improved a lot.

157
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,720
Xitian helped me a lot.

158
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,780
I'm flattered.

159
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,140
Xining.

160
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,730
Xining?

161
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,390
Why are you here?

162
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,070
Shouldn't I be here?

163
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,160
Didn't you practice dancing?

164
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,340
I was practicing.

165
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
I was asked to eat while practicing.

166
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,740
All right.

167
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,300
I invited Xining here.

168
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,820
There was a misunderstanding between the three of us last time.

169
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,620
So I wanted to invite you

170
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,420
to have a chat and meal together.

171
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,180
Yes.

172
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,480
Xining, sit beside me.

173
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,980
Xining.

174
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,980
Sit here.

175
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,860
The couple of Xi-Le

176
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,560
will be protected by me today.

177
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,440
I bought something on my way here.

178
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,220
Miss Sun,

179
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,570
do you want to come to our company?

180
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,500
We happen to need a dance teacher.

181
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,460
I was thinking to put Xining

182
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,820
on a dance variety show.

183
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,820
Of course.

184
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,970
It's my honor to work with you.

185
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,620
No.

186
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,060
Mr. Ji.

187
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,420
People said that Yu Le had a crush on

188
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,460
the new dance teacher.

189
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,840
The topic is still hot.

190
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,100
If she comes to our company,

191
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,960
the netizens will make a big fuss.

192
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,300
They won't be able to see their works at all.

193
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,460
This doesn't match the development direction of our artists.

194
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,340
Is the boss

195
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,740
you or me?

196
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,340
It's you.

197
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,460
But I'm doing this for the artists.

198
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:00,860
Mr. Ji,

199
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,820
it's inappropriate for you

200
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,580
to recruit my dance teacher in front of me.

201
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,220
Xining.

202
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,620
Do you mind?

203
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,540
No at all, Mr. Ji.

204
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,980
With such a good dance teacher,

205
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,270
I will prove my ability to the audiences with my work.

206
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,290
What does the supporting actor want to do?

207
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,420
He makes these love rivals spend time together every day.

208
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Is he helping or harming Xining?

209
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,780
In that case,

210
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,300
nice to cooperate with you.

211
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,850
No.

212
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,980
I don't agree.

213
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,300
It's okay, Qi.

214
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,740
Why don't you sleep on it?

215
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,820
It's a win-win cooperation,

216
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,550
so there's no need to consider.

217
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,220
Since you insist,

218
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,950
I'll comply with your request.

219
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,910
What do you mean?

220
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,220
It's okay.

221
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,500
I know Qi didn't do it on purpose.

222
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,340
Good for you.

223
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,460
Since you wanted to used your trick on me,

224
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,060
let's see who's better.

225
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,640
I did it on purpose.

226
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,590
I've liked Mr. Ji for ten years.

227
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,220
Why did you take all his attention

228
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,380
when you showed up?

229
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,350
What are you talking about?

230
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
I didn't push her.

231
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,220
You...

232
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,890
Qi, are you hurt?

233
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,060
Xining, I'm so sad.

234
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,690
I'm so sincere to Mr. Ji.

235
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,340
He doesn't even look at me.

236
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,420
Mr. Ji, come and comfort her.

237
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,460
Are you crazy again?

238
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,930
My life is too bitter.

239
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,460
Mr. Ji,

240
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,900
I have to speak for Qi.

241
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,100
She likes you so much.

242
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,500
You can't humiliate her in front of all of us.

243
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,730
I don't believe I can't defeat you.

244
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,920
Xining.

245
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,300
She recovered in less than two minutes after she left the company.

246
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,700
She was just pretending.

247
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,610
Mr. Ji,

248
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,860
how can you say that Qi was pretending?

249
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,580
Yu Le and I saw her get injured

250
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,340
at the scene of a car crash.

251
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,580
Xining, don't talk to him.

252
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,710
He won't care for me.

253
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,740
Mr. Ji,

254
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,330
Qi saved my life.

255
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,220
If it weren't for her, I would be in the hospital now.

256
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,420
Stop persuading him.

257
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,190
The more you criticized him, the sadder I am.

258
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,940
I loved the wrong person.

259
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
That's enough.

260
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,420
Today,

261
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,540
I'll stop my feelings towards you

262
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,940
with this glass of water.

263

God,

264
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,460

Forget it.

268
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,360
I have to go through a car accident again if I restart it.

269
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
I'm scared.

270
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm finally back.

271
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,600
Let me check the novel.

272
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,260
The plots haven't changed.

273
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,140
So the plots of the fan fiction world

274
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,140
can't change the novel?

278
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,420
come back and drink with me.

279
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,300
Lu Qiyu quarreled with me

280
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,300
and said I was unreasonable.

281
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,700
Why did you two spat again?

282
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
We're really breaking up this time.

283
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,460
Fine, you can go ahead.

284
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,910

Drinking is bad for our livers.

Yes.

302
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,280
I entered the world of the novel again today.

303
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,860
To be precise, it's my world of fan fiction.

304
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,420
Not only did I save Yu Le

305
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,000
and stop the accident,

306
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,110

She might be a little unreasonable.

think in terms of her

359
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,150

and ruined his KD.

00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,420
I think I was being unreasonable.

I'm sorry.

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
It's all my fault.

379
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
It's all my fault.

380
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,980
I was being unreasonable.

381
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,900
You just wanted to earn money to support our family.

382
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,430
I won't ignore you anymore.

383
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,430
Your happiness is my priority.

384
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,740
I won't snatch your boss.

385
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,220
I want to be your perfect support.

386
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,860
You hugged the wrong person.

387
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,700
Turn around.

388
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,460
Go!

389
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,660
Mr. Ji.

390
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,340
Are you Lu Qiyu's friend?

391
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,020
No.

392
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,700
I'm just afraid that if a drunkard

393
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,820
dies in the tavern,

394
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,980
I will become his last contact.

395
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,990
You're so humorous.

396
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,680
Not really.

397
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,670
I'm just telling the truth.

398
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,620
Qi,

399
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,220
when did you have contact with Ji Shu

400
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,660
behind my back?

401
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,680
Didn't you give me his number?

402
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,300
Isn't this your author's Ji Shu?

403
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,620
So you're the damn author who tormented me?

404
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
No.

405
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,020
Yes.

406
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,580
He is that damn author.

407
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,380
Lu Qiyu.

408
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,940
We're leaving.

409
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,230
Let's go.

410
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,680
Can you two drunks go back by yourselves?

411
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,420
Fu Xingxing!

412
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
My purse!

413
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,020
My purse!

414
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,090
Tonight, the Lyrae meteor shower is coming.

415
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,700
Dear citizens, you can choose a close observatory to enjoy it

416
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,980
and make a wish

417
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,820
with the one you love.

[Unknown contact]

419
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,570
Hello.

420
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,180
Hello, is it Mr. Ji?

421
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,540
You ordered a tea set at our online store.

422
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,070
Because of our negligence,

423
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,220
we shipped the broken tea set to you.

424
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,550
I'm so sorry about that.

425
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,780
We have arranged

426
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,240
to reship the goods to you.

427
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:56,810
Okay.

428
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,740
Thank you.

[Unknown contact]

430
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,180
Thank you for bringing me my bag.

431
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,980
You don't have to pay for the tea set.

432
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,310
It's the store's fault.

433
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,180
The tea set...

434
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,250
I don't really need to pay for it?

435
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,110
Fortunately, they haven't delivered the goods. I need to ask for a refund now.

436
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,980
Mr. Ji.

437
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,660
Sorry for the trouble.

438
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,220
How about I treat you to dinner?

439
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,860
No need.

440
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,140
Mr. Ji.

441
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,260
Thank you for coming back to tell me the news

442
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,790
and giving me the free ride.

443
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,860
Call me if you need anything.

444
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,400
No need.

445
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,380
It's okay. Don't be shy.

446
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,900
You can come to me for anything.

447
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,780
For example, when the pipe is broken or the toilet is clogged.

448
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,040
You can ask for my help.

449
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,900
You?

450
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,100
Don't underestimate me.

451
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,860
I grew up with my grandma.

452
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,700
She's old.

453
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,980
I'm the one who fixed everything at home.

454
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,060
You're quite good.

455
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,660
So call me if you need anything.

456
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,980
It's free.

457
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,540
Let me ask you something.

458
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,420
What is it?

459
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,940
The purpose of your company

460
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,460
is to produce the sweet romantic dramas.

461
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,140
But

462
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,680
you know my writing style.

463
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,380
Mr. Ji.

464
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,500
Are you worried that your writing doesn't match our company's aim?

465
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,180
Nothing is constant.

466
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,700
Our company has been adding some sugar to life

467
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,740
by creating urban sweet romantic dramas.

468
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,940
Now, we'd like to make some new changes.

469
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,140
You're the manufacturer of sweet romantic dramas.

470
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,940
What is the sweet romantic drama?

471
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,100
Keeping being romantic without any reason

472
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,420
is the sweet romantic drama?

473
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,170
Not really.

474
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,380
Mr. Ji,

475
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,900
you don't want to sell the copyright

476
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,770
because you're worried

477
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,300
that it doesn't match our company's purpose?

478
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,700
You can also think this way.

479
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,500
In my opinion,

480
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,390
the society belongs to adults.

481
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,380
And adults

482
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,520
are practical.

483
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,800
No matter how beautiful love begins,

484
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,780
in the end,

485
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,660
it will lose to finance status.

486
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,420
No matter

487
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,430
how a relationship starts,

488
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,420
in the end, the couple will part.

489
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,050
I don't believe

490
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,510
the happy endings in life.

491
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,780
So, you don't have to waste time on me.

492
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,490
Mr. Ji,

493
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,550
why are you so pessimistic?

494
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,860
Is it because of my repeated harassment

495
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,320
he finally cannot stand and wants to kill me?

496
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,660
You don't say.

497
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,410
Mr. Ji... I...

498
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,180
There's a meteor shower tonight.

499
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,060
I want to stay here.

500
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,340
It's convenient to take a taxi here.

501
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,270
A meteor shower?

502
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,380
I...

503
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,970
Where?

504
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
Where?

505
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Where?

506
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,900
Can we really see it.

507
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,420
What is this?

508
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,350
A camera tripod.

509
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,080
♫The breeze blows across the windowsill♫

510
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,460

♫Sending your smile in your mind♫

512
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,460

♫I faint in the heartbeat♫

519
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,260

♫Irrigate it with sweetness♫

521
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,290

Why don't you make a wish, Mr. Ji?

533
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,740
I have no wish.

534
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,390
If you don't have a wish, why are you watching the meteor shower?

535
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,210
Mr. Ji, look at this.

536
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,700
Look, this is huge.

537
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,220
Bubbles, surround him.

538
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,130
What do you think?

539
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Smile.

540
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,790
You don't get along with this atmosphere.

541
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,660
Do you have anything else to do, Song Yanqi?

542
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,830
It perfectly match the meteor shower.

543
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,180
Xingxing, anything I can help?

544
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,940
It's not me.

545
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,890
It's...

546
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Song Yanqi has something to ask you.

547
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,380
What is it?

548
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,700
Lu,

549
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,140
Ji Shu and you are good friends, right?

550
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,260
Of course.

551
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,620
I'm his only friend.

552
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,780
That's great.

553
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,900
If you can help me solve the copyright of his novel,

554
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,860
whatever you ask for,

555
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,720
I'll let Xingxing to make it real.

556
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,260
So,

557
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
how do we get the copyright?

558
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,300
Well,

559
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,990
we have to cater to his preference.

560
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,300
Ji wakes up

561
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,240
at 6:30 a.m. every day.

562
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,900
He goes out at 7 for morning exercises.

563
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,830
He jogs along the beach for an hour,

568

570
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,500
At 1 or 2 p.m.,

571
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,780
he enters his study to work.

572
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,980
He didn't look that old yesterday.

573
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,780
When we went to see the meteor shower together,

574
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,940
he was good at photographing.

575
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,220
I don't know how to do it.

576
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,660

577

You've only known each other for a few days.

You're developing fast.

579
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,580
It's just a coincidence.

580
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,720
A coincidence?

581
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,420
I think it's a destined fate.

Is there any other way?

589

Ji is a tough person.

590
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,420
When we were

591
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,360
in high school,

592
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,120
it took me a whole year to be friends with him.

593
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,980
You only knew him a few days before.

594
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,910
It's impossible

595
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,860
to give up.

596
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,220
I don't believe he's flawless.

597
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,900
But after the meteor shower yesterday,

598
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,000
I think he's a little pessimistic

599
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,730
and lonely.

If you want to know his weakness,

603
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,610
I think it's easier for him

604
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,620
to accept the soft approaches.

605
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
You can have a try.

607
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,740
That's easy. A tough guy is always afraid of the persevering lady, right?

608
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,470
In that case,

609
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,460
I'll start with being friends with him.

610
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,730
It should be easier to persuade him if I'm his friend.

611
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,460
I suppose so.

612
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,820

00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,020
Is there a bug?

752
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,010
He forgets it?

753
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,260
Do you think

754
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,040
I forgot what you did just now?

755
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,380
Mr. Ji,

756
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,620
I saw paparazzi outside.

757
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,540
If they caught

758
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,860
there were intimate actions

759
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,139
between Sun Xitian and Yu Le,

760
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,670
they would make up stories.

761
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,820
How did you know there was a paparazzi?

762
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,860
I saw it.

763
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,840
He was outside.

764
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,340
Ask Mr. Ji. He saw it too.

765
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,800
He followed us all the way.

766
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,020
So,

767
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,940
you wanted to use this way

768
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
to interrupt the paparazzi's plan?

769
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,300
This is to stop the misunderstanding.

770
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,030
To stop the misunderstanding?

771
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,900
If this is true,

772
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,460
could it be that

773
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,220
she changed my plot

774
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,910
and affected the novel?

775
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
This is ridiculous.

776
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,100
Mr. Ji,

777
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,540
if it weren't for Qi,

778
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,340
this would have been maliciously spread.

779
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,570
She was also anxious.

780
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,410
Besides,

781
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,780
you have to think carefully

782
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,880
about Xitian's working at Sheng'an.

783
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,300
Mr. Ji,

784
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,820
please forgive me.

785
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,350
You're such a generous man.

786
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,800
Go back to the company.

787
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,900
Qi, if you're worried,

788
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,980
I'll go back with you.

789
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,540
Xining.

790
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,250
Be nice to Yu Le.

791
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,810
Mr. Ji.

792
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
I know I was wrong.

793
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,140
I tend to be impulsive.

794
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,300
People make mistakes when they are impulsive.

795
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Please forgive me.

796
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,100
Let me ask you.

797
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,900
-Are you Song Yan...
-Don't see me off.

798
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,030
I can go back myself.

799
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,740
Mr. Ji,

800
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,780
I'm so obsessed with love.

801
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,460
I don't want you to see others.

802
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,970
You like me?

803
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,670
Don't you know?

804
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,580
I like you.

805
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,260
I've liked you for ten years.

806
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,980
To work with you,

807
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
I've been working so hard.

808
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,660
When I knew you like Ye Xining,

809
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,060
I felt like the sky was going to collapse.

810
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,730
Luckily,

811
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,820
I still have a chance

812
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,090
because Yu Le and Xining are in a relationship.

813
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,740
When I knew

814
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,010
you may have a crush on Sun Xitian,

815
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,620
I couldn't stand it anymore!

816
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,500
You've liked me for ten years?

817
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,940
Yes.

818
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
What's your name?

819
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,020
Mr. Ji.

820
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,260
Don't you know my name?

821
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,320
Your full name.

822
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,940
Xiao Qi.

823
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,780
Your surname is Xiao?

824
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,410
Can't I?

825
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,900
Even Xiao Hong and Qiang can take Xiao as their surname.

826
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,660
Why can't I?

827
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,380
I should have

828
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,900
taken a proper name.

829
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,840
I shouldn't have be slacking off.

830
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,260
Let's go back to the company.

831
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:51,980
You drive.

832
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
I...

833
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,180
I...

834
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,660
Am I a designated driver?

835
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,130
Get in.

836
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,660
How to use it?

837
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:24,660
Mr. Ji,

838
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,230
let me make it clear.

839
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,740
I don't drive quite often.

840
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,860
For your safety,

841
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,460
you'd better drive it yourself.

842
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Step on the brake.

843
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,420
Mr. Ji,

844
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,020
even though you don't want to forgive me,

845
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,280
can you change another way to torture me?

846
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,500
I just got my license.

847
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,980
If you let a road killer drive,

848
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,980
more innocent people will get hurt.

849
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,940
You can take my injury as an apology.

850
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,260
But it's bad if I hurt you.

851
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,660
Why don't you try another way to silence me?

852
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,330
Or

853
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,710
let me die beautifully.

854
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,380
Just drive.

855
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,610
My great youth

856
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,910
will be ruined in my own hands.

857
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,160
If there is a next life,

858
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,490
I will be a mute.

859
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,130
I'll absolutely let no trouble coming out of my mouth.

860
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,870
This is the safety belt.

861
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,350
This is the brake. It's the accelerator.

862
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,660
Put into gear.

863
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,260
Step on the accelerator.

864
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,230
Oh my!

865
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,560
Mr. Ji, I'll drive the car now.

866
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,500
Go ahead.

867
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,780
Mr. Ji.

868
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,540
Don't look at me.

869
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,180
What's wrong?

870
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,650
I'm nervous when you see me driving.

871
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,980
You stopped

872
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,300
Yu Le's car accident?

873
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,180
Yes.

874
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,780
Mr. Ji, you have a very bad memory.

875
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,540
Eat more nutritious food

876
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,940
to prevent the Alzheimer.

877
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,540
Why?

878
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,780
There's no special reasons.

879
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,580
Do I need a reason to save people?

880
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,580
You got hurt in the car accident?

881
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,510
Mr. Ji, why did you forget it again?

882
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,940
It's not good

883
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,020
to have the Alzheimer at such a young age.
