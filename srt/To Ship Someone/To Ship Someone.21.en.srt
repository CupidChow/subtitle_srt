00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,500
Bro.

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,460
You've been in hospital for so many days.

7
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,140
Why hasn’t Qi come to see you?

8
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,380
Didn't Mr. Zhen come on behalf of the company?

9
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,330
Why should she be here?

10
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,300
You really don't remember anything?

11
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,300
About what?

12
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,940
Nothing.

13
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,500

14
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,979
Let's go back if there's nothing else.

I've got the discharge certificate.

No.

I came to the wrong house.

My house is over there.

31
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,940

I’m sorry.

41

I'll find a place to move out as soon as possible.

42
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,820
Okay, then move out as soon as possible.

43

Aren't you going to tell him the truth?

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,890
He already knew he lost his memory.

47

I didn't say anything.

I said he was injured on his head

51

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,260
Why should I be curious?

67
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,500
She might not be able to find a place for the time being.

68
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,820
And she's an employee at the company.

69
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,030
So I just let her stay for a while.

70
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,580
But

71
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,700
I don't think I would do such a thing.

72
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,659
That's right.

73
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
Aren't you curious

74

When you woke up that day,

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
she was very worried about you.

Aren't you surprised?

80
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,420
I'm her boss.

81
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,540
Isn't it normal for her to worry about me?

82
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:11,900
Normal?

83
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,180
So normal.

84
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,620
My poor Qi.

85
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,980
Why did she have a crush on you

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,180
who is a heartbreaker?

87
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,020
Is there something wrong with my understanding

88
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,580
or your expression?

89
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,980
I'm the one

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,940
If you say so.

92
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,260
Brother.

93
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,380
I don't care.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,460
Anyway,

95
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,659
by then,

96
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,260
you might regret it.

97
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,220
According to Ji Shu,

98
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,100
that if we return to the real world, we can change the rules.

99
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,180
But he hasn't come yet.

100
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,460
Something must be wrong with this part.

101
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,540
So he will make new rules for me.

102
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,860
And we must know it.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,660
Right?

104
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,620
Chicken soup.

105
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,420
It must be.

106
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,380
I'll get the CCTV now.

107
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
After that, I'll go home.

108
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,710
No.

109
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,980
The supporting actor is at home.

110
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,420
What happened

111
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,620
between Qi and Mr. Ji?

112
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,490
Mr. Ji has been hospitalized for so long.

113
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,900
While Qi comes to work every day.

114
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,300
She doesn't even go to take care of him.

115
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,100
Did they really break up?

116
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,220
Don’t talk nonsense.

117
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,900
I also heard that Mr. Ji was discharged today.

118
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,260
Qi must have gone to pick him up.

119
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,180
They might have avoided suspicion.

120
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,790
Have you forgotten

121
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,380
what they did before?

122
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,180
To avoid suspicion?

123
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,380
Everyone in the company

124
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,830
knows about them.

125
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,380
Mr. Zhen.

126
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:06,720
Mr. Zhen.

127
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,420
Was Mr. Ji alright since you went to visit him today?

128
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,340
There's something wrong.

129
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,600
Did they really break up?

130
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,540
Not really.

131
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,140
I just think

132
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,140
something is wrong with Mr. Ji.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,700
I expected him

134
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,380
to ask me about

135
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,700
whether Qi has been doing recently

136
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,340
and what she is doing.

137
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,100
But he asked nothing.

138
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,040
Oh no.

139
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,780
Love in a rich family is too short.

140
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:29,940
No.

141
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,020
The couple I ship can’t have a tragic ending.

142

00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,659
Mr. Ji.

144
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,860
Do you know?

145
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,340
A man shouldn't stop cherishing it when he gets it.

146
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,540
Or you'll be single again.

147
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,700
What do you mean?

148
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,140
Mr. Ji,

149
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,940
Have you forgotten

150
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,580
your girlfriend Qi?

151
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,660
You went through a lot

152
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,820
to get what you want.

153
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,390
Are you that kind of man

154
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,500
who doesn't love you when you get it?

155
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,140
Wait.

156
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,540
Girlfriend?

157
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,900
What girlfriend?

158
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,540
Qi, don’t worry.

159
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,260
Mr. Zhen has talked to Mr. Ji.

160
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,620
We’ll help you break the ice.

161
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,780
Go get him back.

162
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,299
Qi, you should talk to Mr. Ji nicely.

163
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,429
Stop fighting.

164
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,100
Mr. Ji, I can explain...

165
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
The company treats you well, right?

166
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,820
But you guys teamed up to trick me?

167
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,340
Yes, they did.

168
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,540
So don’t take it seriously.

169
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,820
What are they doing?

170
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,620
He should agree with her when he has a chance.

171
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,300
It seems that men always think

172
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
that what they can't have is the best.

173
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,540
Mr. Ji lost his memory.

174
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,780
Memory loss?

175
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,230
They said

176
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,020
we had a relationship before.

177
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,380
Ji Fei knows that.

178
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
If you don't remember,

179
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,620
you can ignore it.

180
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,220
In other words,

181
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
we really dated.

182
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,220
Aren't you sad?

183
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,500
It was just dating.

184
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,900
It's normal to separate.

185
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,540
I'm open-minded.

186
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,980
I don't remember

187
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,900
what happened after that restaurant.

188
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,750
But I remember

189
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,020
what happened before.

190
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,620
I don't remember

191
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,780
I went to the crew

192
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,000
and met any danger,

193
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,540
I don't remember anything

194
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,260
after you came to the company.

195
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,500
Then

196
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,980
pretend that you never met me

197
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,860
and we never dated.

198
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,820
If you think so,

199
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,500
that’s good.

200
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,500
Mr. Ji, if there’s nothing else,

201
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
I’ll go to work.

202
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,460
Go ahead.

203
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,840
She doesn't seem

204
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,140
to be so fond of me

205
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,620
or that she can't live without me.

206
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,820
Thank you.

207
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Mr. Zhen, I want some fruit.

208
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,820
Fruits. This.

209
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,900
Okay, thank you.

210
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,220
Thank you.

211
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,020
Bring something to the actors.

212
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,660
OK.

213
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,260
Mr. Ji, why are you here alone?

214
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,060
Where’s Qi?

215
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,220
Why should she come?

216
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,380
She ships you.

217
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,500
You also know

218
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,460
what happened between us?

219
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,100
What do you mean?

220
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
I’m not with her.

221
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,900
No?

222
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,780
You broke up. Why?

223
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,260
Do we need a reason?

224
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,540
Mr. Ji,

225
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,420
don’t you need a reason to break up?

226
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,060
You and Qi were so close with each other.

227
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,580
But I don’t like her.

228
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,260
Why?

229
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,780
There's no...

230
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,730
How about

231
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,100
I’ll get you something to eat?

232
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,100
No, Mr. Ji.

233
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,420
I have no appetite.

234
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm going to read the script.

235
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,780
I lost my memory.

236
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,860
I forgot a lot of things.

237
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,980
From the moment I met Qi

238
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,200
to the relationship I had with her,

239
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,140
I've forgotten

240
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,890
all what happened.

241
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,900
Memory loss?

242
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,180
Right.

243
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,180
What's ridiculous is

244
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,660
everyone around me told me

245
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,300
that we had a twisted story.

246
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,140
I remember everything before.

247
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,260
But I've forgotten

248
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,220
what happened recently.

249
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,380
Mr. Ji.

250
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,980
If you lost your memory,

251
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
you should focus

252
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,620
on finding your memory.

253
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,870
Qi is a good girl.

254
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,100
I hope you cherish her.

255
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,700
But I don't like her.

256
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,220
I don't like you either.

257
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,270
I'm going to work.

258
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,660
Are you looking for my brother?

259
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,900
My brother just went out.

260
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,900
Good.

261
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,110
I'm looking for something in the study.

262
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,950
What is it?

263
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,180
Memories.

264
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,340
Yes. Memories.

265
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,530
Didn't he lose his memory?

266
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,580
I don't think I should bother him anymore.

267
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,260
I should delete it when I need to.

268
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,030
I'll take a look too.

269
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,180
No way.

270
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,300
Do I still need the startup password?

271
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,580
He didn't tell me.

272
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,130
My goodness.

273
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,380
It's my first time to come to my brother's study.

274
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,980
Fine.

275
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,360
Ji Fei, stop walking around.

276
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,620
Do you know your brother's password?

277
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,060
I...

278
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,530
It's my first time here. How would I know?

279
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,940
If I can't help,

280
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,780
I'll go to the living room.

281
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,700
Wait.

282
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,820
I have a sister

283
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,700
called Ji Fei.

284
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,820
The one in the novel?

285
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,990
That's right.

286
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,380
Where is she now?

287
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,980
When I was eight.

288
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,580
she couldn't be born because of me.

289
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,260
When's your birthday?

290
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,220
My birthday?

291
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Try it.

292
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,140
Tell me, when's your birthday?

293
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,320
1998.

294
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,300
September 1.

295
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,200
No way.

296
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,580
My brother is always pulling a long face on me.

297
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,220
You know that.

298
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,190
If he likes me,

299
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,140
he should've given more pocket money to me.

300
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,460
Why is he doing this?

301
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,780
It's so cheesy.

302
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,340
Do you know why?

303
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,220
Why?

304
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,220
He's feeling timid near hometown.

305
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,490
Timid?

306
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,820
Timid of what?

307
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,780
Timid of me?

308
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,660
You'll know if you grow older.

309

[Please enter the passcode to access. Surveillance footage of Shan Hang's crime]

310
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,900
The backup video is in my computer encrypted document.

311
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,820
The password is the date

312
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,860
when I entered this world from the restaurant.

313
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,980
When you go back,

314
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,900
bring the video with you.

315
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,980
Oh my god, it's been a long time.

316
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,110
How do I remember that?

317
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,900
I'll leave now.

318
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,500
I won't bother you.

319
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,700
Just tell me the password.

320
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,820
Why did he take such a long trip?

321
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,380
It's unnecessary.

322
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,260
This is back to what I said before.

323
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,180
Only people from the three-dimensional space can change the rules.

324
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,020
And Shan Hang might have found this point.

325
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,500
So he set himself

326
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,140
an easy travelling rule.

327
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,260
Ji Shu was telling me

328
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,060
to be careful of Shan Hang.

329
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,820
Time?

330
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,780
It should be at noon that day.

331
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,020
If it's a 12-hour system,

332
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,460
the password would be too simple.

333
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,220
That's 24-hour system.

334
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,900
It's 1 p.m.

335
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,460
Is it that dramatic?

336
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,850
14.

337
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,580
If seconds are counted...

338
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,370
That's...

339
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,700
That's it.

340
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,060
Well.

341
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,750
[Please enter the passcode to access. Surveillance footage of Shan Hang's crime]

342
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,580
Ji Shu,

343
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,260
if I go back,

344
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,540
I'll let you have a try.

345
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,860
Since it's related to your memories,

346
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,020
it must be related to you two.

347
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,080
Based on the cheesy and childish code

348
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,220
my brother set,

349
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,700
the password might be

350
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,420
1314.

351
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,100
I tried. It was wrong.

352
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,420
He said it was time.

353
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,130
Time?

354
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,140
131407.

355
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,180
Your brother wouldn't be so cheesy.

356
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,940
Try it. Listen to me.

357
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,100
Look.

358
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,460
Like I said.

359
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
How could your brother...

360
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,780
Well, let me try.

361
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,580
Don't waste the chances.

362
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,220
Try a few more times, it will be locked.

363
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,820
You still don't know your brother.

364
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,110
Your brother is not that cheesy.

365
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,620
It's unlocked.

366
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,220
I told you

367
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,700
to analyze my brother in the simplest way.

368
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,020
131427.

369
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,740
Love you forever.

370
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,500
What?

371
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,900
Are you so touched that you're about to cry?

372
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,220
I should be touched.

373
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,380
But now I feel

374
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,180
I got goose bumps.

375
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,820
After going back,

376
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,500
I would tell him to stay away from Lu Qiyu.

377
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,020
He should've learnt something good from him,

378
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
instead of the cheesy things.

379
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
Who is Lu Qiyu?

380
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,770
Nothing.

381
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,340
Did you fall in love with someone else?

382
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,300
Yes.

383
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,100
Since I got it,

384
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,940
I’m leaving.

385
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,260
Lu Qiyu.

386
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,940
Who is Lu Qiyu?

387
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,700
Ji Fei, live a good life.

388
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,550
Live the life you want.

389
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,540
True happiness for a person

390
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,810
comes from within.

391
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,109
It can only be found

392
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,380
in your heart.

393
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,339
I didn't find it.

394
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,579
You have to understand

395
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,140
that life

396
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,300
is not as good as you think,

397
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,260
or as bad as you think.

398
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,180
You don’t have a fever.

399
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,500
What's wrong, Qi?

400
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,780
A rainbow comes after the cloud.

401
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,540
Qi.

402
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,390
My brother went to see a doctor.

403
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,220
Tell me if you feel unwell.

404
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
I'll call my brother right away

405
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,420
and ask him to pick you up.

406
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,700
To check his brain?

407
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,900
What's wrong?

408
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,020
He

409
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,490
has a problem here.

410
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,460
I'm not sick.

411
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,740
Look.

412
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,780
You're just like my brother.

413
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,710
The psychiatrist said

414
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,100
sick people always say they are not sick.

415
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,500
That's not right.

416
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,260
Didn't Ji Shu change the rules for me?

417
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,860
Or did he set up another way?

418
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,900
No, I can't crack it.

419
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,010
Is it possible that these are just camouflages?

420
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,150
You mean

421
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,260
the real backstage is among these addresses?

422
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,220
But how can we rule them out one by one?

423
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,400
If we don't have enough time,

424
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,380
and the website is destroyed,

425
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,420
can Qi come out?

426
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,260
How about this?

427
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:45,980
I'm looking for Mr. K.

428
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,700
He was the one who helped us

429
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,580
find the Internet Protocol address last time.

430
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,900
Maybe he can find

431
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,060
where Shan Hang is hiding.

432
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,980
Qi. I understand.

433
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,700
You’ve been too stressed

434
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,580
and you're in a trance.

435
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,380
Don't worry.

436
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,940
My brother has gone to see a doctor.

437
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,050
As long as he found a way to regain his memory,

438
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,660
you can be together again.

439
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,060
Don't be so sad.

440
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,460
Qi.

441
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,500
You must tell me what happened.

442
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,340
Let's analyze and solve it together.

443
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,780
If I were Shan Hang,

444
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,460
the best way to defeat Ji Shu

445
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,860
is to let him see that the chance

446
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,140
to rescue me slips away.

447
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Why are you talking about Shan Hang

448
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,500
and Lu Qiyu?

449
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,510
What are you talking about?

450
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,420
I don't understand.

451
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,860
We'll see.

452
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,390
Which hospital is your brother in?

453
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,980
Don't exaggerate his condition.

454
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,380
He's in...

455
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,380
In People's Hospital.

456
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,140
What are you doing now?

457
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,380
Save your brother.

458
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,290
If I don't explain to him,

459
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,900
he'll really send himself to a mental hospital.

460
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,700
Doctor.

461
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,090
Do I have any blood clots or bruises?

462
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,500
No.

463
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,580
The CT scan results are normal.

464
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,340
Everything is normal.

465
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,460
Normal?

466
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,980
Do we lose our memory normally?

467
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,220
Memory loss?

468
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,060
Generally, there are several possibilities

469
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,990
of memory loss.

470
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,740
One type is retrograde amnesia.

471
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,020
It's usually related to brain trauma.

472
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,100
This one,

473
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,620
according to the result of the CT scan,

474
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,700
can be ruled out.

475
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,500
The second type is selective memory loss.

476
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,980
It's usually caused by stress

477
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,700
or mental diseases.

478
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,260
The other

479
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,470
is a transient global amnesia.

480
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,020
Let me put it this way.

481
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,180
For example, the patient

482
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,340
may forget his own name

483
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,100
or what happened

484
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,180
to him.

485
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,710
Doctor, I...

486
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,340
Excuse me.

487
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,580
Why are you here?

488
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,540
Doctor, he’s not sick. He doesn’t need treatment.

489
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,270
Mr. Ji, if you want to know anything,

490
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,020
I’ll tell you.

491
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,460
No, I…

492
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,880
Mr. Ji.

493
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,030
You’ve been troubled

494
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,660
because of my behavior.

495
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,980
I'm sorry.

496
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,540
So we really had a relationship.

497
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,420
No.

498
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,140
We were not a couple indeed.

499
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,460
They said we...

500
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,940
It’s a long story.

501
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,880
Mr. Ji, if you want to listen, I'll tell you.

502
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,780
Go ahead.

503
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,700
Mr. Ji,

504
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,380
no matter how strange the next thing is,

505
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,570
I hope you can keep it a secret

506
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,620
and keep it from anyone else.

507
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,860
Mr. Ji, have you heard of the higher-dimensional space?

508
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:47,880
Yes.

509
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,240
I...

510
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,140
I'm not from this world.

511
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,020
The memory you lost before

512
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,340
was actually the experience

513
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,420
another person experiences for you.

514
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,060
We are from the two-dimensional world.

515
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,060
It's like a parallel world.

516
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,620
We came here unintentionally.

517
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,260
You saw the rest.

518
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,260
Mr. Ji, do you think

519
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,780
I’m shooting a fantasy story?

520
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,380
Yes.

521
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,270
But doesn't your missing memory

522
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,740
mean everything?

523
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,060
Don't worry.

524
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,380
He has left.

525
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,740
He won't come back.

526
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,260
I apologize for him for occupying

527
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,580
your body.

528
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,660
But if what you said is true,

529
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,020
what about you?

530
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:37,860
I…

531
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,700
Mr. Ji, you believe me now?

532
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,700
If I don’t,

533
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,940
is there any other answer?

534
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,180
No.

535
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,720
There must be many things

536
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,100
that science can't explain.

537
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,230
He and I have many similarities?

538
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,980
But he's not as lucky as you.

539
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,620
Why?

540
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
In his world,

541
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,020
Ji Fei was not born due to an accident.

542
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,900
So he became pessimistic

543
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,460
because of this.

544
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,550
He thinks that all people and things

545
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,780
will eventually turn into a tragedy.

546
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,540
He must be very happy to see Ji Fei.

547
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,020
Probably.

548
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,380
If multiple dimensions truly exist in the universe,

549
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,100
we belong to two different parallel worlds.

550
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,140
The same us

551
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,620
have experienced different lives.

552
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,620
Because of everything he went through,

553
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,260
I have a completely different life.

554
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,540
So I should thank him.

555
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,820
Am I wrong?

556
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,500
No.

557
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,180
Then why did everyone say I lost my memory

558
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,060
and became dumb?

559
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,820
I made it up.

560
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,380
His parents want Ji Shu to get married.

561
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,980
They want a marriage partner,

562
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,500
so I just made up a story.

563
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,940
But they believed it.

564
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,220
I should thank you

565
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,940
for helping me solve a troublesome problem.

566
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,700
What about you? When are you going back?

567
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,220
I...

568
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,660
I don't know.

569
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,510
Maybe I can't go back for a while.

570
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,100
Why?

571
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,580
I'm waiting.

572
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,780
Waiting for a story to end.

573
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,180
How will the story end?

574
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,980
Maybe when everyone

575
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,810
lets go of the grudge,

576
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,490
Yu Le and Xining

577
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,980
can find their happiness.

578
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,620
That's easy.

579
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,460
When I am together with Xining,

580
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,340
she will be happy.

581
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,780
No, Mr. Ji.

582
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,900
I don’t mean that.

583
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,140
Xining's happiness does not lie with you.

584
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,180
Why doesn't it?

585
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,700
I'm single. She's also single.

586
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,740
When I make her fall in love with me,

587
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,740
she will be happy.

588
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,860
Don't worry.

589
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,060
I’ll make you go back.

590
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,060
Don’t get me wrong, Mr. Ji.

591
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,060
No.

592
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,700
No, Mr. Ji.

593
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,500
I didn’t mean that.

594
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,740
You really misunderstood.

595
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,300
You can't give her happiness.

596
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,220
God.

597
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,820
After all things,

598
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,810
why is it worse than the beginning?

599
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,100
You're transferring to be by Xining as an assistant again?

600
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,300
She has found someone.

601
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,460
How can one be enough?

602
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,500
Xining just started filming.

603
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,780
One takes care of her work and the other takes care of her life.

604
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,780
That’s enough.

605
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,770
Mr. Zhen.

606
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,220
Mr. Ji won’t stop me this time.

607
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,820
Trust me.

608
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,540
I don't.

609
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,110
Mr. Zhen.

610
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,060
You know Mr. Ji lost his memory.

611
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,540
We have nothing to do with each other.

612
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
You can rest assured.

613
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,500
Even...

614
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,420
if you transfer me away,

615
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,020
he might thank you.

616
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,980
After all, with such a person who is hesitant

617
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,940
like me by him,

618
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,780
it's dangerous.

619
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,660
No.

620
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,020
Why?

621
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,620
Only when you stay together

622
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,860
can you fall in love again.

623
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,330
Mr. Zhen,

624
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
let me tell you the truth.

625
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,020
I...

626
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,330
I won't listen.

627
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,860
Mr. Ji is pursuing Xining.

628
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,380
I'm going to stop him.

629
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,260
I'll transfer you right away.

630
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,460
I won't lose my temper again.

631
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,290
Don't be angry, okay?

632
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,500
Let's break up.

633
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,740
No.

634
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,460
I'm sorry.

635
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,160
I don't want to.

636
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,780
Don't come to me again.

637
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,020
Cheng Feng, come back.

638
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,380
I can't live without you.

639
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,940
Cut. Okay, take a break.

640
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,900
Are you OK?

641
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,330
Mr. Ji?

642
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,620
I… I'll just wear Qi's.

643
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,220
-Well.
-Don't catch a cold.

644
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,780
I didn't force her.

645
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,250
Xining.

646
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,140
I bought you some food.

647
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,740
So many delicious food.

648
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,820
Thank you.

649
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,860
Xining, I'll leave the lunch here.

650
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,180
You don't have to have it.

651
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,540
Mr. Ji,

652
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,180
I have a question for Mr. Qian.

653
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,860
Qi. You haven't eaten yet, right?

654
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,940
You guys eat together.

655
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,660
I'm going.

656
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:11,980
I...

657
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,900
Thank you.

658
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,780
Mr. Ji,

659
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
I didn't stop you from pursuing her.

660
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,300
It was Xining who refused.

661
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,340
I had no choice.

662
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,100
Shouldn't you help me?

663
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,300
You don't want to go back?

664
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,420
I do.

665
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,860
But you didn't succeed.

666
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,910
Just wait.

667
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Are they all here?

668
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,140
The afternoon tea Xining bought you.

669
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,700
Have a rest and eat something.

670
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,780
Thank you, Miss Ye.

671
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,220
You're welcome.

672
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,860
Come on.

673
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,620
Sugarcoated cannon.

674
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,940
You are using a roundabout tactic.

675
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,060
Then don't blame me for being rude.

676
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,100
Take it and leave.

677
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,980
Thank you.

678
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,220
In order to pursue Xining,

679
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,180
Mr. Ji is currently firing sugar-coated cannons.

680
00:28:22,850 --> 00:29:05,060
[Yu Le]

681
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,380
Isn't Mr. Ji dating you?

682
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,140
It's a long story. Come and guard the tower.

683
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
I have no position.

684
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,980
You know?

685
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,740
When Xining was filming in the rain,

686
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,260
Mr. Ji always stood by.

687
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,620
He sent hot water and towels.

688
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,180
He's afraid she'll be cold.

689
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,940
Xining was not accustomed to eating boxed meals on the set.

690
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,820
Mr. Ji went all the way to buy her home dishes.

691
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,590
I'm coming to visit her.

692
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,980
Yu Le. Yu Le.

693
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,820
My good boy.

694
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,540
I had to exaggerate it.

695
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,330
Xining is going to stay up all night.

696
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,180
Are you going to keep her company?

697
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,380
Can't I?

698
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,980
Why not?

699
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,220
I'm afraid someone

700
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,900
might not be able to take it.

701
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,290
Miss Ye, the scene is ready.

702
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,100
We can start now.

703
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,340
Okay.

704
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,180
I'll go now.

705
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,810
Xining.

706
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,580
Why are you here?

707
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,460
Didn't you go out of town?

708
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,580
I came back for something.

709
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,620
Qi told me you were here.

710
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
So I came to see you.

711
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,140
Have a seat.

712
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,940
I'm going to work.

713
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,580
OK.

714
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,780
Mr. Ji. Are you here to see Qi?

715
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,090
No.

716
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,540
I'm here to see Xining.

717
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,250
Mr. Ji.

718
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,500
Aren't you afraid Qi'll be jealous?

719
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
I broke up with her.

720
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:28,900
You broke up?

721
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,460
What happened?

722
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,810
To be honest,

723
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,420
this Mr. Ji is not that Mr. Ji.

724
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,260
This Mr. Ji lost his memory today.

725
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,940
-Lost...
-Hello?

726
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,060
Okay, I'll come and get it.

727
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,260
What happened?

728
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,400
His memory remains stuck at several months ago.

729
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,220
It was when you two announced it.

730
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,860
You broke up.

731
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,820
He then took advantage of the victory and wants to take down the crystal.

732
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,960
Then why didn't you stop your boyfriend

733
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,700
from pursuing others?

734
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,940
I'm here.

735
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,180
I asked you to come with me.

736
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,540
What are you talking about?

737
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,330
-Nothing.
-It's nothing.

738
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,820
How is it? Did you finish work tonight?

739
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,900
No, there's a problem with the equipment over there.

740
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
It's still being tested.

741
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,460
Xining, I bought you some food.

742
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,100
You didn't have time to eat tonight.

743
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,020
Have some.

744
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,100
Mr. Ji, you may not know

745
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,580
we don’t eat at night.

746
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,300
We are afraid of waking up the next morning

747
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,220
with a swollen condition.

748
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,900
I have two days before the shooting starts.

749
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,200
I can eat it.

750
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,820
Even if you're not filming,

751
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,820
you're still an actor.

752
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,620
Forget it.

753
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,820
Xining.

754
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,060
-I'm not an actress.
-Here.

755
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,660
I'll eat it.

756
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:46,980
Xining.

757
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,470
Okay, I'll come back tomorrow.

758
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,580
