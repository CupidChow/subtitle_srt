Should I save him or not?

141
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,700
The worst scenario

142
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,460
is that it'll completely change itself

143

I thought the loss of my healing power

145
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,260
meant the story had an ending,

No.

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,380
If I had saved him,

172
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,160
everyone would've been fine.

173
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,740
It was dangerous then.

174
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,760
Anyone rushing over could be hit.

175
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,180
No one will blame you.

176
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,460
But if Sun Xitian had got seriously injured,

177
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,740
would Yu Le feel indebted to her?

178
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,620
He should.

179
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,140
Besides, Xitian's injury

180
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,800

182
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,140
Will she become paraplegic?

183
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,260
No.

184
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,980
Her external injury looks nasty,

185
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,940
but other than two fractures,

186
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,870
she didn't get hurt anywhere else.

187
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,420
Are you relieved now?

188
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,620
What about Yu Le?

189
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,220
We'll see.

190
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,660

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,700
You shouldn't have reset the plot!

195
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,490
Now,

196
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,700
all of our previous efforts

197
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,740
are in vain.

198
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,260
What about the evidence?

199
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,230
Don't worry.

200
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,340
Even if we kept it,

201
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,500
we might not be able to take it away.

202
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,180
After all, it belongs to this world.

203
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,300
Then what should we do?

204
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,220
How can we prove Shan Hang guilty without evidence?

205
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,950
Don't worry.

206
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,620
We've found other evidence.

207
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,230
That's good.

208
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,590
Let's go.

209
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,780
Is everything settled?

210
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,730
Yan has taken care of everything.

211
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,450
Good.

212
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,890
Don't worry too much.

213
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,540
I'm home. Go back.

214
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,390
Okay.

215
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
Have a good rest.

216
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,540
You had a hard day today.

217
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,160
Xining.

218
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,540
Xitian is injured.

219
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,670
I can't stand by and do nothing.

220
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,900
I understand.

221
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,620
Yu Le,

222
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,220
let's break up.

223
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,600
Cancel the agreement.

224
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,340
Why?

225
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,300
I've thought it through.

226
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,950
We're not right for each other.

227
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,400
Don't get me wrong.

228
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,140
I have no feelings for Xitian anymore.

229
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,620
I know.

230
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,900
I just don't want to be in your way.

231
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,060
You announced our relationship

232
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,720
because you want to be an actor

233
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,820
and protect me.

234
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,500
But I don't want your career

235
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,780
to be influenced by me.

236
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,300
Don't think like that.

237
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,580
It's all my choice.

238
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,700
In a few days,

239
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,820
when people forget about this…

240
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,880
We'll tell them that we've broken up.

241
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,120
Before that day, we'll interact less

242
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,180
as Yan said.

243
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:57,980
Why?

244
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,060
Just think that I don't deserve you.

245
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,740
No, Xining.

246
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,660
You're very good.

247
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,940
I know I neglected you today.

248
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,300
But it's because Xitian

249
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,700
-risked her life…
-Yu Le.

250
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,880
Don't make a decision so hastily.

251
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,020
Find out what you really want first.

253
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,020
Your career

254
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,790
shouldn't be affected by a relationship.

255
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,080
In the next couple of days,

256

257
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,460
I find this situation quite good.

258
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,310
Love does affect the speed of drawing the sword.

259
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,760
Drawing the sword?

260
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,300
I mean making money.

261
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,760

The company has made a new plan for you.

270

Are you really going to give up

271
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,700
the achievements you finally got?

272
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,430

273

Yes.

275

I won't lie to myself.

I do feel it's a pity.

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,390
Fine.

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,980

384
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,260
Without you, I'd still be hesitating.

385
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,740
Now, I'm determined to become a good actor.

386
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,120
I'm going to join Director Wang's team soon.

387
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,740
Congratulations.

388
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,270
You got what you wanted.

389
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,520
What about you?

390
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,780
What's your plan?

391
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,740
I'll continue to be an actress.

392
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,060
The company has arranged a play for me.

393
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,620
I'll join the crew for rehearsal very soon.

394
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,020
How long will you be gone?

395
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,980
About a year.

396
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,640
When will you start shooting?

397
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,580
In a few days.

398
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,220
I think it'll take more than half a year.

399
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
I hope you can always

400
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,460
be a shiny star.

401
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,580
I hope everything goes well for you.

402
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,140
Ji Shu,

403
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,570
if their story happened

404
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,190
when they were successful and famous,

405
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,260
would the ending be different?

406
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,660
Maybe.

407
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,390
Let's go.

408
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,300
Let's go home.

409
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,100
Yu Le.

410
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,380
Xining.

411
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,460
Every one of my friends in this world.

412
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,940
It's said

413
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,660
if we don't say goodbye, we will meet again.

414
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,940
So I won't say goodbye to you.

415
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,500
I hope all of you can be happy

416
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,460
in this world.

417
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,100
Okay.

418
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,900
Yan,

419
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,580
you promised to buy me drinks.

420
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,700
Fulfill your promise now.

421
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
What do you think?

422
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,700
Sure. Where should we go?

423
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,000
[The world is big, yet the world is also small.
In the crowd of people, if you wish to meet someone, you will surely meet them.
You can't leave the Earth, nor can you reach the Galaxy]

424
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,830
[The End]

425
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,180
You're finally out.

426
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,420
I still haven't found Shan Hang.

427
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,180
But the evidence has been submitted to the police.

428
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,500
OK.

429
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,750
Where is Qi?

430
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,770
At home.

431
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,980
It's over.

432
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,940
It's really over.

433
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,820
I know.

434
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,100
Ji Shu,

435
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,020
we've tried so hard

436
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,770
but still failed to change the ending.

437
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,460
Everything is gone!

438
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,300
Although the story is over,

439
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,360
their world is still moving forward.

440
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,180
Really?

441
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,300
Yes.

442
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,620
No. I still feel so sad.

443
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,060
You can't

444
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,380
be crying your eyes out

445
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,840
for characters in a story.

446
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,340
By the way,

447
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,420
you were there for so long.

448
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,810
Did something happen between that Ji Shu and you?

449
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,700
Don't you ask.

450
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,180
I was so scared when he woke up.

451
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,100
That Ji Shu

452
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,140
pursued Xining with your face.

453
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,010
It felt like

454
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,700
my boyfriend was chasing my bestie.

455
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,300
You were frustrated?

456
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,850
Very frustrated.

457
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,500
You weren't there.

458
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,860
He sent her flowers and food.

459
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
He even stayed up all night with her.

460
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,100
If I had been any less rational,

461
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,220
I would've shouted at him,

462
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,300
"Ji Shu, you heartless man!"

463
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,450
Fortunately, you knew he wasn't me.

464
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,420
Alright. Stop crying.

465
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,550
Your face is all wet.

466
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:25,660
Here.

467
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,540
Where's Shan Hang?

468
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,200
He ran away.

469
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,380
But don't worry.

470
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,780
The police have filed a case.

471
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,110
They'll catch him soon.

472
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,830
A reward for you.

473
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,600
That's all?

474
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,620
What else do you want?

475
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,880
I want what a boyfriend

476
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,300
should have.

477
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,620
Don't you think it's too fast?

478
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,530
What are you thinking about?

479
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,940
I'm talking about a date.

480
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,700
I thought…

481
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,120
All right. I'll take you home.

482
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,380
No.

483
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,000
Why are you so eager to kick me out?

484
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,260
-We haven't seen each other for so long.
-I…

485
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,820
I'm worried that you're tired.

486
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,350
Go back and have a good rest.

487
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,480
I'm not going back.

488
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,780
Isn't that the huge bed?

489
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,900
I can sleep here.

490
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,410
You once left me sleeping here.

491
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,660
It's a bit hard

492
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,700
but not unbearable.

493
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
You're holding a grudge.

494
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,380
I'm not that kind of person.

495
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,440
I'm going to sleep.

496
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,460
You've been through

497
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,180
a lot of hardships recently.

498
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,440
Go back and rest early.

499
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,580
Nothing is hard

500
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,620
when I'm with you.

501
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,780
And every day we're together,

502
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,900
I'm happy.

503
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,780
Thank you, damn author.

504
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,030
You're welcome.

505
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,900
But

506
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,960
can we discuss something?

507
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,740
What's it?

508
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,620
I know it's a pet name,

509
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,300
but…

510
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,420
Can you call me something else?

511
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,350
Something else?

512
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,230
Little Shu?

513
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,730
Shu?

514
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,100
No.

515
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,940
Lin Qingmiao called you that.

516
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,740
It's weird if I call you that too.

517
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,420
Shushu.

518
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,010
Shushu.

519
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,700
Shushu.

520
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,180
Shushu. Shushu.

521
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,980
Call me whatever you want.

522
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,540
Are you shy, Shushu?

523
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,220
No.

524
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,620
It's late.

525
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,740
Go back and rest.

526
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,440
Good night.

527
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,560
Good night.

528
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,160
Good night.

529
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,960
Good night.

530
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,450
Shushu.

531
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,840
You don't want me to go, do you?

532
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,380
But it's really…

533
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,260
Ji Shu?

534
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,420
Don't scare me.

535
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,140
I'm scared.

536
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,420
Stop hiding. Come out.

537
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,120
I'm getting angry.

538
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,300
Song Yanqi, why didn't you come home?

539
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,490
Am I still your bestie?

540
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,900
Of course you are!

541
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,220
Then why did you stay at Ji Shu's place

542
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,300
and not come back to see me?

543
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,020
I'm back now.

544
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,740
Sweetie.

545
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,660
The house actually feels so empty without her.

546
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,620
You're back.

547
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,540
Try the new tea I bought

548
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,740
and see if you like it.

549
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,180
Too cute.

550
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,900
Too thick.

551
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,780
This one.

552
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,660
I wore it once.

553
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,860
Ji Shu.

554
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,240
[Message from an unknown number]

555
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,140
I won't lose.

556
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,550
I won't let you two off!

557
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,380
[Boyfriend]

558
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,030
[Boyfriend]

559
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,060
What's wrong?

560
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,190
Are you home?

561
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,140
Where else could I be?

562
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,820
Okay.

563
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,160
I just want to confirm that you're not still out.

564
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,700
Ji Shu.

565
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,500
I'm not a kid.

566
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,860
I don't have a curfew.

567
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,660
You don't.

568
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,380
It's late. Go to bed.

569
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,200
Good night.

570
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,160
Good night.

571
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,900
Xingxing.

572
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,740
Help me decide

573
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,360
what to wear tomorrow.

574
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,580
Look at your smile.

575
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,580
If I didn't know better,

576
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,980
I'd think

577
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,440
you two did something R-rated after we left.

578
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,100
Maybe we did.

579
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,050
Did you two…

580
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,680
What are you thinking?

581
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,140
You kissed?

582
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,380
Gross lovebirds.

583
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,740
Do you know

584
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,460
when you two were kissing,

585
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,980
I was busy writing articles

586
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,460
because your man

587
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,020
decided to quit writing?

588
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,770
Thank you, beautiful and kind Editor Fu.

589
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:31,700
So,

590
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,100
you've read so many romantic novels.

591
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,940
What do you advise me to wear on a date?

592
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,380
A date?

593
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,980
Tomorrow is Monday.

594
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,240
Don't you need to work?

595
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,870
He asked me out for morning exercise.

596
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,860
So typical of Ji Shu.

597
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,260
You can't

598
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,260
wear a skirt for morning exercise.

599
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,100
Oh.

600
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,620
I've got some sportswear.

601
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,380
Take a look.

602
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,020
Do you know what I want to do now?

603
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,140
I want to blacklist you.

604
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,660
You can blacklist me

605
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,540
after you help me pick.

606
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,380
Hurry up.

607
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,900
What color does your man

608
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,380
usually wear?

609
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,740
He's not my man.

610
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
Song Yanqi.

611
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,980
Can't you act normally?

612
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,030
Well,

613
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,020
I'm a rookie in love.

614
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,180
You're a veteran.

615
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,700
We're different.

616
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,620
You're my nemesis, aren't you?

617
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,920
Tell me. What color does he usually wear?

618
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,420
Either black or white.

619
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,660
Ask him directly.

620
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,540
If he wears white, you'll wear black.

621
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,600
If he wears black, you'll wear white.

622
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,220
Right.

623
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,790
I'll ask him now.

624
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,260
Thanks.

625
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,500
Where was I?

626
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,020
Gross lovebirds!

627
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,300
What's wrong with her?

628
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,500
She's been grinning the whole morning.

629
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,460
You need to ask?

630
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,100
People act like that

631
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,300
when they're in love.

632
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,980
In love?

633
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,820
Who's in love?

634
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,980
You tell me.

635
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,640
You tell me.

636
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,500
You've found out?

637
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,250
Only a fool can't tell.

638
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,860
Is he the man

639
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,380
who took you away during the blind date?

640
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,700
I see.

641
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,940
You're fast.

642
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,660
Great news! The last single person

643
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,940
in our company

644
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,260
is not single anymore!

645
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,100
Thank you.

646
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,420
Song Yanqi.

647
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
Come to my office.

648
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,830
Mr. Jia, what's the matter?

649
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,860
Do you know that Ji Shu

650
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,060
locked Brighter Than Stars and quit writing?

651
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,500
Yes.

652
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,889
What's your plan?

653
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,900
Will you look for a new copyright?

654
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,460
Mr. Jia,

655
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,900
I've talked to Mr. Ji.

656
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,460
The novel is locked,

657
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,739
but the copyright is not.

658
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,100
We've reached an agreement.

659
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,900
If the company still wants to adapt it,

660
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,500
he's willing

661
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,900
to sell us the copyright.

662
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:28,909
Okay.

663
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,020
Get it done as soon as possible.

664
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,480
Mr. Jia,

665
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,909
are you willing to do this project now?

666
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
As long as he agrees.

667
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,580
He agrees.

668
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,889
You and he…

669
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,820
Mr. Jia.

670
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,020
You've known that your boss is the author Ji Shu?

671
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,920
You've known that the author Ji Shu is your boss?

672
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,560
Okay. Things are easy now.

673
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,100
Go.

674
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,220
Who is the great author

675
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,880
picking me up from work today?

676
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,940
The damn author whom you both love and hate.

677
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,530
No.

678
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,460
There's only love today.

679
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,540
Did you go to the police station?

680
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,140
What did the police say about Shan Hang's case?

681
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Are you looking at some pretty girl?

682
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,700
Pretty girl?

683
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,740
The prettiest girl is sitting right next to me.

684
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,530
Don't joke with me.

685
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,320
How's it going with Shan Hang?

686
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,070
Don't worry.

687
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,180
The investigation has started.

688
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,640
The police will catch him.

689
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,500
I know you can handle it.

690
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,660
But I have a bad feeling.

691
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,540
I'm afraid I have PTSD

692
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,800
because of what he did.

693
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,430
Don't worry.

694
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,860
What do you want to eat today?

695
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,310
Look.

696
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,980
What is this?

697
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,020
I searched online and listed 100 must-dos for couples.

698
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,300
I never dated anyone before you,

699
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,490
but I've seen other people date.

700
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,040
How about we follow this list?

701
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,960
No problem.

702
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,620
Let me see what we'll do after dinner.

703
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,380
Take your time.

704
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,600

00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,540
Be serious.

761
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,920
I have no other wishes.

762
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:04,700
You sure?

763
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,620
How's that possible?

764
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,320
♫Lean on me when you're sad♫

765
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,620
Then do you have any wish?

766
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,720
♫What are you thinking under the fireworks♫

767
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,980
I have so many wishes.

768
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,110
♫Those romantic moments♫

769
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,940
I wish

770
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,660
I can eat delicious food every day

771
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,160
♫Are just like yesterday♫

772
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,780
and I'll never be late to work.

773
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,740
It'd be better if I could win a lottery or something.

774
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,090
♫I loved you♫

775
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,770
♫So I want to give you more♫

776
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,770
♫Space brings silence♫

777
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,150
Most importantly,

778
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,730
♫Our love is a once-in-a-lifetime experience ♫

779
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
I wish that Ji Shu

780
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,460
can be happy forever.

781
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,720
♫I think too much♫

782
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,660
♫But you never care♫

783
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,380
Then I wish

784
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,180
all your wishes

785
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,650
♫So it's all in my mind♫

786
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,340
come true.

787
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,940
♫I'm a fool♫

788
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,870
♫How can I♫

789
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,530
♫Forget the past and move forward?♫

790
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,470
♫Wind in my hair♫

791
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,750
♫Can you make me stop missing her?♫

792
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,300
♫I loved you♫

793
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,940
♫So I want to give you more♫

794
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,160
Did you have fun today?

795
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,660
I saw the Ferris wheel

796
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,580
and ate delicious food

797
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
with you just now.

798
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,140
What else should we do today?

799
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,520
What will happen if I step on this?

800
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,870
Grandma never allowed me to do it.

801
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,850
Let me try.

802
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,520
Will it explode if I step on it?

803
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,420
Come here.

804
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,980
What's wrong?

805
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,510
Nothing.

806
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,920
Let's talk over there.

807
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,220
What's wrong?

808
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,880
Why do you look so serious all of a sudden?

809
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,820
Go buy ice cream.

810
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,940
Ice cream?

811
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,270
You don't eat ice cream.

812
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,500
I suddenly feel like eating one.

813
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:05,970
I see.

814
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,630
There's a shop. Wait for me.

815
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,540
Qi.

816
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,540
Ji Shu.

817
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,660
I bought two ones of the same flavor.

818
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,100
They're vanilla…
