[Episode 9]

4
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,820
So I wanted to ask him

5
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,420
what happened between them.

6
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,380
Wait a minute.

7
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,539
Ten minutes left.

8
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,830
I can practice a little longer.

9
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,260
Did you quarrel with Xining?

10
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,500
Her manager is looking for you.

11
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,160
Where is he?

12
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,560
At the door.

13
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,020
Yingjun.

14
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,540
What happened to Xining?

15
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,500
Did you quarrel with Xining?

16
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,760
I...

17
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,060
Xining is missing.

18
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,130
What do you mean?

19
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,980
She has an urgent job this afternoon.

20
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,340
I couldn't find her,

21
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,530
so I came to ask you

22
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,730
if you two had a fight.

23
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,660
We had an argument.

24
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,260
But where would she go?

[The 50th Anniversary of Qin Hai Middle School, Anniversary Ceremony, Students and Teachers Reunion]

26
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,380
Mr. Ji.

27
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,660
What brings you here?

28
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,100
You have work to do this afternoon.

29
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,900
Zhen Yingjun is looking for you.

30
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,980
I came here to take a chance.

31
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,220
I'll go back now.

32
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,820
No hurry.

33
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,579
Don't you understand

34
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,060
why the company did this?

35
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,340
Do you remember what you said

36
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,740
when you gave up dancing?

37
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,140
You said,

38
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,260
one day,

39
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,980
you will stand up again

40
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,660
and reach the level as high as where he is.

41
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,190
How did you know I said that?

42
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,470
It doesn’t matter how I found out.

43
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,220
If I hadn't refused

44
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,820
working with Yu Le,

45
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,480
wouldn’t all this have happened?

46
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,660
I was a coward.

47
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,660
No.

48
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,940
Everyone is afraid of rumors,

49
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,060
not to mention you, who's in the center of the whirlpool.

50
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,660
But if I had been a little braver…

51
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,700
Do you know why Yu Le

52
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,960
appointed you as the second female lead?

53
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,740
Fang Yan asked him to do that.

54
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,220
She asked him to persuade you

55
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,659
to give up being the female lead of The Track.

56
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,060
Even if you had insisted,

57
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,300
he would still persuade you.

58
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,450
No matter what choice you made,

59
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,700
the result would be the same.

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,750
He would think you conspired with the company

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,460
and intercepted his role.

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,340
Mr. Ji,

63
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,780
you did this.

64
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,020
The cake is just this big.

65
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,820
Everyone wants the biggest one.

66
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,280
Wang Ziheng is the company's artist,

67
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,320
but Yu Le is not.

68
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,980
Ye Xining.

69
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,960
You have to understand

70
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,710
he doesn't like you,

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,270
at least he's not that into you.

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,020
In the face of interests,

73
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,460
no matter how much love it is, it's fragile.

74
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,380
I know.

75
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,700
Then why did you still do it?

76
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,660
I'm afraid

77
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,390
you never really loved anyone.

78
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,240
You know he has someone else in his heart,

79
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,390
but you just can't let go of him.

80
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,580
You think time can heal everything.

81
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,380
You think you're the exception.

82
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,180
All the self-righteous feelings

83
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,380
are self-deceiving.

84
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,140
You're different from before.

85
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,330
You used to be nice to everyone,

86
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,020
but you still keep a distance from them.

87
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,700
Now it's like

88
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,560
you're living outside the world.

89
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,820
But now I suddenly realize

90
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,220
you're approachable.

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,700
Am I?

92
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,700
Yes.

93
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
It's weird.

94
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,380
You were straight

95
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,640
pointing out my relationship with Yu Le.

96
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,460
I should be angry,

97
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,780
but actually I feel relieved.

98
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,700
One should know how to cut loss in time.

99
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,100
If he's not that into you,

100
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,220
you should turn around decisively.

101
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,140
But if everyone can be so decisive

102
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,460
in love,

103
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,260
then there wouldn't be

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,540
any pursuing without getting,

105
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,780
not giving up,

106
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,080
or getting without cherishment.

107
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,460
If you can't give it up now,

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,660
I can give you time,

109
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,760
but that won't be too long.

110
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,710
What do you mean?

111
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,460
People will only give up

112
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,980
and accept the reality

113
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,360
after they try.

114
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,540
Ji Shu.

115
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,820
What?

116
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,820
Who are you

117
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,140
to tell her what to do?

118
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,820
Did you ask Xining to cut loss in time

119
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
because you want her to look back at you?

120
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,020
Other supporting actors

121
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,220
are always giving without asking for anything in return.

122
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,980
Why are you

123
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,700
always trying to win?

124
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,580
Qi, Mr. Ji is not…

125
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,160
You eavesdropped?

126
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,900
I don't have to.

127
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,700
It turns out Mr. Ji is so scheming.

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,140
Everything is connected.

129
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,580
No matter how they change,

130
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
they will fight in the end.

131
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm scheming?

132
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,700
If it weren't for you,

133
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,820
why would I even care about it?

134
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,020
What does it have to do with me?

135
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,220
You wanted to intervene in others' relationship.

136
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,540
I didn’t force you.

137
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,820
Qi, you misunderstood me.

138
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,150
Mr. Ji didn’t mean that.

139
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,220
Xining, don’t explain for him.

140
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,980
You trust others too easily.

141
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,340
Don’t judge a book by its cover.

142
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,890
He just wants you to break up with Yu Le

143
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,150
so that he can swoop in.

144
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,780
Do I need to swoop in?

145
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,659
I don't like her at all.

146
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,320
You don't like her?

147
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,340
You're lying.

148
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,580
When she was sad,

149
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,659
you showed up immediately

150
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,340
and tried to drive a wedge between them.

151
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,330
If you didn't like her,

152
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,540
why did you show up in time

153
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,340
when she needed help the most?

154
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,220
You also asked them to break up.

155
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,740
If it's not love, then what is it?

156
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,350
I...

157
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,890
I don't like her.

158
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,140
Ji Shu likes her.

159
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,340
What? You have two personalities?

160
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,020
Big Ji Shu. Little Ji Shu.

161
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,580
Song...

162
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,220
Song what?

163
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,340
I want to give you a ride.

164
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,270
It's hard to guard against a thief.

165
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,900
Xining, stay here.

166
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,160
Yu Le will be here soon.

167
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,260
Don’t go.

168
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,780
Yu Le.

169
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,700
Do you remember the song at the orientation party?

170
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,980
Of course.

171
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,040
That was the first time we met each other.

172
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,460
Do you think

173
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,180
it's lucky to meet me?

174
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
It’s a lucky draw.

175
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,940
Yu Le.

176
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,820
I really didn’t know about The Track before.

177
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,460
If I had known this would end up like this…

178
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,520
I knew everything.

179
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,650
Qi told me everything.

180
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,660
I misunderstood you.

181
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,500
It's all in the past.

182
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm glad we've made it clear.

[The 50th Anniversary of Qin Hai Middle School, Anniversary Ceremony, Students and Teachers Reunion]

184
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,340
When I saw you dancing back then,

185
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,940
at that moment,

186
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,740
I was like seeing the real White Swan.

187
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,170
You stood on your toes,

188
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,500
ready to spread your wings and fly

189
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,060
to the sky you desired.

190
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,150

00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:42,980
Ye Xining!

754
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,700
Ye Xining!

755
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,180
Ye Xining, you and Yu Le

756
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,140
made an agreement to exchange interests.

757
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,420
Did he provide resources for you?

758
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:47,900
Ye Xining.

759
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,300
Don't you have any true feelings for each other?

760
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,860
Ye Xining.

761
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,980
Did Yu Le force you to sign it,

762
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,220
or did you two reach an agreement?

763
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,220
Say something, Ye Xining.

764
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,980
What do you think about he cheating on you

765
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,940
when you were sick?

766
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,700
Ye Xining, say something.

767
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,460
Ye Xining.

768
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,860
Yu Le cheated on you while you were sick.

769
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,500
What do you think about it?

770
00:32:59,500 --> 00:32:59,980
Ye Xining,

771
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,260
what's your relationship with your boss?

772
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,220
She's not Ye Xining.

773
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,620
-She's not Ye Xining. -She's not Ye Xining.

774
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,860
Excuse me. Where's Ye Xining?

775
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,900
Where is Ye Xining?

776
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,780
Where is Ye Xining?

777
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,840
Where is Ye Xining?

778
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,240
Where is Ye Xining?

779
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,360
Where is Ye Xining?

780
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,140
She hasn't come out.

781
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,270
Hasn't she come out?

782
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,730
Cry if you want.

783
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,140
Why should I cry?

784
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,770
It's all the damn author's fault.

785
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,140
Ji Shu.

786
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,420
I’ll kill you!

787
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,300
Mr. Ji, don’t get me wrong.

788
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,500
I’m not blaming you.

789
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,620
I'm blaming the one

790
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,190
who has the same name as you.

791
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
You are so angry.

792
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,860
Of course I am.

793
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,700
It turned out that I shipped the wrong couple.

794
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,300
It's all his fault.

795
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,180
He's a stumbling block in my life.

796
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,860
I warned you

797
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,640
about not being deep in it when you ship someone.

798
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,860
Do you regret now?

799
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,540
As long as I'm alive,

800
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,900
nothing is a big deal.

801
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,199
It's not worth getting ill

802
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,360
and getting angry about a bad guy.

803
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,980
It's not worth it.

804
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,380
Ji Shu.

805
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,580
You can have any names,

806
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,900
why is it Ji Shu?

807
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,100
You can look any way,

808
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,760
but you look exactly like him.

809
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,429
Does my name offend you?

810
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,300
I still don't believe it's true.

811
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,820
I have eyes.

812
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,250
I saw there was something

813
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,650
between Yu Le and Xining.

814
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,500
Even if there's an agreement,

815
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,900
they must be joking.

816
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,940
Then they were used by someone on purpose.

817
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
That agreement must be maliciously photoshopped.

818
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,940
How can you tell if it's real or fake?

819
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,380
I've been browsing in various forums.

820
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,420
Usually, there are warm-ups and trials for this kind of thing,

821
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,620
but there's no sign at all this time.

822
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,980
Someone must have maliciously set up a trap.

823
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
That makes sense.

824
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,340
What else?

825
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,460
Also,

826
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,980
they must have read

827
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,940
too many contractual relationship novels online.

828
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,810
Even if it's true,

829
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,740
are they stupid?

830
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,220
Who would leave evidence

831
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,620
to harm themselves?

832
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,900
Are they playing a drama?

833
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,500
What about the chat records?

834
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,020
Even if they're real,

835
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,900
it's possible that someone takes out a part of it.

836
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,860
It's normal for a couple

837
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,180
to role-play and have fun.

838
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,980
It makes sense.

839
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,260
I must catch

840
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,240
the one who's behind this.

841
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,740
Why did the break-up scene

842
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,180
occur in advance?

843
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,020
Did something happen in the real world?

844
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,720
Who was the mysterious guy

845
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,450
last night?

846
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,170
Could it be him?

847
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,860
I know.

848
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,180
It won't affect our cooperation.

849
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll try my best to deal with this.

850
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,740
Okay.

851
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,860
We will attend the audition on time.

852
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,980
Okay, bye.

853
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,100
Yan,

854
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,740
the brand side said

855
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,780
if we don't respond,

856
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,380
they will terminate the contract with us.

857
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Some of them have already issued the termination statements directly.

858
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,860
Okay. You try to pacify them.

859
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,300
I’ll discuss with Mr. Ji.

860
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,860
Okay.

861
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,170
What’s your plan, Mr. Ji?

862
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,540
What do you want to do?

863
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,740
I think you all know

864
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,100
what happened.

865
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,820
Most of the responsibility

866
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,980
lies with Yu Le.

867
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,340
But

868
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,380
one hand alone can't clap.

869
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,980
Ye Xining agreed to Yu Le

870
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,070
because she wanted his resources.

871
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,060
You're right.

872
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,130
You damn supporting actor

873
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,740
must be very happy now.

874
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,380
You've finally got a chance to swoop in.

875
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,620
I don't care about their relationship.

876
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,580
Now we're facing

877
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,780
a high penalty.

878
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,580
I don’t think Mr. Ji wants to

879
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,660
lose money before making money, right?

880
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,860
What do you want to do?

881
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,740
We'll try our best to cooperate.

882
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,780
We can't admit the contractual relationship.

883
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,940
Just say it's a prank between friends.

884
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,470
They took it out of context.

885
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,380
Excuse me.

886
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,020
I think so too,

887
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,750
but Fang Yan,

888
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,050
do you think the netizens will believe it?

889
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,820
Of course, it's more than clarification.

890
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,500
My friend has a drama.

891
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,620
I've asked him

892
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,220
to let them star in the drama.

893
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,410
This photo

894
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,260
is a leaked behind-the-scenes photo.

895
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,660
We can take this opportunity

896
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,010
to officially announce this drama

897
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,140
and make them appear in the same show.

898
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,970
Besides, let them participate in

899
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,620
the dating variety show mentioned before.

900
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,150
Fang Yan,

901
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
you've finally thought it through.

902
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,260
I prepared a live stream at 3 p.m.

903
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,560
for them to clarify this thing together.

904
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,820
Mr. Ji,

905
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,420
Director Qian's film won the award.

906
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,020
Xining won the Best Actress.

907
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,540
Should I publish this news

908
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,460
and make it a trending topic?

909
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,980
No.

910
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,780
Listen to her.

911
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,380
Okay.

912
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,980
What do you think?

913
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,420
Mr. Ji. Yan.

914
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,380
Can I talk to Yu Le alone?

915
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,100
Sure.

916
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,940
Xining.

917
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,660
I didn't expect this to happen.

918
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,250
I should have cleared

919
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,340
my chat records.

920
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,460
It's not only your fault.

921
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,420
It's the truth.

922
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,340
It can't be hidden.

923
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,620
I was too impulsive,

924
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,240
so I made such a ridiculous decision.

925
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,260
Yu Le,

926
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,540
Yan's right.

927
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,040
Apart from liking you,

928
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,540
I'm with you also because

929
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,340
I want to get resources from you.

930
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,540
Get resources?

931
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,820
Are you angry

932
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,660
because of me and Xitian?

933
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,190
So you said that on purpose.

934
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
I admit

935
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,890
she was very important to me,

936
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,620
but it's in the past.

937
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,980
Is it?

938
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,060
Maybe, Yu Le.

939
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,860
Every time I see you with Xitian,

940
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,470
even if I'm jealous,

941
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,340
I dare not say anything or be angry.

942
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,540
Do you know why?

943
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,740
Because our beginning is not simple.

944
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,660
No matter

945
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,820
why we were together,

946
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,980
it doesn't matter now.

947
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,790
I just want to...

948
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,840
[Xitian]

949
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,620
Answer it.

950
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,850
Yu Le.

951
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,900
I came back to get something.

952
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,090
They found me.

953
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,420
I'm stuck upstairs.

954
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,020
Go now.

955
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,300
Wait for me.

956
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,380
Why did he go out?

957
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,820
Something happened to Xitian.

958
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,660
What?

959
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,980
The live stream is about to start. How can he leave?

960
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
I'll find him for you.

961
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,580
Qi.

962
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,620
Forget it.

963
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,460
No.

964
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,140
I’m here to stop it.

965
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,060
Yu Le,

966
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,640
do you know what you are doing?

967
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,380
I know.

968
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,580
Then why are you leaving?

969
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
What if you don't come back before the live stream?

970
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,980
How can you let Xining

971
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,980
face the netizens alone?

972
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,450
I'll be back before the live stream.

973
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:22,980
What if?

974
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,460
What if you don't come back?

975
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,500
Do you think Sun Xitian will let you go back

976
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,630
after you get there?

977
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,740
She wants you to break up.

978
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,060
Xitian is not that kind of person.

979
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,940
Qi,

980
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,190
when I was training abroad,

981
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,880
there were many times I couldn't hold on.

982
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,380
It was Xitian who accompanied me

983
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,540
during the hardest time for me.

984
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,250
I can't stand by

985
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,380
when she needs help.

986
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,280
Are you stupid?

987
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,620
She did that because she knew you would do this.

988
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,500
Now I suspect that

989
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,060
she was the one who exposed the contract.

990
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,790
I know you and Xining are close.

991
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,940
You care about her,

992
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,980
but please don't slander others.

993
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,460
Forget it. I've got to go.

994
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,540
Go back with me now.

995
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,500
You can find her.

996
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,860
You can find her after the live stream.

997
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,020
No, she's in danger.

998
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,620
I'm afraid something might happen to her if I don't go.

999
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,540
Call the police if anything happens.

1000
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,060
Call 120 if she doesn't feel well.

1001
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,980
Are you a police officer or a doctor?

1002
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,100
It's none of your business.

1003
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,500
What?

1004
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,430
[Xitian]

1005
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,840
Say sorry to Xining for me.

1006
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,500
I'll be back before the live stream.

1007
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,180
Yu Le.

1008
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,460
Yu Le.

1009
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,420
Yu Le.

1010
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,420
Yu Le.

1011
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,130
Yu...

1012
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,100
[Yu Le]

1013
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,740
You can't stop him.

1014
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,380
Give up.
