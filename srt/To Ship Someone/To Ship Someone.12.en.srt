[To Ship Someone]

[Episode 12]

4
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,780
When I was young, I couldn't understand

5
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,500
why the little mermaid

6
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,180
couldn't be with the prince.

7
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,420
After I grew up,

8
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,860
I realized what I wanted to change

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
was not the ending of the story.

10
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,860
If I were her,

11
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
I wouldn't exchange my beautiful voice

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,100
for a pair of legs.

13
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,420
She relinquished the right to choose

14
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,940
and couldn't talk anymore.

15
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,740
That's silly.

16
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,940
Then what would you do

17
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,600
if you were her?

18
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,740
I'd want the prince to love me for who I am.

19
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,020
If he couldn't accept the true me, end of the story.

20
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,220
In that way,

21
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,660
readers wouldn't feel sorry for me.

22
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,390
They'd think

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,700
that he was not worth it.

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,380
Well,

25
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,940
our opinion

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,700
on the same thing

27
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,420
changes as we grow up.

28
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,940
Yeah.

29
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,260
Now in retrospect,

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,060
the so-called sufferings

31
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,420
were actually

32
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,940
not a big deal.

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm grateful for those hardships.

34
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Without them,

35
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,270
I wouldn't have become better.

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,620
Better?

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,180
Yes.

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,660
Mr. Ji.

39
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,950
You're a famous writer who everyone admires now.

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,630
You must have become much better than before.

41
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,900
Are you sure?

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,700
Yes.

43
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,780
When I was young, I wondered

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,620
why everyone else had parents but I didn't.

45
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,100
My grandma told me

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,620
that before we come to the world,

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,370
God will show us

48
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,220
different scripts of life

49
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,900
and let us choose.

50
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,620
Life is full of hardships,

51
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,900
but

52
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,220
there is always a reason for you

53
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,900
to choose a certain script.

54
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,750
Have you found that reason?

55
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,180
Yeah.

56
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,780
I grew up surrounded by love.

57
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,060
My life is not perfect but I'm happy.

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,940
I never bother to wonder

59
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
what other people's lives are like.

60
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,820
I know they must have their ups and downs too.

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,260
Why are you laughing?

62
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,710
Nothing.

63
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,380
Now I see why you called yourself a spiritual guru.

64
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,500
Then did you find my words

65
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,940
inspirational?

66
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,940
Yeah.

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,900
When fate takes something from us,

68
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,060
it'll compensate us

69
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,780
in another way.

70
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,380
Ji Shu,

71
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,060
do keep those words in mind.

72
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,060
Now I feel

73
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,940
that there's a halo above my head.

74
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,620
You mean you're a saint.

75
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,500
Angel. I'm an angel!

76
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,260
I've never heard

77
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,880
anyone calling themselves an angel.

78
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,540
Mr. Ji, as a saint,

79
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,140
no, an angel, I have a piece of advice for you.

80
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,070
Confidence does you much more good than diffidence.

81
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,820
Angel Song, get up.

82
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,990
Time to go back. The mortals will be off work soon.

83
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,630
Ji Shu, this is for you.

84
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,700
Even if you haven't found that reason,

85
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,360
you must believe in yourself.

86
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,770
It's a lame gift.

87
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,940
It's not a gift but a reward.

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,659
A reward?

89
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,580
When a kindergarten kid falls,

90
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,140
the teacher will give him a reward

91
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,700
to encourage him to stand up

92
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,780
and move forward.

93
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,700
So you're taking me as a kid?

94
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,780
Dear Ji,

95
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,880
make yourself worth this reward.

96
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,740
I'll give you something too.

97
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,310
I'd like to have that starfish.

98
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,100
A stone?

99
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,720
Why did you give me a stone?

100
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
It looks like you.

101
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,780
Not that bad.

102
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,860
I'll take it as a compliment.

103
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,470
But you look like a stone more than I do.

104
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:33,900
Let's go.

105
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,970
Mr. Ji,

106
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,740
can you get up a little bit late?

107
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,020
Why?

108
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,100
Because you got up too early.

109
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,090
What should we do about it?

110
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,850
It's spraying water.

111
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,780
Why don't we keep it?

112
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,790
-Are you done? -Yes.

113
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,350
Let's go.

114
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,270
Look, that Border Collie looks just like you.

115
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,150
Black and white.

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,460
And smart.

117
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,040
Ji Shu.

118
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,670
Yeah?

119
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,380
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,830
For what?

121
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,120
About that flash drive,

122
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,500
you've long recognized me, right?

123
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Yes.

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,760
I know I can't change what's happened

125
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,900
and damage has been done.

126
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,430
I shouldn't make excuses…

127
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,260
Song Yanqi.

128
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,220
Did you know me and Shan Hang back then?

129
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,050
Since you didn't know us,

130
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,530
why would I blame you?

131
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,320
After all, you didn't know what was going on.

132
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,990
But,

133
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,420
that matter back then…

134
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,560
You told me

135
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,910
to remember what I said.

136
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,420
What?

137
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,470
If fate takes something from me,

138
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
it'll make it up to me in another way.

139
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,220
What do you mean?

140
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,360
I think

141
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,159
I know the reason

142
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,350
why I chose this life script.

143
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,870
What is it?

144
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,909
Take a guess.

145
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,320
Ji Shu,

146
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,540
you can't leave me dangling.

147
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,320
You read so many novels.

148
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,170
Can't you read between the lines?

149
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,400
What does it have to do with reading novels?

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,780
No.

151
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,200
You just told me half the story.

152
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
How can I understand?

153
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,870
It's fine that you can't.

154
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,330
Let bygones be bygones.

155
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,520
Forget it.

156
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,210
Fine. Forget it.

157
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,770
I'll go back now.

158
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,250
No matter what the result is,

159
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,410
I'll face it with you.

160
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,220
Good night.

161
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,070
Good night.

162
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,640
What does he mean?

163
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,230
Read between the lines?

164
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,280
How did it go?

165
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,010
Ji Shu almost fell apart.

166
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,680
I talked him

167
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,240
out of giving up his life.

168
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,560
Don't flatter yourself.

169
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,920
Ji is cold sometimes,

170
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,940
but he'll in no way commit suicide.

171
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,370
Shut up.

172
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,370
Only I can be mean to my bestie.

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,660
He's fine now,

174
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,380
but I'm in big trouble.

175
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,900
Now the company is making cutbacks.

176
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,500
I'll certainly get laid off.

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,450
Ji Shu stopped writing.

178
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,560
I think my career

179
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,420
will be ruined because of him too.

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,170
Is it that serious?

181
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,180
-Yes! -Yes!

182
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,570
I've found the evidence.

183
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,710
[Qin Hai]

184
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,290
I made a friend on the internet

185
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,690
who is an awesome hacker.

186
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,270
Yesterday, I asked him to look into

187
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,470
the IP address for me.

188
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,790
He's found something.

189
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,640
What is this?

190
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,790
He said he had a hunch

191
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,510
that the IP address was a smokescreen.

192
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,020
He tracked it down

193
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,660
and found

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,890
more than one real IP address.

195
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,120
He felt something was wrong,

196
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,420
so he kept investigating.

197
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,020
Then what?

198
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,780
He found that things were more complicated.

199
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,300
The real IP address

200
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,600
is located in more than ten places in Qin Hai.

201
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,250
[Qin Hai]

202
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,170
What does that mean?

203
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,200
In short,

204
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,880
we can compare

205
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,210
Song Yanqi's IP address

206
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,310
with the IP address

207
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,170
of that abnormal account to prove

208
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,420
that she's innocent

209
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,610
and Ji didn't plagiarize.

210
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,780
Great!

211
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,500
Send it to me now.

212
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,640
I'll send it over.

213
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,060
Yeah.

214
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,400
I'll ask the official account to post it

215
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,500
together with the lawyer's statement.

216
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,380
By the way, Qi,

217
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,440
I've sent you the video you asked for.

218
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,220
Love you.

219
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,160
[Song Yanqi]

220
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,050
Hello, Mr. Ji.

221
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,310
Hello, Ji Shu.

222
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,410
Hi, dear author.

223
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,950
Ji Shu.

224
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,790
Hello, Ji Shu.

225
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,010
I've been your fan for seven years.

226
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,940
I won't say much.

227
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,830
You know you always have my support.

228
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,720
I love your novels.

229
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,520
Although they are full of drama,

230
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,540
many things you said

231
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,880
are very inspirational.

232
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,440
Who says no one likes soppy novels?

233
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,280
I do.

234
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,420
It drives me crazy that it always takes you ages

235
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,550
to reply to my messages.

236
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,900
I've been worried about you lately,

237
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,490
but I know that you can make it through.

238
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,800
I'm sorry for not standing up

239
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,400
for you in college.

240
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,530
If I had known

241
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,540
what happened,

242
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,140
I might have been able to help.

243
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,520
Actually, I've always believed

244
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,820
that you wouldn't plagiarize.

245
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,390
I know what kind of person you are.

246
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,300
Well, can you consider starting writing again?

247
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,530
I remember a role in your novel said

248
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,790
that life is full of hardships

249
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,420
and one can only count on oneself.

250
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,940
You're a successful writer now.

251
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,280
We're happy for you.

252
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,040
Buck up.

253
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,920
Buck up.

254
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,690
I've always got your back, bro.

255
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,380
[Song Yanqi]

256
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,560
All this time,

257
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,750
I've been using my way of thinking

258
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,050
to understand others,

259
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,070
which led to me saying

260
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,170
and doing things that hurt your feelings

261
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,480
when I didn't even know the whole story.

262
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,200
Mr. Ji.

263
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,930
I won't write fan fiction anymore.

264
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,730
I'll respect your ending of the story.

265
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,300
Also, I'm sorry for what happened in college and recently.

266
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,110
Can you forgive me?

267
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,960
Has he watched the video or not?

268
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,640
Probably not.

269
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,200
It usually takes him ages

270
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,670
to reply to my work messages.

271
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,420
Be patient.

272
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,690
I think this matter is not that simple.

273
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,290
Ji asked me

274
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,650
to look into the fan fiction website Qi used.

275
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,850
You can never imagine

276
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,300
who is behind that website.

277
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,430
-Who? -Who?

278
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,960
Shan Hang.

279
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,040
Shan Hang?

280
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,890
He works as a programmer in our company.

281
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,280
Do you mean

282
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,300
he was involved in this matter?

283
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,560
I have no evidence now.

284
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,070
But it's very likely.

285
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,740
I have to keep investigating.

286
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,760
Why hasn't he replied?

287
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,650
Is he mad at me for making this video

288
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,660
without telling him?

289
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,840
Don't worry.

290
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,230
I don't think so.

291
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
How can I not worry?

292
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,670
Both plagiarism scandals are related to me.

293
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,150
I bet he doesn't want to talk to me now.

294
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,930
But we were fine yesterday.

295
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,770
Why…

296
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,960
You're just overthinking.

297
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,760
Worry about yourself now.

298
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,650
You're going to lose your job.

299
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,520
Although Ji Shu is temperamental

300
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,780
and sharp-tongued,

301
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,580
he's great in many other ways.

302
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,600
He's rich and handsome.

303
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,400
He's such a good man.

304
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,310
You can't just want his novel.

305
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,470
What do you mean?

306
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,080
If you really feel sorry,

307
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,290
you should give yourself to him.

308
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,290
What do you think?

309
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,360
If fate takes something from me,

310
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,550
it will make it up to me in another way.

311
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,910
No way! Out of the question!

312
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,890
As you said, he's moody

313
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,770
and sharp-tongued,

314
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,280
and it takes him ages to reply to messages.

315
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,910
If…

316
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,520
I mean, if we were together,

317
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,650
I might text him for help

318
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,790
when I'm in danger

319
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,510
but get no reply at all.

320
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,430
What should I do then?

321
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,650
Don't psych yourself out.

322
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,490
Song Yanqi.

323
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,130
This is not you!

324
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,000
You always look at the good side of things.

325
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,460
He's an exception.

326
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,130
Find a way to ask Ji Shu out.

327
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,760
You heard me?

328
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,550
Yes.

329
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,650
It means he's special.

330
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,830
Think about it.

331
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,310
As long as a man has two things,

332
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,880
anything he does can be forgiven.

333
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,680
What are they?

334
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,040
Treat me to dinner. Then I'll tell you.

335
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,010
No matter how downhearted you are,

336
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,310
you can't kill yourself.

337
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,190
I won't.

338
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,200
I saw it.

339
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,880
You kept walking towards the sea.

340
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,610
I'm not as fragile as you think.

341
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,150
Let go.

342
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,470
Why am I thinking about her?

343
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:24,920
Xingxing.

344
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,400
Now that you've eaten your fill and drunk your fill,

345
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,160
tell me.

346
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,860
One is money, the other is a pretty face.

347
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,690
He has both.

348
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,670
Are you sure you don't want

349
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,900
to be with such a perfect man?

350
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,620
Why don't you pursue him?

351
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,770
Do you want Lu Qiyu to end up behind bars

352
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,910
for murdering his romantic rival?

353
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,660
Forget I asked.

354
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,660
If you had been to Ji Shu's place with me…

355
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,680
Good for you, Song Yanqi.

356
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,530
He brought you home

357
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,830
soon after you met.

358
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,510
Did you do it?

359
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,310
Was he good?

360
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,270
What are you thinking?

361
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,030
I mean…

362
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,290
That's not the point.

363
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,630
The point is that he lives like an old man.

364
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,270
He doesn't even have a sofa.

365
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,940
Can you imagine that? It's scary.

366
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,000
Men need to be changed.

367
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,550
No man is perfect.

368
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,690
Don't you agree?

369
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,609
Stop making fun of me.

370
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,589
He won't

371
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,660
even reply to my messages.

372
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,260
Perhaps he's thinking about blacklisting me.

373
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,880
You said you were good yesterday.

374
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,069
We're both adults.

375
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,910
Perhaps he was just keeping up appearances.

376
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,260
Hey.

377
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,120
Hello.

378
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,840
Ji,

379
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,480
come and pick me up.

380
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,620
Did you fight again?

381
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,960
Yeah.

382
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,800
Fu Xingxing.

383
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,570
Fu Xingxing is so bad.

384
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,980
She kicked me out.

385
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,830
Go find a hotel.

386
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,140
No, Ji.

387
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,940
We've been friends for so many years.

388
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,660
Without me…

389
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,230
We've been through thick and thin.

390
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,780
I never complained about how mean you were to me at times.

391
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,270
Now,

392
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,950
even Fu Xingxing

393
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,510
is not as important as you.

394
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,020
How could you turn me down?

395
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,410
I have no money with me.

396
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,790
I only have 7.75 yuan on WeChat

397
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,310
and not a dime on Alipay.

398
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,480
I can't afford a hotel room.

399
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,530
You can borrow money on Alipay.

400
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,640
I didn't bring my ID card with me.

401
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,950
You can apply for a digital one on Alipay.

402
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,680
I can't remember my ID number.

403
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,890
Lu Qiyu.

404
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,570
What?

405
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,750
You're acting crazy

406
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,910
and I suggest you do it in front of Fu Xingxing.

407
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,990
Fine. I'll be honest with you.

408
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,070
Song Yanqi

409
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,050
hasn't gotten your reply yet

410
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,890
and is worried that you may be angry again.

411
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,090
She feels so contrite

412
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,420
that she almost drank all the wine in the restaurant.

413
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,550
Send me the address.

414
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,900
I'm so disappointed in you.

415
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,360
I'll text you the address.

416
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,080
Slow down.

417
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,560
No one will take care of you if you get drunk.

418
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,150
I…

419
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,090
I don't need to be taken care of.

420
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
So disappointed!

421
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,900
My girl is the best.

422
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,820
Xingxing.

423
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,080
Have some too.

424
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,740
Please, guys!

425
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,500
You're not alone!

426
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,980
We just want to stimulate you

427
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,320
to find a boyfriend.

428
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,640
You can't wait

429
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,370
to make a public display of affection too, right?

430
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,800
Just go get Ji Shu.

431
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,690
You know what?

432
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,580
I can't wait to put you two

433
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,730
in a washing machine.

434
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,330
Disgusting lovers!

435
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,080
Has he

436
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,480
watched the video or not?

437
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,460
It's been so long.

438
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,140
He can't be so busy.

439
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,490
You mean,

440
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,970
he saw my messages

441
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,610
but chose not to reply.

442
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,870
Why?

443
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,920
Why?

444
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,480
Ask him.

445
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,410
Call him or text him.

446
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,650
I dare not.

447
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,720
You're single for a good reason.

448
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,670
You long for a relationship

449
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,270
but look at you.

450
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,720
You never make any effort to get it.

451
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,850
Are you content with

452
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,080
just watching others in love?

453
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,650
I…

454
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,020
What are you talking about?

455
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,430
What are you thinking?

456
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,360
Look at you.

457
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,960
You know what an adult relationship is all about.

458
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,230
You've learned so much from novels.

459
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,670
Why don't you apply it in real life?

460
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,640
The novels I thought about,

461
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,230
wrote,

462
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,870
and read are even less racy than this beer.

463
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,180
Wiseman doesn't fall in love.

464
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,250
So you prefer reading love stories to being in love.

465
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,190
I'm single because I'm able to stay single.

466
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,720
Xingxing, leave her alone.

467
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,410
She has Ji, doesn't she?

468
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,020
I have nothing to do with him.

469
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,830
He's going to blacklist me.

470
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,510
I…

471
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,030
I doubt that.

472
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,000
Someone was so cold to his best friend

473
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,260
but changed his attitude

474
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,120
once he learned that you're here.

475
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,650
Look. He came so quickly.

476
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,730
He...

477
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,290
He looks like Ji Shu.

478
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,500
I am Ji Shu.

479
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,310
Well, we gotta go.

480
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,930
Take your time.

481
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,730
Ji Shu.

482
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,310
The guy in my imagination actually feels warm!

483
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,970
You put beer in a thermos cup?

484
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,270
You're smart.

485
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,320
Take it.

486
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,100
It's not beer.

487
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,270
This is tea.

488
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,330
Tease?

489
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,030
Who teased him? Who teased him?

490
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,490
This…

491
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,590
I don't drink this.

492
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,980
I drink beer.

493
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,960
Why did you drink so much?

494
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,750
Why did you show up here without texting me back?

495
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,020
Forget it.

496
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,480
It's fine.

497
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,540
I shouldn't care about you.

498
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,590
You're drunk. I'll send you home.

499
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,820
Let's go.

500
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,090
Let me get you home.

501
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,190
I'm not drunk.

502
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,990
I just started drinking!

503
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,420
Anyone who wants to drink with me?

504
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,520
Xingxing. Xingxing.

505
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,620
Where is Xingxing?

506
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,790
She's in the sky.

507
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,420
She's left.

508
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,680
I'll make a wish to her.

509
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,200
Mr. Ji, please reply to me.

510
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,580
Please forgive me.

511
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,000
Please! Please!

512
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,990
Please text me back, Mr. Ji.

513
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,780
Please.

514
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
Check your phone.

515
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,450
[I forgive you.]

516
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,850
My wish came true.

517
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,980
I…

518
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,240
He…

519
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,940
Mr. Ji replied.

520
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,990
J-Ji…

521
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,670
Mr. Ji replied.

522
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,260
-I… -Come down.

523
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,940
Mr. Ji replied.

524
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,920
He replied.

525
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,660
-Mr. Ji replied. -I'll pay for the bill.

526
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,960
Good night.

527
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll get you home.

528
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,470
Which home?

529
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,270
How many homes do you have?

530
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,420
Two.

531
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,860
Let me tell you a secret.

532
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,310
I got a new home recently.

533
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,530
What is this new home like?

534
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,540
Cozy.

535
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,310
And?

536
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,570
Warm.

537
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,070
That's all?

538
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,010
It's not here.

539
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,740
It's in another world.

540
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,930
Do you believe me?

541
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,310
Yes.

542
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,710
Song Yanqi.

543
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,780
Why do you insist on changing the plots?

544
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,800
You just want to give the characters

545
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,810
a good ending?

546
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,070
Why?

547
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,570
Do you know the word "emo"?

548
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,980
A kind of rock music?

549
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,290
I knew you didn't know!

550
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,640
Emo means sad and depressed.

551
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,580
It means all the bad emotions.

552
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,600
Everyone gets emo now and then.

553
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,040
What does it have to do

554
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,900
with the plots?

555
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,530
Sadness is a devil.

556
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,260
I'm the knight who will defeat the devil.

557
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,740
Get away!

558
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,280
I still don't get it.

559
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,180
My grandma said

560
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,040
that life is short.

561
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,720
You can spend your time moping

562
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,780
or just having fun.

563
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,800
Why should we make things hard for ourselves?

564
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,740
So, I want to defeat sadness!

565
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,460
Also,

566
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,280
your novel is so dramatic.

567
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,800
Life is not that dramatic.

568
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,850
Life is more dramatic.

569
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,160
Being sad is easy,

570
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,430
but staying upbeat is hard.

571
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,280
Why should we

572
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,960
keep doing the easy thing?

573
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,350
Why can't we challenge ourselves?

574
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,260
Do you remember the way home?

575
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,770
Over there.

576
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,860
There's a bus stop.

577
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,780
I…

578
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,690
I live just four stops away.

579
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,380
Can you go back by yourself?

580
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,480
Yes.

581
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,790
Try it.

582
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,280
Song Yanqi.

583
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,060
What are you doing?

584
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:53,760
You're rich, handsome, and have a car and a house.

585
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,700
You are quite good.

586
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,770
If only you can smile more often.

587
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,970
You must

588
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,450
love the characters in your novel very much,

589
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,300
or you wouldn't have created them.

590
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,850
Why do I feel

591
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,850
that you don't love your work at all?

592
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,060
What is love?

593
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,920
I never thought my novel would be popular.

594
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,460
I never take it as a product.

595
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
It's just a bad method

596
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,190
I used to treat my illness.

597
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,250
You're sick?

598
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,490
I can cure you.

599
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,710
Healing others is my specialty.

600
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,490
My grandma said I could cure any sick people.

601
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,860
Your grandma was right.

602
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,490
Of course.

603
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,360
Do you know why I wrote fan fiction?

604
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,000
People always say that life is cruel

605
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,030
and true love is only young people's fantasy.

606
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,160
But I think

607
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,240
anyone who loves wholeheartedly deserves a happy ending.

608
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,010
So,

609
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
you want to give them a happy ending?

610
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,720
I have something to tell you.

611
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,650
What's it?

612
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,240
Oh, sorry.

613
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,310
I'm Ji Shu in the novel's world.

614
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,760
Song Yanqi.

615
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,080
Song Yanqi.

616
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,950
Song Yanqi.

617
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,000
Song Yanqi!

618
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,330
Ji Shu, you damn author.

619
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,730
You separated my favorite couple.

620
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,920
Don't…

621
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,640
Don't take off my shoes.

622
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,250
I'm home.

623
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,870
Where is my sofa?

624
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,170
Sofa.

625
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,260
I…

626
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,210
Don't…

627
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,510
-Don't go. -Let go.

628
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,460
Ji Shu,

629
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,940
what is your illness? I can cure it.

630
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,040
Ji Shu, don't go.

631
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,430
Don't go!

632
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,240
Don't go!

633
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,710
Song Yanqi, let go!

634
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,720
If you don't tell me,

635
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,650
I won't release you.

636
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,460
You look right as rain.

637
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,730
How is it possible that you're sick?

638
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,480
I…

639
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,590
Song Yanqi, let go!

640
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,920
I'll bite the virus off.

641
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,220
I'll know after one bite.

642
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,300
Ji Shu.

643
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,770
Don't go!

644
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,420
Ji Shu.

645
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,380
Don't go!

646
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,090
Song Yanqi.

647
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,190
Something bit me.

648
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,590
The pillow is so hard.

649
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,310
Song Yanqi!

650
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,500
I need to use the toilet. Get out!

651
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,590
Go out!

652
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,350
Go out?

653
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,690
This is my toilet.

654
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,330
You can't hog it!

655
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,250
Come out!

656
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,720
You hog my bathroom

657
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,580
and want me to sleep on the street.

658
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,580
Come out!

659
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,110
-Get out! -I'm warning you.

660
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Song Yanqi, let go!

661
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,570
God, is this real?

662
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,990
A naked hottie in my bathroom?

663
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,920
Let go!

664
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,230
Song Yanqi, get out!

665
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,950
This is my dream.

666
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,920
I can do whatever I want.

667
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,520
-What do you want? -Revenge.

668
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,010
Don't go.

669
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,770
He just disappeared?

670
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,690
Toilet.

671
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,710
Why is the bed getting harder and harder?

672
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,120
Mr. Ji.

673
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,820
Where am I?

674
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,670
My place.

675
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,699
Your place?

676
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,190
Why am I here?

677
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,400
Didn't happen.

678
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,320
280.

679
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,150
The blanket.

680
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,640
You mean the cleaning fee is 280 yuan?

681
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,010
What else could it be?

682
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,860
The accommodation fee?

683
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,170
Why am I at your place?

684
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,180
You forgot?

685
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,350
I was drinking with Fu Xingxing and…

686
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:22,790
You're rich, handsome, and have a car and a house.

687
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,600
If only you smile more often.

688
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:34,840
Song Yanqi.

689
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,360
What did you do?

690
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,840
Tea can help with hangovers.

691
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,600
Use this cup.

692
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,230
I'm sorry.

693
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,910
Sorry about last night.

694
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,840
Did I say anything I shouldn't say?

695
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,270
Lots.

696
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,380
No matter what I said,

697
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,650
I was drunk and not thinking straight.

698
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,240
Don't take them seriously.

699
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,430
I think alcohol made you honest.

700
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,390
No!

701
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,280
I talk nonsense when I'm drunk.

702
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,550
You said I separated your favorite couple.

703
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,270
And,

704
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,780
that my novel sucks.

705
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,990
You said you were a big fool

706
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,290
to have bought the copyright.

707
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,750
You also called me the damn author.

708
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,890
That sounds like what I'd say.

709
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,760
I couldn't have said that.

710
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,850
Song Yanqi.

711
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,700
Stop denying it.

712
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,940
Don't think too much.

713
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,560
You haven't

714
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,330
moved on from that matter?

715
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,350
In this world,

716
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,240
there is no such thing as perfection.

717
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,880
Perfect things

718
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,620
only exist in fairy tales and imagination.

719
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,180
A reader of yours

720
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,790
said that your novel is like poison coated with sugar.

721
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,580
Your readers are tempted to eat it

722
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,080
and find that cruel reality is at its core

723
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,610
after the sugar melts.

724
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,260
If they swallow it, they'll become realistic.

725
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,700
If they spit it out,

726
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,570
the remnant of the poison will torture them slowly

727
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,370
until they become realistic.

728
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:23,960
But

729
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,620
why can't there be a third choice?

730
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,270
It can be a candy from the very beginning.

731
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,060
Only someone who has tasted candy can have a third choice.

732
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,140
No.

733
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,870
Everyone can.

734
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,630
I don't eat candy,

735
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,270
but I want to be a candy.

736
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,670
I'll get going, Mr. Ji.

737
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,560
If

738
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,350
my story is still a tragedy,

739
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,290
do you want to continue?

740
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,530
I don't care very much

741
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,380
whether it's a tragedy or a comedy.

742
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,180
Life is full of ups and downs.

743
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,130
Why can't you be easy on yourself and others

744
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,470
in that world?

745
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,540
That's self-deception.

746
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,080
People in modern society

747
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,680
are better at breaking up than falling in love.

748
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,340
Many people think the road less traveled

749
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,930
is the wrong road

750
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,380
and not worth taking.

751
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,500
But what if it's the right road for you?

752
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,400
The right road can turn out to be the wrong road.

753
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,310
You need to travel it yourself

754
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,240
to see whether it's right or wrong.

755
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,760
You can't turn life into a tragedy

756
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,350
just because you think it's a tragedy.

757
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,240
Song Yanqi.

758
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,270
What do you think is love?

759
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Romantic dramas?

760
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,770
They're just reality

761
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,870
with countless filters.

762
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,520
Then what's the reason

763
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,080
you wrote novels?

764
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,100
To manipulate other people's lives

765
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,630
with your joys and sorrows?

766
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,180
Song Yanqi.

767
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,790
There's no empathy in this world.

768
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,590
When life is not plain,

769
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,820
it's disastrous and treacherous.

770
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,370
I don't eat candy,

771
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,020
but I want to be a candy.

772
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,570
Hey, Xingxing.

773
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,920
How could you leave without me last night?

774
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,810
Did Ji Shu abandon you?

775
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,630
You called him there?

776
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,860
You are indeed my best friend.

777
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,210
You're welcome.

778
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,140
That's what best friends do.

779
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,960
You didn't come home last night. How did it go?

780
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,600
How far did you go?

781
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,770
Fu Xingxing.

782
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm trying so hard not to swear right now.

783
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,380
You didn't enjoy yourself?

784
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,290
What are you thinking?

785
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,440
Sex, obviously.

786
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,290
I hate you!

787
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,830
What's it?

788
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,310
I passed out last night.

789
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,740
What could I do?

790
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,950
Then where did you sleep last night?

791
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,290
His place.

792
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,050
His place?

793
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,470
I slept on the floor.

794
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,510
On the floor?

795
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,050
Really? You slept on the floor?

796
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,280
Qi,

797
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,080
you slept over at his place.

798
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,950
It's already progress.

799
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,650
Seize the chance and get him.

800
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,530
Understand?

801
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,070
Get him?

802
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,130
I'll get you beaten up first!

803
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,890
Wait and see.

804
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,780
Qi.

805
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,340
Mr. Jia came here several times

806
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,470
and asked to see you.

807
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,770
I'll meet him right now.

808
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,540
Where's Lin Qingmiao?

809
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,260
She went to the platform for a meeting.

810
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,130
It seems this is my last day working here.

811
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,600
Don't say that.

812
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,590
I'll miss you.

813
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,620
Mr. Jia, this is the layoff list.

814
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,680
Please take a look.

815
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,800
Okay. You may leave.

816
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,260
Okay.

817
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,530
Mr. Jia,

818
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,250
An Jing has taken over most of my work.

819
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,690
Do you still want to work on Bright Than Stars?
