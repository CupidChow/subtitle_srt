Let's get off work.

191
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,220
You must have a problem with your mind if you don't get off work on time.

192
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,340
It's time?

193
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,210
Bye, Qi.

194
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,710
Wait for me.

195
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,460
Have you finished your work?

196
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm gonna go. Bye.

197
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,450
Bye.

198
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,330
Homeless.

199
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,820
No money. No ID card.

200
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,340
I can't even go back.

201
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,060
Am I going to wander here?

202
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,090
No.

203
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,020
Next time when I go back,

204
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,360
I'll make myself a character of a rich kid

205
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,970
living in a big villa

206
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,160
and owning a yacht.

207
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,850
Then I can focus on shipping others.

208
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,740
You…

209
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,340
Mr. Ji, you can leave.

210
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,640
I still have work to do.

211
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,170
Mr. Ji, anything I can do for you?

212
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,780
I want to ask

213
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,730
how can you go back?

214
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,250
Go back. Go home?

215
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,980
Yes.

216
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,580
By bus, subway, or bicycle.

217
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,150
That's not what I meant.

218
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,780
I mean

219
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,730
if you go to a place

220
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,970
normally you can't go,

221
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,630
how can you go back from there?

222
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,180
Mr. Ji,

223
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,580
where's the place that can't be reached in a normal situation?

224
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,460
Since you can't get there,

225
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
how can you go and how can you go back?

226
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,980
I'm asking you.

227
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,500
Mr. Ji,

228
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,290
since you're asking me,

229
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,930
you have to tell me where it is

230
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,340
so that I can help you.

231
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,900
Don't bother.

232
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,590
Forget I asked.

233
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,330
[Employee Information Form]

234
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,450
[Employee Information Form]

235
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,260
You joined the company in March this year?

236
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,820
Yes, March.

237
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,780
Song Yanqi.

238
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,110
[Employee Information Form]

239
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,860
How come you didn't realize

240
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,260
he was tricking you?

241
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,770
Move!

242
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,540
Let me see if you are hurt.

243
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,300
Yu Le.

244
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,420
Oh no.

245
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,580
I forgot such an important plot.

246
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,270
Hello, Xining.

247
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Where are you now?

248
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

249
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,780
Am I hallucinating?

250
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,040
I must have seen the wrong person.

251
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,050
Why is he everywhere?

252
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,420
What a coincidence.

253
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,500
Mr. Ji.

254
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,900
What a coincidence.

255
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,300
Mr. Ji, are you here to buy snacks?

256
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Not for me.

257
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,860
Then what are you…

258
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,300
I'm going to visit someone.

259
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,980
Visit?

260
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,380
Visit whom?

261
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,650
Whom do you think I'm going to visit?

262
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,290
Of course it's Ziheng.

263
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,170
Take your time. I'm gonna go.

264
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,060
Well, Mr. Ji,

265
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,050
as the president,

266
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,060
you can let your assistant do this.

267
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,380
You should be sitting in the car.

268
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,839
I'm capable of doing this.

269
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,700
Why can't I do it myself?

270
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,380
Sure, go ahead.

271
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,290
I heard that Ziheng's team and Yu Le's team

272
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,220
sit quite close.

273
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,580
You've bought so many things he's a spokesperson for.

274
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,040
Are you going to visit him?

275
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,220
What do you want?

276
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,220
I thought you would like me

277
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,250
to give you a ride.

278
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,140
Since you don't want to see me,

279
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,000
then forget it.

280
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,130
Okay.

281
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,140
You're so kind and helpful.

282
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,540
I…

283
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,820
I can save the transportation fare then.

284
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,460
Mr. Ji.

285
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,360
What are you doing?

286
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,970
Are you an actor or not?

287
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,010
Can you act?

288
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,700
When you're supposed to look nervous, you put on a poker face.

289
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,850
No matter you should be happy, excited, worried, or scared,

290
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,290
you always put on a poker face.

291
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,500
What are you doing?

292
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,940
Can you act or not?

293
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,530
If you can't act, I'll change someone else.

294
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,330
Come on.

295
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,570
I told you not to use eye candies.

296
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,820
What else can they do apart from dating?

297
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,980
What a day.

298
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,690
I don't understand

299
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,490
what their fans like about them.

300
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,500
There are so many good-looking people.

301
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,160
Seriously.

302
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,490
Xining.

303
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,350
Please comfort my brother.

304
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,690
The more the director scolds him,

305
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,770
the more anxious he is.

306
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,500
I guess he's having a hard time now.

307
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,140
I know.

308
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,580
Qi will be here soon.

309
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,460
Go pick her up.

310
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,970
Okay.

311
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,610
Why are you here?

312
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,140
I'll stay up with you.

313
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,940
Have a seat.

314
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,460
Alright.

315
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,610
Didn't you say that before?

316
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,770
The more you're in a hurry to do something,

317
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,630
the easier you'll make mistakes.

318
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,620
Am I wrong?

319
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,380
Actually, I'm not suitable to be an actor.

320
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,540
Yu Le.

321
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,270
There's no such thing.

322
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,020
It depends on how hard you work on it.

323
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,210
Isn't this the view

324
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,410
you've been holding?

325
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,950
Thank you for the ride, Mr. Ji.

326
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,820
You can visit Wang Ziheng now.

327
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,260
It occurred to me that

328
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,100
I was wrong.

329
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,470
They are not in the same drama.

330
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,020
You...

331
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,010
You scheming supporting actor.

332
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,530
You tricked me step by step.

333
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,490
Wait and see.

334
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,700
Then from here,

335
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,220
the camera will slide like this.

336
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,340
Yu Le,

337
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,420
can you act or not?

338
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,500
The crew paid you for work,

339
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,020
not for dating.

340
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,460
Why did you bring someone else

341
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,300
to the scene?

342
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,330
Can you do the filming?

343
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm sorry, Director.

344
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,540
I came here without telling you.

345
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,850
Yu Le didn't know either.

346
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,220
Sorry to disturb you.

347
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Don't talk about that.

348
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,060
Let me ask you.

349
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,460
Can you do the filming?

350
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,190
Go back if you can't do it today.

351
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,780
Director Qian.

352
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,310
Have some water. Calm down.

353
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,290
Yu Le is a novice actor in the industry.

354
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,060
He needs your guidance.

355
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,290
Everybody, thank you for your hard work today.

356
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,090
You're gonna stay up late tonight. Have something to eat and drink.

357
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,550
Recharge your batteries.

358
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,540
Director, you should take a break too.

359
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,600
Give him some time.

360
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,580
Mr. Ji.

361
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,970
Why didn't you call me

362
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,370
before you came to visit?

363
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,530
I was just passing by.

364
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,220
Can I have a word with you?

365
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,130
Sure.

366
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,760
Please.

367
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,060
Qi, thank you.

368
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,290
Luckily you came in time.

369
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,090
It's nothing.

370
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,900
I'll give out these to them.

371
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,870
There you go.

372
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,530
-Thank you. -Thank you.

373
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,100
Ji Shu…

374
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,690
No.

375
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,530
I...

376
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,090
You bastard supporting actor.

377
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,460
I'll kill you one day.

378
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,580
Mr. Ji.

379
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,060
Mr. Ji.

380
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,290
What's wrong?

381
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,050
Nothing.

382
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,060
Qi didn't do it on purpose.

383
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,100
She has bought so much stuff.

384
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,140
She must have got that mixed up.

385
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,020
Yes, Yu Le.

386
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,530
These are all buy-one-get-one-for-free.

387
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,190
These are expiring products. No one wants them.

388
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,020
For free?

389
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,300
The cashier at the supermarket gave it to me.

390
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,220
I didn't check it carefully.

391
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,260
I'll dump them.

392
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,610
Mr. Ji said

393
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,040
you majored in ballet.

394
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:41,990
Yes, Director.

395
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,660
I'm

396
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,380
planning on an art movie.

397
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,090
The heroine in the movie

398
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,340
has also learned dancing like you.

399
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,100
I know.

400
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,370
I've been following your works.

401
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
I like

402
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,780
many of your works.

403
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,140
Are you interested in having an audition?

404
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,340
Thank you, Director.

405
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,570
You're welcome.

406
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,700
If you want to thank someone,

407
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,610
thank Mr. Ji.

408
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,580
It's him

409
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,280
who strongly recommended you.

410
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,730
Yu Le,

411
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,690
get ready for the shooting.

412
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,350
Don't make mistakes anymore.

413
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,410
Okay.

414
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,980
Mr. Ji, have a seat.

415
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,920
I'll go prepare for the shooting.

416
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,450
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

417
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,300
You're welcome.

418
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,940
Ye Xining.

419
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,220
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.

420
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,900
Where is Qi?

421
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,850
She went that way.

422
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,290
What's wrong?

423
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,210
Nothing.

424
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,450
Congratulations.

425
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,690
Director Qian is a good director.

426
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,860
What are you congratulating me for?

427
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,120
It's just an audition.

428
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,530
It's not bad.

429
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,480
I'm gonna go.

430
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,820
Good luck.

431
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,420
You bastard supporting actor.

432
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,220
Crap writer.

433
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,980
How dare he mess up with me?

434
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,260
It's too much.

435
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,050
I can't waste them. I…

436
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,090
I can't…

437
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,660
Thank you.

438
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,690
Mr. Ji.

439
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,210
You'll get choked

440
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,250
if you say something bad behind one's back.

441
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,020
I'm not.

442
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,650
I'm saying it openly.

443
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,220
Are you going to

444
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,660
eat all of these by yourself?

445
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,260
So what?

446
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,210
None of your business.

447
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,490
Eating too much snacks

448
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,970
is bad for your health.

449
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,250
How dare you say that?

450
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,050
Who bought these?

451
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,050
I bought them.

452
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,290
Why were they mixed in the bag

453
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,540
I gave to Yu Le?

454
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
My bag was broken.

455
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,060
It's an excuse.

456
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,450
You knew Yu Le doesn't like Wang Ziheng,

457
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,710
so you bought stuff he's a spokesperson for to piss him off.

458
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,250
Childish.

459
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,380
Why do you like them?

460
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,500
Whom?

461
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,290
Ye Xining and Yu Le.

462
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,610
Of course.

463
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,890
It's because of love.

464
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,170
Yu Le is an idol.

465
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,970
When Xining got abused online,

466
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,220
he wasn't afraid of losing fans and didn't deny their relationship.

467
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,610
Instead, he made his relationship public firmly.

468
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,220
I like that courage.

469
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,210
Courage?

470
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,090
Don't you know

471
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,930
he was trying to get rid of more scandals?

472
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,940
Before that,

473
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,180
he had more gossip.

474
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,220
Besides,

475
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,410
how did you know

476
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,150
whether Ye Xining was with him

477
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,920
for anything else?

478
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,900
Mr. Ji,

479
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,050
you are judging others

480
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,370
based on your own presumption.

481
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,630
You won't understand.

482
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,210
What a waste.

483
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,780
Fine.

484
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm wasting it.

485
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,260
This scene

486
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,220
doesn't need any of your emotions.

487
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,140
You just need to show

488
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,210
your profession as a chef.

489
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,650
Okay?

490
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,060
It's a simple scene.

491
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,860
Okay.

492
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,010
Come on, all departments get ready.

493
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,170
What are you doing?

494
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,380
If I say something will happen later,

495
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,330
Mr. Ji, do you believe me?

496
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,900
No matter what happens later,

497
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,180
it has nothing to do with you.

498
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,380
As long as it's related to Yu Le and Xining,

499
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,040
it has something to do with me.

500
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:44,910
Step aside.

501
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,970
Why allowed you to rush out?

502
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,250
Don't you know we're filming?

503
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,090
Director Qian.

504
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,660
She probably saw the fire in the pot,

505
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,570
so she was afraid something bad might happen.

506
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,890
Director Qian, don't be angry.

507
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,330
Qi didn't do it on purpose.

508
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,570
She didn't do it on purpose?

509
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,850
Then who did it on purpose?

510
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,890
How can I shoot tonight

511
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,170
since the scene is messed up?

512
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,030
Director Qian.

513
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,250
She's our employee.

514
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,290
It's indeed

515
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,300
her fault.

516
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,620
But there's water in the kettle.

517
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,260
If Yu Le really had poured it,

518
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,060
it would have been a big trouble.

519
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,620
Director, it's indeed water.

520
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,350
Are you sure?

521
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,300
Yes.

522
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,810
Sorry, Director.

523
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,930
It's all my fault.

524
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,340
I was nervous.

525
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,780
How did you know?

526
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,890
I saw it with my eyes.

527
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,260
Didn't you see it?

528
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,020
Forget it.

529
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,650
As long as everyone's safe.

530
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,420
We can't shoot today.

531
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,220
Director.

532
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,890
I'll take responsibility for today's loss.

533
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,020
Go back to your work.

534
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,560
I'll take her away.

535
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,330
Why did you do that?

536
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,370
It needs no reason for me to help.

537
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:04,810
Mr. Ji,

538
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,170
if you had known something dangerous was going to happen,

539
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,370
you would've done the same.

540
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,780
If you hadn't done anything and someone got hurt,

541
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,730
would you like to see that?

542
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,660
How is the wound

543
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,850
on your hand?

544
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,710
It's just a minor injury. I'm fine.

545
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,890
There are no pharmacies nearby.

546
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,570
Take care of it when you get home.

547
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,370
Bye.

548
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,420
Go home.

549
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,650
How can I go home?

550
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,090
It's so late.

551
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,610
I have nowhere to go.

552
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,290
It's so dark and scary.

553
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,100
Where can I go?

554
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,690
What should I do?

555
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,900
Let me send you back.

556
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,250
Mr. Ji.

557
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,140
It's okay.

558
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,270
I can go back myself.

559
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,830
But you don't have a place to stay.

560
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,890
You know it?

561
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,780
It's just I got scammed

562
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,450
on renting an apartment.

563
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,570
Be careful.

564
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,170
Don't get tricked next time.

565
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,970
It's not the real landlord.

566
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,010
It's a sublease.

567
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,660
I was scammed out of three months' worth of rent.

568
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,900
I didn't realize I was cheated

569
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,980
until the real landlord came to collect the rent.

570
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,980
So I got kicked out

571
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,250
because I didn't pay the rent.

572
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,300
So?

573
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,420
So...

574
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,010
So...

575
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,380
Shouldn't a gentlemanly supporting actor

576
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,730
help the poor solve the problem?

577
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,340
You think

578
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,330
you're pitiful?

579
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,540
Am I not?

580
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,570
Now,

581
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,780
I have no money, no car, no house,

582
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,260
and I'm homeless.

583
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,180
You had a car before?

584
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,090
That's not the point.

585
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,570
Then why didn't you call the police?

586
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,690
Because I…

587
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,820
Because I don't have a legal residence permit.

588
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,220
How can I call the police?

589
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,530
I have an empty house.

590
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,300
I can…

591
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,010
What can you do?

592
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,060
I can live there.

593
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,300
I'll rent it to you.

594
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,260
You have to pay at the market price.

595
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,330
Is there an employee discount available?

596
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,330
No.

597
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,650
I have no money now.

598
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,810
Can you deduct it from my salary?

599
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,690
Sure.

600
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,860
Mr. Ji, you're so nice.

601
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,410
You're like one of my relatives,

602
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,010
my mother's son, my brother,

603
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,130
a Disney prince.

604
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,650
I won't watch the drama if you're not the male lead.

605
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,930
Don't flatter yourself.

606
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,330
You as a Disney princess?

607
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,500
What a pity.

608
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,590
In someone's eyes,

609
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,610
I'm just an annoying supporting actor.

610
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,130
How come?

611
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,170
Mr. Ji,

612
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,290
from now on,

613
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,470
you're my male lead.

614
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,870
Looks like all the settings

615
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,340
are the same as my novel.

616
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,570
This house has been vacant.

617
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,900
It has all the necessary home appliances.

618
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,610
Mr. Ji,

619
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,410
you aren't going to say

620
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,570
that you live next door,

621
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,270
are you?

622
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,130
I live next door.

623
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,650
You own both the units on the same floor?

624
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,890
Are you rich people

625
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,420
buying houses like buying stamps?

626
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,810
You don't even live here.

627
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,050
You'll only come when you're in a good mood.

628
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,660
Are you complimenting me or scolding me?

629
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,720
It's a compliment.

630
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,330
Of course.

631
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,140
Compared to you,

632
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,450
the writer is nothing.

633
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,660
Since it's stamp collecting,

634
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,900
I have to keep it well.

635
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,910
I won't rent it.

636
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,260
Mr. Ji, I'm sorry.

637
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,860
You are silent.

638
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,000
I'll take it as your forgiveness.

639
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,060
I annoyed him so much,

640
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,560
but he offers to rent his apartment to me.

641
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,610
Does he really like me?

642
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,890
No way.

643
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,410
Mr. Ji,

644
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,090
it's my business that I like you.

645
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,790
You don't have to respond.

646
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,050
I know there's a huge gap between us.

647
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,810
I expect nothing from this crush.

648
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,810
It just occurred to me that

649
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,530
I have other uses for this apartment.

650
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,650
I decided not to rent it.

651
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,380
Why?

652
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,770
You're right.

653
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,100
I think the gap between us

654
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,420
is really huge.

655
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,950
If we become neighbors,

656
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,250
we will always meet each other.

657
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,460
Then we can't forget each other.

658
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,930
So, let's keep a distance.

659
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,850
Mr. Ji,

660
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,850
I know I was wrong.

661
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,410
I shouldn't give up my love for you

662
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,070
because of a little obstacle.

663
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,220
I've made up my mind.

664
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,060
Even if there are many obstacles between us,

665
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,650
even if the mountain has no ridges and heaven and earth are united,

666
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,050
I'll never part from you.

667
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,530
But I...

668
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,290
No buts.

669
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,250
I like you.

670
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,810
Well,

671
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,500
if you're not busy,

672
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,730
let's sign the contract first.

673
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,050
I won't sign the contract today,

674
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,710
but you can stay here tonight.

675
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

676
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,690
Take care, Mr. Ji. Let me see you off.

677
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,490
Mr. Ji, you're so nice.

678
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,330
You are really handsome and kind.

679
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,850
Are you here for charity?

680
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,810
It's so luxurious.

681
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,780
There's really a huge gap between us.

682
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,130
I'm not comparable to him.

683
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,060
Have a good rest.

684
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,490
Good night.

685
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,090
Wait.

686
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:31,930
Ji Shu.

687
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,850
Why is Ye Xining

688
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,290
with my idol?

689
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,860
Do you want mom to give you a little sister

690
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,990
or a little brother?

691
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,650
Sister.

692
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,690
Okay, sister.

693
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,850
Then give her a name.

694
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,210
Fei.

695
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,170
Okay. Your brother names you Fei.

696
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,290
I'm asking you, Ji Shu.

697
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,460
Ji Fei.

698
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,970
I'm asking you why your artist Ye Xining

699
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,850
is with my idol?

700
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,260
I'm not with Ye Xining.

701
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,010
I mean Yu Le.

702
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,850
Yu Le?

703
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,970
Brother.

704
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,570
You're my brother.

705
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,490
Can you make your artist Ye Xining

706
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,250
leave Yu Le?

707
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,100
Yu Le's career is rising.

708
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,860
It'll get him into trouble if he announces his relationship now.

709
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,370
Do you think I'm an emperor who can dictate others' relationships?

710
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,290
Who are you?

711
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,720
None of your business.

712
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:28,830
I...

713
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,530
Why are you in front of my house?

714
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,970
She's my employee.

715
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,300
I'll let her stay in the other apartment temporarily.

716
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,970
It's legal.

717
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,530
But you're not

718
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,100
my brother's type.

719
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,030
My brother is so handsome.

720
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,900
He won't like you.

721
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,370
Calm down.

722
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,690
Brother,

723
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,730
please separate Ye Xining from Yu Le.

724
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,410
Aren't celebrities not allowed to date?

725
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,380
Didn't you make it clear

726
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,290
when you signed the contract with her?

727
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,940
She's an artist of the company.

728
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,580
She didn't sell herself to the company.

729
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,660
Whatever.

730
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,250
Just make them break up.

731
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,620
How can she be with my idol?

732
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,330
Because it's true love.

733
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:06,690
True love?

734
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,530
Do you know what true love is?

735
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,370
You know?

736
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,100
Ji Fei, you should be tired.

737
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,530
Go to bed early.

738
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,190
What kind of employee are you?

739
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,730
It's no use arguing with your brother.

740
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,330
It's true love between them.

741
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:20,830
He has a sister,

742
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,010
Ji Fei?

743
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,690
Hello, everyone. I'm back.

744
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,290
Stop your work.

745
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,530
Look. I've brought you gifts.

746
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,010
Fei, great!

747
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:35,980
You're finally back.

748
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,969
Finally, someone can gossip with me.

749
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:38,900
I want to ask you.

750
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,090
Someone in the company has had a crush on my brother for ten years.

751
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,010
Really?

752
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,940
Who is it?

753
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,449
It's been ten years.

754
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,530
Well…

755
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,250
You?

756
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,429
You're the one who has had a crush on my brother for ten years.

757
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,060
No wonder you showed up in my house.

758
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,290
No.

759
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,690
It's not what you think.

760
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,550
How old are you?

761
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,210
We should be about the same age.

762
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,470
Maybe we were in the same grade at school.

763
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,140
But how come I don't remember you

764
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,020
among the girls

765
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,590
who had a crush on my brother back then?

766
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,730
It turns out after one lie,

767
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,050
I need to make it up with millions of lies.

768
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,470
One-sided love

769
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,250
is always silent.

770
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,930
At that time,

771
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,290
I was inferior.

772
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,650
I was embarrassed to see him.

773
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,530
Inferior…

774
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,570
Compared to those girls who had a crush on my brother,

775
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,290
you are indeed too ordinary.

776
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,180
But it's okay.

777
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,460
My brother...

778
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,570
My brother is still single.

779
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,890
Really?

780
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,690
Yes.

781
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,690
It's a secret coming out of his sister. It must be true.

782
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,170
Then he and Xining...

783
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,010
Xining?

784
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,570
It's just a crush.

785
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,770
Who can be sure

786
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,900
about a crush?

787
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,810
It's none of my business.

788
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,950
How about I help you chase my brother?

789
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,700
You betrayed your brother so quickly?

790
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,140
I'm not selling him out.

791
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,570
He's always in charge of everything.

792
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,130
He doesn't allow me to do anything.

793
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,930
I have to find someone to discipline him.

794
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,650
Then he won't have time for me.

795
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:13,930
Forget it.

796
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,480
Do you need my help?

797
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,690
Sure.

798
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,010
Let me tell you

799
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,030
what kind of person my brother is.

800
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,740
Although he looks serious

801
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,180
and he's a fashionable president,

802
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,050
in fact,

803
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,500
he's just old-school.

804
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,230
Old-school?

805
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:35,420
All he does every day is playing mahjong.

806
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:35,890
I won.

807
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,700
Mahjong.

808
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,940
Tai Chi.

809
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,780
Surprised?

810
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,450
I didn't expect that.

811
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,380
He's so similar to the writer.

812
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,740
Don't feel inferior.

813
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,000
From now on,

814
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,250
feel free to ask me

815
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,860
anything about my brother.

816
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,510
Let me think.

817
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,130
Okay.

818
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,940
Are you the couple fan of Yu Le and Ye Xining?

819
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,210
You are a couple fan.

820
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,610
You can't be with my brother.

821
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,570
A couple fan and a biased fan are irreconcilable.

822
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,170
We can't co-exist under the same roof.

823
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,570
I...

824
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,620
I'll ask my brother to fire you.

825
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,610
Brother.

826
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,740
Fire her.

827
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,620
Mr. Ji,

828
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,970
I believe you can distinguish personal stuff from business.

829
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,660
Don't worry.

830
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,990
They won't be together.

831
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,580
Really?

832
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,170
Mr. Ji,

833
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,820
you promised me not to interfere with Yu Le's relationship.

834
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,350
Fire her.

835
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,260
I can't fire her.

836
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,210
From now on,

837
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,250
she'll be my assistant.

838
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,050
We'll find another assistant for Ye Xining.

839
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,650
Mr. Ji, you broke your promise.

840
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,310
How can she be your assistant?

841
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:48,700
Right.

842
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,180
Why should I be your assistant?

843
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,660
I don't think I can do this job.

844
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,010
I…

845
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,180
Mr. Ji, what makes you think I'm capable? I'll change.

846
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,770
I'm with her.

847
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,570
She's incapable from top to bottom, from left to right.

848
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,170
That's right.

849
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:57,770
Fei.

850
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,820
If you don't have anything to do, go play by yourself.

851
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,410
Mr. Ji,

852
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,330
you're forcing me.

853
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,210
I don't agree.

854
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:03,980
I'm the boss.

855
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:04,930
You're an employee.

856
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,060
You can't refuse it.

857
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:14,850
Mr. Ji,

858
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,690
I can't do this job.

859
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,450
You know,

860
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,730
when someone is forced to do something,

861
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,010
bad things will happen.

862
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,010
I'm not afraid.

863
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,410
I'm afraid.

864
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,170
I'm here to ship my couple,

865
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,570
not to work.

866
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,310
What are you afraid of?

867
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:30,900
I...

868
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,650
I'm afraid

869
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,450
I'll like you more.

870
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,570
I know

871
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,470
you are the moon in the sky.

872
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,100
I'm not good enough for you.

873
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,690
But if you keep me by your side,

874
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,370
I can't control my delusion.

875
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,090
Is that so?

876
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,010
Then let me see

877
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,770
how much you like me.

878
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,170
Be my assistant.

879
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,210
You're on call 24 hours a day.

880
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,930
The president's assistant, right?

881
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,530
Okay, I'll do my best.

882
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,850
I'll wait and see.

883
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:37,970
Qi,

884
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,170
you can stay with Mr. Ji day and night.

885
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,290
Why are you unhappy?

886
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,170
I'm happy.

887
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,090
I'm so happy.

888
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,210
What are you talking about?

889
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,930
You look so sad.

890
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,130
Yeah, I'm thrilled…

891
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,650
I should have made myself

892
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,970
a rich character

893
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,090
owning 10 billion assets and 10 properties,

894
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,220
then I can focus on shipping my couple.

895
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,690
I have to change Ji Shu's mind

896
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,290
and make him regret keeping me by his side.
