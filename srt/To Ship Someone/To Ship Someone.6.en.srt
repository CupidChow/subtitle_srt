00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,090
in the company.

192
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,110
I'm leaving.

193
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,450
What's so important?

194
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,740
You're not celebrating your birthday?

195
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,930
How can I finish these alone?

196
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,900
Mr. Ji.

197
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,290
What's wrong?

198
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,740
Nothing.

199
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,620
Mr. Ji.

200
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
I'm going back.

201
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,660
Qi.

202
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,610
What's wrong?

203
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,930
Nothing.

204
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,140
Go back.

205
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,540
Mr. Ji.

206
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,970
You're not locked out and unable to go home,

207
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,700
are you?

208
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,330
Just say it. It's not something embarrassing.

209
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,990
I often got myself locked out.

210
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,500
Why don't you come in?

211
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,010
It takes time for the locksmith to come.

212
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,100
Okay.

213
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,920
Come on.

214
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,900
Thank you.

215
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,900
Come on in.

216
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,280
Have a seat.

217
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,590
Mr. Ji, have you had dinner?

218
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,330
If not, make do with it.

219
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,490
Eating too much instant noodles is bad for your health.

220
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,950
I'll eat it by myself then.

221
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,330
Please.

222
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,610
Enjoy, Mr. Ji.

223
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,540
You're welcome.

224
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,440
If you want, you can treat me back.

225
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,650
No.

226
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,460
It feels more formal if you eat instant noodles sitting.

227
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,660
Wait.

228
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,850
I'll turn off the lights.

229
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,080
Why would you turn off the lights?

230
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,610
Do you feel like we're having steak during a candlelight dinner

231
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,610
in a luxurious western restaurant?

232
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,900
Where is the steak?

233
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,300
Isn't this it?

234
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,340
You're so imaginative.

235
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,780
If you only

236
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,420
live a life that you can see,

237
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,340
it would be boring.

238
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
You have to enjoy yourself.

239
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,140
Right, Mr. Ji?

240
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,550
Are you enjoying yourself

241
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,060
or deceiving yourself?

242
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,770
You can also think of it like this.

243
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,100
In my opinion, society belongs to adults.

244
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,540
And adults are materialistic.

245
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,020
No matter how beautifully love begins,

246
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,700
in the end,

247
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,710
it will give way to reality.

248
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,620
No matter

249
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,610
how the relationship starts,

250
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,380
it will end in a flash.

251
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,050
I don't believe in

252
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,400
happy endings in life.

253
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,860
So you don't have to put any effort into me.

254
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,580
Why are you looking at me?

255
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,490
I think

256
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,940
you resemble someone I know.

257
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,820
Are you trying to be sarcastic again?

258
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,810
No.

259
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,130
Mr. Ji, eat.

260
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,060
It'll get soggy.

261
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,280
Who would look for me at this hour?

262
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,550
[Ye Xining]

263
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,320
[Ye Xining]

264
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,940
[Ye Xining]

265
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,090
[Ye Xining Missed Call]

266
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
Are you unhappy?

267
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,370
No.

268
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,340
You dance to vent out your frustrations

269
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,180
whenever something doesn't go your way.

270
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,250
Do you think you've changed your habits after so many years?

271
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,380
After so many years,

272
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,350
you still like to expose me.

273
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,820
You should enjoy dancing,

274
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,330
not use it as a vent.

275
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,410
Get up.

276
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,020
Come.

277
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
You like venting, right?

278
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,140
I'll take you to a place to vent.

279
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,630
Where're we going?

280
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,220
You'll know when we arrive.

281
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,450
I'll go take a look.

282
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,619
What's wrong?

283
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,060
I...

284
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,200
Nothing. Go and open the door.

285
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,940
Ji Fei.

286
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,280
Have you eaten?

287
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,300
I'm eating.

288
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,030
Here.

289
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,020
You're being nice to me for no reason.

290
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,660
Are you trying to poison me?

291
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,140
Me poisoning you?

292
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,380
Am I that bored?

293
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,260
It's all because of my brother.

294
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,090
I've spent so much effort to prepare the birthday banquet for him.

295
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,460
But he didn't eat anything.

296
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,210
He said he was going to deal with some work.

297
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,810
I'm not as important as work?

298
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,610
Birthday?

299
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,550
Take it.

300
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,930
Don't you know it's my brother's birthday?

301
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,540
You had an unrequited love for him for ten years.

302
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,450
How come you don't know?

303
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,250
How is that possible?

304
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,380
I celebrated it for him during the day.

305
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,090
So it was because you celebrated his birthday,

306
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,970
so he didn't finish his work in time

307
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,930
and didn't have time to celebrate it with me.

308
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,700
You've delivered the food.

309
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,960
You should go back now.

310
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,460
Ji Fei was at home.

311
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
That means he wasn't locked out.

312
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,340
Why didn't he spend his birthday with his sister

313
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,140
but looked dejected at the door?

314
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,220
Candles.

315
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,730
Since I know,

316
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,460
let's go through the process.

317
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,120
Otherwise, it'll be awkward.

318
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,020
Although it's a bit shabby,

319
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
I didn't know

320
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,630
it is your birthday.

321
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,420
Don't you have an unrequited love for me?

322
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,620
You didn't know that?

323
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,380
I was too busy to remember.

324
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,230
Why did you take it away?

325
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,820
It's not too late.

326
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,130
Your birthday is once a year.

327
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,060
We can't celebrate it so modestly.

328
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,450
Let's eat outside.

329
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,620
Haven't you eaten?

330
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,140
These are all appetizers.

331
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,940
It's nothing.

332
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,730
Let's go. I'll take you to eat something nice.

333
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,570
You will definitely like that restaurant.

334
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,900
It's really delicious.

335
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,860
I go there several times a year.

336
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,020
Look, it's Yu Le.

337
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,530
Yes, it's Yu Le.

338
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,620
-So handsome. -Yes.

339
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,370
Do you think I really have no acting skills?

340
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,410
You're drunk.

341
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,620
I'm not drunk.

342
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,340
Come on, cheers.

343
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,130
Mr. Ji, this is the one.

344
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
What do you think?

345
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,940
How about

346
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,380
another one?

347
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,330
Mr. Ji.

348
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,120
This store may look ordinary,

349
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,090
but it's on the Black Pearl's Must-try List.

350
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,020
You'll like it.

351
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,210
OK.

352
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,090
Qi.

353
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,370
This restaurant looks bad.

354
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,810
Let's go to another restaurant.

355
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,340
Mr. Ji.

356
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,570
You can't judge a restaurant by its appearance.

357
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,810
This restaurant is really delicious.

358
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,070
I insist you have a try.

359
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:02,820
Qi.

360
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,460
It's late.

361
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,340
Eating such greasy food is bad for digestion.

362
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,070
The research shows

363
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,660
if we eat midnight snacks,

364
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,060
first,

365
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,650
we'll have indigestion,

366
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,090
second,

367
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,090
we'll gain weight,

368
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,690
the third,

369
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,410
people who eat midnight snacks often stay up late,

370
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,370
so it will affect their working ability the next day

371
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,610
and their immune system will be weakened.

372
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,810
Why does he sound like that damn author?

373
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:26,940
Mr. Ji.

374
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,130
I don't eat it often.

375
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,100
I just eat it occasionally.

376
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,780
It's okay.

377
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,690
Listen to me.

378
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,770
Let's eat something light.

379
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,020
I'm already restrained in the real world.

380
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,730
When I enter the world of novels,

381
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,940
I must eat freely.

382
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,250
Anyway, the meat will not grow on me.

383
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,050
Don't worry, Mr. Ji.

384
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,980
It's my treat.

385
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,420
Qi.

386
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,420
If you really insist on eating,

387
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,260
let's go to another restaurant.

388
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:53,930
Mr. Ji.

389
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,410
You're a little strange today.

390
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,370
-Are you...
-No.

391
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,500
Starting to like me?

392
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:00,850
I'm not.

393
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,370
Mr. Ji,

394
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,050
I'll be sad

395
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,510
if you reject me like this.

396
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,170
You touched my hands and face.

397
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,350
I will misunderstand.

398
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,510
How about this?

399
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,300
I promise you one thing.

400
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,140
And you promise me one thing.

401
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,410
As long as it's not illegal,

402
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,410
I can promise you.

403
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,260
Be on standby 24 hours a day.

404
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,460
Don't leave my sight.

405
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,370
Mr. Ji, you're excessive.

406
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,340
Forget it.

407
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,850
I don't believe you can keep an eye on me all the time.

408
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,050
If it's your birthday wish,

409
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,690
I agree.

410
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,330
Okay, deal.

411
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,110
Let's go to another place.

412
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,700
I just want this one.

413
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,420
Qi, why don't we reconsider it?

414
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,300
-You've been to too many high-end restaurants. -I...

415
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,890
-Change to another restaurant. -So you don't want to eat here.

416
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,570
I just want to eat in it now.

417
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,050
I...

418
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,380
Okay.

419
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,280
Let's eat here.

420
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,000
Mr. Ji, take a look.

421
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,490
Waitress.

422
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,060
Qi.

423
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,560
Check the menu.

424
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,220
Please.

425
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,950
I've eaten here several times.

426
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,380
What would you like?

427
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,530
What else do you want?

428
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,430
Suit yourself.

429
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,410
Then I'll order these on the recommendation list.

430
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,890
We have a promotion event today.

431
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,290
You can take part in the lucky draw if you order the couple set.

432
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,890
Do you have any special requirements

433
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,970
for the couple set?

434
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,050
No.

435
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,610
It's just a normal double meal. You can just pay for it.

436
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,700
Then a couple set, please.

437
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,140
Okay.

438
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,140
Couple set.

439
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,490
Qi.

440
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,020
Have some water.

441
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,630
What's with the water?

442
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,790
For disinfection.

443
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,500
[Lucky draw]

444
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,540
Mr. Ji, may I draw it?

445
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,420
The third prize.

446
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,730
What's the third prize here?

447
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,650
The third prize is a pair of key chains.

448
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,250
Fine.

449
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,950
It's good that I got a prize.

450
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,690
Xining, I need to go to the washroom.

458

Here're the key chains.

459
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,060
Hello, here's your gift.

460
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,630
I don't want it.

461
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,490
This is the lucky object of Last-minute Bus Catcher.

462
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,210
And today is your birthday.

463
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:17,940
Take it.

464
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,190
I don't want it.

465
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,330
It's your birthday gift.

466
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,820
Forget it.

467
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,430
I want it.

468
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,050
The seafood here is very delicious.

469
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,180
Let me peel it for you.

470
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,310
I don't eat seafood.

471
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,080
You don't eat seafood?

472
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,530
Then have some beef.

473
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,230
Help yourself.

474
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,100
Okay.

475
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,490
Don't choke yourself.

476
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,490
Drink more water.

477
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,220
Eat up.

478
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,820
I need to go home at ten and get to bed.

479
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,180
That early?

480
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,730
Do you have the same routine as the elderly?

481
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,240
[Ye Xining]

482
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,060
Yu Le.

483
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,140
Yu Le.

484
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,100
You are drunk.

485
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,620
Let me take you home.

486
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,570
OK?

487
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,660
Be careful.

488
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,500
Are you done?

489
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,220
Okay.

490
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,060
Let's go.

491
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,100
Come on.

492
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,850
Do you have your belongings with you?

493
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,250
I've been carrying them.

494
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,080
Here you go.

495
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,190
Take the key chain.

496
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,690
-Well. -Let's go.

497
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,370
You're so full.

498
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,850
Do you want to take a walk?

499
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,410
No need.

500
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Didn't you say you'd go to bed early?

501
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,260
Mr. Ji, you've been acting weird today.

502
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,330
How?

503
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,610
It's your birthday.

504
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,420
We went our for a dinner,

505
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,020
but you...

506
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,570
Are you out of your mind? Why didn't you watch out for traffic?

507
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,300
Are you okay?

508
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,700
I'm fine.

509
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,650
Qi.

510
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,870
Are you having a crush on a man in the book?

511
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,250
If so, the ending

512
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,980
is destined to be tragic.

513
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,930
Do you also think I'm not as good as Wang Ziheng?

514
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,770
Only when he rejects the role,

515
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,140
do I have a chance, right?

516
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,350
Am I really not good at acting?

517
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,410
Say something.

518
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,450
If you don't say anything, it means you admit it.

519
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,530
So all of you

520
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,910
think the same about me.

521
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,890
Yu Le, acting

522
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,410
is based on innate talent and efforts.

523
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,890
You just started a transformation.

524
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,620
Don't deny yourself so quickly.

525
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,370
No.

526
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,490
Even as an idol,

527
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,710
I'm not as good as Wang Ziheng.

528
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,140
In everyone's eyes,

529
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,700
he is a versatile artist with excellent singing,

530
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,890
dancing, and acting skills.

531
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,700
And I

532
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,690
am just a clout who wants a share

533
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,700
in the film industry.

534
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,980
You're wrong.

535
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,130
In my heart,

536
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,210
you've always been the best.

537
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,490
Xining.

538
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,560
Is that what you really think?

539
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,450
Yes.

540
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,730
Xining.

541
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,930
Thank you for trusting me.

542
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,100
You're the only one who's by my side

543
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,570
and accompanies me.

544
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,570
Do you want to be trending

545
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,490
by hugging her in public?

546
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,250
He has a girlfriend.

547
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,210
Watch your manners.

548
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:26,970
Girlfriend?

549
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,450
I quarreled with my girlfriend.

550
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,730
I made her angry.

551
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,340
Did you two fight again?

552
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,370
It was all my fault.

553
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,660
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

554
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,410
But you...

555
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,290
How can you say in front of me

556
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,220
that another man is better than me?

557
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,770
I have my pride.

558
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,010
Then tell her

559
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,370
and explain to her.

560
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,230
But I...

561
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,220
Yu Le.

562
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,780
Yu Le, let's go. I'll take you home.

563
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,500
He can't go with you.

564
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,260
Take out your phone.

565
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,330
Call her

566
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,060
and tell her what you just said.

567
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,330
She definitely doesn't want to talk to me.

Don't interfere with others' relationship.

He's not. He wants to apologize to you,

593

Are you his sibling or his parent?

00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,530
Yes.

755
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,650
There's this Happy tranquil bar on South Xilijie Road.

756
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,450
Do you know it?

757
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,300
Happy tranquil bar?

758
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,610
Isn't this tranquil bar in the world of fan fiction?

759
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,470
There's one in the real world too?

760
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,040
Mr. Ji.

761
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,180
Do you go to places like that often?

762
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,650
No.

763
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,290
When I passed by there,

764
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,730
I saw someone who looked like you.

765
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,930
You must be mistaken.

766
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,300
I didn't go there today.

767
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,750
What about before?

768
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,730
I don't think it counts since I've only been there in the fan fiction world.

769
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,520
No.

770
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,130
It's really her.

771
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,410
About the copyright...

772
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,070
-Have you decided? -I have...

773
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,410
No.

774
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,170
Since it wasn't you,

775
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,030
I'll leave now.

776
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,370
Did he wait here

777
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,650
just to ask me this?

778
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,290
Mr. Ji.

779
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,610
I have something else to ask you.

780
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,970
Can we talk in the car?
