00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,410
Xining.

193
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,300
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,620
Let's break up.

195
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,630
It's not over yet.

196
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,190
This can be solved.

197
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,120
This is a mistake.

198
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,970
Let's end it.

199
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,960
I don’t believe you have no feelings for me.

200
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,670
Yu Le,

201
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,360
I admit I used you.

202
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,950
I don't care.

203
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,120
But I do.

204
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,660
This relationship

205
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,140
was not pure from the beginning.

206
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,780
I knew we weren't suitable for each other.

207
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,710
But I didn't want to.

208
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,310
Me too.

209
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,210
We can stay together.

210
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,580
You never firmly chose me

211
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,110
or like me that much.

212
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,260
You know that better than I do.

213
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,610
So...

214
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,800
there's no way to mend this, right?

215
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,480
Xining,

216
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,090
please forgive me this time.

217
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,140
The reason I proposed the agreement

218
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,610
was because I was out of my mind.

219
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,250
I was worried that you might think

220
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,430
there's a gap between us.

221
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,180
I was afriad you'd feel insecure

222
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,490
so I made a joke.

223
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,620
But Yu Le,

224
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,970
that's not the only reason

225
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,410
I want to break up.

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,140
Then why?

227
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,620
I wanted to give up liking you countless times.

228
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,730
But I always told myself.

229
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,710
Ye Xining.

230
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,470
Hang in there.

231
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,250
When I'm with you,

232
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,570
I saw my persistence getting a response.

233
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,380
So I wanted more.

234
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,110
In this process,

235
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,800
I gradually became unlike myself.

236
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,560
It's all my fault.

237
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,120
I will change everything.

238
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,340
It's not your fault.

239
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,490
I just don't want to be bothered

240
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,210
by meaningless things anymore.

241
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,980
Asking for candy

242
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,320
and receiving it without asking

243
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,590
are two different things.

244
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,350
I know.

245
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,250
I'm neither your favourite nor your exception.

246
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,780
I hope you

247
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
don't forget your original intention.

248
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,370
Don’t let those who love you down.

249
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,250
Bye, Yu Le.

250
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,890
Look.

251
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,990
Yu Le posted on Weibo.

252
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,670
Weibo?

253
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,930
Look.

254
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,290
[I'm grateful that you walked along this path with me. @Ye Xining]

255
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,760
It's true.

256
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,230
Yes.

257
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,830
Don't be sad.

258
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,680
There's always another couple to ship.

259
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,110
Maybe the next one will be better.

260
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,830
I've already changed the couple I ship.

261
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,840
Who?

262
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,940
You and Mr. Ji.

263
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,970
Why do you ship every weird couple?

264
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,100
Is it possible for me and Ji?

265
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,320
He and I are sworn enemies.

266
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,470
Everything was leaked by Ji Shu.

267
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,120
He wants to separate Yu Le and Ye Xining.

268
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,370
Ji Shu.

269
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,600
Tell me.

270
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,360
Does this have anything to do with you?

271
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,120
What did you say to Xining?

272
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,000
She broke up with Yu Le.

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,260
Was it your doing?

274
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,980
It has nothing to do with me.

275
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,860
You made them break up

276
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,080
so you could be with Xining.

277
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,640
This was her own decision.

278
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,830
She wouldn't break-up no matter what.

279
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,610
Why are you crying again?

280
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,050
This couple has a really tragic ending.

281
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,569
No.

282
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,270
Why?

283
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,660
Why are you doing this to me?

284
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,430
It's all your fault.

285
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,109
It's all your fault.

286
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,300
Fine, it's all my fault.

287
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,460
You bastard!

288
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,220
You're inhumane.

289
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,810
You...

290
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,070
Fine.

291
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,370
I'm a jerk.

292
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,560
Just cry.

293
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,320
If you cry too much, your brain will lose oxygen

294
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,370
and enhance chances to get

295
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,460
cardiovascular diseases.

296
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
Why are you cursing me?

297
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,920
You lied to me.

298
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,860
Isn't it enough for you to break apart my couple?

299
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,110
You...

300
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,300
You... You're cursing me.

301
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,620
I just don't want you to cry.

302
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,870
You're not hungry?

303
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,420
When humans are emotional,

304
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,270
the serotonin in their bodies will be activated.

305
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,620
And the formation of this substance

306
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,850
requires a lot of carbohydrates.

307
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,320
Are you sure you're not hungry?

308
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,620
I'm not hungry.

309
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,590
You pay.

310
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,890
Get in.

311
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,780
Ji Shu.

312
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,550
You care about others too.

313
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,190
You really have changed.

314
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,920
Why?

315
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,770
Wasn’t it good before?

316
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,290
Qi.

317
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,400
Don’t be too sad.

318
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,390
I was too optimistic

319
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,670
and thought everything was sunshine and rainbows.

320
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,100
I hoped everyone could be happy.

321
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,780
After all this,

322
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,930
I started to doubt if I was wrong.

323
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,610
Mr. Ji,

324
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,540
you’re right.

325
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,940
Some things are not as beautiful as you think.

326
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,160
Regret is normal.

327
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,800
You're not wrong.

328
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,320
Actually, there are happy endings in life.

329
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,090
Not always bad.

330
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,190
Brother.

331
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,040
Great.

332
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,460
My idol finally broke up

333
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,600
with Ye Xining.

334
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,710
Congratulations.

335
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,220
Finally, they broke up.

336
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,610
Don't be too sad.

337
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,750
I support his career.

338
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,750
Let's support him together.

339
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,590
Fei.

340
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,880
To comfort your broken heart,

341
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,360
I'm not against you being with my brother.

342
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,040
Thank you.

343
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,300
You have so many idols.

344
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,070
I don't care.

345
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,540
My brother...

346
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,010
Come out, infobox!

347
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,760
I...

348
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,860
Didn't I solve everything already?

349
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,840
Let me go back.

350
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,890
No.

351
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,100
I...

352
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,460
Come out, infobox!

353
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,590
Come out!

354
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,600
Come out!

355
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,700
Seriously.

356
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,460
Ji Shu.

357
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,390
Ji Shu.

358
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,020
You damn author.

359
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,380
I curse you to break up every time you're in a relationship

360
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,510
and receive emotional damage every time.

361
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,520
I...

362
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,330
I don't know if she's cursing me

363
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,590
or blessing me.

364
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,000
Do all women hurt by love

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,510
wear armor?

366
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,830
Amazing.

367
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,140
It's like she just got resurrected and is focusing on her career.

368
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,000
Is she really not sad?

369
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,600
Of course she is.

370
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,780
But what can she do?

371
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,880
It has happened.

372
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,060
She needs to work harder

373
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,620
and let everyone see it.

374
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,380
So what if she's single.

375
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
She's doing well on her own.

376
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,020
It's a tragic ending for my couple.

377
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,360
It's not your fault.

378
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,760
I just don't want to be bothered

379
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,600
by meaningless things anymore.

380
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,290
Asking for candy

381
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,590
and receiving it without asking

382
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,860
are different.

383
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,120
Bye, Yu Le.

384
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,040
I thought you don't want to care about me anymore.

385
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,510
Get up, pack and go to class.

386
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,280
Class?

387
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,050
Is it necessary for someone with trashy acting skills like me

388
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,350
to go to class?

389
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,370
There are no jobs anyway.

390
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,340
It's useless to go there.

391
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,110
I'm really crazy.

392
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,630
I'm already in a bad situation

393
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,140
but I still don't want to give up.

394
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,320
I also tried my best to keep your chance

395
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,790
to audition for Director Wang's movie.

396
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,840
What did you say?

397
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,310
Director Wang's new movie?

398
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,150
Yes.

399
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,830
After a week.

400
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,090
You decide

401
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,100
to go or not.

402
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,940
I'll go!

403
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,750
Get ready.

404
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,830

Why is he acting so mysteriously?

413
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,150
Why don't I go out

414
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,620
and see if it can fool the mechanism

415
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,800
to send me back?

416
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,750

Do we have to meet outside?

421
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,650
Didn't you say it's urgent and to meet

422
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,910
at the fountain?

423
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,380
Didn't you ask me out?

Where are you?

00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,930
I'm...

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,960
I think I saw you.

427

I'm in front of you.

428

Mr. Ji.

432

Are you okay?

433
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm fine.

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,920
Did you get hit?

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,390
Are you okay?

436
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm fine. Are you okay?

I'm sorry. It's my fault.

440
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,180
I'll take you to the hospital.

441
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,310
No, I'm fine.

Wait.

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm fine.

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,360
This is all fake.

That's good.

Fortunately, it's fake.

You're right.

450

Not everything ends up with the worst result.

There'll be times when we're lucky.

Ji Shu was accused of plagiarism by netizens.

473
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,980
The netizens said you plagiarized a fan fiction.

490
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,620
I know.

491
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,980

00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,120

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,650
What do you know?

494
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,290
It's a bit complicated to explain.

How is that possible?

524
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,530
His novels are similar to mine.

525
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,540
That's entirely because

526
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,590
the plot in my fan fiction changed,

527
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,220

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,970
Oh no.

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,070
I caused trouble for Ji Shu.

530
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,130
At the beginning, the similarity was 40%,

531
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,360
then it got to 60%, then 80%,

532
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,750
and eventually exactly the same.

533
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,930

Ji Shu's novel with another fan fiction.

567
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,740

570
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,440

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,580
Terminate this project immediately.

572
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,880
From now on,

573
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,240
we must not collaborate with such bad authors.

574
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,380
Mr. Jia,

575
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,350
Mr. Ji agreed to cooperate right away.

576
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,990
Now I'm the one who does the picking,

577
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,000
not him.

578
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,840
Ji Shu.

579
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,230
Yu.

580
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,990
Long time no see.

581
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,550
Long time no see.

582
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,210
Have a seat.

583
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,170
Let's get down to business.

584
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,080
I've been following your account

585
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,720
once I knew about what happened.

586
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,150
I found some clues.

587
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,920
What clues?

588
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,430
The hacker's IP address is

589
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,370
near Ji Shu's house.

590
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,480
Near Ji's house?

591
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,250
Can you stop it?

592
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,250
We can only think of solving it from the source.

593
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,650
Finish the novel in advance and then lock it.

594
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,710
Then they won't be able to modify it.

595
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,680
If you end it without any pretext,

596
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,980
isn't that a bad ending?

597
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,700
Sorry.

598
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,880
They're very smart.

599
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,930
I have no choice.

600
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,160
This is

601
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,680
the second time this happened, right?

602
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,530
If you keep updating,

603
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:13,510
the other party may continue to modify

604
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,570
and even help him continue the story.

605
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,159
It's okay.

606
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,719
Before this happened,

607
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,650
I already decided to stop writing.

608
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,340
I'll consider it a proper reason for me to do so.

609
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,860
Also,

610
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,679
the end of the month evaluation is coming.

611
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:29,639
Everyone,

612
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,739
please be ready.

613
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,840
Qingmiao.

614
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,280
Don't waste your time on this project

615
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,620
and focus on your own.

616
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,480
Qingmiao?

617
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,210
Okay, Mr. Jia.

618
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,830
Dismissed.

619
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,560
Don't put your hopes on Ji Shu.

620
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,750
You don't know his past

621
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,710
yet you trust him so much?

622
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,930
What if

623
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,320
it's true?

624
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,210
I will find the evidence.

625
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,690
Ji, are you crazy?

626
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,740
If you do this,

627
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,170
people will think you admitted to plagiarism

628
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,300
because you feel guilty.

629
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,190
Is the truth that important

630
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,250
to them?

631
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,900
No one cares about the truth.

632
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,500
They only believe what they see.

633
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,000
Ji Shu,

634
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,270
this matter is not yet serious enough for you to stop writing.

635
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,990
We don't believe you plagiarized.

636
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,250
We will find a way.

637
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,100
Yes, Ji Shu.

638
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,360
I will find a way for you.

639
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,130
But...

640
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,190
the content is so similar.

641
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,090
How do you explain it?

642
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,740
The upright has no need to fear.

643
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,310
You said the same thing

644
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,160
during college.

645
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,050
The upright has no need to fear.

646
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,570
But clear evidence was presented

647
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,830
in front of everyone.

648
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,760
Everyone thinks

649
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,870
you copied my design and thesis.

650
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,680
Even if we believe it,

651
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,570
will others believe it?

652
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,790
Shan Hang.

653
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,510
Don't bring that up.

654
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,730
We all know

655
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,070
what happened in college.

656
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,710
You all know it.

657
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,140
You mean

658
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,610
that you think I did all this?

659
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,500
Yu.

660
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,930
We're friends too,

661
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,730
right?

662
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,590
Why don't you believe me?

663
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,650
Is the wound on your right hand

664
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,420
okay?

665
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,200
Well...

666
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,550
Come on.

667
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,910
Let's celebrate both of you taking on

668
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,550
Devil Li's project.

669
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,560
I'll work for you two from now on.

670
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,780
Mainly,

671
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,050
whether I can graduate or not depends on you.

672
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,220
Make your own designs.

673
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,840
Ji,

674
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,520
are you my friend?

675
00:36:59,370 --> 00:36:59,710
Watch him.

676
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,670
I'm going to the bathroom.

677
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,730
-Here, Shan Hang. -You're drunk?

678
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,420
Shan Hang.

679
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,490
He's not a good friend. You're a good friend.

680
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,000
Don't throw up later.

681
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,860
I can drink.

682
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,510
Who are you?

683
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,640
Come on.

684
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,990
Drink more. Drink more.

685
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,490
Come on. Who are you?

686
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,000
We'll know each other after a drink.

687
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,510
Don't go.

688
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,570
Those three look like gangsters.

689
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,540
Don't cause trouble.

690
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,740
We'll get to know each other after a drink.

691
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,380
Don't go.

692
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,390
The less trouble, the better.

693
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,220
Who?

694
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,990
Drink some more.

695
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,200
-Who are you? -It's fate.

696
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,130
-I'm telling you. -Don't touch me.

697
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,730
Come on, cheers.

698
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:45,780
Drink.

699
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,040
Go.

700
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,710
Thank you.

701
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,810
What are you doing?

702
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,990
You guys are harassing women.

703
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,080
I don't mind calling the police

704
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,840
to teach you a lesson.

705
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,520
Are we in your way?

706
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,200
Him?

707
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,420
None of your business.

708
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,470
No, no, no.

709
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,310
Wait a minute.

710
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:00,900
Damn.

711
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,380
You think you can leave after ruining our night?

712
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,180
Buzz off!

713
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,060
What are you doing?

714
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,650
What are you doing?

715
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,240
Let me tell you.

716
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,660
I never liked you guys from the start.

717
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,130
Go to the police station if you dare.

718
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,940
Let's see what else you've done.

719
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,330
You dare call the police?

720
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:12,790
What?

721
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,800
What are you doing?

722
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:17,870
Shit.

723
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:20,940
Stop right there!

724
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,030
It still hurts when it rains.

725
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,640
Thank you.

726
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,500
That time,

727
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,590
if it weren't for you,

728
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,940
I'll be the one

729
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,120
with an injured arm.

730
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,260
But

731
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,110
I owe you a hand,

732
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,130
not him.

733
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,830
Lu Qiyu only has reasonable suspicions.

734
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,520
You can also

735
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,790
be upright with no need to fear.

736
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,860
Um...

737
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,870
Shan Hang.

738
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,500
How about this?

739
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,320
Go back and keep an eye on the situation

740
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,790
and find more clues.

741
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:22,930
Ji Shu,

742
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,280
don't talk about quitting for now.

743
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,580
It's not that serious yet.

744
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,600
Okay.

745
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,320
I'll go back to the office.

746
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,730
Ji Shu.

747
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,910
I will do my best

748
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,010
to help you resolve it.

749
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,420
Resolve?

750
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,100
I think he's just making trouble.

751
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,240
Ji, it's okay.

752
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,840
I know an incredible friend.

753
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,930
I'll ask him for help.

754
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,230
The company wants me to have a meeting.

755
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,330
I'll go back now.

756
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,250
Well,

757
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,140
call me if anything happens.

758
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,110
-Take care. -Okay.

759
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,230
How about

760
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,410
I find you a lawyer?

761
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,330
Let's take legal procedures.

762
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,250
Yu.

763
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:10,680
No need.

764
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,660
For me,

765
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,550
this is just a way to cure my illness.

766
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,560
Now,

767
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,570
the solution is ineffective

768
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,190
so the treatment is terminated.

769
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,130
But have you ever thought

770
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,940
what if the author of the fan fiction caused this

771
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,160
to make themselves popular?

772
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,210
That's not true.

773
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,600
Why are you so sure?

774
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,990
You know that person, right?

775
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,420
Stop guessing.

776
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,680
I've already planned to stop writing.

777
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,870
Five years ago,

778
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,850
the doctor told me

779
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,010
healing through stories

780
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,390
is not suitable for everyone.

781
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,910
This proves that

782
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,050
it's not suitable for me.

783
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,640
So you know this person,

784
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,570
right?

785
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,550
Mr. Ji.

786
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,940
The lights are off.

787
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,750
He's not at home?

788
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,480
Ji Shu.

789
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,830
Here you are.

790
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:39,930
What's wrong?

791
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,270
I'm here to apologize.

792
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,370
You said it during the day.

793
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,760
But...

794
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,230
I know you didn't do it.

795
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,020
I don't even know if I did it.

796
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,150
How do you know?
