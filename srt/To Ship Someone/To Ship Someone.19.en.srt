[Episode 19]

4
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,680
Since you've thought it through,

5
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,900
break up with him.

6
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,740
Mr. Ji,

7
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,900
you have to give me some time

8
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,460
so that I can explain to Ji Shu.

9
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:48,900
Okay.

10
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,300
Now.

11
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,630
Let's go.

12
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,660
Qi.

13
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,860
See us off.

14
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,500
Okay.

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,539
I'll see you off.

16
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,700
Qi.

17
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,340
What do your parents do?

18
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,090
They passed away.

19
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,980
Sorry.

20
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,720
Have you been considerate since you were young?

21
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,940
You seem to be

22
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,380
quite

23
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,410
considerate.

24
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,620
No.

25
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,620
I can be very naughty

26
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,820
sometimes.

27
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,740
My son used to be very obedient when he was young.

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,670
He was a good kid.

29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,380
Even if he doesn't say it,

30
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,300
I know

31
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,820
he

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,540
admires his father.

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,980
He always want to be

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,020
a successful man like his father.

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,300
In terms of that,

36
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,579
Ji Shu has done a good job.

37
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,100
He can do better.

38
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,500
You are

39
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
a good girl.

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,100
There were

41
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,820
some misunderstandings between us.

42
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,220
But as you said,

43
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,220
marriage is not only about two people,

44
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,900
but about two families.

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,660
You are still young.

46
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,660
It's easy for you to be happy for a while,

47
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,940
but

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,020
if you stay together for a long time,

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,010
you will have conflicts

50
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,860
because of

51
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,700
different values you have.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
You're right.

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,530
It's very important to find someone who shares similar values.

54
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,620
His father's company

55
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,740
is going to collaborate with

56
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
another company.

57
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,660
These two companies

58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,820
have made a long-term plan

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,540
for the future.

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,420
The person in charge of that company

61
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,579
has a daughter

62
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,420
who is a match

63
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,700
for my son.

64
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,420
His father wants them

65
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,300
to get familiar with each other.

66
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,460
They will

67
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,020
get married soon.

68
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,530
Mrs. Ji,

69
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,140
what do you mean by that?

70
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,420
I just found out

71
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,100
you didn't take the money I gave you last time.

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,810
[Two Million]

73
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,820
This

74
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,220
is for you.

75
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:49,829
Well…

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,900
Mrs. Ji,

77
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,260
I can't take the money.

78
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,380
Let me finish.

79
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
After all,

80
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,340
his father and I

81
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,820
asked you to leave my son.

82
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,660
It's kind of harsh.

83
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,540
This is the compensation

84
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,860
for you.

85
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,820
But the daughter

86
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,380
of that family

87
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,740
suits my son better.

88
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,100
She can provide more help

89
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
to my son.

90
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:09,940
Mrs. Ji,

91
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,380
I...

92
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,540
I really can't take it.

93
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,300
Please take the money.

94
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,290
Mrs. Ji,

95
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,300
do you like

96
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,100
to boot people out with money?

97
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,140
I never thought that one day

98
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,740
I would be given money twice.

99
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,410
I really like the plot.

100
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,540
Who wouldn't like money?

101
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,780
This is a chance to get rich overnight.

102
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,420
Take the money.

103
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,700
I hope you can make it clear

104
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,300
to my son as soon as possible.

105
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,100
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

106
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,540
Well…

107
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,820
Two million again.

108
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,700
Are you happy?

109
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,860
Oh no.

110
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,980
Someone went crazy.

111
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,260
He was forced to break up,

112
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,900
yet he looked so happy.

113
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,480
What is he happy about…

114
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,420
Brother.

115
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,580
Brother.

116
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,560
When did you two get together?

117
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,620
Not long ago.

118
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,780
You had to break up not long after you got together.

119
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,860
Are you really going to break up?

120
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,020
It depends on her.

121
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,700
If mom and dad

122
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,980
force Qi to leave you with money

123
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,060
and she really leaves,

124
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,980
will you let her go?

125
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,580
No.

126
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,780
That's so you.

127
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,660
When the time comes,

128
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,100
don't get me involved

129
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,160
when you need to confront mom and dad.

130
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,620
Qi.

131
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,420
Didn't my mom force you to break up?

132
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,150
Yes, she did.

133
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,220
She even gave me money.

134
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,700
But this time it's two million.

135
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,100
She forced you to break up with money.

136
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,700
Why are you so happy?

137
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,020
It's so easy to make two million by doing nothing.

138
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,460
I didn't expect my dream of getting rich

139
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,790
would come true one day.

140
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,140
I...

141
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,580
So you planned this from the beginning?

142
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,020
Tell me.

143
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,780
If your parents know we haven't broken up,

144
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,140
will they give me more money?

145
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,220
You can try.

146
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,810
Yes, they will.

147
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,660
Why not?

148
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,020
They will give you more money.

149
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,740
Great.

150
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,540
Your parents are so kind.

151
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,940
I'm an outsider now, right?

152
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,140
Suit yourself.

153
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm gonna have a rest.

154
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,220
Don't bother me.

155
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,500
Are you okay?

156
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,100
I'm fine.

157
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,860
That's good.

158
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,460
What are you going to do?

159
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,620
I'll do whatever I can.

160
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,310
Anyway, I can't really break up with you.

161
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,050
I'll find a way

162
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,650
to solve this problem I made.

163
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,100
But who is Xu Tiantian?

164
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,200
She is not a character in the original story.

165
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,420
Just like you,

166
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,170
she only exists in the world of fan fiction.

167
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,900
I didn't write this character.

168
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,550
It must be Shan Hang's game.

169
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:51,980
Shan Hang?

170
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,580
Why?

171
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,900
Because this person

172
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,760
looks exactly like Lin Qingmiao.

173
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,940
No way.

174
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,740
She didn't destroy me,

175
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,820
now she wants to torture me.

176
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,220
Where is Ji Shu?

177
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,180
Xu Tiantian.

178
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,400
This name doesn't suit you at all.

179
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,110
You don't give a sweet vibe.

180
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,740
I'm his fiancee.

181
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,860
Follow me.

182
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,380
What’s wrong?

183
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,260
Mr. Ji,

184
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,030
your ex-girlfriend and fiancee has arrived.

185
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
Please sign here.

186
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,100
Are you Ji Shu?

187
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,900
You are indeed handsome.

188
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,850
I’m your fiancee, Xu Tiantian.

189
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,980
I don't have a fiancee.

190
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,180
I only have a girlfriend.

191
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,300
Of course you didn't have one before,

192
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,460
but now you have one.

193
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,060
My dad and your dad have made a decision.

194
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,550
You are his girlfriend?

195
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,500
No,

196
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,830
his ex-girlfriend.

197
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,800
You can leave the company now.

198
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,380
Who are you to fire me?

199
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,020
Yesterday,

200
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,300
your father gave me a gift,

201
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,340
the shares of Sheng’an Entertainment.

202
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,620
As a shareholder,

203
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,620
I think I have the right to fire anyone.

204
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,540
Besides,

205
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,140
I don't want to see

206
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,820
a time bomb next to my husband

207
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,380
after we get married.

208
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,750
Good, Ji Shu.

209
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,100
Your ex-girlfriend from the real world is infatuated with you.

210
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
She's even here in the world of fan fiction.

211
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,620
Just you wait.

212
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,100
It's not me.

213
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,220
Ms. Xu Tiantian.

214
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,309
When you point one finger at me,

215
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,380
you also have three fingers pointed at yourself.

216
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,659
As a daughter of a rich family,

217
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,100
don't you have basic manners?

218
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,580
Second,

219
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,500
according to Article 71,

220
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,540
Equity Transfer,

221
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,580
of the Company Law of the Peoples Republic of China,

222
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,540
the shareholders of a limited liability company

223
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,740
can transfer all or part of their shares to all the other shareholders.

224
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
The equity transfer between a shareholder and a non-shareholder

225
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,260
needs to be approved by half of the shareholders of the company.

226
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,700
Mr. Ji,

227
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,620
as the boss and the largest shareholder of the company,

228
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,340
have you received any notice on that?

229
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,820
No.

230
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,660
Mr. Ji hasn't receive any notice.

231
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,940
You are not a shareholder of our company.

232
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,470
You have no right to fire me.

233
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,220
Alright,

234
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,540
if there's nothing else,

235
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,420
please leave.

236
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,740
Because you have affected

237
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,580
our employees' work.

238
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,580
I thought she was a great non-player role.

239
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,980
She was defeated so soon.

240
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,740
Shan Hang created such a character.

241
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,940
It's not worth her value

242
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,420
if she doesn't give me five million.

243
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,820
If you want five million,

244
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,440
I can give it to you.

245
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,420
Why did Lin Qingmiao show up just now?

246
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,540
Do you think about her day and night

247
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,660
so that she's always around?

248
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,260
That was Xu Tiantian.

249
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,060
She looked exactly like Lin Qingmiao.

250
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,460
You...

251
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,710
♫I want to be around you like stars♫

252
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,120
♫Blinking and telling you secrets♫

253
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,920
♫Approaching a wonderful scenario♫

254
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,940
Do you

255
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,100
still doubt it?

256
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,300
♫The starry sky is the place where wishes belong♫

257
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
No, I don't.

258
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,300
Are you still imagining it?

259
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,670
♫Although we're ordinary♫

260
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,780
No, I'm not.

261
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,380
I'm not imagining anything.

262
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,340
Are you sure?

263
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,040
♫We won't be replaced♫

264
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,780
Do you want

265
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,420
to prove it?

266
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,450
♫In this relationship♫

267
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,100
♫I am touched by your tenderness♫

268
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,620
Alright.

269
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,220
♫You made me forget to leave♫

270
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,810
Mr. Ji,

271
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,220
there's a contract

272
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,310
♫If it's not your choice♫

273
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,260
for you to sign.

274
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,300
How did you dance just now?

275
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,500
I still can't learn it.

276
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,100
The script.

277
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,060
The script.

278
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,900
The script.

279
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,070
What do you think of this dance?

280
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,700
We were evaluating the script.

281
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,830
It was a dance scene.

282
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,630
There’s nothing between me and Mr. Ji.

283
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,660
Right.

284
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,060
I didn't hear

285
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,420
anything about your relationship.

286
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,700
I was doing a favor for Mr. Ji.

287
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,750
He was half-arsing his blind date.

288
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,770
Give it to me.

289
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,580
Mr. Ji.

290
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,900
Next page.

291
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,560
You signed at the wrong place.

292
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,620
Keep going.

293
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,700
I'll knock on the door next time.

294
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,340
In case they misunderstand

295
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,420
and affect the plot,

296
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,620
we must keep a distance.

297
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,750
Do we have to do that?

298
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,940
You said in front of everyone in the company

299
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,340
that you liked me for ten years.

300
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
I had no choice.

301
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,510
That was to stop you…

302
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,220
To stop the supporting actor from swooping in.

303
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,680
What are you afraid of now?

304
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,230
How dare you?

305
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,060
Anyway, keep a distance.

306
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,420
Anyway, I can't say

307
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
it's awkward

308
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,060
to be shipped in front of others.

309
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,900
I wonder if Xining felt awkward

310
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,220
when she saw me back then.

311
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,020
Got it.

312
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,020
You eavesdropped again?

313
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,100
I didn't.

314
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,540
You were too active in your mind.

315
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,180
Do you have to do this?

316
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Of course we can't

317
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,270
let them see us doing these things.

318
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,700
I'm a couple fan.

319
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,180
I know the characteristics of couple fans.

320
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,420
Usually,

321
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,100
if the couple gets close to each other,

322
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
they'll overthink about it.

323
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,180
If we really touch each other by hands,

324
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,380
they will definitely say,

325
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,220
"They touched their hands. They must be in a relationship."

326
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
Since

327
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,940
you've already said so,

328
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,420
it'll be a pity

329
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,920
if I don't hold your hands.

330
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,940
Ji Shu.

331
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
Let's go.

332
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,220
Let's go.

333
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,500
This position is not good.

334
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,780
I can only hear the sound, but I can't see them holding hands.

335
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,860
It was not that sweet.

336
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,900
Blacklist it.

337
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,300
Okay.

338
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,260
Let's go.

339
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,410
What's wrong?

340
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,450
I feel like someone is peeping at me.

341
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,980
Do you think everyone is like you

342
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,740
finding a good spot in advance

343
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,980
to ship someone?

344
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,060
I was just trying to avoid the misunderstanding

345
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,740
and to prevent you from getting in between the couple.

346
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,690
Shipping someone is not the top priority.

347
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,900
Okay, whatever.

348
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,940
Ji Shu,

349
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,580
I want to

350
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,180
speak with this gorgeous alone.

351
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,780
Just say it here.

352
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,300
I don't eat humans.

353
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,860
I just want to talk to her.

354
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,660
You have to let me know

355
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,820
how I lost to her,

356
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,580
right?

357
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,140
It's okay.

358
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,020
Don't worry.

359
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,540
Just a few words.

360
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,630
Go ahead.

361
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Next time when Xu Tiantian shows up,

362
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,930
we'll continue to act with her.

363
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,500
I'll pretend to be

364
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,290
an angelic bitch who's too weak to take care of herself.

365
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,260
You only need to

366
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,370
care for me.

367
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,020
You?

368
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,330
An angelic bitch

369
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,460
who's too weak to take care of herself?

370
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,060
Who was the one argued back

371
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,340
with the Company Law?

372
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,940
An angelic bitch

373
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,300
can also be tough.

374
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,060
Fine.

375
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,260
Remember to share locations

376
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,490
with me on WeChat

377
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,340
and follow me.

378
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,300
I want to see what Xu Tiantian will do.

379
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,860
We can't sit and do nothing this time.

380
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,820
We must take the initiative.

381
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,780
Okay.

382
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,980
I promise you,

383
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,880
but you have to be careful.

384
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,630
Aren't you worried?

385
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,060
No.

386
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,940
Don't worry.

387
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,880
I won't do anything to you.

388
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,390
I just don't want to talk in front of Ji Shu.

389
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,340
Okay.

390
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,580
Are you afraid

391
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,890
that I might harm you

392
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,110
so you're secretly contacting Ji Shu?

393
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,730
Don't worry.

394
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,390
I just want to find a place to chat with you.

395
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,140
Okay.

396
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,740
What would you like?

397
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,260
Orange juice, please.

398
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,130
A cocktail.

399
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,220
Three desserts.

400
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,260
Okay. Have a seat.

401
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,660
I heard you took two million from the Ji family.

402
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,250
You’re still not satisfied?

403
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,900
Tell me.

404
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,500
What can make you

405
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
leave Ji Shu?

406
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,180
I didn't want the money.

407
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,140
Mrs. Ji gave it to me.

408
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,020
Ms. Xu,

409
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,460
I really like Mr. Ji.

410
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,780
I can’t break up with him.

411
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,380
What do you think you can bring to the Ji family?

412
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,220
I know.

413
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,310
I grew up in an ordinary family.

414
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,420
I have no parents

415
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,640
and no one to depend on.

416
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,440
But as a kid of the poor,

417
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,300
I managed household affairs at an early age.

418
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,230
I started working when I was young.

419
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,140
I know I’m not as good as you

420
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,220
or Mr. Ji.

421
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,980
But

422
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,580
you rich people can't

423
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,420
trample on others’ dignity so easily.

424
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,060
Ms. Xu,

425
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,360
I know you are not that kind of person.

426
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,020
That's too dramatic.

427
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,500
If I were Xu Tiantian,

428
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,330
I would slap myself twice.

429
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,060
You...

430
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,700
You...

431
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,940
You poor little girl.

432
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,340
But Qi,

433
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,620
I’m sorry.

434
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,140
I have to do this.

435
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,280
I've made a promise to my parents.

436
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,660
I've also done some research.

437
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,580
You've only been with Ji Shu for a few days.

438
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,780
Your love is not that deep yet.

439
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,860
It won't be that sad

440
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,300
to break up now.

441
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,290
Don't worry.

442
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,100
I promise you.

443
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,380
As long as you break up with Ji Shu,

444
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,310
I will find a way to make it up to you.

445
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,660
This

446
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,620
is the compensation

447
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,950
for breaking up with Ji.

448
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,500
After you break up with him,

449
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,830
you will definitely find someone better.

450
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,260
Tiantian,

451
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,740
thank you.

452
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
But I really

453
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,860
can't take the money.

454
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,060
I won’t leave Mr. Ji.

455
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,010
Give up.

456
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,220
Seems like it's not enough money.

457
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,100
Tell me.

458
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,230
How much do you want?

459
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,420
Or,

460
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,940
you want more than money?

461
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,700
You want the Ji Group?

462
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,220
You want to be Mrs. Ji?

463
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,060
Ms. Xu,

464
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,940
how can you measure

465
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,660
my love for Mr. Ji

466
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,700
with money?

467
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,540
Stop acting.

468
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,580
I heard

469
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,540
you took five million from Ji's father.

470
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,660
Why can't you quit?

471
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,060
How much do you want?

472
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,900
Ms. Xu,

473
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,700
do you really like Mr. Ji?

474
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,560
He’s a good partner for marriage.

475
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,140
As for feelings,

476
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,620
I met him formally for the first time today.

477
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,820
I don't have many feelings for him.

478
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,380
But romantic feelings can be developed gradually.

479
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,180
In your eyes,

480
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
what is marriage?

481
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,420
Is it a tool?

482
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,500
If you are not happy after marriage,

483
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,420
Mr. Ji will hate you

484
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
starting from this three million.

485
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,940
Do you think it can still meet your expectations?

486
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,690
No.

487
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,540
You'll only be a puppet couple full of resentment

488
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,700
and hate each other.

489
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,620
Well,

490
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,620
you said "if".

491
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,660
Besides, I've learned

492
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,220
that Ji Shu is a gentleman.

493
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,700
He won't give a woman a hard time

494
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,560
because of such a trivial matter.

495
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,780
You don't have to shy away from it.

496
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,240
Just tell me what you want.

497
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,580
It's not been long since I got together with Mr. Ji.

498
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
But

499
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,180
our relationship

500
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,490
has gone through a lot.

501
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,500
You…

502
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,220
When I first met Mr. Ji,

503
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,740
he was down on his luck.

504
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,740
He went to the set

505
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,660
and fell off the cliff.

506
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,320
No one noticed him.

507
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,580
It was I who saved him.

508
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,940
After he woke up,

509
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,350
he lost his memory.

510
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,620
Only then did I know his brain got hurt

511
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,820
and he became stupid.

512
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,700
I accompanied him

513
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,820
in his most difficult times.

514
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,420
I didn't expect

515
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,810
that he would disappear one day.

516
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,100
I couldn't find him anywhere.

517
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,430
There was a time when I thought he died in an accident.

518
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,380
What a fate.

519
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,860
Five years later,

520
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,260
I went to the company for an interview and met him.

521
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
I found out

522
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,140
he did regain his memory,

523
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,820
but he just forgot me.

524
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,180
It was too hard.

525
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,600
It's so hard to make up this story.

526
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,250
Really? What happened next?

527
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,220
How did he remember you?

528
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,380
After that,

529
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,430
I was about to give up on him,

530
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,540
but because of an accident recently...

531
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,140
What accident?

532
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,140
A car accident.

533
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,010
A motorcycle charged towards Mr. Ji out of nowhere.

534
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,460
I protected Mr. Ji subconsciously

535
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,700
and got injured.

536
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,180
Mr. Ji was shocked

537
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,740
and regained his memory.

538
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,940
Then,

539
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,780
we were together.

540
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,680
There were too many twists and turns.

541
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
It was so hard.

542
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,300
It's so hard.

543
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,740
It's finally the ending.

544
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,580
Isn't it him?

545
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,900
After that accident,

546
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,100
I realized

547
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,340
how much I love him.

548
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,500
I can't live

549
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,180
without him.

550
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,140
Your love is so touching.

551
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,200
I won't let your love end in a tragedy.

552
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,500
Really?

553
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,290
Don't worry.

554
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,020
I will help you

555
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,140
persuade Ji Shu's parents.

556
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,870
After all, you saved their son.

557
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,380
I'll take back

558
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,300
the money.

559
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,300
This money

560
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,740
is an insult to your love.

561
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,460
Well…

562
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,300
Let's go. I'll send you home.

563
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,410
You're leaving?

564
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,860
Don't you want to do anything else?

565
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,180
Right,

566
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,060
I forgot something.

567
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,170
We're finally getting to the point.

568
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,340
Qi, let's add each other on WeChat.

569
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,140
Okay.

570
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,900
No problem.

571
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
I'm touched

572
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,500
by your love.

573
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,580
If you make any progress in your relationship,

574
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,110
remember to keep me posted.

575
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,660
Don't you want to say

576
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,420
anything else?

577
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,020
Yes.

578
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,620
I'm going to ship you two.

579
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,700
Don't give me

580
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,660
a tragic ending.

581
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
Otherwise, I won't believe in love.

582
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:37,820
Let's go.

583
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,990
Let me send you home.

584
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,940
It's okay.

585
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,350
Mr. Ji will send me back.

586
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,140
I see.

587
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,150
It's my treat

588
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,900
today.

589
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,400
Good luck, Qi. See you.

590
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,540
See you.

591
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,340
Three million.

592
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,330
Three million

593
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,300
just left me.

594
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,380
Good story.

595
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,400
Do you think I'm a fool?

596
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,060
It's all what the plot requires.

597
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,720
You really took it seriously?

598
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,810
Tell me.

599
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,380
Is Xu Tiantian stupid?

600
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,260
She believes everything I said.

601
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,860
Is she stupid, or am I stupid?

602
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,380
Judging from your storytelling level,

603
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,220
you're pretty much the same.

604
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,090
What do you mean?

605
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
I think

606
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,600
there must be some problems with her.

607
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,540
Well…

608
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,260
Let's go.

609
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,280
Let's get back.

610
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:31,280
[Message From An Unknown Number]

611
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,740
Tell Ji Shu's parents the truth,

612
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,420
expose their lies,

613
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,620
and stimulate the conflicts between Ji Shu and his parents.

614
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,810
The truth?

615
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,940
I really should

616
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,740
tell Ji's parents the truth.

617
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,780
That is to say,

618
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,420
when you were with her,

619
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,070
she showed nothing wrong.

620
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,140
Everything else was normal.

621
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,700
The most abnormal thing

622
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,300
was she believed my nonsense.

623
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,500
She even said she would help me deal with your parents.

624
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,020
If this person was Shan Hang.

625
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,740
He created this new character

626
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,980
only to help us?

627
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,220
It shouldn't be that simple.

628
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,900
You lied to her.

629
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,270
She might lie to you too.

630
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,820
This is too hard.

631
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,260
I think you've adapted well.

632
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,800
You made up a story easily.

633
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,220
I was almost dead and returning to life again and again in your mouth.

634
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,460
I returned to life but became stupid.

635
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,940
After I became stupid, I went missing.

636
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,620
Finally I regained my memory,

637
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,960
then I had an accident.

638
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,940
I told you it was what the plot required.

639
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,100
I had no choice.

640
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,900
Don't be angry.

641
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,500
It's getting late.

642
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,520
I have to go.

643
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,810
What's wrong?

644
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,660
What a scene.

645
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,060
I didn't expect you to go back on your word.

646
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,220
Since you took our money,

647
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,300
you should break up with Ji Shu.

648
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:12,940
Yes.

649
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,860
Mr. Ji,

650
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,940
don’t be angry.

651
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,740
Can I talk to her alone?

652
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,780
Again?

653
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,470
What does she want to do?

654
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,700
Fine.

655
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,690
Let's talk outside.

656
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,140
Okay.

657
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,060
What are you going to say?

658
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,940
I must marry Ji Shu.

659
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,580
My baby will only have a father

660
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,900
if I marry him.

661
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,070
What do you mean?

662
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,260
Say something.

663
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,700
You're pregnant?

664
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,340
Does Mr. Ji know?

665
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,820
They will.

666
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,140
After they find out,

667
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,500
my baby will be in a member of the Ji family.

668
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,870
There’s breaking news.

669
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,130
Ji Shu won't admit it.

670
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,860
His parents like me so much.

671
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,300
I have my own way.

672
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,010
You can hide it for a while,

673
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,100
but not forever.

674
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
After you deliver the baby,

675
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,500
they'll know you lied to them

676
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,740
once the DNA test result comes out.

677
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,620
I said

678
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,300
I have my own way.

679
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,060
Xu Tiantian,

680
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,540
we treat you like our own daughter.

681
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,220
How could you do this to us?

682
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,500
Mrs. Ji, it's not like that.

683
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,060
I was lying.

684
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,780
I was trying to make them break up.

685
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,240
Enough. Stop explaining.

686
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,900
I won't believe anything you say.

687
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,460
Right.

688
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,020
Xu Tiantian.

689
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,420
I didn’t expect you to be such a person.

690
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,700
You want my brother to be your kid's dad?

691
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,300
Go back and tell your father

692
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,380
the engagement is cancelled.

693
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,900
Mr. Ji.

694
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,420
Stop it.

695
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,380
Go back now.

696
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,340
Right.

697
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,580
Go back.

698
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,020
There's someone who's better at making trouble than me.

699
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,090
Shan Hang must be crazy.

700
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,550
He sent someone to help me.

701
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,100
Qi.

702
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,740
Right?

703
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,460
I'm really sorry

704
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,340
for letting you go through this for no reason.

705
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,660
I'm sorry.

706
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,650
It's okay.

707
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,420
Mrs. Ji.

708
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,620
Although we made a mistake

709
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,820
about Xu Tiantian,

710
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,140
still

711
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,540
you and my son…

712
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,660
You two are really...

713
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,140
Mom,

714
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,060
I have something to tell you.

715
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,180
Okay.

716
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,020
What is it?

717
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,980
Come over.

718
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,380
What are your brother and Mrs. Ji talking about?

719
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,500
I'll accompany you.

720
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,620
Do you want some?

721
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,940
Come in.

722
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,060
Sister-in-law.

723
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,940
Please.

724
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,420
Qi.

725
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,900
Come here.

726
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,220
Come, have a seat.

727
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,340
Have a seat.

728
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,820
Good girl.

729
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,780
You suffered too much.

730
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,300
Suffered?

731
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,900
I didn't expect

732
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,500
there were so many twists and turns

733
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,420
between you and my son.

734
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,100
What story

735
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,820
between us?

736
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,240
Stop hiding it.

737
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,540
We all know.

738
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,940
If it weren't for you,

739
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,340
he would have died.

740
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,250
That's right.

741
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,780
What did you say to them?

742
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,670
I didn't suffer.

743
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,260
Not at all.

744
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,580
So you acted that day

745
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,310
in front of us

746
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,700
only to make my son

747
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,570
leave you.

748
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,690
You said we misunderstood you.

749
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,300
Look at what we did.

750
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,020
Actually,

751
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,140
Ji's father and I

752
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,260
don't care about

753
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,190
well-matched marriage that much.

754
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,330
Don't take

755
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,080
what I said before seriously.

756
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,020
No,

757
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,940
I won't.

758
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,460
Actually, we came here

759
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,620
because his father heard that my son

760
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,820
treated Xu Tiantian badly.

761
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,460
He wanted us to persuade him.

762
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,460
We didn't expect

763
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,340
to find out the truth here.

764
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,740
Otherwise, we'll be fooled

765
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,620
and be cheated by her.

766
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,660
Right.

767
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,540
All right.

768
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,100
Everything's clear now.

770
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:11,830
Okay.

772

Okay.

We're gonna go.

774
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,730
Let's go.

775
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,080
Mom, let me see you off.

776
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,690
Let's go.

777
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,620
You don't have to see us off.

778
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,340
Stop here.

779
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,500
Take care.

780
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
I'll see them off.

781
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,740
Bye.

782
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,980
What did you tell them

783
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,440
to change their attitude?

784
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,220
Of course

785
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,900
it was the twisted story between us.

786
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,380
Do you mean…

787
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,540
I also explained the reason

788
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,300
why you forced it with death.

789
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,980
How did you explain that?

790
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,420
I said

791
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,580
I was in the process of regaining my memory.

792
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,980
I didn't know clearly about many things.

793
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,090
When you found out about my family background,

794
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,700
you thought we were not from the same background

795
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,500
and wanted to draw a line with me.

796
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,260
Do they really believe it?

797
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,220
Well,

798
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
it really worked.

799
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,020
This world is crazy.

800
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,740
How can they believe such a weird thing?

801
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,470
There must be something wrong.

802
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,140
Shan Hang created that character.

803
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,740
She just came and did nothing

804
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,860
but help us.

805
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,010
Ji...

806
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,780
This is the CCTV footage that day.

807
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,900
Let's find a way to go back.

808
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,180
There's too much going on about the car accident and the rival in love.

809
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,510
I can't take it anymore.

810
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,100
Okay.

811
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,700
We used to go back

812
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,900
when the misunderstanding between Yu Le and Xining

813
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,260
was resolved.

814
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,980
It seems that it hasn't worked this way

815
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,540
since the school thing.

816
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,540
Besides,

817
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,700
they've broken up.

818
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,900
What misunderstanding could there be?

819
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,730
Water park.

820
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,460
Water fountain.

821
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,940
It must be a different mechanism

822
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,460
these two times, right?

823
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,300
I think so.

824
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,810
According to the old rules,

825
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,780
we can go back once the misunderstanding is resolved,

826
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,060
but a break-up isn't an removal of a misunderstanding.

827
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,190
It's a complete end.

828
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,100
So there must be a new rule.

829
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,550
Could it be an accident?

830
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,940
Impossible.

831
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
If it was an accident,

832
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,300
we should have gone back last time on the black car.

833
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,380
What else can we do?

834
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,200
I'm glad it's fake.

835
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,280
Luckily it's fake.

836
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,340
As you said,

837
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,400
not everything has the worst result.

838
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,110

Why are you looking at me like that?

845
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,940
Do you think the new rule is related to you?

846
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,219
I...

847
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,100
I've been thinking about it,

848
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,300
but I can't figure it out.

849
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,219
But after thinking about it,

850
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,980
the latest two times were related to you.

851
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,090
To be precise,

852
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,620
they were about what you said.

853
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,900
What I said?

854
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,820
What did I say?

855
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,460
You used to be

856
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,389
a very pessimistic person, right?

857
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,690
But these two times,

858
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,540
you said something particularly positive

859
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,980
and you were very happy.

860
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,199
Could it be related

861
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,659
to your attitude?

862
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,179
No way.

863
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,179
This is ridiculous.

00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,980

Why can't you say it?

871

Fate is a vague thing.

874
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,260
Some believe in fate and reach the top,

875
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,420
while others fall to the bottom.

876
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,620
Some want to change their fate,

877
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,690
but the chance of success is as low as winning the lottery.

878

there's no more grey road ahead.

It's grey fog.

881

Grey fog.

I'm still an ordinary author of fan fiction.

884
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
It must be you, the original author.

885
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,620

886
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,000
Let me pick one for you.

887
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,180
The eighth one. This number is auspicious.

888
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,850
Forget it.

889
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,940
Although

890
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,570
the past can't be changed,

891
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,090
the future can.

892
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,940
It didn't work?

893
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,420
Of course not.

894
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,170

There must be something wrong with the background.

00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,990

00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,810
Hello.

954
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,670
Director Qian.

955
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
You just arrived?

956
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,370
Why is there nothing happening?

957
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,460
Let's talk over there.

958
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,020
What happened to your hand?

959
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,580
Nothing.

960
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:37,860
Let's go.

961
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,900
Why did they leave?

962
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,860
Who left?

963
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,740
Nothing.

964
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,200
Mr. Ji, we’ll go to the next scene.

965
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
Go ahead.

966
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,500
Director Qian is looking for you.

967
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,100
Okay.

968
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,340
I've gotta go.

969
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,660
You guys talk.

970
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
You...

971
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,780
You go first.

972
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,060
The director said

973
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,580
you were more confident

974
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,170
on the stage.

975
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,060
After going through so many things,

976
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,620
of course, I'm more mature.

977
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,260
How are you doing?

978
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,950
I heard that your career fans are all back.

979
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,180
I'm preparing for a new movie.

980
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,630
I'm also getting my work back gradually.

981
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,100
It's just

982
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,940
sometimes

983
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,380
I can't find someone

984
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,140
to share my happiness with.

985
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,460
I can't think of anyone to share with me.

986
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:49,900
I like this current state

987
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,060
quite much,

988
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,140
trying my best for the career.

989
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,580
Yes,

990
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,830
so I have to work harder.

991
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,100
I can't be left behind by you.

992
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,680
Let's work hard together.

993
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,060
Well,

994
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,020
I have to get ready for the next scene.

995
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,500
Okay.

996
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,180
Don't be too sad.

997
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,980
How can I not be sad?

998
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
I can't believe the couple I shipped

999
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,780
would end like this.

1000
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,500
Maybe one can only learn how to cherish

1001
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,060
after experiencing loss.

1002
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,060
I just think

1003
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,460
Yu Le's state

1004
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,110
is not as good as before.

1005
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,220
He's experiencing

1006
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,700
the psychological impact

1007
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,340
of a trough period.

1008
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,190
What do you mean?

1009
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,700
He has been facing doubts all this time,

1010
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,300
not to mention the break-up.

1011
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,300
All these things have brought him fears of cameras.

1012
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,820
He doesn't dare to face the camera now.

1013
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,740
He even doesn't dare

1014
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,100
to show up in front of the public.

1015
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
What should he do?

1016
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,500
What about acting in the future?

1017
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,260
This

1018
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,100
can only be overcome by himself.

1019
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,700
Ji Shu,

1020
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,900
did you have the same fear

1021
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,090
as him before?

1022
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,940
Facing the betrayal of a friend,

1023
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,060
the lack of trust from classmates,

1024
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,820
and the teacher's disappointment.

1025
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,010
Have you ever felt hopeless?
