This is the list of layoffs.

5
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,910
Please take a look.

6
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,420
Okay, you can back to work.

7
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,140
OK.

8
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,140
Mr. Jia,

9
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,020
most of my work has been handed over to An Jing...

10
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,020
Do you still want to follow up the Brighter Than Stars?

11
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,490
Do you?

12
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,140
Of course I do.

13
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,580
But you said...

14
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,680
It doesn't matter what I said.

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,580
What matters is whether you want to continue or not.

16
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,340
I can continue if I want to?

17
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,300
The story of Brighter Than Stars is not satisfactory.

18
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,540
And Mr. Ji has stopped updating it.

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,180
It can be updated again.

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,140
But it's a tragedy.

21
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,860
It doesn't match our company's concept.

22
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,820
It can be changed too.

23
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,890
Mr. Jia, do you have a fever?

24
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,460
No.

25
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,410
Then why do change your mind?

26
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,460
Do you want to do it or not?

27
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,300
Yes.

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,760
If you want, keep following up this project.

29
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,140
Mr. Jia.

30
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,820
You may not know

31
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,700
Ji Shu didn't just suspend the update,

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,300
he also plans to stop writing.

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,960
We may not be able to read the ending of the novel.

34
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,020
He didn't tell me so.

35
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
Who?

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,020
No one.

37
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,870
I don't care.

38
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,380
Since he just plans to stop writing,

39
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,460
then he hasn't, right?

40
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,790
Don't let him stop then.

41
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,700
Do I have the ability?

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
You're not kidding?

43
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,420
Do I have so much time to joke with you?

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,860
No.

45
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,860
Will you do it or not?

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,900
Yes, of course.

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,020
So,

48
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,620
I don't have to pack up and leave, right?

49
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,150
Who will do it if you leave?

50
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,860
Thank you, Mr. Jia.

51
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,860
I'll get Mr. Ji.

52
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,670
-Go ahead. -I mean, his novel.

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,590
Qi, what's going on?

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,860
Are you leaving?

55
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,579
It's good news.

56
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,100
-What is it? -What news?

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,700
Mr. Jia agreed to let me follow up

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,100
the Brighter Than Stars.

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,460
And he promised

60
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,820
as long as I get the intellectual property of the novel,

61
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,140
he'll do it even if it's a tragedy.

62
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,980
Really?

63
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,700
Yes.

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,980
Great.

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,579
I knew it.

66
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,300
Life is full of ups and downs.

67
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,100
I need to think about

68
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,300
how to help Mr. Ji finish his novel.

69
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,820
Congratulations, Qi.

70
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,360
I read the clarification.

71
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,140
Most readers believe in Ji Shu.

72
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,140
Only a few anti-fans still disagreed.

73
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,860
That means you have good taste in people.

74
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,700
Your sense is accurate.

75
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,900
When you finish this project,

76
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,420
remember to treat us to a meal.

77
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,260
We have to eat the most expensive meal.

78
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,900
Of course.

79
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,690
Of course.

80
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm already dreaming.

81
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,500
Ji,

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm done talking to Qi.

83
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,300
Thank you, Yingjun.

84
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,620
That's the least I can do.

85
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,420
Back then,

86
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,810
if you hadn't invested our company,

87
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,020
the company would have been gone.

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,810
Now you are the boss of Ansheng Entertainment.

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,180
Also,

90
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,010
I like Qi too.

91
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,900
I didn't ask her to leave.

92
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,940
She didn't let me finish last time.

93
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,820
That's good.

94
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,020
If others want to resign,

95
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,700
you can also let them go.

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,940
They can leave

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,470
after they find other jobs.

98
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,940
Look at you.

99
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,380
If I had known this novel was yours,

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,230
why did we beat around the bush?

101
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,260
Don't tell her yet.

102
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,540
I understand.

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,620
I'll leave you to your work then.

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,820
Is it this hard

105
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,500
to pursue a girl?

106
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,540
I didn't do this when I was pursuing my wife.

107
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,260
Do you know why I wrote the fan fiction?

108
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,170
People say

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,060
youth lost to the reality,

110
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,260
and love lost to the interest.

111
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,260
But I think

112
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,740
people who truly love each other

113
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,940
deserve a happy ending.

114
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,180
Can true love

115
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
really end well?

118
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,850
Sure. I was about to talk to you.

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,550
Which one should I wear?

122
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,490
I have nothing to wear.

123

I'll pick you!

126
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,170
Mr. Ji, I'm here.

127
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,070
Have a seat.

128
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,820
What would you like to drink?

129
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,500
Am I overdressed?

130
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,280
Everything is fine for me.

131
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,050
Then let's drink the kuding tea.

132
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,680
It can eliminate summer heat, and is good for eyesight as well wisdom.

133
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,900
Is it good?

134
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,140
It's so tasty.

135
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,860
Really?

136
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,930
Why are you laughing?

137
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,100
Shall we drink something you like?

138
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,780
No, I can drink this.

139
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,740
This is your last chance.

140
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,900
Let's go.

141
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,800
Try this one. I like it so much.

142
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,530
How is it?

143
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,780
Isn't it super sweet?

144
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,340
If you eat too much sugar,

145
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,590
you'll age quickly.

146
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,460
Youth is meant to be consumed.

147
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,910
Tea can help you resist oxidation.

148
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,740
Milk tea is also tea.

149
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,770
Do you know why you

150
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,020
always react so much to kuding tea?

151
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,740
Why?

152
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,690
Because you usually eat too much sugar,

153
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,020
so you can't stand the bitterness,

154
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,860
not even a bit.

155
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,490
You mean I'm sweet?

156
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,140
I mean

157
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,340
your tongue is...

158
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,260
The taste buds on your tongue are sweet.

159
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,620
Anyway,

160
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,660
as long as it tastes good.

161
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,260
Just like your novels.

162
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,740
The endings don't matter,

163
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,140
as long as the process is sweet.

164
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,740
By the way,

165
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,860
I have good news for you.

166
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,670
Go ahead.

167
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,380
I'm not fired.

168
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,140
Congratulations.

169
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,740
Am I lucky?

170
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,620
I thought I was going to get fired,

171
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,380
but my boss suddenly

172
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,340
let me stay.

173
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,650
I'm so lucky.

174
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,020
So, I'm here

175
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,500
to talk about

176
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
your copyright again.

177
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
Our company still wants to buy your novel.

178
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,540
Its ending can be written any way you want.

179
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,600
Are you really not going to update it?

180
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,860
I'm not going to continue.

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,020
Why?

182
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
There're so many readers waiting for your novel.

183
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,290
I told you before

184
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,500
I write novels to cure my illness.

185
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,630
Now this method has failed.

186
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,590
So there's no need to continue.

187
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,140
There's no other reason for you to continue?

188
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,700
Let me think about it.

189
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,740
Okay.

190
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,010
Excuse me.

191
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,380
The tiramisu you ordered.

192
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,240
Thank you, sir.

193
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,070
I'm not cold.

194
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,340
Yes, you are.

195
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,720
I'm really not.

196
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,990
Just wear it.

197
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,850
Take a bite.

198
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,780
No.

199
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,620
It won't destroy your taste buds.

200
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,260
No.

201
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,740
Try it.

202
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,260
Okay.

203
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,340
Just one bite.

204
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,400
Wear my suit properly.

205
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,780
Why is my heart beating so fast?

206
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,870
♫I want to be around you like stars♫

207
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,280
♫Blinking and telling you secrets♫

208
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,490
Why do I keep thinking about him?

209
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,090
♫Approaching a wonderful scenario♫

210
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,100

♫The starry sky is the place where wishes belong♫

212
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,260
sick?

213
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,840
♫Although we're ordinary♫

214
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,210

[Lu Qiyu]

218
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,700
Come to the basketball court tomorrow.

219
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,230
I have something to ask you.

220
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,600
Xingxing, does your stomach still hurt?

221
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,130
I'm fine.

222
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,220
I'm getting used to the pain.

223
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,420
Drink more hot water.

224
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,460
Thank you.

225
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,740
My goodness.

226
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,850
Ji asked me out?

227
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,860
The sun has risen from the west.

228
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,460
It's such a historic moment.

229
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,670
I have to take a screenshot for memory.

230
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,260
All these years,

231
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,340
this is the first time Ji asked me out.

232
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,790
I can't believe it!

233
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,860
Lu Qiyu, come back!

234
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,850
Wait.

235
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,020
I am too tired.

236
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,370
You're crazy.

237
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,500
I need to drink some water

238
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,360
and have a rest.

239
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,620
Ji,

240
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,140
did you quarrel with Song Yanqi?

241
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,600
You seem to be in a bad mood.

242
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,150
Why should I argue with her?

243
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,580
You're right.

244
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,900
With your personality, you can't quarrel with others.

245
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,370
Is it because you didn't get along well that day?

246
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,300
That day?

247
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:39,980
Which day?

248
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,500
The day she got drunk

249
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,180
and was taken home by you.

250
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,740
No.

251
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,200
Ji,

252
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,260
what do you think of Song Yanqi?

253
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,920
I think she's nice.

254
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,540
She never gives up easily.

255
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,940
She's so persistent.

256
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,700
You call this perseverance?

257
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,860
Isn't this shameless?

258
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,780
How is that shameless?

259
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,780
She is persistent.

260
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,530
Look.

261
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,620
She's optimistic and has a good personality.

262
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,530
I have to ask who is single around me

263
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,390
so that I can introduce her to him.

264
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
Everything is idealism in her mind.

265
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,860
She always thinks of the world in a beautiful way.

266
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,780
Are you sure this is not stupid?

267
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,220
But as for that kind of silly,

268
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,740
I mean, happy girl,

269
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,880
do you like her?

270
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,620
To lower her IQ?

271
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,500
What's wrong with her IQ?

272
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,740
She looks smart.

273
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,780
And she's pretty.

274
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,500
It will be so lovely

275
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
to ask a cute girlfriend like her out.

276
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,780
If so,

277
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,740
why don't I bring a fortune cat?

278
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,860
At least it's more adorable than her.

279
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,390
You compared her with cats?

280
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
You're hopeless.

281
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,020
You deserve to be single.

282
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,500
To be honest,

283
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,130
why did you ask me out?

284
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,260
I want to try something new.

285
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,440
You mean the novel?

286
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,720
You want to continue to update it?

287
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,260
I haven't made up my mind.

288
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,140
You've already had the answer in your mind,

289
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,619
you know?

290
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,430
If you've made up your mind, just do it.

291
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,060
If you don't stop writing,

292
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,980
Xingxing and Qi will be so happy.

293
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,980
I suggest

294
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,780
you should discuss it with Song Yanqi.

295
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,180
She's really good at writing fan fictions.

296
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,260
You two can cooperate.

297
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,260
If I start over

298
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,339
and we get into it again,

299
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,060
it will be too dangerous.

300
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,580
Getting into it?

301
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,710
Where are you going?

302
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,750
Nothing.

303
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,700
I'm just thinking

304
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,330
if I revise the truth

305
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,420
and decorate it with beauty

306
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,350
before presenting it to everyone,

307
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
will it be good?

308
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,500
Mr. Ji.

309
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,840
It doesn't matter.

310
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,020
Because everyone knows

311
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,300
what reality is.

312
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,670
You know why?

313
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,100
Because in this world,

314
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,420
there are too many people standing on the ladders of the wrong wall.

315
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,500
They can neither go up nor down.

316
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,960
And they can't get out of the trap they are in.

317
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,010
Some people

318
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,500
choose to spend the rest of their lives like that.

319
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,420
But others choose to

320
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,460
break the wall

321
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,220
and create a new path.

322
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,580
In my heart,

323
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,420
you're a brave wall breaker.

324
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,780
Everyone misjudges others sometimes.

325
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,180
Fine.

326
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,920
I won't argue with you.

327
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,090
You'll figure it out one day.

328
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,020
But since you haven't made a decision yet,

329
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,420
why don't you put it aside

330
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,500
and find something easier to do?

331
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
For example,

332
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,660
you can be in a relationship.

333
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,460
No need.

334
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,300
Why not?

335
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,220
As a writer of romantic fictions in the new era,

336
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,780
how can you allow yourself to have only one relationship?

337
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,780
That will lead to the repeated content of your novels.

338
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,940
Your readers were

339
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,730
unsatisfied with the plots, right?

340
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,900
That's the reason.

341
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,540
You're right.

342
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,940
But I don't accept it.

343
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,220
You are like the root of an 800-year-old maple tree.

344
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,290
So stubborn!

345
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,260
Well,

346
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,590
I'll think about it.

347
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,500
Sleep on it.

348
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,030
I'm gonna play basketball.

349
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,020
What should I do?

350
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,500
Help me think of a way.

351
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,030
I can't go on the blind date.

352
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
I have an idea.

353
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,340
Go straight to the point

354
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,780
and tell him you actually have a boyfriend

355
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,840
to make him give up.

356
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm afraid I can't.

357
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,180
My mom doesn't allow us to be together.

358
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
She will definitely go

359
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,000
where my boyfriend works.

360
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,540
I was careless.

361
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,020
When they asked me,

362
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,740
I just told them

363
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,580
where my boyfriend works.

364
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,740
Has he seen your photos?

365
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,560
We added each other on WeChat,

366
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,300
but never sent any photos.

367
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,180
There's another way.

368
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,550
You asked someone to go on the blind date on behalf of you.

369
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,060
Are you guys talking about me?

370
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,780
No.

371
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,300
I've never gone on a blind date.

372
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,540
I have no experience.

373
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,220
Qi, An Jing can't go.

374
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
I'm a man.

375
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,500
I can't go either.

376
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,810
Fine.

377
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,820
Thank you, Qi.

378
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,100
Just go and meet him,

379
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,940
and then reject him.

380
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,220
It won't take long.

381
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,420
Don't blame me if I screw up the plan.

382
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,060
Don't worry.

383
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,100
I'll go with you.

384
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,090
Good luck.

385
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,120
The twitches of my eyelids today has foretold this.

386
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,740
Which one?

387
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,820
He said he's near the window.

388
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,300
That one?

389
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,250
It seems to be.

390
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,820
He looks no bad from the back.

391
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,420
Why don't you do it yourself?

392
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,180
Please.

393
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,810
Wait for my news.

394
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,460
I can't.

395
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,500
Why don't you go by yourself?

396
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,940
What if I got caught? I...

397
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,020
It's okay.

398
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,780
Go.

399
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,220
You...

400
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,660
Ji Shu?

401
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,080
What made you here?

402
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,660
Are you here for the blind date?

403
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,500
You finally got the hang of it?

404
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,420
Blind date?

405
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,870
What do you mean?

406
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,500
Why are you here?

407
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,280
Not him. It should be that man over there.

408
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,460
Sorry, I made a mistake.

409
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,980
Hello.

410
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
You are...

411
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,500
Liu Yifei.

412
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,700
You are An Jing?

413
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,580
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,020
The sun is too bright today.

415
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,780
I'm afraid of the sun burn,

416
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,660
so I moved here.

417
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,700
You are taking good care of your skin.

418
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,100
Yes.

419
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,280
Please have a seat.

420
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,940
Ji Shu.

421
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,580
Why are you here?

422
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,300
Lu Qiyu came to buy books.

423
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,030
I'm here to wait for him.

424
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,010
I heard the desserts in this bookstore are very tasty.

425
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,140
Do you want to try it?

426
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,900
Dessert's bad for our stomach.

427
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
You still remember my stomach problems?

428
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,960
What a bootlicker.

429
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,740
What did you say?

430
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,810
I said it's sweet.

431
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,700
You like it?

432
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,220
It's easy.

433
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,420
We can order a take-out before we leave.

434
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,740
I heard from your family

435
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,340
that you work in a film and television company.

436
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,480
You are the first person I know in the entertainment industry.

437
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,260
Do you often meet some celebrities?

438
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,500
Not really.

439
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,940
I'm just doing some preliminary planning work.

440
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,570
Okay.

441
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,260
What's wrong with the dramas

442
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,900
nowadays?

443
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,490
Are there no scriptwriters in our country?

444
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,780
There are lots of dramas

445
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,110
adapted from fictions.

446
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Is your idle's reputation ruined?

447
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,260
No, not really.

448
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,090
I just think it's not a good way to produce TV plays.

449
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,340
Why not create something original?

450
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,180
Actually, stories are essential.

451
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,220
Whether it's a novel or an original script,

452
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,420
it's mainly about the value of the story itself.

453
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,100
There was an Internet trending topic

454
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,700
about the novel plagiarism.

455
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,500
Will you use this kind of novels?

456
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,570
I think you didn't pay attention to the follow-up.

457
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,050
This matter has been clarified.

458
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,340
There is no plagiarism.

459
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,060
Yes, I don't know much about it.

460
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,900
It's okay.

461
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,020
When I was at the office today,

462
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,460
I heard Qi was looking forward to this blind date.

463
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,980
He is a nice guy.

464
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,290
It sounds like he has a stable job.

465
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,160
At least it'a more stable than our business.

466
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,690
What's going on there?

467
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,180
Did you see Qi over there?

468
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,180
Yes.

469
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,660
She's on a blind date.

470
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,740
Blind date?

471
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,260
Oh no.

472
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,020
The mission Xingxing gave me is going to fail.

473
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,940
Yu, long time no see.

474
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,180
Long time no see.

475
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,900
You are quite leisure at work.

476
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,740
It's the office hour, but you have time to come here.

477
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,500
No.

478
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,020
I've been busy lately.

479
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,980
My project is about to come out.

480
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,020
I've made an appointment with the platform

481
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,220
and we'll communicate on it here later.

482
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,900
Do you know

483
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,230
many authors of novels?

484
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
As for the plagiarism last time,

485
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,700
my niece

486
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,900
was so sad.

487
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,220
She's the author's fan.

488
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,940
She said

489
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,180
she wouldn't like him

490
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,640
and buy his books anymore.

491
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,760
I don't think she knows the truth.

492
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,500
Ji Shu didn't plagiarize and won't plagiarize.

493
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,230
I read a few of his books before,

494
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,660
so I'm curious about him.

495
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,260
No.

496
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,820
Just like the official clarification,

497
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,980
the hacker reader didn't like the plot,

498
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,500
so he wanted to change the plot.

499
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,420
Do you know him?

500
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,220
Yes.

501
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,770
I see.

502
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,220
But this Ji Shu's

503
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,300
writing skills are much worse.

504
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,100
His works now are not as good as his previous ones.

505
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,500
Recently, there's a fiction called Best Actor or something...

506
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,900
The name is already vulgar.

507
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,580
But the content is even more dramatic.

508
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,300
I gave up

509
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,820
I...

510
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,900
when I read half of it.

511
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,100
It's quite dramatic.

512
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,930
But life is far more dramatic than stories.

513
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,290
Yes.

514
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
But many people are having a hard time.

515
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,220
So they want to make themselves feel good

516
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,700
by reading a novel or watching a drama.

517
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,100
You're in the film industry.

518
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,560
You should understand this better than I do.

519
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,120
But people are different.

520
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,220
Some people are willing to face the reality

521
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,420
and always alert themselves.

522
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,260
But others are willing to live in fantasy

523
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,580
and weaken the reality.

524
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,640
You can't deny others' choices with your own thoughts.

525
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,940
You have a point.

526
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,600
I didn't expect

527
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,640
that Song Yanqi is protecting you behind your back.

528
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,740
I have two movie tickets.

529
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,900
It's the romantic movie

530
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,100
you girls like to watch.

531
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
It's almost the time.

532
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,260
Let's go watch together.

533
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,820
I have something else to do.

534
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,350
Maybe...

535
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,220
But your mom said

536
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,740
you have no other plans today.

537
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,260
We can go back after dinner.

538
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,100
To be honest,

539
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,420
I like you.

540
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,940
I hope we can spend some time together

541
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,420
with the premise of marriage.

542
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,680
If you think it's okay,

543
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,740
let's get married soon.

544
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,300
Get...

545
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,220
So soon?

546
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,670
I got married in a few words before.

547
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,100
No.

548
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,020
I won't do it this time.

549
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,820
Not this time.

550
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,180
Let's go.

551
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
No, I...

552
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,420
Qi.

553
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,220
What a coincidence.

554
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,420
Nice to meet you here.

555
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,330
Qi?

556
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,830
Isn't your name An Jing?

557
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,180
Qi is my nickname.

558
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,410
Qi...

559
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,260
Miss Song.

560
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,430
You must be busy.

561
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,420
I don't think you have time to talk about the copyright.

562
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,340
After you get married,

563
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,070
you will have less time to work.

564
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,750
Let's cooperate later.

565
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,860
You're Miss Song? Should it be Miss An?

566
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,090
Song...

567
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
I'll explain this to you later.

568
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
If I lose this opportunity,

569
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,900
I'll lose my job.

570
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,830
I'll treat you to a movie next time.

571
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,300
Waiter.

572
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,700
I just ate half of the cake.

573
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,960
Can I pay for half of it?

574
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,820
And I don't want the take-out.

575
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,980
But I already packed it.

576
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Sorry, I don't need it anymore.

577
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,580
Thank you.

578
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,090
Qingmiao, as you can see,

579
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,580
Ji has gotten over the past.

580
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,980
He will have a new relationship.

581
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,380
Live well with Shan Hang.

582
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,750
Don't dwell on the past.

583
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,740
Mei.

584
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,760
Are you available now?

585
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,570
There's a romantic movie on.

586
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,580
You girls may like it.

587
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,340
Let me treat you to a movie, okay?

588
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,270
I'll pick you up.

589
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,350
I'll pick you up.

590
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:34,770
Waiter.

591
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,580
Pack it up for me.

592
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,940
Pack this unfinished cake.

593
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,290
Okay.

594
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,330
Ji Shu.

595
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,660
Ji Shu!

596
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,100
Ji Shu.

597
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,580
I want to say thank you

598
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,260
for helping me out.

599
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,060
Song Yanqi.

600
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,940
You confirmed the relationship on the first meeting of a blind date.

601
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,270
Are you stupid or blind?

602
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,900
You seemed smart before.

603
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,940
Why do you want to get married at a young age?

604
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,900
Why are you so eager to get married?

605
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,860
Why?

606
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,740
I just yearn for marriage. So what?

607
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,340
Does it have anything to do with you?

608
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,780
It's fine that my work isn't going well.

609
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,510
But you don't want my relationship to go well too?

610
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,090
It's not the first time I can't distinguish people.

611
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,490
I've already learned a lesson given by you.

612
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,700
Are you really angry?

613
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,060
No.

614
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,900
Well.

615
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,660
Who do you think you are?

616
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,790
Why are you so angry?

617
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,790
Besides,

618
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,330
do I look like a fool?

619
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,080
It's not my blind date.

620
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,300
I was there to refuse for someone else.

621
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,020
But he didn't follow the rules

622
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,680
to confirm our relationship.

623
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,940
When I was about to leave,

624
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,740
you already saved me like a hero.

625
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,920
Every potter praises hit pot.

626
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,900
What?

627
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,780
I said you're a hero.

628
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,440
But you said I praised myself?

629
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,850
You're destined to be alone.

630
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,110
Don't be this stupid

631
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,740
in the future.

632
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,870
I have no choice.

633
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,020
Fools always do stupid things.

634
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,630
I will never change.

635
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,770
When you go out,

636
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,420
hang a card on your chest with your name and address on it.

637
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,740
When you can't find your home,

638
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,300
remember to ask for help.

639
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,780
You...

640
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,540
Unreasonable.

641
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,220
Unbelievable.

642
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,420
Mr. Ji.

643
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,020
You said you wanted to talk about work with me.

644
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,700
Are you going to continue to write?

645
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,100
I haven't made up my mind.

646
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,500
How come?

647
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,300
Are you really going to end the Brighter Than Stars with an anticlimax?

648
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
I don't know.

649
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,540
What do you mean?

650
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,060
You said I'm incurable

651
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,780
and unreasonable, didn't you?

652
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
People like me

653
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,190
are abnormal from time to time.

654
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Mr. Ji,

655
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,250
you know I'm mean in talking.

656
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,180
You can't believe what I said.

657
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,330
You are...

658
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,940
No.

659
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,700
You two have an affair behind my back?

660
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,990
It's not what you think.

661
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,740
Go back and think about it.

662
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,020
I'll come back tomorrow.

663
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,900
Not...

664
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,100
Stop!

665
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,540
Tell me the truth.

666
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,340
Nothing. You misunderstood.

667
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,580
And that's Ji Shu.

668
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,660
How could I have anything to do with him?

669
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,320
Do you think I'll believe you?

670
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,270
Then how can you believe me?

671
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,300
I think

672
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,520
I won't believe anything you say.

673
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,000
I only believe what I saw with my own eyes.

674
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,500
I just don't want him to stop writing

675
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,220
and end the Brighter Than Stars like this.

676
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,940
Mr. Jia has promised me

677
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,180
as long as I can get the copyright,

678
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,300
he will agree to change

679
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,500
and try to do a drama with a tragic ending.

680
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Didn't Ji Shu tell you?

681
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,500
Tell me what?

682
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,650
Nothing.

683
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,740
So now he's fallen love with you,

684
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,660
but you have no idea about that.

685
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,420
So Master Ji is

686
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,880
fishing you with the copyright of his novel.

687
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
If I don't assist him,

688
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,420
I would be unqualified

689
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,340
for my "best friend" title.

690
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,100
How's the copyright issue

691
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
going with him?

692
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,060
Your damaging ways didn't work.

693
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,300
You've seen the ending.

694
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,830
He didn't fall into my trap.

695
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,150
It's different now.

696
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,300
What's the difference?

697
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,560
You two are different.

698
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,180
So,

699
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,900
you should plan to pursue him again.

700
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
No.

701
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
It's embarrassing.

702
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,060
Lady,

703
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,220
don't lie to yourself.

704
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,540
You have to face your heart.

705
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,710
I don't want to talk to you.

706
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,700
Do I really fall in love with him?

707
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,700
It seems quite good.

708
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,100
Mr. Ji, what a coincidence.

709
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,489
We meet in the neighborhood of my home.

710
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,420
Is it a coincidence?

711
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,219
We can take exercise everywhere.

712
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,290
Let's jog together.

713
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,020
Sure.

714
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,080
You still don't get it?

715
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,389
Look, this move is amazing.

716
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,739
What do you think?

717
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,280
Checkmate!

718
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,980
No way.

719
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,460
Why did I lose again?

720
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,020
I'm lucky.

721
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,400
You're promising.

722
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,550
I have good luck.

723
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,060
I'm good at it?

724
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,060
I told you

725
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,500
I'm not a girl who only likes net literature.

726
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,700
Did you really learn it from childhood?

727
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,700
Of course, I've always liked playing chess since childhood.

728
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
I also know that you like it too.

729
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,500
Right?

730
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,100
You started to learn it last night, didn't you?

731
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,140
It's embarrassing.

732
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,500
No way.

733
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,090
Wait for me.

734
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,570
I often come here for breakfast.

735
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,500
I love the tea here.

736
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,980
Really?

737
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,610
Of course.

738
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,580
I can also brew tea and tell its quality,

739
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,110
as well as enjoying, drinking and tasting it.

740
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,380
Please have some tea.

741
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,660
Actually, I haven't had milk tea for a long time.

742
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,700
Last time was long ago.

743
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,620
Mr Ji, I think actually

744
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
we have many things in common.

745
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,490
I...

746
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,540
You...You don't drink it?

747
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,580
Thanks.

748
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,180
It's cold.

749
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,550
I didn't boil the water?

750
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,180
Why isn't it turned on?

751
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,150
Let me boil another pot for you.

752
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,380
No need.

753
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,620
What's wrong?

754
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
I just want to say

755
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,940
I'm

756
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,140
a well-rounded girl.

757
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
It was an accident today.

758
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,570
I usually do much better than today.

759
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,900
I believe you.

760
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,940
But you don't look like you do.

761
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
I'm not stupid.

762
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,900
I can tell it.

763
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,830
What do you want me to do?

764
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,900
Forget it.

765
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,650
I...

766
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,300
I don't know.

767
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,670
Forget it. I'm going back.

768
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,860
Just be yourself.

769
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,110
There's no need to cater to others.

770
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,340
Since you worked so hard,

771
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,420
let's spend the weekend at the nearby villa tomorrow.

772
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,550
You don't have to go though.

773
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
I'd love to!

774
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,860
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

775
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,620
Don't be late.

776
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,940
Okay, I won't be late.

777
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

778
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,780
Not long.

779
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,620
Get in the car.

780
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,180
Am I your diver?

781
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,440
No, I am just putting my suitcase inside.

782
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,900
How to adjust the seat?

783
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,360
On your right side.

784
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,180
Where is it?
