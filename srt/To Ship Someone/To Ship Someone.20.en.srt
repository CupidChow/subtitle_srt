00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,060
Promise me

195
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,500
don't leave me, okay?

196
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,780
As long as you choose me firmly,

197
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,490
I won't leave you.

198
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,130
♫Missing you is so silent♫

199
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,460
♫It always appears in the middle of the night♫

200
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,130
♫The stars in my eyes♫

201
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,070
♫Are all twinkling for you♫

202
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
Thank you.

203
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,220
Thank you.

204
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,180
♫The sea of flowers is too vast♫

205
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,450
♫It's too easy to get lost♫

206
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,770
♫That's why I'm more reluctant to leave you♫

207
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,620
♫I want to be by your side♫

208
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,200
♫Holding hands tight♫

209
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,230
What do you want?

210
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,160
Guess what I want to do.

211
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,540
How would I know?

212
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,820
I...

213
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,620
What is that?

214
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,700
We need to sort out

215
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
how we can go back.

216
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,620
Not to mention the medium is a website.

217
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,780
Then why can't I figure it out?

218
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,860
I came here directly,

219
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,060
but you became Ji Shu?

220
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,750
According to what you said,

221
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,100
when you started to write your fan fiction,

222
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,140
the world of the novels has created the world of fan fiction.

223
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,380
And in this world,

224
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,140
you created a new character.

225
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Qi.

226
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,780
The place we are in now

227
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,700
is the world of your fan fiction.

228
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,530
In a sense,

229
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,140
you and I are the same.

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,660
Then what is the trigger for travelling in and out the novel?

231
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,740
It can't be a stupid reason like

232
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,890
alignment of the planets.

233
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,610
I've investigated everything from the beginning.

234
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,300
There's something suspicious.

235
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,160
Do you remember

236
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,140
in March,

237
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,420
there was a day when there was only thunder and no rain?

238
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,020
Yes.

239
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,860
That day,

240
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,900
there was thunder and lightning until night,

241
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,420
but it never rained.

242
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,500
Maybe that's why it modified

243
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,630
the magnetic field.

244
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,510
And you were writing your fan fiction, right?

245
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes.

246
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,390
So it really has something to do with thunder?

247
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,380
Can we go back

248
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,840
if the weather is the same?

249
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,280
I need to check the weather forecast.

250
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,660
Oh no.

251
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,430
This method is done for.

252
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,860
How about I make a sacrifice?

253
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,300
No.

254
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,260
I'm back.

255
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,140
-What are you doing?
-The whiteboard.

256
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,270
Whiteboard, hurry.

257
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,940
Reality, novel, space-time travel.

258
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,180
Are you studying

259
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,580
the company's new novel?

260
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,580
Yes.

261
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,520
This...

262
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,580
Ji Shu?

263
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,440
He's a character from a novel.

264
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,300
Qi.

265
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,180
So cool!

266
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,820
Studying the novel by yourselves.

267
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
The protagonist's name is your own.

268
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,220
Let's add a Ji Fei.

269
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,340
Sure.

270
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,620
How far along the story are you?

271
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,780
We talked about

272
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,370
how the protagonist wants to go back to the original world.

273
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,300
But we tried several ways

274
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,820
but it didn't work in the end.

275
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,750
It doesn't work?

276
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,220
Let's think about it together.

277
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,150
The three of us are better than one.

278
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,860
Here's the story.

279
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,420
Isn't it easy?

280
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,140
As authors, you can change

281
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,780
the people, situation and things in the story,

282
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,580
including

283
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:47,980
rules.

284
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,300
But

285
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,820
if you are in the story,

286
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,300
no matter what you do,

287
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,300
all stories will develop

288
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,160
according to its original track.

289
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,100
Why?

290
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,180
Because you're already in the game.

291
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,380
No matter what you do,

292
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,260
the rules are like God,

293
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,020
it oversees everything.

294
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,100
How can you fool it?

295
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,180
So,

296
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,220
you mean

297
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,360
we need people outside to change?

298
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,300
That's my brother.

299
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,360
Do you understand?

300
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,600
You don't understand?

301
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,430
Brother,

302
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,560
when you have a child, they must inherit your IQ.

303
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,220
Why don't you just whisper to a speaker?

304
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,100
What do you mean?

305
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,780
Nothing.

306
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,420
I'll leave you two alone.

307
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,220
It means I'm going back to sleep.

308
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,620
What does Ji Fei mean?

309
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,620
Have you ever read The Three-Body Problem?

310
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,010
You mean

311
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,500
the nature of the worlds of fan fiction and novels

312
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,180
are two-dimensional.

313
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,780
That's right.

314
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,700
Actually,

315
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,260
Ji Shu and Qi in this world

316
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,780
are not the Ji Shu and Qi in three-dimensional space.

317
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,640
Since we stepped into this world,

318
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,140
we've become people of two-dimensional space.

319
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,500
No matter what we do,

320
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,940
we can't change the rules.

321
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,260
[World of the Novel]

322
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,500
So if we want to go out,

323
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,660
we need to contact people outside to change the rules.

324
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,940
But we can't contact them now.

325
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,950
We can only wait.

326
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
It's all my fault.

327
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,300
Why did I write fan fiction.

328
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,700
I even risked my life for a couple I ship.

329
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Besides waiting,

330
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,220
we can also use the rules here.

331
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,700
How?

332
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,580
Do you remember how you got in?

333
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
I went through Bifengge.com.

334
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,380
Why did it drag you in?

335
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,380
I guess,

336
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,180
you want to change the ending

337
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,060
and it wants to change itself.

338
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,500
But it is something that belongs to the two-dimensional space.

339
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,980
So it needs someone

340
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,460
to help it achieve its goal.

341
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,580
The night the lightning changed the magnetic field

342
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,620
was its chance.

343
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,700
Are you talking about...

344
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,940
But you're different from me.

345
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,460
You belong to the two-dimensional world

346
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,579
and a person of the three-dimensional world.

347
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,490
That explains

348
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,500
why you were injured before,

349
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,940
but you can gradually heal.

350
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,140
Because before the ending is completely changed,

351
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,180
it can't let you die.

352
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,260
So,

353
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,940
that's why I can heal myself.

354
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,900
The worst result is

355
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,380
it completely changes itself.

356
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,440
And you become a person of this world.

357
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,530
What about Shan Hang?

358
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,850
He came out of nowhere these few times.

359
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,620
On the coastal road,

360
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,980
he just disappeared.

361
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,820
This is back to what I said before.

362
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,900
Only people from the three-dimensional space can change the rules.

363
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,160
And Shan Hang must have discovered this.

364
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,380
So, he set himself

365
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,310
a very simple rule of space travel.

366
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,620
Why?

367
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,020
Why are we

368
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,220
the ones who suffer

369
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,980
while he can have space travelling skills.

370
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,900
He can come whenever he wants.

371
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,100
Since someone threw the bait,

372
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,540
let's play along

373
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,660
and go back to the real world

374
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,550
to change the rules.

375
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,660
A man who works hard is so cool.

376
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,180
-What's going on?
-Qi.

377
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,420
Your love story with Mr. Ji

378
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,700
is so moving.

379
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,580
I won't say soap dramas

380
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,040
are too dramatic anymore.

381
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,700
Exactly.

382
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,380
Art really comes from life.

383
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,020
What are you talking about?

384
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,960
Ji Fei told us everything.

385
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,020
It’s not easy for you and Mr. Ji.

386
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,140
What did she tell you?

387
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,480
The love story between you and Mr. Ji.

388
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,100
You knew each other so early.

389
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,100
No wonder Mr. Ji wasn't at the company

390
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,380
for a long time.

391
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,140
He lost his memory

392
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,540
and was with you.

393
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,060
Could it be...

394
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,100
That's right.

395
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,500
What’s going on?

396
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,180
Why are Mr. Ji and Qi so serious?

397
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,020
Are they going to fire me because I forgot

398
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,750
to knock on the door a few times?

399
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,540
I want to know the details of

400
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,200
of Ye Xining's trending news.

401
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,400
On the day of the incident,

402
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,580
Xining told me the whole story.

403
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,460
Although her father was imprisoned,

404
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,500
he was framed.

405
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,140
They've been looking for the real culprit

406
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,290
who ran away with the money the past few years.

407
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,260
He was used.

408
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,820
We also published the truth

409
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,380
to the maximum extent.

410
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,500
That incident has a great impact.

411
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,020
The bankrupt company owner jumped off the building.

412
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,300
The victim's family requested

413
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,100
all the suspects not to mediate.

414
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,420
So, Xining's father was imprisoned.

415
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,940
How did you clarify it?

416
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,420
We answer honestly?

417
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,830
What's the problem?

418
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,220
Xining.

419
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,620
What's with your injury?

420
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,780
I'm fine.

421
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,300
So the victim's family hit her?

422
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,260
What injury?

423
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,700
That's all.

424
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
You may leave now.

425
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,620
Ji Shu.

426
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,420
Did I guess it right?

427
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,420
If it's just the victim's family,

428
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,620
it would be easier.

429
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,540
But I'm afraid Shan Hang might have pretended to be that person.

430
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,380
What do you mean?

431
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,440
Shan Hang's family

432
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,390
is the other side of this story.

433
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,300
What?

434
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,660
So his father

435
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,300
was implicated into prison too?

436
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,500
No.

437
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,060
He went bankrupt.

438
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,060
His father jumped off the building too?

439
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,500
No.

440
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,980
But...

441
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,580
Slowly.

442
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,340
Here, pass.

443
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,370
-I'm sorry, bro.
-I'm sorry.

444
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,100
Are you okay?

445
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,500
Come back.

446
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,720
Let me tell you,

447
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,300
his family used to be very rich.

448
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,010
I went to the same school as him.

449
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,460
But his family's company was ruined and bankrupted.

450
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,780
His dad was drunk all day long and in a bad mood.

451
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,490
His mother

452
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,340
is a very strong person.

453
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,580
She couldn't stand the shock.

454
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,640
They got divorced.

455
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,740
She even caused trouble at the school before.

456
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,940
She said the school made a mistake in her son's grades

457
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,780
as if she was crazy.

458
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,580
So miserable.

459
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,420
Should I compensate him?

460
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,220
A skinny camel is bigger than a horse.

461
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,550
It's not your business.

462
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,870
Are you okay?

463
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,540
I'm fine.

464
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,790
That's good.

465
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,420
Shan Hang.

466
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,690
We're going out for a meal.

467
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,290
Together?

468
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,550
Let's go.

469
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,340
Let's go.

470
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,610
Hey.

471
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,940
Don't listen to them.

472
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,300
Ji, his family is quite similar to yours.

473
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,780
His father also went bankrupt.

474
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,660
There's a lot of people who were jealous of his family

475
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,500
and many are sitting back and watching the show.

476
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,760
He doesn't care at all.

477
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,060
Whether they say it in front of him

478
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,860
or secretly,

479
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,380
it's like they're just

480
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,980
minding their own business.

481
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:33,920
Really?

482
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,260
So don't worry about it.

483
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,620
No need to care about what others say.

484
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,380
Let's eat.

485
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,380
So you two have similar experiences.

486
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,660
Lu Qiyu often invited him.

487
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,780
Later, we became close

488
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,980
and we had similar experiences,

489
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,040
we became friends.

490
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,940
We are similar and different.

491
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,820
Shan Hang is sensitive

492
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,810
but Yu is not.

493
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,180
Unintentional injury is the most hurtful.

494
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,140
That's right.

495
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,860
What happened after that?

496
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,920
Shan Hang's mother

497
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,870
has a strong desire to control.

498
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,140
She asked him to do the best in everything.

499
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,500
He can't be inferior to others.

500
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,420
As long as he resembles his father,

501
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,950
she would criticize Shan Hang very severely.

502
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,030
Plus the rumors around her,

503
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,980
and accumulated influence.

504
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,220
People

505
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,980
will change.

506
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,180
Who will help me

507
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,960
with this assignment?

508
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,740
Ji Shu, you be the one.

509
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,180
The teacher's son.

510
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,860
Good luck.

511
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,320
Read your book.

512
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,420
Shan Hang.

513
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,030
I saw you stood up just now.

514
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,660
Do you want to follow up on this assignment too?

515
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,180
Ji needs to help me,

516
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,900
so you can tell her

517
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,220
to give you the assignment.

518
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,580
Didn't you say

519
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,420
you want to learn more

520
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,700
by communicating with the teacher about the assignment?

521
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,380
No need.

522
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,140
By the way,

523
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,710
Ji Shu's research this time

524
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,500
is very good.

525
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,580
Don't think college

526
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,420
as a place for your retirement.

527
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,580
Shan Hang.

528
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,300
You didn't do well.

529
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,740
Some are wrong.

530
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,420
I've already reviewed them for you.

531
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,620
Go back and change it.

532
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,180
Okay.

533
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,940
Let's continue.

534
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,820
Most people like to see successful people

535
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,620
fall down.

536
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,460
By denying others,

537
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,560
they can show their own value and sense of presence.

538
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,100
Come to think of it,

539
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,230
he's quite pitiful.

540
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,540
But that's not the reason to target you.

541
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,060
Humans are really unpredictable.

542
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,700
Some people will work hard

543
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,660
to prove themselves.

544
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,860
Some people only blame others.

545
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,520
But those who are compared are also victims.

546
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,860
Before,

547
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,780
Shan Hang plotted against you.

548
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,980
Are you sad?

549
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,710
It's false to say it's not surprising.

550
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,980
But

551
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,520
I didn't expect him to hate me so much.

552
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,740
So in this story,

553
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,300
Ye Xining's father was used

554
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,020
and became an assailant who destroyed other's family.

555
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,050
And you wrote this story.

556
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
So Shan Hang subconsciously believed

557
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,300
Ye Xining's father

558
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,030
is the shadow of the assailant.

559
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,020
As the daughter of a criminal,

560
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,490
Xining shouldn't have lived such a good life.

561
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,290
It's possible

562
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,500
he used that to set this up.

563
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,780
He pretended to be the victim's family

564
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,900
to take revenge on Xining.

565
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,500
When she found out who he was,

566
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,830
she felt guilty,

567
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,660
so she didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

568
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,260
After her wound was discovered by others,

569
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
she covered it up.

570
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,240
But the more she hides,

571
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,820
the more we pay attention

572
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,540
and investigate the truth.

573
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,030
But don't we know the truth now?

574
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,140
What is his purpose?

575
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,020
He's provoking us?

576
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,750
He wants to lure us into the game

577
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,900
and remind me

578
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,920
we have similar experiences.

579
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,140
But because of you,

580
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,940
I changed.

581
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,860
So he thinks it's because of me.

582
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,660
If he kills me,

583
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,520
you'll become the same as before.

584
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,080
What are you thinking?

585
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,540
Nothing.

586
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,220
I'll take one step at a time.

587
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,380
We must solve the problem

588
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,580
so that we can go back.

589
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,530
What should we do now?

590
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,620
Go to the crew to wait for him.

591
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,860
Let's go now.

592
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,020
I asked Xining.

593
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,260
She'll go to the hospital

594
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,460
to be with her mom after work ends at 8 pm.

595
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,180
8 pm.

596
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,340
It's rush hour.

597
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,020
You should check the traffic of

598
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,420
the road to the hospital.

599
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,700
The main road.

600
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,820
It should be at the peak of rush hour.

601
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,100
Qi.

602
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,740
The backup video is an encrypted document in my computer.

603
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,090
The password is the date I entered this world

604
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,100
in the restaurant.

605
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,060
When you go back,

606
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,630
try to bring the video back.

607
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,510
Why are you telling me this?

608
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,100
Ji Shu, what are you planning?

609
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Don't be rash.

610
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,990
Maybe it's not Shan Hang who hurt Xining.

611
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,540
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

612
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,580
But I don't remember the time.

613
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
You'll remember.

614
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,980
Xining is out.

615
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,660
Shan Hang.

616
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,300
Don't do anything stupid.

617
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,560
We can talk things out.

618
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,270
I have nothing to tell you.

619
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,420
Tonight,

620
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,420
either I push her down from here,

621
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,620
or

622
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,800
you jump from here.

As long as you let her go,

625
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,030
I'll promise you anything.

626
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,980
But there's one thing I don't understand.

627
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,380
Why do you hate me so much?

[I'm sorry. Your content doesn't meet our requirements.]

629
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,220
Recently, an author named Ji Shu

630
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,140
became famous.

631
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,510
Have you read his novel?

632
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,740
Yes.

633
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,940
He knows exactly how to attract people's attention.

634
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,780
No matter what,

635
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,140
he should be considered master level now.

636
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,940
He's so lucky.

637
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,180
Ji Shu?

638

Why can you succeed again

639
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,820
in the field I like?

640
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,780
You became a popular author.

641
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,540
And I was rejected again and again.

642
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,980
Why are you pestering Qingmiao?

643
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,620
You messed up my life.

644
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,660
Qingmiao will come back to me

645

only when you completely disappear.

646
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,900
Shan Hang, you think too much.

647
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,980
There's nothing between us.

648
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980

649

as long as you let her go,

650
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,020
I won't let Qingmiao see me again.

653
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,900
you will never see her

654
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,020
and she will never see you again.

655
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,220
I'll give you one last time to think about it.

656

If you don't jump from here,

657
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,100
I'll push her down.

658
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,680

00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,900
I can help you find Shan Hang.

760
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,260
This

761
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,260
is what I found in his room.

762
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,090
[Dongguang Road]

763
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,100
[Room 1001, 307 Dongguang Road, Jintai District]

764
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,430
[Bifengge.com is being obliterated.]

765
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,750
[Bifengge.com is being obliterated.]

766
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,980
[Bifengge.com is being obliterated.]

767
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,420
Qi.

768
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,740
Qi!

769
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,340
Qi.

770
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:28,740
Go back and rest.

771
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,740
You've been here all night.

772
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,600
Leave him to me.

773
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,700
It's okay.

774
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,710
I'll wait for him to wake up.

775
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,020
My brother is awake.

776
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,380
Ji Shu.

777
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,780
You're awake.

778
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,380
Does your wound hurt?

779
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,610
Where do you hurt?

780
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,980
Where am I?

781
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,020
Ji Fei.

782
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,940
You are...

783
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Mr. Ji?

784
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,490
Of course.

785
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,750
My brother must be him.

786
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,610
Brother, wait for me.

787
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,810
I'll call the doctor.

788
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,860
Doctor!

789
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,820
Did something happen?

790
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,620
Why am I at the hospital?

791
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,020
And I got hurt.

792
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:16,900
Ji Shu,

793
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,500
can you hear me?

794
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,620
Say something.

795
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,630
Why are you looking at me like that?

796
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,260
Nothing.

797
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,300
Nothing.

798
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,820
The doctor is here.

799
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,500
He's fine.

800
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,860
We'll do a full body check tomorrow.

801
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,100
If there's no problem,

802
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,760
he'll be fine after some time.

803
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,940
Thank you, doctor.

804
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,010
Thank you.

805
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,760
You're almost recovered.

806
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,660
Qi.

807
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,890
What are you waiting for?

808
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,700
My brother is finally awake.

809
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,300
Come here.

810
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,380
You have no idea how worried Qi was

811
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,980
when you were in a coma.

812
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,510
What do you mean?

813
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,200
Did something happen these days?

814
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,630
Don’t you remember?

815
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:15,980
Mr. Ji,

816
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,850
may I ask

817
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,340
when your memory has stopped recently?

818
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,980
You were injured

819
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,380
and I took you to the hospital.

820
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,980
You wanted to leave in the middle.

821
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,220
After I found you,

822
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,900
you said you were hungry, so we went to the restaurant.

823
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,300
Brother, you lost your memory again?

824
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,780
Again?

825
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,420
You two...

826
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,620
Me and her?

827
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,500
Why are you covering my mouth?

828
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,060
Ji Fei.

829
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,180
Don't tell him about me.

830
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:57,860
Why?

831
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,340
Listen to me.

832
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,940
I'll explain to him myself.

833
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
It won't work.

834
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,540
What should I say

835
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,820
if he asks me about things that happened recently?

836
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
Just say nothing special happened.

837
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,780
Just tell him

838
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,300
Xining was in trouble

839
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,940
and he got hurt when saving her.

840
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,670
Are you sure?

841
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,260
Just say that.

842
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,460
Fine.

843
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,940
Why didn't I go back?

844
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,050
Where is Ji Shu?
