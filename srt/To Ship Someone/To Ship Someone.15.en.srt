[Episode 15]

4
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,740
Your coat.

5
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
Why do I like this kind of person?

6
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,180
Where can I get a taxi at this hour?

7
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,940
Bye, Mr. Ji.

8
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:08,940
Get in.

9
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,340
Are you getting in?

10
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,660
The speed of men getting angry

11
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,060
is not slower than women.

12
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,120
Mr. Ji,

13
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,760
what were you trying to say

14
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,340
on the road just now?

15
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,300
I forgot.

16
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:56,900
Mr. Ji,

17
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,860
you know that

18
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,140
I like you, right?

19
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,260
And then?

20
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,020
You know,

21
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,570
after thinking about it,

22
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,180
I think there's a huge gap between us.

23
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,060
Although

24
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,260
I like you,

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,340
but reality tells us

26
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,780
that people from two worlds

27
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,110
will never be together.

28
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,460
Ten years.

29
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,079
You've liked me for ten years.

30
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,180
How can you say that?

31
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,860
I was ignorant before.

32
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,020
Look.

33
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,020
You're from a rich family.

34
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,740
I'm just an ordinary employee.

35
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,300
This kind of plot

36
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,180
is only found in novels.

37
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,660
If you force him to be together,

38
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,900
the result

39
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,300
will be tragic.

40
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,570
So, Mr. Ji,

41
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,579
please keep a distance

42
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,570
for our sake, okay?

43
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,700
What if

44
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,420
I'm forcing us to be together?

45
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,950
What should I do?

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,630
Why are you suddenly so affectionate?

47
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,780
Yeah.

48
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,140
I suddenly realized that

49
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,100
I seem to like you.

50
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,020
Really?

51
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,300
Absolutely.

52
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,050
Mr. Ji,

53
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,180
if I didn’t understand Chinese,

54
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,020
your tone just now

55
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,020
sounded like you want

56
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,079
to murder someone.

57
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,459
If not,

58
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,300
should I agree?

59
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,980
A man's heart is really hard to grasp.

60
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,020
Did you two fight?

61
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,430
Did we fight?

62
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,620
No.

63
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,340
My brother's expression

64
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,810
is like saying "I'm angry"

65
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,930
with his face.

66
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,740
Did you offend him again?

67
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,490
Your brother suddenly wanted to be with me,

68
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,300
but I refused.

69
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,230
Does this count?

70
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,380
My brother

71
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,260
wants to be with you?

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,100
Ji Fei, aren't you going out?

73
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,560
Why are you still here?

74
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,060
I suddenly feel it's too hot.

75
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,060
I don't want to go.

76
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,020
Then go home.

77
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
What can you do

78
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,600
to make Ji Shu give up on me?

79
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,620
Are you delusional?

80
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,260
My brother, give up on you?

81
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,100
Aren't you happy that my brother likes you?

82
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,350
We are destined to be from two different worlds.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,180
Are you going to ruin your

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,820
unrequited love for ten years?

85
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,940
I don't want to.

86
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,490
But this ill-fated relationship

87
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,700
must be eliminated.

88
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,700
Did I miss something?

89
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,050
Why don't I understand?

90
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,380
Who pushed me into the water?

91
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,740
I think I've seen that scar somewhere.

92
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,460
So person at the water fountain

93
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,460
and the seaside is the same.

94
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,050
Is it really Yu Le?

95
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,060
I didn’t open the website this time.

96
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,610
How did I enter?

97
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,440
Am I going to soak in the sea for two hours?

98
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,300
I'll die.

99
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,300
Isn't this a romance drama?

100
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,060
Why is there suspense?

101
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,020
God!

102
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,020
Please help me.

103
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,820
My brother likes mature, intelligent

104
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,010
[Ji Fei]

105
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,940
and gentle girls.

106
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,810
It's up to you.

107
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,180
The most important thing now

108
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,180
is to let Ji Shu know my true colors

109
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,940
and give up liking me.

110
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,380
I shouldn't have claimed that I like him

111
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,900
and got myself involved.

112
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,140
Brother, look.

113
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,820
Who's here?

114
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,820
We're back.

115
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,730
You're back.

116
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,220
I was going to buy groceries.

117
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,780
What do you want for dinner?

118
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,580
Shrimps, crabs

119
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,740
and hairtail.

120
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,780
You can only choose two.

121
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,370
Then

122
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,940
clams and shrimp.

123
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,460
Okay.

124
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,940
Be good and do your homework

125
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,820
and wait for me.

126
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,380
Okay.

127
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,050
Be good.

128
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,500
Don't play. Do your homework.

129
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,780
Okay.

130
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,820
Shu.

131
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,370
Didn't I ask you to do your homework at home?

132
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,500
Why are you playing here?

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,620
I'm sorry, Mom.

134
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,370
I'm not forbidding you from playing.

135
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,340
Didn't I tell you to play after finishing your homework?

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,580
Mom, I didn't forget.

137
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,940
I just finished my homework.

138
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,340
You did?

139
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,260
I wronged you.

140
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,340
Mom.

141
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,020
Mom, what's wrong?

142
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,620
Mom.

143
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,740
Son.

144
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,740
-Hurry. Make a call. -What is it?

145
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,020
Okay.

146
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,020
Call 120.

147
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,620
Hello?

148
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,660
Tell them

149
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,620
Apartment 141, Building 22, Yuqiao Gardens, Shangqiao District.

150
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,500
Hurry up.

151
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,860
Hurry up.

152
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,020
Hurry, call your dad.

153
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,500
How was your exam?

154
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,010
Good.

155
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,750
That's good.

156
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,460
I have something

157
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,500
to discuss with you.

158
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,220
Whatever.

159
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,640
I haven't told you yet.

160
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,770
I know.

161
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,780
It's a divorce.

162
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,020
That's good.

163
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
I'll go in first.

164
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,540
We're here to see you.

165
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,100
Why are you so surprised?

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,360
Are you having a hard time at work?

167
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,610
Why

168
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,420
are you here?

169
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,900
Did you forget?

170
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,980
Today is the weekend.

171
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,380
It's family day.

172
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,100
Yes.

173
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,850
Today is the weekend.

174
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,380
You can't just work.

175
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,890
If we don't come to see you,

176
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,370
you won't even call us.

177
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,980
Alright, I won't argue with you.

178
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,180
I'll cook something delicious for you.

179
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,420
Thank you.

180
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,830
Brother.

181
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,900
Are you still angry

182
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,140
because Qi rejected you yesterday?

183
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,900
No.

184
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,380
Fine, whatever you say.

185
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,020
I'll go help.

186
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,140
Mom, let me help you.

187
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,150
Come and sit.

188
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,620
Work is neverending.

189
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,460
You should rest when you need to.

190
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,380
How is it?

191
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,620
How is the company going recently?

192
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,860
I heard that a celebrity in your company

193
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,660
broke up

194
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,740
in less than two months.

195
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,260
It's all over the place.

196
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,260
It's settled.

197
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,780
That's good.

198
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,260
By the way, Fei told me

199
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,380
one of your employees likes you.

200
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,620
Really?

201
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,900
Where is this girl from?

202
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,020
How old is she?

203
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,140
How is her personality?

204
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,860
That's not true.

205
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,660
Her name is Qi.

206
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,900
I don't know her age

207
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,380
but she's quite cute.

208
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,190
As for her personality...

209
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,280
I'll open the door.

210
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,380
Who is it?

211
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,860
Didn't I tell you

212
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,260
my brother likes mature and gentle girls.

213
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
What are you doing?

214
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,480
Where is Ji Shu?

215
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,850
He's here.

216
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,940
Where is Ji Shu?

217
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,420
Ask him to cook for me.

218
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,990
You heard me?

219
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,890
Go cook.

220
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,130
What are you doing?

221
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,340
Who are you?

222
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,140
Who are you?

223
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,020
Qi.

224
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,620
This is my mom.

225
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,540
This is my dad.

226
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,260
Your parents?

227
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,980
I thought

228
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,020
you and Ji Shu are biological siblings.

229
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,380
Of course.

230
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,000
Hello, uncle and aunt.

231
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,850
It's not convenient today.

232
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,110
I'll come another day.

233
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,010
No.

234
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
If Ji Shu's parents hate me,

235
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,500
wouldn't it be easier for him to give up on me?

236
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,660
Since you're here,

237
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,380
stay for dinner.

238
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,700
Okay, Ji Shu.

239
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,620
Ji Shu.

240
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,140
Before dinner,

241
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,780
I have to remind you.

242
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,260
Don't forget the mansion

243
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
you promised me.

244
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,500
Of course, I think

245
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,300
your love for me worth more than a million yuan.

246
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,980
Song Yanqi, you're disgusting.

247
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,020
How much do you think my love is worth then?

248
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,420
Bro, why are you playing along with me?

249
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,500
Shouldn't you say,

250
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,420
"You mooney hungry woman,

251
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,980
don't come to me again?"

252
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,740
Ten million?

253
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,620
Five... five?

254
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,260
Okay.

255
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,500
O... Okay?

256
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,140
This is five million.

257
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,260
No problem.

258
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,230
As long as you're happy.

259
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,340
Oh my god.

260
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,020
A true love that worths five million yuan.

261
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,140
Can I stay in this world

262
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,860
and be with the second male lead?

263
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,740
You wish.

264
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,860
Ji Shu,

265
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,780
you're willing to spend a fortune for others.

266
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,020
Why don't you even give me five million?

267
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,420
You even going to give me a billion yuan mansion.

268
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,140
What?

269
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,590
A billion yuan mansion?

270
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,140
Ji Shu.

271
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,380
Why do you like this kind of person?

272
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,740
I don't allow you two to be together.

273
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
You're getting out of line.

274
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,870
Why would you get involved with

275
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,020
such a woman?

276
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,540
Here it comes.

277
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,380
The script is finally on track.

278
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,900
You're leaving

279
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
before getting the money?

280
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,740
You're driving me crazy.

281
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,740
Ji Shu, listen to your father.

282
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,220
Break up with her.

283
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,500
Uncle, auntie,

284
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,740
we are true love.

285
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,900
How can you separate us

286
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,420
because of our different status?

287
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,220
I don't allow you to be together.

288
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,340
You want money, right?

289
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,400
I can give it to you.

290
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:48,980
Uncle.

291
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,020
I don't want to leave him.

292
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,340
If you want to break us up,

293
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,300
I...

294
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,210
I...

295
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,900
I must take it further.

296
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,860
I will...

297
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,140
I'll kill myself.

298
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,380
Am I crazy enough?

299
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,100
You can't keep a psychopath.

300
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,610
Get rid of me.

301
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,700
Don't move. Calm down.

302
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,900
Brother, what kind of short play is this?

303
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,490
Aren’t you afraid

304
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,020
that Qi won't be able to marry into our family?

305
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,140
She’ll be so happy.

306
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,900
Miss, let's talk.

307
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,010
Put the knife down.

308
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,020
Don't hurt yourself.

309
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,420
Okay? Put the knife down.

310
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,780
You couples nowadays

311
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,620
like cosplaying that much?

312
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,720
Just watch her act.

313
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,610
That's a real knife.

314
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,220
It's okay.

315
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,780
Ji Shu,

316
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,020
if we can't be together in this life,

317
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,500
we'll meet in the next life.

318
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,820
You're holding the knife wrong.

319
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,020
Lady,

320
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,900
I'll give you five million.

321
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,860
Leave now.

322
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,020
Ji Fei, bring the cheque.

323
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,960
This...

324
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm really going to get it.

325
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,820
You deal with it.

326
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,410
Hurry up.

327
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,020
Five million from a rich family.

328
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,220
So this is how it feels to be hit by money.

329
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,420
It feels so good.

330
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,380
Put the knife down.

331
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:01,980
Mom. Dad.

332
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,820
Give it to me.

333
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,859
They're really giving it to me?

334
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,540
If I accept it,

335
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,770
will it be considered as blackmail?

336
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,900
Since you have the money,

337
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,700
leave now.

338
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,339
Ji Shu,

339
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,220
after I leave,

340
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,140
don't be too sad.

341
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,480
I've paid you back.

342
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,420
Don't call the police.

343
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,770
Ji Shu.

344
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,380
Calm down.

345
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,240
You're old enough to get married.

346
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Instead of dating these people,

347
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,220
you might as well

348
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,750
marry Uncle Xu's daughter.

349
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,540
She's not an indecent person.

350
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,010
You...

351
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,820
All right.

352
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,460
Calm down, everyone.

353
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,380
Ji, sit down.

354
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,860
Have some tea and fruits.

355
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,820
Calm down.

356
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,140
What is this?

357
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,180
I'll cook for you.

358
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,420
Don't be angry.

359
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,190
Let me help you, mom.

360
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,780
My performance

361
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,110
should be enough to make Ji Shu forget about being together.

362
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,110
[Cheque]

363
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,140
No way.

364
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,460
You found out so soon?

365
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,980
Won't my acting just now

366
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,570
be in vain?

367
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,190
Have some fish. The fish is delicious.

368
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,420
Have some shrimp.

369
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,620
Son,

370
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,180
you can't always be busy with work.

371
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,580
You should pay attention to your life.

372
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,100
Your dad and I are not against you dating.

373
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,980
But it depends on the person.

374
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,860
If you find a decent girl,

375
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,780
we will definitely support you.

376
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,660
But look at the girl just now.

377
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,590
-She's... -Mom.

378
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,540
Brother, peel a shrimp for me.

379
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,540
Don't you have hands?

380
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,380
Fine, I'll do it.

381
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,220
Dad.

382
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,180
Help me get this dish.

383
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,480
Thank you, dad.

384
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,860
You eat first.

385
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,820
Your mother is right.

386
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,140
You're an adult.

387
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,880
You should know how to tell good from bad.

388
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I'll

389
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,230
go back to the study.

390
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,580
Stop!

391
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:11,860
Ji Shu.

392
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,630
That woman is not a good person.

393
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,700
Just break up.

394
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,620
Are you angry at your family

395
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,120
because of outsiders?

396
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,780
Look at you.

397
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,340
Why are you so fierce?

398
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,620
Why are you angry?

399
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,900
But son,

400
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,860
your dad is right.

401
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,620
That girl is really not suitable for you.

402
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,300
Do you remember

403
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Xu Tiantian?

404
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,980
Aren't you high school classmates?

405
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,300
She has been abroad for many years.

406
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,220
Now that she's back,

407
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,820
your dad and I are thinking

408
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,070
of arranging a meeting for both of you.

409
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,380
I guess you forgot what she looks like.

410
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,540
Let me look for her photo.

411
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,620
Here.

412
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,380
Look.

413
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,780
Isn't she beautiful?

414
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,180
She's getting prettier.

415
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,380
Xu Tiantian?

416
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,220
Yes, you remember.

417
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,420
How could it be her?

418
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,020
I remember there's no such character

419
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,940
in the novel.

420
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,140
I discussed it with Uncle Xu,

421
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,140
to let you meet her some other day.

422
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,800
Mom, I'm going back to my room.

423
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,860
Do you hear me?

424
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,180
Enough.

425
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,140
Stop shouting.

426
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,420
Why are you shouting

427
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,860
during mealtime?

428
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,700
I know.

429
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,460
I’ll get prepared.

430
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,820
-Is it Yu Le who pushed me into the water? -Don’t worry.

431
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,860
Why is he in the real world?

432
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,620
What’s with the scar on Yu Le’s hand?

433
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,830
I remember it wasn't there before.

434
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,580
If it was Yu Le who pushed me into the water,

435
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,580
why did he do that?

436
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,940
To change their plot?

437
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,380
But how did he appear in the real world?

438
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,140
Could this person...

439
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,820
exist in both worlds?

440
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,090
Now, a character

441
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,690
who looks exactly like Lin Qingmiao appeared.

442
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,700
Unless this person

443
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,300
knows me and Qi well.

444
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,550
[Information on Bifengge.com]

445
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,900
Is it really him?

446
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,060
How did he enter the story?

447
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,860
What’s the scar

448
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,820
on Yu Le’s hand?

449
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
Does Mr. Ji know

450
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,540
you're transferring to work for Xining?

451
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,180
Mr. Zhen,

452
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,650
I came to beg you to not tell Mr. Ji.

453
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,140
No, Qi.

454
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,700
I think

455
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,820
you should tell Mr. Ji.

456
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,620
After all, he’s the boss, right?

457
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,300
Also,

458
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
you're the assistant of the CEO now.

459
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,980
If I help you transfer,

460
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,330
wouldn't that be inappropriate?

461
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,780
You can talk it out,

462
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,460
right?

463
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Fighting can't solve the problem.

464
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
It's not about fighting.

465
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,390
It's hard to explain to you.

466
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,780
Just think that I finally realized

467
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,100
it’s impossible between me and Mr. Ji.

468
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,300
I’ve decided not to bother him anymore.

469
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,220
Qi.

470
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,240
It's like this.

471
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,480
When two people are together,

472
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,380
they will encounter some difficulties,

473
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,980
right?

474
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,700
You can't give up

475
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,940
just because of a little setback.

476
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,780
Listen to me.

477
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,820
I'll call him.

478
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,900
You two can talk it out

479
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,620
and communicate.

480
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,380
Both of you should make everything clear, okay?

481
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,180
No.

482
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,620
Mr. Zhen,

483
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,140
do you know how hard it was for me to make this decision?

484
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,140
It’s not that I don’t like Mr. Ji,

485
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,900
but

486
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,060
his parents

487
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,790
didn't allow us to be together.

488
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,620
I can't let him go against his parents

489
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,880
and be an unfilial son.

490
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,300
Even if he is

491
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,060
fighting against his parents for me,

492
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,140
but as time goes by,

493
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,940
it'll harm their relationship.

494
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,540
I can't help you.

495
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,540
Why not?

496
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,380
Because I can't separate

497
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
the couple I ship.

498
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,540
Is the couple you ship...

499
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,780
Forget it. Let’s get straight to the point.

500
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,620
I don’t like Mr. Ji anymore.

501
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,620
I like someone else who is

502
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,220
a hundred times better than him.

503
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,080
I gave up on him.

504
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,900
Mr. Ji’s father gave me five million yuan.

505
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,330
Why should I refuse the money?

506
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:10,900
You...

507
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,380
You left Mr. Ji

508
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,700
for money?

509
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,700
The couple I ship suddenly ends like that?

510
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,620
This is called timely prevention.

511
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,820
Qi,

512
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,430
I didn’t expect you to be such a woman.

513
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,900
Mr. Ji is a good man.

514
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,860
Leave now.

515
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Mr. Ji is a good man.

516
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,100
He will find his true love sooner or later.

517
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,340
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

518
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,140
Qi.

519
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
What should I do?

520
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,700
What happened?

521
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,140
Mr. Ji.

522
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,050
Do you know

523
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,770
Qi is transferred to be Ye Xining's assistant?

524
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,200
I know.

525
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,330
He said he knew.

526
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,380
Looks like my couple has really ended tragically.

527
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,540
Today, Xining...

528
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,780
What's Xining's schedule for today?

529
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,540
Don't cry.

530
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,460

she'll film the last two scenes for Ziheng's MV.

534
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,430
We'll join the film crew in the afternoon.

535
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,870
I'm going to visit the crew. Are you going?

536
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,140
I...

537
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,020
I have nothing to do.

538
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,240
Let's go together.

539
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,290
Okay, I'll arrange it.

540
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,180
Dismiss.

541
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,130
Everyone, stop crying.

543
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,370

00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,900
is tomorrow.

546
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,900
Whether you can seize this opportunity

547
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,100
is up to you.

548
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,460
Don't forget your dream.

549
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,220
Don't let everyone down.

550
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,460
By the way,

551
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,300
I heard that the music video

552
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,460
of Ye Xining and Wang Ziheng is doing very well.

553
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,180
She'll also join The Track's film crew today.

554
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,300
The directors she worked with

555
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,380
praised her.

556
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,610
Although I don't like Ye Xining,

557
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,940
but

558
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,420
I admire her now.

559
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,520
Because she's clear-minded.

560
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,940
I hope you won't let me down.

561
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,460
I'll take care of their break-up's

562
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,900
follow-up problems.

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,700
is to keep an eye on him

565

so that he can read the script

566
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,820
and communicate with the performance teacher.

567
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,280
Okay, I'll go get the food.

568
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,920
Xining, what's wrong?

569
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,980
My mom is in the hospital.

570
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,820
I have to go to the hospital.

571
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,750
I'll go with you.

572

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,130
please tell film crew

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,140
we might be late.

575
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,620
Okay.

576
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,300
Call me if you need anything.

577
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,340
Mr. Ji.

578
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,530
Yingjun.

579
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,780
What brings you here?

580
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,440
Where is Qi?

581
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,260
She went to the hospital.

582
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,820
What happened to her?

583
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,060
Why did she go to the hospital?

584
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,620
No.

585
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,620
She went to the hospital with Xining.

586
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,420
Hey, you...

587
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,220
Well done.

588
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,140
Only such a misunderstanding

589
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,740
can prolong the protagonist's relationship.

590
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,140
In the future,

591
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,540
keep it up.

592
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,860
Why are you here?

593
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,860
Let's talk.

594
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,060
Sure.

595
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,220
I won’t beat around the bush.

596
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
You can’t stay with Yu Le now.

597
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,300
I was the one who hired you.

598
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,900
I will take responsibility for your future.

599
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,630
I promise you’ll be satisfied.

600
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Thank you, Yan.

601
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,900
I understand

602
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,220
and will cooperate.

603
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,620
But forget about work.

604
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,820
I want to rest for a while.

605
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,420
Okay.

606
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,940
Let me know if you need anything.

607
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,340
Okay.

608
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,900
I have something to tell you.

609
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,780
You can’t

610
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,290
come disturb Yu Le for the time being.

611
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,580
His task now

612
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,220
is to focus on his career.

613
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,820
As for relationships...

614
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,460
Yan, don’t worry.

615
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
I also hope Yu Le has a better career.

616
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,460
If you don’t mind,

617
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,110
I'll say goodbye to him.

618
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,620
No problem. Go ahead.

619
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,530
Yu Le.

620
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,030
Why are you here?

621
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,100
I came to see you.

622
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,460
Are you okay?

623
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,220
I fell asleep that day.

624
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,950
You did something, didn't you?

625
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,340
What are you talking about?

626
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,900
I don't understand.

627
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,540
Xitian.

628
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,180
I don't want to think badly of you.

629
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,980
But I can't figure it out.

630
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,990
How could it be such a coincidence?

631
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,700
What coincidence?

632
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,810
Getting hurt.

633
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
Stalking photos.

634
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,800
Revealing the agreement.

635
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,380
Creditors.

636
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
Making me go away.

637
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,580
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?

638
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,380
Sometimes,

639
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,570
things pile up together.

640
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,060
It's normal.

641
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,180
Yes.

642
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,820
It's normal.

643
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,810
You suspect me?

644
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,340
Shouldn't I?

645
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,460
Yu Le,

646
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,820
when you asked me this,

647
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,900
you already think I did it,

648
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,620
right?

649
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,580
Yes,

650
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,180
I did it.

651
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,380
I did it because I like you.

652
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,220
And I know

653
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,140
you like me too.

654
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,120
The agreement tied you up.

655
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,440
I want to help you get rid of Ye Xining.

656
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,340
Help me?

657
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,910
You exposed the agreement.

658
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,060
How did you know?

659
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,620
Who told you that?

660
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,300
Who told me?

661
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,780
You told me.

662
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,380
You said it when you were drunk.

663
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,060
You said you were in a contractual relationship.

664
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,340
You told me!

665
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,700
Impossible.

666
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,460
You've already broken up.

667
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,620
Why are you laughing?

668
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
I'm laughing...

669
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,380
because I was muddleheaded in the past.

670
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,940
I can’t even see who I really like.

671
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,540
Yu Le,

672
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,220
even if you know I did it,

673
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,740
I don't regret it.

674
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,420
I just tried my best

675
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,540
to get what I want.

676
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,380
And from this moment on,

677
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,460
you are no longer what I want.

678
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,380
Don't worry.

679
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,810
I won't bother you.

680
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,980
Yu Le.

681
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,140
Ye Xining has got what she wants.

682
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,100
Do you think she'll still be with you?

683
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,420
Brother, time to eat.

684
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,140
Where are you going?

685
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,780
[Outpatient] [Help the People Live a Healthy Life]

686
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,220
Nurse, how is my mom?

687
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,180
The doctor is doing an examination.

688
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,100
Don't worry.

689
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,620
No.

690
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,820
Everything will be fine.

691
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,480
The nurse told me not to worry.

692
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,540
What?

693
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,250
Didn't I tell you

694
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,090
not to leave my sight

695
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,580
within 24 hours?

696
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,010
Don't forget my words.

697
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,340
Mr. Ji, I'm fine.

698
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,989
What if something happens?

699
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,659
Are you caring about me?

700
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,420
No.

701
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,260
Why are you so worried about me?

702
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,590
Did you forget about the fountain?

703
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,380
It's daytime now.

704
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,100
He can't commit a crime in broad daylight.

705
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,429
Can you guarantee that?

706
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,139
Qi,

707
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,340
I have something to tell you.

708
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,300
Go ahead.

709
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,199
-Actually, I... -Xining.

710
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,780
Xining, what happened?

711
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,980
Are you hurt?

712
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,739
Let me see.

713
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,489
Qi.

714
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:56,840
Qi.

715
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,470
I'm glad you're fine.

716
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,730
I'm glad you're fine.

717
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,290
Yu Le,

718
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,500
I want to ask you a question.

719
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,220
Go ahead.

720
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,140
What was the scar on your right hand?

721
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,550
It's fake.

722
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,960
It was a guest appearance in a drama

723
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,020
and the character in it needed it.

724
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,970
It was fake.

725
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,300
You didn't push me.

726
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,890
Why would I push you?

727
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,500
Who else could it be?

728
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,020
In the real world,

729
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
did I make an enemy who wants me dead?

730
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,180
Your scar was fake?

731
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,900
Why do you care so much about my scar?

732
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,100
Do you remember what the scar

733
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,860
looked like?

734
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,580
It was around here.

735
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,910
I don't know the length.

736
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,900
The man in black has something similar.

737
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,540
I don't know if I didn't see it clearly

738
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,850
or if I was wrong.

739
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,560
Is the wound on your right hand

740
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,980
still okay?

741
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,020
It still hurts when it rains.

742
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,580
Let's go.

743
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,740
Why are you pulling me again?

744
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,500
Yu Le.

745
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,420
Xining's mom is hurt.

746
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,490
Stay with her.

747
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,110
Don't worry.

748
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,540
She'll be fine.

749
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,380
You should go.

750
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,500
It's not good to be photographed.

751
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,100
I'll be frank if I get caught.

752
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,860
I'm courting you again.

753
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:35,780
You...

754
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,380
I know your mom's sick

755
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,440
and you don't want to talk about this.

756
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,590
I just want to show you my attitude.

757
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,780
Xining.

758
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,580
It was my fault.

759
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,420
I didn't give you a sense of security.

760
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,380
Now I just want to be with you

761
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
when you need me.

762
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,580
I can just keep quiet.

763
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,820
Are you Ms. Dai Shufen's family?

764
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,210
Yes, I'm her daughter.

765
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,860
You can go through the hospitalization procedure first.

766
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,060
She still has some tests to do.

767
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,300
Doctor, what happened to my mom?

768
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,150
I'm not sure.

769
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,420
But judging from all her symptoms,

770
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,900
we can't rule out the possibility of lung cancer.

771
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,260
Judging from the patient's symptoms,

772
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,900
she's been suffering for a long time.

773
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
You should have come to the hospital earlier.

774
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,630
Lung cancer.

775
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,860
Xining!

776
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,540
Xining.

777
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,550
Don't worry.

778
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,900
She just said "can't rule out,"

779
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,940
maybe it's not cancer.

780
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,420
Yes.

781
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,420
It might be fine.

782
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,500
Xining.

783
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,430
This way.

784
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,660
Mr. Ji, why did you drag me out again?

785
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,540
I'm Ji Shu.

786
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,260
I know.

787
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,020
You know?

788
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,340
Xining, wait for me.

789
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,180
I'll be right back.

790
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,820
Okay.

791
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,060
This is the hospital.

792
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,740
I hope when you're

793
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,900
looking for entertainment news,

794
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,780
you should be aware of the location.

795
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
I know what you're trying to make up.

796
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,210
If I see any false news,

797
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,870
I'll sue you until you go bankrupt.

798
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,500
How do I know if you're threatening me

799
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,900
to cover up the truth?

800
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,940
Truth?

801
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,020
Yu Le, let go.

802
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,980
I came to the hospital because my family is sick.

803
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,100
If you're going to expose it, go ahead.

804
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,660
Let's go.

805
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,010
Ye Xining's father is in jail.

806
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,380
Her family is in debt,

807
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,800
she has ulterior motives to be with Yu Le.

808
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,220
Didn't you forget

809
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,660
what happened that day because you got drink?

810
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,260
Drunk...

811
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,460
Drunk?

812
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,660
When did I ever get drunk?

813
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,060
I mean,

814
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,030
I'm not Ji Shu of this world.

815
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,340
Yu Le.

816
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,380
Why is the timing always so bad?

817
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:15,980
Qi.

818
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,630
Thank you for telling me about Xining.

819
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,180
Why did you come out so early?

820
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:20,900
Why don't you...

821
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,010
Now her mom's sick.

822
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,490
If I keep pestering her

823
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,220
and say something irrelevant,

824
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,540
she'll be troubled.

825
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,380
Then you...

826
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,860
I'll pursue Xining again.

827
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,820
Really?

828
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,340
I didn't do many things well

829
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,060
in the past.

830
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,940
I've already told Xitian.

831
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,860
I'll try my best to prove to Xining too.

832
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,580
Good job.

833
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,540
As long as you really like her,

834
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,740
you will be together.

835
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,740
I hope so.

836
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,190
Don't worry.

837
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,650
With me assisting you,

838
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,220
I'll definitely help you get Xining back.

839
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,940
Thank you.

840
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,380
Don't mention it.

841
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,950
I'll go back now.

842
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,260
Please take care of

843
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,660
to Xining.

844
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,580
It's nothing.

845
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,460
Even though the guy chasing the girl is old-fashioned,

846
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,100
but why do I like it so much?

847
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,980
What did he just say to me?

848
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,260
Can't you be more careful, Song Yanqi?

849
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,520
What's wrong with you?

850
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,980
-Luckily you're fine. -That car...

851
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,980
What did you call me?

852
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,940
Song Yanqi.

853
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,010
What?

854
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,660
Aren't you Song Yanqi?

855
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,260
Song Yanba?

856
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,990
Song Yanjiu?

857
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,050
What...

858
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,460
What were you talking about?

859
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,180
I...

860
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,860
I said,

861
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,380
I'm not from this world.

862
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,700
I'm just like you.

863
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,050
I'm Ji Shu from the real world.
