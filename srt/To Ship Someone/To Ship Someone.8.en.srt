[Episode 8]

4
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,780
This Cantonese breakfast restaurant is really good.

5
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,060
Do you often come here?

6
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,090
Are you still with Shan Hang?

7
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,740
Yes.

8
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,420
What's wrong?

9
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,840
Nothing. I'm just asking.

10
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,980
Have more.

11
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,540
Mr. Ji?

12
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,020
Are you camping here too?

13
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,980
Me too.

14
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,110
What a coincidence.

15
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,820
Do you mind if I set my tent up next to yours?

16
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,080
You don't mind, do you?

17
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,910
You got it wrong.

18
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,100
I got it wrong?

19
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,060
What's wrong?

20
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,820
Here.

21
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,100
Song Yanqi.

22
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,820
I don't think you're camping here.

23
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,180
You are actually stalking me, aren't you?

24
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,579
Lu Qiyu told you my schedule, right?

25
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,780
How is that possible?

26
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,220
It's really a coincidence.

27
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,579
Camping is popular now.

28
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,740
I'm following the trend,

29
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,540
not you.

30
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,860
Isn't it easy?

31
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,380
It's not that difficult.

32
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,220
Ji Shu.

33
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,820
Ji Shu, what's going on?

34
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,260
Ji Shu.

35
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,030
Pass me the hammer.

36
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,180
Why are you looking at me?

37
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,110
Watch how I do it.

38
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,420
My heart was racing just now.

39
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,580
Song Yanqi, calm down.

40
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,900
Beauty will mislead you.

41
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,940
Don't get yourself into trouble

42
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,140
before you get him.

43
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,340
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

44
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,420
Ji Shu.

45
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,850
Why are you with her?

46
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,909
It's a coincidence.

47
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Lin Qingmiao, why are you here too?

48
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,820
Ji Shu.

49
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,620
Long time no see.

50
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,110
Long time no see.

51
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,600
A coincidence?

52
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,740
I think she has an ulterior motive.

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
So what?

54
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,820
So do you!

55
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,600
Have a seat.

56
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,700
Mr. Ji,

57
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,940
since I had tea at your house last time,

58
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,060
I suddenly realized the beauty of drinking tea.

59
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Teach me how to make tea.

60
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,860
Use mine.

61
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,100
Wait a minute.

62
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,750
Okay.

63
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,620
Song Yanqi.

64
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,420
We haven't seen Ji Shu for a long time.

65
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,480
We want to catch up.

66
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm afraid it's inconvenient for you to be here.

67
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,020
Mr. Ji.

68
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,180
Am I interrupting you?

69
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:58,940
No.

70
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,260
Ji Shu.

71
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,510
After so many years,

72
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,580
your temper hasn't changed at all.

73
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,340
It's impossible to change.

74
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,420
This is a scene where an ex and current boyfriend meet.

75
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,980
I called you earlier,

76
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,700
but you changed your number?

77
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,560
I did, long ago.

78
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,740
But why did you call me?

79
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,700
I encountered something before

80
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,060
and would like to ask for your help.

81
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,390
But it's all solved now.

82
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,140
Why don't you exchange your contact information now?

83
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,020
After all, you've known each other for so many years since you were classmates.

84
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,880
Exchange your phone numbers in case you may need it.

85
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,620
Sure.

86
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,170
It's quite hot today.

87
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,540
I brought ice cream.

88
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,340
I'll go get it.

89
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,780
Ji Shu.

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,180
You haven't introduced who this is.

91
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,470
Girlfriend?

92
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,470
A friend.

93
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,140
It's rare.

94
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,500
After so many years,

95
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,360
you finally have a new friend.

96
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,140
You're much better now?

97
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,780
Mr. Ji.

98
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,740
It seems that

99
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,380
you're not that close with this friend.

100
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,170
No one asks about others' illness

101
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,380
right away.

102
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,580
Aren't you obviously

103
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,500
healthy?

104
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,659
Qi, I only brought three.

105
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,700
Sorry.

106
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,150
Ji Shu, here.

107
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,320
No, thanks.  Give it to her.

108
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,620
Since Mr. Ji insisted on giving it to me,

109
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,720
I have to accept it.

110
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,180
If you don't want to,

111
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,860
I won't force you though.

112
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,150
Here you are.

113
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,100
Since you want to give it to me,

114
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,970
I'll take it.

115
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,580
Don't eat too much cold food.

116
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,980
It's bad for your health.

117
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,910
Thank you for your concern.

118
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,180
So ugly.

119
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,940
You look like a kitten eating secretly.

120
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,500
You're ugly.

121
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,740
Stop it.

122
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,940
It's embarrassing

123
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,360
in front of others.

124
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,780
What are you doing?

125
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,179
Now you have really become a kitten.

126
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,870
Let me take you to wash up over there, okay?

127
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,299
Okay.

128
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,179
Let's go.

129
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,780
Are you angry?

130
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,110
Do you want some?

131
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,430
I'm not eating. You can have it all.

132
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,940
Is it good?

133
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,780
Wait.

134
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,080
You got it on your lips.

135
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,700
What are you doing?

136
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,220
Come on.

137
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,660
They didn't need to do that.

138
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,130
Why were they showing off their love?

139
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,940
Why bother?

140
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,940
It's almost written on her face

141
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,860
that she has lived a better life

142
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,390
after breaking up with you.

143
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,340
Mr. Ji.

144
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,840
As the saying goes,

145
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,460
there are other fish in the sea.

146
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,180
Why waste the whole forest

147
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,710
for a crooked neck tree?

148
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,580
No wonder he wrote a supporting character like that.

149
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,440
He is like writing about himself.

150
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,200
People who are named Ji Shu are so miserable.

151
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,760
You think too much.

152
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,620
You are just reluctant to admit it.

153
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,220
Alright, I thought too much.

154
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,820
Mr. Ji.

155
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,380
I brought barbecue tools and ingredients.

156
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,580
Do you want barbecue?

157
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,790
-Oh you want it? Then I'll grill some for you.
-No.

158
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,830
Here, Mr. Ji.

159
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,420
I just grilled it. Try it.

160
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,660
Thank you. I don't eat barbecue.

161
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,320
Well...

162
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,300
The barbecue contains heterocyclic amine and benzopyrene.

163
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,490
There are cancer-causing risks.

164
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,820
Ji Shu never eats these.

165
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,900
We can't talk about the amount of toxicity aside from the dosage.

166
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,890
It's okay to eat it once in a while.

167
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,220
Ji Shu doesn't eat that.

168
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,060
What's wrong with eating it occasionally?

169
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,860
Song Yanqi.

170
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,140
A person's lifestyle

171
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,940
won't change.

172
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,190
So what if he tries?

173
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,360
Don't make yourself feel so wronged.

174
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,340
You need to learn to fight fire with fire

175
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,740
to stimulate her inner jealousy,

176
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,650
and let her know that she cares about you

177
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,980
so she'll be regretful.

178
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,220
You...

179
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,390
How is it? Is it good?

180
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,340
Not bad.

181
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,420
Not bad, right?

182
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,140
I'll grill some more for you.

183
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,650
I want a drink.

184
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,670
The iced one.

185
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,300
It's bad for your health.

186
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,100
I just want it.

187
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,190
Okay.

188
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,660
Wait a moment.

189
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,780
Ji Shu,

190
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,920
I want to talk to you alone.

191
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,670
His ex-girlfriend is so powerful.

192
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,400
Don't give her the copyright.

193
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,980
Mr. Ji,

194
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,140
the newly grilled ones are for you.

195
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,260
I'm not interested.

196
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,940
Take them away.

197
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,870
But you just said it was delicious.

198
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,110
Don't follow me.

199
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,340
Do you want barbecue?

200
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
What's wrong?

201
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,480
Song Yanqi.

202
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,860
Are you following me?

203
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,070
I didn't follow you on purpose.

204
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,250
I was worried

205
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,510
about your condition.

206
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,510
I'm fine.

207
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,340
Mr. Ji, I'm in a bad mood.

208
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,010
I may not be able to

209
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,470
get the copyright anyway.

210
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,020
Why don't we find something to do and relax?

211
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,870
What are you going to do?

212
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,340
Come with me.

213
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,860
Mr. Ji, get on and try this.

214
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,050
♫I want to be around you like stars♫

215

This is fun.

Get on.

224
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,800
Enjoy it yourself.

♫I am touched by your tenderness♫

226
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,090

♫You made me forget to leave♫

Come on.

231
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,160
Hold tight.

232
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:04,490
♫Loving you, can I accompany you to the place where you belong?♫

I told you it was fun.

240
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,910
You didn't believe me.

241
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,740
Sorry.

242
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,000
I... I didn't stand properly.

243
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,780
It's OK.

244
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,770
You smiled?

245
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,140
You smiled?

246
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,260
Get up.

247
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,980
Look at this.

248
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,190
Does it look like me?

249
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,020
This is for you.

250
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,900
You'll feel better when you see pretty things.

251
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,340
Let me add some magic.

252
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,780
Just say what you want to say.

253
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,420
The stars tonight are beautiful.

254
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,620
So what?

255
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,460
It doesn't matter whether they are beautiful or not.

256
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,300
They're all things that can't be touched.

257
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,020
Not really.

258
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,980
Although we can't touch them,

259
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,660
the brilliance and beauty of them

260
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,640
are worthy of our admiration.

261
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,700
Well, Mr. Ji,

262
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,180
don't mind what happened during the day.

263
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,240
It was an accident.

264
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,640
They don't deserve it.

265
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,700
I didn't take it seriously.

266
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,420
That's good.

267
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,380
It sounds like I cared about it.

268
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,700
Mr. Ji,

269
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,190
can I ask you a question?

270
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,680
Why do you have so many questions?

271
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,460
Go ahead.

272
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,780
I've been wanting to ask this question for a long time.

273
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,859
Why do you always write tragedies?

274
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,680
Is there a special reason?

275
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,220
Tragedy is reality.

276
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,619
I just ended the novels with reality.

277
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,550
But you can't tar everybody with the same brush.

278
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,780
In my opinion,

279
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,109
if a couple really like each other,

280
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,900
they should trust each other.

281
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
No matter what conflicts and misunderstandings there are,

282
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
all can be solved.

283
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,660
There are many things in life that have nothing to do with misunderstandings

284
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,720
or right and wrong.

285
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,780
Even if the previous misunderstanding was solved,

286
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,940
there are still obstacles of reality and interests.

287
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,900
The two may not be equal in their relationship,

288
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,160
or even family status.

289
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,940
Even if these are all solved,

290
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,100
sometimes, the answer that suits them

291
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,140
are not in it.

292
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,350
I don't believe it.

293
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,420
Life is like making choices.

294
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,780
There are indeed many misleading choices.

295
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,620
We just need to eliminate the wrong options

296
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,460
one by one.

297
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,420
It's natural for people to make the wrong choices

298
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,110
or take the wrong paths.

299
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,820
Mr. Ji,

300
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,620
if you judge

301
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,220
people's life one-sidedly,

302
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,630
that would be a tragedy.

303
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,500
But some people

304
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,180
don't have any choice since birth.

305
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,450
Their lives are not choice questions,

306
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,130
but arrows.

307
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,180
They do their best

308
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,660
just to make a living.

309
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,020
It's already hard to survive for them.

310
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,220
Like,

311
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,180
love

312
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,700
and happiness

313
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,860
are

314
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,900
far away from them.

315
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,060
You have nothing to say, right?

316
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,260
When are you going to update your novel?

317
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:50,660
Soon.

318
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,660
I'll finish the novel in advance.

319
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,060
If you still want the copyright after that,

320
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,500
we can talk on it later.

321
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,090
Really?

322
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,020
Yes.

323
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,900
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

324
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,610
So,

325
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,700
do you still want to end it with a sad ending?

326
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,580
What's the secret between Yu Le and Xining?

327
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,840
You are so obsessed with the story

328
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,720
just because of your company?

329
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,230
♫There is like a star in the dark♫

330
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,240
Is there any other reason?

331
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,940
I'm your loyal reader.

332
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,350
♫You should always remember near or far♫

333
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,020
I can feel the power from your writing.

334
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,060
I also hope I can yearn for life

335
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,640
♫You've got family to share your load♫

336
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
and love,

337
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,860
instead of just accepting my fate.

338
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
Is that the only reason?

339
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,450
♫Just remember to take your way♫

340
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,300
Of course not.

341
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,700
♫Don't forget your own type♫

342
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,940
You don't know how bothering it is to wait for your update.

343
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,580
I'm really burning with anxiety.

344
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,230
♫That is just how you live♫

345
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,660
We all want to know the follow-up development.

346
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,300
Since I have the chance now,

347
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,900
of course I want to inquire.

348
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,910
♫Our life is not just rain and tears♫

349
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,030
You really want to know?

350
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,660
♫So you can take it all♫

351
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,360
Wait for it.

352
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,310
♫I could be your sea of sand you know♫

353
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,900
♫And I will keep you safe and strong tonight♫

354
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,460
How long?

355
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,580
One day?

356

♫I see there's a rainbow in the sky♫

357
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,180

♫I see the life I never had♫

359
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,880

Good morning, Mr. Ji.

363
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,060
Morning.

364
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,120
You're up so early.

365
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,180
How is it?

366
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,220
What is it? Let me see.

367
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Let me take a look.

368
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,420
You stayed with Ji Shu all night.

369
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,750
Did he agree to sign the contract with you?

370
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,020
Qingmiao.

371
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,140
Did you install a CCTV on me?

372
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,420
How did you know

373
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,150
Mr. Ji agreed to talk about his copyright with me?

374
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,900
No way.

375
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,620
Why not?

376
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:52,860
How is it?

377
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,390
Tell us about the progress.

378
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,860
Good news.

379
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,780
Ji Shu agreed to talk to me about copyright after the completion.

380
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,700
So he agreed?

381
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,100
Not exactly.

382
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,980
But the success rate is at least 50%.

383
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,060
I thought he had agreed.

384
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,540
It's much better than before.

385
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,050
He refused to see me before!

386
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,140
It's 50 percent.

387
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,060
Fine. You're awesome, okay?

388
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,380
But why only 50%?

389
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,420
Because I have the other 50%.

390
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,140
He must be flattering the boss again.

391
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,780
But Qi,

392
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,040
I have faith in you.

393
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,580
Me too.

394
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,150
You have good taste.

395
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,660
Look!

396
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,940
Mr. Ji reported back

397
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,980
and suddenly updated three chapters!

398
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,580
Let me see.

399
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,080
What did the netizens say?

400
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,380
The netizens are very dissatisfied with the plot,

401
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,020
and decided to give up reading it.

402
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,410
What? What's going on?

403
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,660
That's not the point.

404
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,820

405
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,700
when I came in.

406
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,110
I overheard something.

407
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,300
Mr. Jia might have seen the dissatisfaction of the netizens.

408
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,380
They're talking about

409
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,780
Lin Qingmiao's project.

410
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,140
He also asked her to speed up the contact with the platform.

411
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,290
Lin Qingmiao also suggested

412
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,700
to combine two groups

413
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,860
and reduce unnecessary personnel.

414
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,920
If we carry out her original project,

415
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,180
the person who leaves will be...

416
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,540
I'll go find Mr. Jia now.

417
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,480
Come in.

418
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,020
Let's talk about it another day.

419
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,180
Mr. Jia, I have something to tell you.

420
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,780
By the way,

421
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,180
I was about to call you.

422
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,940
Stop the copyright negotiation with Mr. Ji.

423
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,600
But Mr. Jia,

424
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,460
Mr. Ji agreed to talk about the copyright

425
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,940
after the novel is completed.

426
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,620
But I don't like the current story and plots.

427
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,800
Did you read it?

428
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,620
I just got the news.

429
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,220
I didn't have time to read it.

430
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,060
But Mr. Jia, trust me.

431
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,270
I can persuade him to change the story.

432
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,900
Mr. Jia, that's impossible.

433
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,840
I know him well.

434
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,010
He is stubborn.

435
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,820
He won't change his mind easily.

436
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,780
Just as you said,

437
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,860
he won't change his mind easily,

438
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,620
instead of refusing to change at all.

439
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,530
As long as we find the cause

440
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,460
and persuade him in the proper way...

441
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,850
And Mr. Jia, I've found the best way,

442
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,650
so I don't want to give up easily.

443
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,460
I believe it will become a hit.

444
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,740
Please trust me one more time.

445
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,380
Okay, I'll give you a few more days.

446
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,380
If it doesn't work,

447
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,110
just give up.

448
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,680
Thank you, Mr. Jia.

449
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,880

The vicious supporting actor must have done it on purpose.

He deliberately created conflicts for Yu Le and Xining.

00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,140
It's okay.

566
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,860
Let's cooperate later.

567
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,420
Okay, bye.

568
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,260
Yan.

569
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,940
Have you signed the contract of the Track?

570
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,060
Can you tell the producer

571
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,260
to give me the full script?

572
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,860
I want to prepare in advance.

573
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,630
What's wrong, Yan?

574
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,090
The male lead has been decided.

575
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,820
What?

576
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,550
But didn't you say that we just need to sign the contract?

577
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,180
There are always variables before signing the contract.

578
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,640
Now here comes a variable.

579
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,540
The film crew decided the leading role overnight.

580
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,060
The contract has been signed.

581
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,530
So,

582
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,850
who's the leading role now?

583
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,740
Wang Ziheng

584
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,060
and Ye Xining.

585
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,700
What?

586
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,700
Wang Ziheng and...

587
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,660
Ye Xining?

588
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,740
But she told me she had rejected.

589
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,970
How did this happen?

590
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,060
You should ask Ye Xining this question.

591
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,180
I heard Sheng'an Entertainment

592
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,540
contacted them proactively.

593
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,020
They said the film crew could also get one actor free.

594
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,540
Ye Xining's pay is much lower than before.

595
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,900
They even proposed

596
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,140
that Wang Ziheng can sing the theme song for free.

597
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,660
They will sing the OST  together

598
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,780
and cooperate with all the publicity.

599
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,040
How could this happen?

600
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,780
Don't you understand?

601
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,220
Sheng'an Entertainment snatched your role.

602
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,980
Yu Le.

603
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,860
Why are you so silly?

604
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,890
You were happy to work with her.

605
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,580
In front of you, she told you that she would refuse

606
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,620
and wouldn't take advantage of your popularity.

607
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,140
But later she conspired with her company

608
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,300
to snatch your role.

609
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,260
No.

610
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
Xining is not that kind of person.

611
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,300
What kind of person is she?

612
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,180
The truth is right in front of us.

613
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
It's impossible.

614
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,700
Even though Sheng'an Entertainment snatched my role,

615
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,230
she wouldn't know about it.

616
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,460
It better be.

617
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,340
This is the compensation for you.

618
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

619
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,060
Why don't you open it?

620
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,620
Later.

621
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,740
Xining, your phone.

622
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:54,900
Thank you.

623
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,140
I just want to know

624
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,900
whether you know what happened

625
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,500
to the contract of the Track?

626
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,300
I...

627
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,660
You knew it, didn't you?

628
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,820
Xining.

629
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
If you're worried that if we play the roles together,

630
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,980
it will affect each other,

631
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,110
you can just tell me.

632
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,520
You don't have to do these things.

633
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,820
I'm sorry.

634
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Do I look funny

635
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,740
in your eyes?

636
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,020
I don't think so.

637
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,060
You didn't?

638
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,700
I came here

639
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,380
to let you explain like a fool.

640
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,780
I don't even know

641
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,620
what you said is true.

642
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,180
Yu Le, I...

643
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,840
Things are already like this.

644
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,680
It's useless to say anything.

645
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,460
Mr. Zhen,

646
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,130
why did you give Xining a new phone?

647
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,139
What's wrong with her phone?

648
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,179
She lost her phone yesterday.

649
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:12,980
What?

650
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,650
Oh no. It's over.

651
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,420
What is over?

652
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,780
Their love is over.

653
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,659
What are you talking about? It's weird.

654
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,460
Damn author.

655
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,480
I am irreconcilable with you!

656
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,949
Let's calm our relationship down.

657
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,060
Yu Le,

658
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,540
it's not what you thought.

659
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,400
Then what is it?

660
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,380
I don't want to quarrel with you.

661
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,300
Go back and rest.

662
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,740
Xining.

663
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,220
Yu Le.

664
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,660
Yu Le.

665
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,140
Yu Le.

666
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,620
There shouldn't be any problems this time.

667
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,310
The ending is predestined.

668
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,440
There's no need to be so stubborn.

669
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,100
Ji Shu,

670
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,780
why are you so heartless?

671
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,620
You bastard!

672
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,900
Why did you use this method to break the couple I ship?

673
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
Let go of me first.

674
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,690
It's all because of you!

675
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,740
If you hadn't helped Wang Ziheng snatch the role,

676
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,210
they wouldn't have quarreled.

677
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,540
Can you be reasonable?

678
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,580
Their quarrel

679
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,300
was their own problem.

680
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,060
The couple I've been shipping has a bad ending.

681
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,460
I can't get the IP of this novel.

682
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,990
I lost my job because of you.

683
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,300
Both of the Ji Shu are so bad.

684
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,620
I told you

685
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,350
that all relationships

686
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,630
will end unhappily.

687
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,140
You were too obsessed.

688
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,160
That's why you got hurt in the end.

689
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,980
I worked so hard to live.

690
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,900
Why are you doing this to me?

691
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,940
Why did you

692
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,440
name the character Ji Shu?

693
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,980
You bullied me in this world too.

694
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,100
Are you really crying?

695
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,420
You, you broke them up.

696
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,420
Now...

697
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,730
You even maliciously speculated on me.

698
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,260
Stop crying.

699
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,980
They are breaking up.

700
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,900
My life turns to be boring now.

701
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,260
Does their breaking up

702
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,540
affect you this much?

703
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,530
Yes.

704
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,900
If they break up,

705
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,180
I think all the good things will be gone.

706
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,100
I can't eat well.

707
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,900
I can't dress well.

708
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,660
I can't sleep tight.

709
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,180
My heart is broken.

710
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,900
I think life is meaningless.

711
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,370
I will eventually go to darkness

712
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,700
and destruction.

713
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
Let go of me first.

714
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,460
No.

715
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,020
If they really break up,

716
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,100
I might as well end my life.

717
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,620
Fine.

718
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,300
What can I do to stop you from crying?

719
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:53,800
Really?

720
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:56,940
Yes.

721
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,420
From now on,

722
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,340
I want you to stop destroying

723
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,270
Yu Le and Xining's realationship.

724
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,700
OK.

725
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,930
I promise you.

726
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,040
But do you think

727
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,980
there will be no problem between them

728
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,510
if others don't intervene?

729
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,090
At least there are no external obstacles.

730
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,340
The problems between them

731
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,000
were never created by others.

732
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,100
It's their own problem.

733
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,350
I don't care.

734
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,380
Fine.

735
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,020
I promise you.

736
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,380
Mr. Ji,

737
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,340
you are the best person in the world.

738
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,500
Who just said

739
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,140
all Ji Shu in the world

740
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,060
are bad guys.

741
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,320
That's because...

742
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,140
I...

743
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,700
Why are you pulling my hair?

744
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,520
Don't move.

745
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,840
Don't move now.

746
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,130
What happened?

747
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,250
What are you doing?

748
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,620
I'm not that easy.

749
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,940
If you don't want me to take off my shirt,

750
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,220
you must cut your hair.

751
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,000
You choose.

752
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,700
Take it off then.

753
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,020
Step aside.

754
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,500
Mr. Zhen.

755
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,030
I have something to report.

756
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,820
♫Just remember to take your way♫

757
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,050
♫Don't forget your own type♫

758
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,310
♫That's just how you live♫

759
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,140
Mr. Ji.

760
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,820
I didn't mean it.

761
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,460
I'm sorry.

762
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,060
♫Our life is not just rain and tears♫

763
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,540
Go on.

764
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,360
What's the matter?

765
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,220
It almost slipped my mind.

766
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,280
Xining is missing.

767
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,290
She's missing?

768
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,210
How come?

769
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,900
How can you be sure that she was missing?

770
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,220
I can't find her anywhere.

771
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,380
Did you call her?

772
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,180
I just got her new SIM card.

773
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Oh my.

774
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,620
It's OK that people can't be contacted

775
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,300
for no signal or running out of battery.

776
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,300
It's the first time I see a person can't be connected for this reason.

777
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
She's a grown-up.

778
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,840
Why can't  you find her?

779
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,540
Mr. Ji,

780
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,100
I just received a notice.

781
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
Her notice tomorrow is put forward.

782
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,570
Besides,

783
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,500
Xining is already on the cusp.

784
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,140
I don't want her name to show up on the hot search for acting like a diva.

785
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,870
Don't worry.

786
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,620
Have you searched the places Xining likes to go?

787
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,340
I did.

788
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,790
I also went to her house.

789
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,380
Where else can she go?

790
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,290
Mr. Ji.

791
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,940
Are you really not worried?

792
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,670
You know something, don't you?

793
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,000
Why should I worry?

794
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
Instead of just guessing here,

795
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,060
you'd better go to the places she often goes.

796
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Did you find Yu Le?

797
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,700
I don't want to see Fang Yan.

798
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,340
Look at the situation now.

799
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,600
Why are you still spatting with Fang Yan?

800
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,060
I'll go to his studio.

801
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,390
I'll go with you.

802
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,100
You can't.

803
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,580
Why not?

804
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,110
You have to work.

805
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,820
Mr. Ji,

806
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,860
which is more important now,

807
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,100
working or finding Xining?

808
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,700
It's none of your concern.

809
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,860
You just promised me.

810
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,030
Let's go.

811
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:46,820
Mr. Zhen.

812
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,300
Go and find Yu Le first.

813
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,620
I'll look for her somewhere else.

814
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,300
Let's split up.

815
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,860
Okay.

816
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,740
-Be careful.
-Good luck.

817
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,020
Hello.

818
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,580
Hello.

819
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,060
I'm Xi Ning's agent.

820
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,180
Is Xining here?

821
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,100
No.

822
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
Can I talk to Yu Le?

823
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,060
Wait a moment.

824
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,580
Yu Le is practicing dancing.

825
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,660
He doesn't like to be disturbed while practicing.

826
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,980
I have something urgent.

827
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,580
How about this?

828
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,380
Tell him

829
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,550
Xining is missing.

830
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,260
Xining is at Qin Hai High School.

831
00:41:59,260 --> 00:41:59,780
Come quickly.
