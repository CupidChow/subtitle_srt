192
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,580
and we both have feelings for each other,

193
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,500
so we got back together.

194
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,380
Stop talking.

195
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm asking you.

196
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,660
Tell me. I'm asking you.

197
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,780
Yes.

198
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,040
We are together again.

199
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,000
♫I loved you♫

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,670
♫So I want to give you more♫

201
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,680
♫Space brings silence♫

202
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,640
♫Our love is a once-in-a-lifetime experience ♫

203
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,630
♫I think too much♫

204
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,570
♫But you never care♫

205
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,020
♫So it's all in my mind♫

206
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,050
Qingmiao.

207
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,710
Where are you going?

208
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,540
I told you

209
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,020
we were not right for each other.

210
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,880
Let's break up.

211
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,350
Did Song Yanqi tell you something?

212
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,020
Is it her?

213
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,840
Why do you know Song Yanqi?

214
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,820
Didn't we meet her at the resort?

215
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,420
I've known her since then.

216
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,080
You asked whether Song Yanqi told me something.

217
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,580
What did you do that you don't want me to know?

218
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,780
I didn't do anything.

219
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,580
I don't care about your things either.

220
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,910
Give me my luggage to me.

221
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,510
You can't leave.

222
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,090
Are you going to find Ji Shu after you leave me?

223
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,580
His reputation has been ruined.

224
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,180
Is there anything of him that you can't forget?

225
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,790
-You're okay. -Don't touch me.

226
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,980
Do you want to know

227
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,380
the things about Ji Shu that I can't forget?

228
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,580
He never gets jealous of others.

229
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,380
He never hates others

230
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,510
just because they are better than him.

231
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,340
It turned out to be an excuse.

232
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,780
You just wanted to get back together with him.

233
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,420
Ji Shu.

234
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
What happened?

235
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,620
Why are you so drunk?

236
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:09,980
Xingxing.

237
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,480
Come on.

238
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,490
Drink with me.

239
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,260
Cheers!

240
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,340
Song Yanqi.

241
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,400
Do you know how much you've drunk?

242
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,920
Are you going to get drunk?

243
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,580
Can I?

244
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,100
What on earth happened?

245
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,500
Ji Shu sent me a message

246
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,980
and let me look after you here.

247
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,110
Did you have a fight?

248
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,460
No.

249
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,940
Then why are you getting drunk here?

250
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,100
We broke up.

251
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,340
What?

252
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,260
It's not long since you have been together!

253
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,390
Why did you break up?

254
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,060
I don't know why.

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,700
Xingxing.

256
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,940
Tell me, is my figure

257
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,340
or my appearance not good enough?

258
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,860
He...

259
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,860
Why did he abandon me?

260
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,990
He's not a superficial person.

261
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,010
He didn't say anything.

262
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,370
I don't know why he abandoned me.

263
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,820
You see, Yu and I

264
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,060
quarreled

265
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,900
frequently.

266
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,730
And we often mentioned breakup when we got angry.

267
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,140
Maybe he regrets it now.

268
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,340
Check your phone.

269
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,920
There might be many missed calls.

270
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,100
There's no one.

271
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,340
Not a single one.

272
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,420
All right.

273
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,710
I'll teach him a lesson for you at once.

274
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,140
Xingxing.

275
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,620
I want to go home.

276
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,740
I want to go home!

277
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,660
I want to go home.

278
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,180
Okay.

279
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,540
I want to go home.

280
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,340
Let's go home.

281
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,260
Go home.

282
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,260
Be careful.

283
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,380
Song Yanqi.

284
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,220
Today,

285
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
I'm single again!

286
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
Happy breakup!

287
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,730
Happy breakup.

288
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,540
Wish you happy.

289
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,060
You will...

290
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,620
Ji Shu.

291
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,020
You're a damn author.

292
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,940
You can't find a better girlfriend than me.

293
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,740
You're right.

294
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,860
Let's go home.

295
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,100
Let's go home.

296
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,220
Yes.

297
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,180
Let's go home.

298
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,230
Let’s go.

299
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,670
Qi, are you alright?

300
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,820
Let me see.

301
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,420
Are you going to be dumb due to the fall?

302
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,340
Don't scare me.

303
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,490
Xingxing.

304
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,860
He abandoned me.

305
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,900
Why?

306
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,380
Why?

307
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,660
He abandoned me.

308
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,300
Fine.

309
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,840
The next one is better.

310
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,490
The point is I'm heartbroken now.

311
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,780
I think...

312
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,060
I...

313
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,300
Xingxing.

314
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,940
Are you feeling better now?

315
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,140
I'll get you a glass of water with honey.

316
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,700
Wait for me.

317
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Do you

318
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,540
have any wishes?

319
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,740
I hope

320
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,380
you will be healthy

321
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,960
and happy forever.

322
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,500
You'll never be in danger again.

323
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,490
Why did you get up so early today.

324
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,290
I have to work.

325
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,780
It's weekend.

326
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,860
Weekend?

327
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,510
Then I'll go back and sleep.

328
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,380
Oh no.

329
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,990
Why does she look a little out of it?

330
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,900
Ji Shu,

331
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,940
how dare you bully my bestie!

332
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,500
Hey, Xingxing, just so you know...

333
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,540
I'm about to call you.

334
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,340
What does your best friend mean?

335
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,860
How dare he bully my bestie?

336
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,260
Tell him to make it clear.

337
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,340
I was about to tell you this.

338
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,420
You can't imagine what I saw.

339
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,320
I saw Ji and Lin Qingmiao being together.

340
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,030
Looking at them,

341
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,340
I thought as if I traveled back to college.

342
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,940
No.

343
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,940
In college,

344
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,670
he had never been so open to her.

345
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,940
Keep him there.

346
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,080
I'll be there soon.

347
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,740
I'll get some tissues.

348
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,140
Ji Shu.

349
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,620
How dare you cheat on your ex-girlfriend?

350
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,060
I'll beat him to death.

351
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,460
Xingxing!

352
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,100
How could you do this to Qi?
Xingxing.

353
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,980
Calm down.

354
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,740
Alright.

355
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,900
Ji, explain to her.

356
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
It's okay.
It's just a misunderstanding.

357
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,860
What misunderstanding?

358
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,740
Are you talking about me dating Ji Shu?

359
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,460
Date?

360
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,060
What do you mean?

361
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,940
We two are dating.

362
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,980
You know what I mean.

363
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,460
Ji Shu,

364
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,660
you broke up with Qi

365
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,980
because of her?

366
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,950
Breaking up?

367
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,780
Why?

368
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,700
Ji,

369
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,950
what's going on?

370
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,460
I have nothing to say.

371
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,700
It's what you think.

372
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,460
I broke up

373
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,910
with Song Yanqi.

374
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,740
Good.

375
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,740
It's good you've broken up.

376
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,340
Hitting a bastard

377
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,060
won't break the law, right?

378
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:46,940
Xingxing.

379
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,660
Xingxing.

380
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,900
Lu Qiyu, let go of me!

Every time when Ji Shu is anxious,

his index finger and thumb

422
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,210
will rub each other repeatedly.

423

Sometimes, he also clenches his fist.

424
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,300
He won't even notice that he has hurt himself.

Song Yanqi, Ji Shu had an accident.

you want to learn more practice from our counselor?

540
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:36,920
No need.

I saw Shan Hang stand up just now.

542
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,860
I guess he wanted to follow the counselor.

543
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,460
After all, it'll be much easier

544
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,100
to get the postgraduate recommendation.

545
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,900
What a pity.

Can't you tell?

547
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,510
Our counselor likes Ji Shu.

548
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,980
That's the difference between the first and the second place.

549
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,620
Of course.

Song Yanqi became the first user.

568
