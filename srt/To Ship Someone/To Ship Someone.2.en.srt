[Episode 2]

4
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,800
The power went out.

5
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,020
It must be fake!

6
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,139
What was that?

7
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,300
What on earth

8
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,740
was that?

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,640
[Yu Le: I'll go to the convenience store to buy some ice. We'll put it on your wound after going home…]

[Sun Xitian took out sunglasses from her bag and gave them to Yu Le…]

11
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,740
Except for me,

12
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,320
everything else is exactly the same.

13
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,190
Was that a dream?

14
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,340
I thought a lot about it during the day

15
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,000
so I dreamed about it at night?

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,030
Who's it?

17
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,579
Song Yanqi, open the door!

18
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,420
Song Yanqi.

19
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,340
Song Yanqi!

20
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,540
Song Yanqi!

21
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,060
Open the door!

22
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,460
Song Yanqi!

23
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,500
Song Yanqi!

24
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,500
You know I'm afraid of thunder.

25
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,140
-How could you lock your door? -I...

26
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,780
Sorry. I just fell asleep.

27
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,860
Are you okay now?

28
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,940
In the future,

29
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,980
you can only lock your door

30
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,700
when you're in bed with a man.

31
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,940
At other times,

32
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,820
don't you dare lock your door!

33
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,480
Xingxing, what nonsense are you talking about?

34
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,210
Xingxing.

35
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,180
Let me tell you something unbelievable.

36
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,940
Okay.

37
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,900
I suspect

38
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,270
I traveled into the novel just now.

39
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,660
I saw Yu Le and Ye Xining.

40
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,690
Do you think you're in a novel?

41
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,890
That was just a dream.

42
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,030
You're so imaginative.

43
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,980
Why don't you write a novel yourself?

44
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,579
Maybe you can become famous.

45
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,579
You don't believe me?

46
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,110
Give me a pen.

47
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,540
No twist of fate!

48
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,340
My characters will fall in love in the first chapter,

49
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,540
get married in the tenth chapter,

50
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,460
and have a baby in the 20th chapter.

51
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,540
Two children in three years and three in five.

52
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,580
They'll help raise the birth rate

53
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,340
and participate in

54
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,380
parent and child programs

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,840
to make everyone envious.

56
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,860
Reading too many novels has made you insane.

57
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,670
I hope that was the case.

58
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,220
If I can't get the copyright of the novel,

59
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,540
I'll get sacked.

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,020
Buck up.

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,960
Don't let my money fly out the window.

62
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,520
I'm going to sleep.

63
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,980
Wait. You're going to sleep here?

64
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,420
Yes.

65
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,420
You're an adult now.

66
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,220
Grow up!

67
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,220
I'm already asleep.

68
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,140
Go back.

69
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,020
I saw you push my son.

70
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,220
See? His hand got grazed.

71
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,380
I didn't push him.

72
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,780
He bumped into me and fell.

73
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,140
Ask him if you don't believe me.

74
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,890
I saw you push him.

75
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,430
I demand compensation.

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,900
Wait.

77
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
You want to walk away?

78
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,660
No way!

79
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,060
Madam,

80
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,540
is there any misunderstanding?

81
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,780
I know him.

82
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,700
He wouldn't mess with a little boy.

83
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,580
Who are you?

84
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,180
Why should I believe you?

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,780
Listen.

86
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,020
You must pay me today.

87
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,260
According to your logic,

88
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,540
you might be lying too.

89
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,900
Why should I believe you?

90
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,810
I suspect that you're blackmailing him.

91
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,020
That's nonsense!

92
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,550
I'm not blackmailing him!

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,130
Kid,

94
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,670
take a careful look.

95
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,340
Did this guy push you?

96
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,460
No.

97
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,659
I bumped into him and fell.

98
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,580
He helped me up.

99
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,020
What?

100
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,140
Madam,

101
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,570
perhaps you don't believe your own child either.

102
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,370
But you have to

103
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,790
believe the security footage, right?

104
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,170
Fine.

105
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,100
I'm out of luck today.

106
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,350
Let's go.

107
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,730
Poor boy.

108
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,980
-Thank you. -His mother is a nightmare.

109
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,460
Mr. Ji.

110
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,220
I'm here today for…

111
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,860
I apologize for

112
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,780
taking you as a thief yesterday.

113
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,460
It feels bad to be misunderstood, right?

114
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,720
But it doesn't matter.

115
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,780
As for the copyright,

116
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,280
I won't change my mind.

117
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,820
I never expected to convince you easily.

118
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,340
I won't give up.

119
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,220
No matter how many times you come to me,

120
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,540
my answer is the same.

121
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,840
The guy with a mask?

122
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,700
It was you

123
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,710
at the bus stop that day, right?

124
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,700
What a surprise.

125
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,810
It turns out

126
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,980
that we've met before.

127
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,100
I live nearby.

128
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,060
We'll

129
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,740
meet a lot in the future.

130
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,580
I'll say it again.

131
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,500
I won't sell the copyright.

132
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,180
Please leave me alone.

133
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,260
Why don't you let me tell you

134
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,920
what we've got to offer first?

135
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,700
No matter what you can offer,

136
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,830
I'm not interested.

137
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,540
Why?

138
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,659
So many good novels have been adapted into rubbish.

139
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,620
The recreation of the script

140
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,740
will be under the pressure from many parties.

141
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,100
The outcome will be nothing like the original work.

142
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,260
So I won't sell my novel.

143
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,020
I promise

144
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,620
that we won't do big changes.

145
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,570
How can you be so sure?

146
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,100
I…

147
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,780
I…

148
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,060
I…

149
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,220
I…

150
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,780
How can I be so sure?

151
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,140
How could a warm-blooded human

152
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,860
say something so cold?

153
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,780
Have you seen the trending topics on Weibo?

154
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,020
Big production companies are laying off employees again.

155
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,280
The economy is bad now.

156
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,740
Maybe the next one getting sacked

157
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,500
will be you.

158
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,700
It can't be me!

159
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,950
Don't worry.

160
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,920
I'll get sacked before you do.

161
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,760
Song Yanqi.

162
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,260
Mr. Jia.

163
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,140
I went to the platform today.

164
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,770
They think highly of Brighter Than Stars

165
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,900
and have been paying attention to its author for a long time.

166
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,340
So,

167
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,789
get its copyright as soon as possible.

168
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,820
Mr. Jia,

169
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,460
the author refused to sell the copyright.

170
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,020
Refuse?

171
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,059
Why?

172
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,460
He's worried that we'd make too many changes to his work.

173
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,820
Tell him that we respect the original work.

174
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,350
You should know what to say!

175
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,460
That's what I said, but he…

176
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,820
No one would refuse a chance to make money.

177
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,650
No one.

178
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,700
He brushed you off with some lame excuse

179
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,560
and you gave up?

180
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
I didn't hire you to be a quitter!

181
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,440
Mr. Jia.

182
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,140
If Song Yanqi can't do it,

183
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,520
let me give it a try.

184
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,500
I can.

185
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,920
Mr. Jia, I can do it.

186
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,100
Just get it done.

187
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,540
Okay.

188
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,960
You can't handle that author.

189
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,500
Don't waste your energy.

190
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Why are you so sure

191
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,430

192
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,860
I just can.

193
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,620
No one would refuse a chance to make money.

194
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,950
If it's not about money,

195
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,980
it got to be about people.

196
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,820
Qi must have done something wrong.

197
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,100

198
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500

Yes.

204
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,420

Mr. Ji wants to meet me to discuss the copyright.

208

I'm going out.

He's early.

211
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,340
Sorry, Mr. Ji.

212
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,340
Am I late?

213
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,750
You're five minutes early.

this is the adaptation plan I wrote.

217

If you have any objections,

218
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,520
I'll revise it now.

219

This is the copyright contract.

220
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,180
This is the scriptwriter contract.

221
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,220
Considering that you don't have much experience in adapting,

222
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,100
here are some scriptwriters we signed.

223
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,580
Take a look.

224
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,420
Do you need someone to work with you?

225
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Don't get me wrong.

226
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,820
You have the final say.

227
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,260
What matters most is the copyright.

228
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,860

229
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,260

It's so kind of you to give me a gift,

232
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,220
but I think

233
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,220
it's a bit too early.

234
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,660
You took my parcel without permission.

235
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,620
You have to be responsible for the damage.

236
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
I didn't break it.

237
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,450
The deliveryman said it wasn't him either.

238
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,580
But he told me

239
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,060
that you pretended to be my girlfriend

240
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,520
and signed for my package.

241
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,580
Sorry. I'll pay for it.

242
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,630
How much is this?

I don't need your money.

Okay.

I'm so mad at Ji Shu.

267

He said this story is not ideal

268
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,300
and wants to end it in advance.

269
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,730
He'll design a car accident

270
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,540
where Sun Xitian gets hurt for saving Yu Le.

271
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,300

279

280
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,950
or reply to my messages.

281
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,060

It's grazed.

378
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,680
My wounds have healed.

379
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,780
I…

380
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,260
I'm in the novel now?

381
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,380
Where's the frame?

382
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,940
How can I go back without it?

383
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,860
Where are they?

384
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,780
Thunder.

385
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,980
God.

386
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,020
Please, I need thunder now.

I promise

388
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,990
I'll arrive at the office early in the future.

389
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,830
God has heard me?

390
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,700
Where's the frame?

391
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,180
Frame!

392
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,700
Hello?

393
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,900
Hey, Qi.

394
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,300
Did you go to the hospital?

395
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,380
You are…

396
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,530
Xining?

397
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,220
I'm fine. I just got a graze. No need to go to the hospital.

398
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,150
Thank you for what you did just now.

399
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,300
Well,

400
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,260
will you go to the company later?

401
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,020
What company?

402
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,580
Sheng'an.

403
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,380
I'm on my way there.

404
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,220
OK.

405
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,130
Yu Le wants to thank you.

406
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,500
We'll be there after we get it done here.

407
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,900

Official announcement yesterday and car accident today.

422

The ex's appearance just made things worse.

00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,340
Everyone thinks

424
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,980
that Yu Le and Ye Xining's relationship is fake.

425
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,660
How's that possible?

426
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,020
They're a true couple!

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,820
We know that for sure,

428
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,740
but the netizens don't believe that.

They think Ye Xining

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,780
is a just an understudy.

Today he got into a car accident.

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,580

Yu Le is the one who's in trouble.

443
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,700
After all,

444
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,420
Xining is a victim.

445
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,140
This is not our war to fight.

446
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,780
No.

447
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,580
Mr. Jia,

448
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,960
as a reputed manager in the industry,

449
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,440
how can you be so negative?

450
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,300
Am I wrong?

451
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,460
Qi,

452
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,710
Xining told me everything.

453
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,950
Without you,

454
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,380
Yu Le would have been hit.

455
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,500
Look at you. You got injured.

456
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,260
Do you want a paid leave?

457
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,940
Work is important,

458
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,920
but health is more important.

459
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,380
You've even got memory issues.

460
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,740
I…

461
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,730
What do you mean?

462
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,620
Qi, did you lose your memory?

463
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,980
That's Mr. Zhen.

464
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,860
How could you get his name wrong?

465
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,620
Mr. Zhen?

466
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,420
Mr. Zhen?

467
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,140
You've recalled my name?

468
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,460
Zhen Yingjun.

469
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,420
I'm glad you didn't lose your memory.

470
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,500
I thought you did.

471
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,190
Mr. Zhen,

472
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,700
I think you should consider changing your name.

473
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,300
Zhen is not a surname that brings you good luck.

474
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,780
Really?

475
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
No wonder I've been so unlucky lately.

476
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,500
Forget it.

477
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,620
You're injured.

478
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,000
Are you sure you don't need a rest?

479
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,820
No.

480
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,180
I love work.

481
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,900
Work makes me happy.

482
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,820
Song Yanqi.

483
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,620
You're such a lucky dog.

484
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,780
Others entering novels have to try so hard to stay alive.

485
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,900
But here I am, in my own fan fiction.

486
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,820
Anyone who has ever shipped a couple

487
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,020
will envy me.

488
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,340
[Yu Le's hardcore fans all know that his dream girl went abroad and returned lately.]

489
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,740
Who can tell me when Fang Yan will arrive?

490
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,300
I've contacted her. She'll be here soon.

491
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,860
Yu Le's unforgettable ex?

492
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,780
Has Yu Le confirmed it?

493
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,700
Yu Le just treats her as a friend.

494
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,980
There's nothing between them.

495
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,700
Both Xining and I were there last night.

496
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,220
Really?

497
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,580
Xining was probably here. I was here.

498
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,110
Things are much easier now.

499
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,580
Xining and Qi were there last night.

500
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,820
A passersby's perspective can clear up the rumors.

501
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,150
We can start from there.

502
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,180
OK. I'll draft a post right away.

503
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,060
Yu Le's car was here.

504
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,380
There must be a dash cam on his car.

505
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,540
Use the footage as evidence.

506
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,220
Okay.

507
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,440
Why didn't I think of that?

508
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Do as Qi said.

509
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,940
Okay.

510
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,220
By the way,

511
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,980
the car accident…

512
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,250
It was just an accident. Nothing complex.

513
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,020
First, wait for the police's report.

514
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,860
Tell Yu Le's manager

515
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,140
that we'll repost it together

516
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,740
to tell the fans that he's fine.

517
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
The only problem

518
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,820
is that Sun Xitian was there too.

519
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
Contact Fang Yan.

520
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,220
Get our story straight.

521
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,700
They were there to pick up their friend

522
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,010
to hang out together.

523
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,300
Good idea.

524
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,500
Do as Qi said.

525
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,770
Write a lawyer letter

526
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,780
and contact the police.

527
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,380
Okay.

528
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,200
Prepare a list of media

529
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,350
and a press release.

530
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,590
Okay, I'll do it now.

531
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,970
The news of the car accident

532
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,700
has diverted people's attention from the fake relationship.

533
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,300
But they may bring it up soon.

534
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,260
I remember that Wang Ziheng

535
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,820
is about to announce the release time of his new song.

536
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,420
Yes.

537
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,980
Tell him to announce it earlier

538
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,780
so that his fans can make it a hit.

539
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,120
Is there any reality show invitation recently?

540
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,260
Tell Fang Yan

541
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,930
that Yu Le and Xining

542
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,900
need to get on a dating show.

543
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,160
Everyone will see they're a true couple.

544
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,380
I'm a genius.

545
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,780
I solved the problem and created opportunities for them to be together.

546
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,570
Qi.

547
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,050
It sounds nice

548
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,420
but Mr. Ji…

549
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,700
No "but".

550
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,020
It's an emergency we're talking about here.

551
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,750
Understand?

552
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,500
Getting them on a dating show

553
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,780
can be risky but it's a great opportunity

554
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,900
to prove that they're a true couple.

555
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,740
We must do it.

556
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,660
Now,

557
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,790
announce the release time of Wang Ziheng's new song.

558
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,340
My goodness.

559
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,900
He scared the crap out of me.

560
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,900
Why is Ji Shu here?

561
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,740
If he finds out that I'm writing fan fiction

562
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,800
and changed the plots, he'll kill me.

563
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,490
Do what I said.

564
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,420
Okay.

565
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,360
When will Fang Yan be here?

566
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,440
In a minute.

567
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,220
This is the show they'll be on.

568
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,080
[Let's Date]

569
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,380
After Fang Yan arrives,

570
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,660
tell her that they must get on the show together.

571
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,380
This is the only way

572
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,180
to correct the misinformation.

573
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,490
Any questions?

574
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,420
No.

575
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
How is Xining now?

576
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,180
Is she affected

577
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,900
by the rumors on the internet?

578
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,140
I got her. Don't worry.

579
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,540
Protect her at all costs.

580
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,310
Okay.

581
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,100
What's wrong, Qi?

582
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,850
Shh.

583
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
I met my nemesis.

584
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,220
Are you talking about

585
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,460
our boss, Mr. Ji?

586
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,020
The one and only.

587
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,420
If he finds that I'm here

588
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,980
and changed the plots of his novel,

589
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,500
you'll never see me again.

590
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,060
Wait.

591
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,180
Who did you say he is?

592
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,890
Our boss.

593
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,300
Mr. Ji.

594
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,580
Our boss?

595
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,180
Ji Shu, the boss of Sheng'an Entertainment.

596
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,020
27 years old.

597
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,220
Young, accomplished, handsome, and rich.

598
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,260
He's very sensitive to entertainment information

599
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,260
and established Sheng'an Entertainment five years ago and made it big.

600
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,420
He signed Wang Ziheng and many other popular artists in a short time

601
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,380
and produced many films and TV shows.

602
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,820
Whether he's the executive producer

603
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,900
or the associate producer,

604
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,060
none of his works is a failure.

605
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,180
Three years ago, he established

606
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,140
the PR Department, Management Department, and Circulation Department.

607
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,700
He built a complete entertainment chain.

608
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,020
He's Ji Shu, the supporting role?

609
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,560
What supporting role?

610
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,780
Nothing. Go back to work.

611
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,570
If I had known that the same name means the same person,

612
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,620
I would've named him Theo Zhu.

613
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,680
Don't even think about it!

614
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,900
I won't allow Yu Le

615
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,400
to get on this dating show.

616
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,180
Netizens won't remember it for long.

617
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,780
Once there are new rumors,

618
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,880
they'll forget about it completely.

619
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,580
Being on this dating show

620
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,660
won't do Yu Le any good.

621
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,740
But the internet remembers.

622
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,340
Fang Yan,

623
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,220
you've been in this industry for so long.

624
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,140
You should know

625
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,250
that once a celebrity is labeled,

626
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,910
it's hard to get the label off.

627
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,300
Who are you to object?

628
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,680
This is my fiction!

629
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,760
Fang Yan, trust me.

630
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,550
After they get on this show,

631
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
they'll get more and more shippers.

632
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,830
It'll end the gossip

633
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,220
and the fans Yu Le lost will come back.

634
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,060
Impossible.

635
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,980
I won't let you make use of Yu Le like that.

636
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,700
Fang Yan.

637
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,220
How could you say that?

638
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,140
What do you mean by making use of him?

639
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,500
That's what it is!

640
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,500
Their relationship

641
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,020
has made your artist

642
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,680
famous overnight, hasn't it?

643
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,980
She's got invited to lots of

644
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
shows and programs.

645
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,310
Even her rate is much higher now, isn't it?

646
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,060
Who says there are only pros?

647
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,660
After the relationship was exposed,

648
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,900
Yu Le lost lots of fans and paid the penalty,

649
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,740
but Ye Xining suffered losses too.

650
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,980
She was stalked and bullied online.

651
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,220
Go check her Weibo.

652
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,260
Everyone is saying nasty things about her.

653
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,420
The comments she received in the past few days

654
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,900
are more than those she received since her debut.

655
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,430
Fang Yan,

656
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,660
do you still think Xining only benefits from this relationship?

657
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,060
I'll clarify it on Weibo.

658
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,300
If you do,

659
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,280
I may be criticized for more days.

660
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,300
It's just criticism.

661
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,300
Every celebrity gets criticized.

662
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,420
A bad reputation is a reputation too.

663
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,900
Anyway, you can't get on the dating show.

664
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,300
For Yu Le,

665
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,230
keeping a low profile is safer.

666
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,700
But if this dating show

667
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,060
can change the public opinion of him,

668
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,380
will you change your mind?

669
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,820
How is that possible?

670
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,080
It is possible!

671
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,300
The show can prove that they're a true couple

672
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,740
and attract more shippers.

673
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,970
It's a win-win solution.

674
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,500
But Yu Le is an idol.

675
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,460
No one expects an idol to start a relationship.

676
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,820
He's in transition.

677
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,900
That's exactly

678
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,740
why he shouldn't be on a dating show.

679
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,220
He needs time to practice his acting skills.

680
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,140
Fine.

681
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,500
Forget the dating show.

682
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,290
But the rumors have to be addressed.

683
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,180
They have a bad influence

684
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,510
on both Xining and Yu Le.

685
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,540
Qi.

686
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,420
Mr. Ji has made an arrangement.

687
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,150
It'll make things hard for him.

688
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,490
Cooperation

689
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,780
should be consensual.

690
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,820
So,

691
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,500
if you think Xining is taking advantage here,

692
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,210
there's no need for them to get on the dating show.

693
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,540
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

694
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,260
I'll take care of this matter.

695
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,420
Since we have reached a consensus,

696
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,220
I'll go.

697
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,450
Newcomer.

698
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,000
You're quick-witted.

699
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,240
Learn from her.

700
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,980
Stay calm in times of crisis.

701
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,160
You flatter me.

702
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,590
What are you doing here?

703
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,530
I came to thank the girl who saved my life.

704
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,860
I also brought the staff

705
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,000
afternoon tea.

706
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,060
You've been working late

707
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,140
because of me and Xining.

708
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,620
Thank you all.

709
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,900
What's wrong?

710
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,720
You want to separate them, don't you?

711
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:01,860
What?

712
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,010
I won't let you do that.

713
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,670
There must be something

714
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,280
going on between them.

715
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,800
What's the matter?

716
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,380
Mr. Ji,

717
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,740
I want to thank you for your compliment.

718
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,670
You're welcome.

719
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,800
You've proved yourself capable.

720
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,340
I'll make you a regular employee in advance.

721
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,140
Then,

722
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,740
you'll work in the PR Department.

723
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,660
Wait, Mr. Ji.

724
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,420
I'm not good at public relations.

725
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,140
Let me be Xining's assistant.

726
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,220
Okay.

727
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,920
What do you want to say?

728
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,660
Mr. Ji,

729
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,020
I want to say

730
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,740
that you're a great boss.

731
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,940
You're better than Jia Yingjun,

732
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,500
no, Zhen Yingjun.

733
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,410
I know.

734
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,220
No, you don't.

735
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,580
Jia Yingjun wants

736
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,220
to use the copyright as an excuse

737
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,140
to sack me.

738
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,300
I'll try my best to get the copyright

739
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,220
and impress him.

740
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,980
Don't worry.

741
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,740
As long as you work hard,

742
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,800
no one can sack you.

743
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,060
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

744
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,940
If there's nothing else,

745
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,880
I'll leave now.

746
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,300
You…

747
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,860
I…

748
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Can't you finish your words at once?

749
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,060
Mr. Ji,

750
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,580
I'm grateful

751
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,580
that you promoted me and gave me a raise,

752
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,220
but for your good,

753
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,530
I can't let you go out.

754
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,820
For your good,

755
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,060
you should let go of me right now.

756
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,980
Or I'll take back my words about the promotion

757
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,540
and fire you.

758
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Mr. Ji, actually…

759
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,580
What?

760
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,280
I've liked you for a long time.

761
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,660
You like me?

762
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,700
Yes.

763
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,100
I'll pretend

764
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,580
that I heard nothing.

765
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,180
Let go.

766
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,020
But you heard me.

767
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,860
Give me a reply,

768
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,110
or I won't let you go.

769
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,060
Do you really like me?

770
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,820
I like you so so much.

771
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,220
Fine.

772
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,270
This expression means you like me?

773
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,220
As your boss,

774
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,970
I admire your ability.

775
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
But if you want to take a shortcut through me,

776
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,020
it's not gonna happen.

777
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,420
Mr. Ji,

778
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,740
it's fine that you don't believe I like you,

779
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,980
but there are so many girls out there.

780
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,370
Don't carry the torch for someone who's already spoken for.

781
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,580
Look at the other girls.

782
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,860
Do you mean you?

783
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,540
It doesn't have to be me.

784
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,780
It just can't be Xining.

785
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,140
What I feel for her is none of your business.

786
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,800
I'll forget

787
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,040
what you just said.

788
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,220
Mr. Ji,

789
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,350
you have to admit

790
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,260
that timing is very important.

791
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:45,820
Sometimes,

792
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,780
it's not that you're not good enough.

793
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,500
You're just not the leading role.

794
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,260
Sometimes,

795
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,780
knowing someone for a long time

796
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,980
doesn't mean you can be with them forever.

797
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,660
Oh no.

798
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,380
You…

799
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,420
♫I see there's a rainbow in the sky♫

800
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:10,610
♫I see the life I never had♫

801
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,460
Mr. Ji.

802
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,580
You had a car accident. Are you okay?

803
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,110
I'm fine.

804
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,420
I'm lucky to not get hurt.

805
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,940
We're waiting for the police's report.

806
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,540
Good.

807
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,330
I'm Xining's boss

808
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,260
and friend.

809
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,030
I don't want her to be in trouble

810
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,080
because of you.

811
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,540
Of course.

812
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,980
I don't want anything to happen to Xining either.

813
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,040
I want to thank you for saving my life.

814
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,420
Qi.

815
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,300
You're Qi, right?

816
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,040
Thank you for saving me this morning.

817
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,010
Are you okay?

818
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,700
I'm fine. You don't have to thank me.

819
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,760
Of course I'd save…

820
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,620
I mean

821
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,980
I love helping others.

822
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,060
I'm relieved that you're fine.

823
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,790
Are you okay?

824
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,860
Thanks to you,

825
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,940
I'm still in one piece.

826
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,620
I'm fine.

827
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,820
They look so good together.

828
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,140
They're meant to be together.

829
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,780
What a perfect match!

830
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,139
Is he thinking about chopping off Yu Le's hand?

831
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,460
Qi,

832
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,860
I've put coffee and cake on your table.

833
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,449
Remember to eat them.

834
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,380
Okay. Thank you.

835
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,020
Okay.

836
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,170
I'll go practice dancing.

837
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:25,580
OK.

838
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,780
I gotta go.

839
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,060
You're leaving already?

840
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,340
Thank you, everyone.

841
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,940
Thank you.

842
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,380
He's busy.

843
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,900
He needs to build a career.

844
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,300
I should support his career.

845
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,860
Wait. In the novel, this plot will lead to a misunderstanding.

846
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,500
No. I have to stop it.

847
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:44,900
Yu Le.

848
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,420
Where are you going?

849
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:46,900
Well…

850
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,940
Xining, stop him.

851
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,260
You…

852
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,420
What's wrong?

853
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,360
Something bad is going to happen.

854
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,620
What do you mean?

855
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,540
Will your wound get infected?

856
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,940
It may leave a scar.

857
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,620
Show me the wound.

858
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,700
I'm fine.

859
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,220
Let me take a look.

860
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,780
It's just a graze.

861
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm fine.

862
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,260
It's just a graze.

863
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,550
Where's your wound?

864
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,860
Wound?

865
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,980
What wound?

866
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,460
Didn't you hurt your hand?

867
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,900
There's blood on your sleeve.

868
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,300
Fine.

869
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,570
Let me make Ji Shu give up on Xining first.

870
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,100
Blood. Blood…

871
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,660
Hey!

872
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,780
You're out of line.

873
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,980
Mr. Ji, I feel dizzy.

874
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,100
Did you get a concussion?

875
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,050
Do you feel any other discomfort?

876
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,690
Yes.

877
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,660
I feel tightness in my chest.

878
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,480
Drop the act or I'll dock your pay.

879
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,860
Mr. Ji, how can you think I'm acting?

880
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,620
I'm in so much pain now.

881
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,190
Then go to the hospital.

882
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,580
Hospital?

883
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,740
No, I…

884
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,860
Go see a doctor.

885
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
You don't want to get too ill and die.

886
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,620
Mr. Ji,

887
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,820
thank you for being so considerate.

888
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,300
Well,

889
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,720
could you send me to the hospital?

890
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,820
What do you think?

891
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,500
Mr. Ji,

892
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,250
if I'm going to die soon,

893
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,300
I hope you're the last person

894
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
I see before I die.

895
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,020
Xining.

896
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,660
Don't get the wrong idea.

897
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
There's nothing between me and her.

898
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,180
Mr. Ji,

899
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,140
let's send her to the hospital together.

900
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,900
No.

901
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,780
Xining.

902
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,890
Well,

903
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,180
I've liked Mr. Ji for a long time.

904
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,580
You…

905
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,140
I want to be alone with him.

906
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,060
You like Mr. Ji?

907
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,780
Qi.

908
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,180
You like Mr. Ji?

909
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,460
Xining, I didn't know her before today.

910
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,340
Trust me.

911
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,020
Let go!

912
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,730
Mr. Ji.

913
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,980
I know you didn't know me

914
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,540
and you won't like me,

915
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,540
but I've loved you for ten years.

916
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,460
Qi.

917
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,290
Have you ever thought about why?

918
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,560
-If... -Let go!

919
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,460
If I don't have much time left,

920
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,780
I hope you can be the one by my side.

921
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,820
I don't have time

922
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,660
for this farce.

923
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,460
Let go.

924
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,780
You're vomiting blood!

925
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,420
Send her to the hospital, Mr. Ji.

926
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,620
You can't let her die.

927
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,460
Fine.

928
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,780
Most people keep their feelings inside.

929
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,490
Qi is so brave.

930
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,980
I hope all unrequited love

931
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,020
could have a happy ending.

932
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,780
I'm not going to the hospital.

933
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,500
I won't faint again, Mr. Ji.

934
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,210
It hurts.

935
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,900
I'll send you to go to the hospital.

936
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,960
Maybe you need an operation in the ER.

937
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,300
Here.

938
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,330
The cost

939
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,740
of putting up this show is too high.

940
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:22,860
Ji…

941
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,060
After some rest,

942
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,640
I feel much better now.

943
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,260
Mr. Ji,

944
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,820
please pull over.

945
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,180
I don't need to go to the hospital.

946
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,940
Don't worry.

947
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,500
I won't give up the life of any employee.

948
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,840
Even if God wants you to die today,

949
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,990
I'll make you live to see tomorrow.

950
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,060
It's not that serious.

951
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,850
It's not up to you.

952
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,940
The doctor has the final say.

953
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,300
Why are you looking at me?

954
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,460
Mr. Ji,

955
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,860
maybe

956
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,910
you don't like the way I look at you,

957
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,460
but you can see in my eyes

958
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,220
that I'm really into you.

959
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,140
I feel so hot.

960
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,540
Qi,

961
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,700
as the boss of such a big entertainment company,

962
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,540
I've seen countless women who are hotter than you.

963
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,420
Do you think

964
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,170
I'd be interested in you?

965
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,500
I'm just

966
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,010
having a fever.

967
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,580
I…

968
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,980
I want to throw up.

969
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,980
Pull over.
