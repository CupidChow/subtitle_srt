00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,180
Mr. Ji.

5
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,580
I have another question.

6
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,640
Can I get in the car?

7
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,140
No way.

8
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,940
I must be mistaken.

9
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,640
What do you want to ask?

[Unknown Caller]

11
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,860
You got a call.

12
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,300
Hello?

13
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,700
Ji Shu, it's me.

14
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,730
How have you been?

15
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,740
This voice sounds so familiar.

16
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,620
How did you get my number?

17
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,670
I asked an old classmate for it.

18
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,300
What's it?

19
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,820
Can we meet?

20
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,660
No.

21
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,250
Now,

22
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,920
what's your question?

23
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,660
Well,

24
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,900
I saw the notice you put out.

25
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,940
Why did you suddenly stop releasing new chapters?

26
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,330
Something came up during the release process.

27
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,330
I'm working on it.

28
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,300
I see.

29
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,140
How long will it take?

30
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,990
I don't know.

31
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,960
You don't know?

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,660
Well,

33
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,580
I'm a reader of your work.

34
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,100
You suddenly stopped releasing new chapters

35
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,230
and kinda left your readers dangling.

36
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,270
You want to know how the story goes?

37
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,170
Why?

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,140
It's normal for a reader to be curious about

39
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,200
how the story goes.

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,160
That's all?

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,730
Yeah.

42
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,500
Get off. I'm home.

43
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,640
Thank you for giving me a ride.

Was it accidental or intentional?

Hello?

48
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,780
Look into a website for me.

49
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,740

50
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,650
Send me a report of what you find.

51

What's wrong with you?

52
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,540
Why the long face?

53
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,070
You look like a sad sack.

54
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,960
Half of my chickens were taken before they hatched.

55

What chickens?

56
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,220

with someone else.

whoever lands the client

61
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,200
will lead the project.

62
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,460
But I've been working on that project since the very beginning.

63
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,660
Just another poor guy who's bound to hit the wall.

64
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,140
Why are you so worried?

65
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,630
No. We have different starting lines.

66
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,260
Right.

67
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,100
You knew Ji Shu first.

She was Ji Shu's high school and college classmate.

70
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,220
Is she also his ex?

71
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,750
Judging from her expression today, that's very likely.

72
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,580
Wait.

73
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,380
Far as I can recall,

74
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,460
Ji Shu has only one ex.

75
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,300
Are you talking about Lin Qingmiao?

76
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,960
Oh hell.

Can I be your kept woman?

79
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,700
Forget it.

It's not that bad.

82
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,730
He's so hard to deal with.

83
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,540
I could've long gotten to anyone else.

84
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,660
Why is Ji Shu

85
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,740
such a pain in the ass?

86
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,550
What do you mean?

87
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,940
You've met his namesake?

88
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,300
They not only have the same name

89
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,700
but also look the same.

90
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Trust me.

91
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,740
Don't give up so soon.

92

We don't know if that Lin Qingmiao

93

94

What do you mean?

If you and she visit Ji Shu together,

96
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,780
Ji Shu may just give you the cold shoulder

97
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,659
but give her the boot.

98
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,110
The boot?

99
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,620
For what?

100
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,220
Wait.

What does Ji Shu mean?

104
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,100
Is there really a secret

105
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,500
between Yu Le and Xining?

106
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,650
He didn't say how long the break would be.

107
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,780
Should we keep negotiating about the copyright?

108
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,100
Of course.

109
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,890
He'll release new chapters eventually.

110
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,690
We can't quit.

111
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,820
Are you so confident

112
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,750
that you can get the copyright?

113
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,340
I can ask you the same question.

114
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:33,940
I am.

115
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,740
He's agreed to meet me.

116
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,900
I advise you

117
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,100
to start looking for a new novel.

118
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,060
I don't believe you can make it in one go.

119
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,700
I heard

120
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,170
that the one who gets the copyright

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,580
will lead the project.

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,580
This novel is much more popular

123
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,220
than her original project.

124
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,020
Lin Qingmiao will definitely do her best.

125
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,480
Qi, you must go all out too.

126
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,780
I'll be damned

127
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,100
if I can't land Ji Shu!

128
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,150
Where are you going?

129
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,270
I'm going to take the wind out of my enemy's sails.

130
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,710
Long time no see.

131
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,640

How have you been?

137
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,220
Why did you want to see me?

138
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,780
You're as straightforward as before.

139
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,980
It's been a long time.

140
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,580
Shouldn't we catch up first?

141

If you just want to catch up,

142

I changed my job not long ago.

Whether to you or to her,

151
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,540
my answer is the same.

152
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:11,900
No.

153
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,220
Ji Shu.

154
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,260
Are you rejecting me

155
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,440
because of what happened before?

156
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Do you still think

157
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,140
what happened back then was completely my fault?

158
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,340
If you hadn't

159
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,370
been so cold to me,

160
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,100
I wouldn't have done that.

161
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,620
So you're still blaming me,

162
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,820
right?

163
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:40,820
No.

164
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,270
No?

165
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,580
If not,

166
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,580
why didn't you stop me

167
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,510
when I decided to be with Shan Hang?

168
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,310
We had broken up by then.

169
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,940
And it was your decision.

170
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,630
I wouldn't stop you.

171
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,470
That's the only reason?

172
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,100
Yes.

173
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,580
Ji Shu,

174
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,100
have you no heart?

175
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,620
I spent so many years with you

176
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,190
and that's all you have to say to me.

177
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,220
Ji Shu.

178
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,590
Here you are.

179
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,430
I told you

180
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
you don't have to bring me breakfast.

181
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,340
I know.

182
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,620
But you're not my boyfriend yet.

183
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,900
Other girls keep bringing you breakfast.

184
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,340
What if you fall in love with one of them one day?

185
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,900
I'll enjoy that privilege

186
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,980
after I become your girlfriend.

187
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,700
Fine. You're my girlfriend now.

188
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,580
You mean it?

189
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,420
Don't send me breakfast again.

190
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:52,750
Here.

191
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,750
Oh my god! You're my boyfriend now!

192
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,740
It's cold. Go home.

193
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,820
No.

194
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,300
I want to be with you

195
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,100
and tell the whole world about this good news!

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,160
I need to lay claim!

197
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,530
You're my boyfriend now.

198
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,620
He's my boyfriend.

199
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,020
Let's go.

200
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,460
He hasn't gotten over her

201
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,270
but is too proud to admit it?

202
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,990
I didn't do anything wrong.

203
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,540
Let bygones be bygones.

204
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,660
If there's nothing else,

205
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,880
I'll get going.

206
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,820
If you want to be a stalker,

207
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,480
work harder on your disguise.

208
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,220
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

209
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,540
Oh no.

210
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,340
I overheard his secret.

211
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,780
He hasn't gotten over his ex.

212
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,280
The copyright…

213
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,370
To compete with me,

214
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,770
you need to come up with something smarter.

215
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,940
Eavesdropping?

216
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,630
It's low, even for you.

217
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:24,750
Darn it.

218
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,380
Am I out?

219
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,540
No.

220
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,730
I won't give up until the last minute.

221
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,530
If Ji Shu sees me now,

222
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,700
will he beat me up?

223
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,460
After all, I just overheard

224
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,720
his romantic entanglements with his ex.

225
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,820
An extra like me

226
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,500
is usually used by the leading roles for catharsis

227
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,360
before they rekindle their love.

228
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:00,980
No.

229
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,710
I need to find a way to cozy up to him.

230
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,110
Find a way.

231
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,980
Find a way?

232
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,260
What can I do?

233
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,220
I'll say I wrenched my neck

234
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,460
and ask him if he knows how to treat it.

235
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,060
No.

236
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
He'd say I should go to the hospital.

237
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,460
Then should I

238
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,940
learn Tai Chi or Five Animal Frolics?

239
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,740
What are Five Animal Frolics like?

240
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,650
There must be tiger moves and snake moves.

241
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,660
Girl, watch out!

242
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
-I'm sorry. -You scared me.

244
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,740
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,500
Ji,

246
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,520
that girl is your girlfriend, right?

247
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,780
She's cute.

248
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,100
She's always waiting downstairs for you.

249
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,430
Did you two have a fight?

250
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,420
She was mumbling about

251
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,180
finding an excuse to see you.

252
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,500
She's not my girlfriend.

253
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,540
You young people

254
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,940
like making a fuss

255
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,630
about trivial things.

256
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,060
Have a good talk with her.

257
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,460
Think carefully before calling it quits.

258
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,300
It's hard to be with someone you love.

259
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,140
You can't expect her to be perfect.

260
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,900
No one is perfect.

261
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,100
Yeah. You have a point.

262
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,070
Glad that you agree with me.

263
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,460
I'll look forward to getting wedding candies from you.

264
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:25,980
I see.

265
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,140
I got it.

266
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
A gambit may help.

267
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,020
I'll tell him

268
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,940
that I'll give up

269
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,860
and won't get involved in his love affair

270
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,660
with his ex.

271
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,460
Will he use me to make Lin Qingmiao jealous?

272
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,300
Normally, when the leading roles are on bad terms,

273
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,310
a supporting role like me can always benefit from it.

274
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,980
Good idea.

275
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,220
You…

276
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,620
Mr. Ji.

277
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,860
Are you okay?

278
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,020
Who did that?

279
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,700
Him.

280
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,140
You're the vicious queen.

281
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,300
I need to defeat you.

282
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,480
The vicious queen?

283
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,780
I am the vicious queen

284
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,110
and love punishing naughty boys like you!

285
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,810
I'll teach you a lesson today!

286
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,220
You…

287
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,740
Stop! Stop!

288
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,800
You can't beat me, can you?

289
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,860
Your water gun!

290
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,510
Who are those children?

291
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,420
Thank you.

292
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,640
You're so kind.

293
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,470
I just don't want to see something embarrassing.

294
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,460
Mr. Ji,

295
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,050
I know your bark is worse than your bite.

296
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,260
You don't want me to catch a cold, right?

297
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,540
I want my jacket back.

298
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,380
Mr. Ji.

299
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,900
You can't take back the kindness

300
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,580
you showed.

301
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,860
Mr. Ji.

302
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,370
What?

303
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,220
I just want to tell you

304
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,460
that your secret

305
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,540
is safe with me.

306
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,980
My lips are sealed.

307
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,660
Do you need my help?

308
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,260
With what?

309
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,780
I think

310
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,940
you still have feelings for each other.

311
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,700
In movies, a couple like you

312
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,820
need a push from either a friend

313
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,140
or an enemy.

314
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I'd be glad to play such a role for you.

315
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,140
Do you need my help?

316
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,100
Why?

317
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,060
You want to be my wingman?

318
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,250
I just want to offer my help.

319
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,430
I can't bear to see you hurt each other.

320
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,230
Don't worry.

321
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,350
With my help,

322
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,060
you'll get her back for sure.

323
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,960
Song Yanqi.

324
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,310
What the hell are you thinking?

325
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,180
You…

326
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,920
and your novel.

327
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,820
Let's make a deal.

328
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
I'll help you get Lin Qingmiao back.

329
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,740
In return,

330
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,540
you'll sell me the copyright.

331
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,300
I can help you make her jealous

332
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,630
so you can see how much she cares about you.

333
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,440
Isn't it a wonderful idea?

334
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,670
Are you trying to make use of me and her?

335
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,380
How could you say that?

336
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,860
It's called a win-win!

337
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,580
I say no.

338
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,940
Why not?

339
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,200
Tell me what you think.

340
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,960
It's just out of the question.

341
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,730
Have you

342
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,319
gotten over Lin Qingmiao?

343
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,500
You went to all this trouble

344
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,740
just for the copyright.

345
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,540
Is it worth it?

346
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,579
My career is at stake.

347
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,020
Of course it's worth it.

348
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,180
So you won't give up?

349
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,200
Not when I'm still breathing.

350
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,020
Mr. Ji?

351
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,430
You only have one pair of slippers?

352
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,350
I live alone.

353
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,950
What is that?

354
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,960
Disinfectant.

355
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,440
Close the door.

356
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,950
Is that some kind of ritual?

357
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,660
This looks like a sample room.

358
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,660
You really live here?

359
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,000
The interior is so simple.

360
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,480
Take it.

361
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,090
A gift for me?

362
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,460
Change your wet clothes.

363
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,540
No need. I can change after I go home.

364
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,230
Are you sure?

365
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,100
Thank you.

366
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,180
Mr. Ji,

367
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,070
since you know why I'm here,

368
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,860
I won't beat around the bush.

369
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,660
I'll be frank.

370
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,270
What should I do to make you sell me the copyright?

371
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,980
I told you.

372
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,480
I won't sell it.

373
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,160
Ji…

374
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,300
Sorry.

375
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:55,890
Mr. Ji,

376
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,140
listen to me.

377
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,160
What are you doing?

378
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,730
Mr. Ji.

379
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,590
I didn't know you have mysophobia.

380
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,860
Staying clean is one of my ground rules.

381
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,250
Mr. Ji,

382
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
let me explain.

383
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,820
Listen to me.

384
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,540
About the copyright,

385
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,510
we can discuss it after I finish the novel.

386
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,600
You've changed your mind?

387
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,390
I promise you

388
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,290
I'll consider it.

389
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,140
Then when…

390
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,380
When do you plan to release new chapters?

391
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,060
How will the story end?

392
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,630
You want to know?

393
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,500
Of course.

394
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,180
All the readers want to know.

395
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,700
I'm lucky that I can

396
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
ask you directly.

397
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,900
I heard

398
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,700
that your novels usually have bad endings.

399
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,500
Is Brighter Than Stars the same?

400
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:10,580
Yes.

401
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,620
Why?

402
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,650
Will they break up?

403
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,980
Will one of them die?

404
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,630
[Fu Xingxing]

405
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,420
Shan Hang

406
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,750
[Fu Xingxing]

407
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,870
got the job not long ago.

408
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,620
He dealt with that matter.

409
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,910
Your tea is cold.

410
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,380
It's okay. I like cold tea.

411
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,340
I'm implying that you should see yourself out now.

412
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,700
That's a hint?

413
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,540
I'll get going then.

414
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,700
Mr. Ji,

415
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,300
I'll return your clothes after I wash them.

416
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,540
Didn't you say that sighs may call down bad luck?

417
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,620
You kept sighing.

418
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,860
Aren't you afraid of losing your good luck?

419
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,530
Perhaps I've run out of

420
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,180
my good luck.

421
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,140
Lady Luck is no longer with me.

422
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,980
Say something I can understand.

423
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,980
I overheard

424
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,900
Lin Qingmiao and Ji Shu's conversation today.

425
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,820
Things are more complicated than I thought.

426
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,300
They haven't gotten over each other.

427
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,030
Impossible.

428
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,100
Why?

429
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,080
What Lin QingMiao did to Ji Shu is unforgivable.

430
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
I've learned from Yu

431
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,900
what kind of person Ji Shu is.

432
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,360
There's no way that he's still hung on to her.

433
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,900
I believe what I saw.

434
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,460
You were not there.

435
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,500
You didn't see Ji Shu's reaction when Lin Qingmiao cried.

436
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,140
He looked indifferent,

437
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,300
but his hands clenched into fists

438
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,580
on his knees.

439
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,220
That's what men do in novels.

440
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,820
He thought he had let it go,

441
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,260
but the moment he saw tears streaming down her face,

442
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,020
he realized that he had never forgiven her.

443
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,440
Night after night, in his dreams,

444
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,380
he kept thinking about how to get back on her.

445
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,620
That sounds scary.

446
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,940
You need to know

447
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,420
that what you saw may not be the truth.

448
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,100
What you assumed

449
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,150
is definitely not the case!

450
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,700
It's not the case now,

451
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,280
but it may be in the future.

452
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,180
Who is she?

453
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,180
His ex.

454
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,660
Who am I

455
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,860
to compete with her?

456
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,250
I have a good idea.

457
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,420
What's it?

458
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,980
It requires more hard work on your part.

459
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,660
No problem.

460
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,190
I'm willing to do anything!

461
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,180
Why did you call him here?

462
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,100
No one in the world

463
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,420
knows Ji Shu better

464
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,140
than him.

465
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,230
That's true.

466
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,340
But what is your good idea?

467
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,380
If you can make Ji Shu fall for you

468
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,910
and become your boyfriend,

469
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,260
his ex won't be a threat anymore.

470
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,620
The copyright won't be a problem either.

471
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,020
Are you so eager

472
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,180
to get me off the market?

473
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,300
Don't get me wrong.

474
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,860
Ji Shu can be obnoxious sometimes,

475
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,340
but no one is perfect.

476
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,700
He's a good man in general.

477
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,200
I'd rather see him with you than with some strange girl.

478
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,980
You're not helping!

479
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,340
If that poker face

480
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,100
became my boyfriend,

481
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,710
I'd be driven mad every day.

482
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,740
Actually,

483
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,040
Ji's childhood was quite miserable.

484
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,780
His parents didn't care for him

485
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,020
and his first love

486
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,220
ran away with someone else.

487
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,100
He's 27 years old now.

488
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,780
He got money, a car, and a house.

489
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,910
He's also handsome.

490
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,700
But he only had one pure

491
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,400
and simple relationship.

492
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,380
He's so poor.

493
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,260
Really?

494
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,620
Ji Shu had only one relationship?

495
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,060
Yes.

496
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,320
Let me tell you.

497
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,960
Ji can't resist anyone who is nice to him.

498
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,940
If you treat him well,

499
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,940
he'll stay with you all the time

500
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,660
and become very sweet.

501
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,260
You can't even get rid of him.

502
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,040
Are you sure you're talking about Ji Shu?

503
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,540
He looks aloof,

504
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,130
but deep down,

505
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,820
he's a cute boy.

506
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,380
Every day and night,

507
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,900
he prays for a lasting relationship.

508
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,380
Don't look so skeptical.

509
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,620
You've read his novel.

510
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,130
Isn't it sweet at the beginning?

511
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,260
What does that mean?

512
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,700
It means he desires love.

513
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,150
He designed a bad ending

514
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,380
only because

515
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,980
he's heartbroken from his last relationship.

516
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,250
To cure a disease,

517
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,760
you must tackle the cause of the disease.

518
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,180
Trust me.

519
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,340
Ji's love life is very simple.

520
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
Making him fall for you is very easy.

521
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,100
Very easy.

522
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,780
Flirting with him is all you need to do.

523
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,180
We'll always be your backup

524
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,430
and strong support.

525
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,420
Is it really that simple?

526
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,230
Sounds like you're fooling me.

527
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,830
We're almost there!

528
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,420
Lu, give her the final push.

529
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,260
Leave it to me.

530
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,950
I mean it.

531
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,460
After you get to know him,

532
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,990
making him your boyfriend will only take…

533
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,900
One month?

534
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,180
One week.

535
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,860
Yes, one week.

536
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,400
One week is enough.

537
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,380
Isn't one week too short?

538
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,110
You think so?

539
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,980
Yes!

540
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,550
There are conflicts between them now.

541
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,210
It may take a little longer.

542
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,410
Yes. A little longer.

543
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,500
As we all know,

544
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,760
any habit can be formed in 21 days.

545
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,460
Get along with him in seven days.

546
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,740
Let him get used to you in 21 days.

547
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
Then…

548
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,780
Let Yu tell you

549
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,260
what is the key to winning Ji Shu's heart.

550
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,020
In short,

551
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,060
be patient.

552
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,100
One week.

553
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,540
No, 21 days will be enough.

554
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,540
It's really that simple?

555
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,220
Should I give it a try?

556
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,460
We made it?

557
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,420
Seems so.

558
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,940
But why do I feel

559
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,380
that you're kidding her?

560
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,890
But Song Yanqi doesn't think I am.

561
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,020
Has she really bought it?

562
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,060
I've made up my mind.

563
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,360
I'll do as you said.

564
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,680
I'll make him my boyfriend in 21 days.

565
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,700
Lu Qiyu.

566
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,700
Send me

567
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,460
all his likes and dislikes.

568
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,380
For my project and career,

569
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
I have to come up with a perfect plan.

570
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,890
You have a point.

571
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,780
So can you guys tell me more

572
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,100
about what he likes?

573
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,940
For example, where he likes to go or…

574
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,310
[The Plan of Landing Ji Xu in 21 Days]

575
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,940
I

576
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,340
will definitely make it.

577
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,280
♫I want to be around you  like stars♫

578
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,690
♫Blinking and telling you secrets♫

579
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,490
♫Approaching a wonderful scenario♫

580
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,880
♫The starry sky is the place where wishes belong♫

581
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,250
♫Although we're ordinary♫

582
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,860
♫We won't be replaced♫

583
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,260
Mr. Ji.

584
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,760
What a surprise! You're jogging too?

585
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,640
Say something.

586
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,660
Good morning.

587
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,670
Haven't you had breakfast?

588
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,570
There's a very good breakfast restaurant over there.

589
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,810
You came to me so early

590
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,980
just to recommend a restaurant to me?

591
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,330
No.

592
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,140
I want to have breakfast with you.

593
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,860
What do you say?

594
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,220
No.

595
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,710
I don't eat before exercising.

596
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,500
Good for you.

597
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,340
Ouch!

598
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,490
You need to warm up before exercising.

599
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,130
Are you caring about me?

600
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,530
I'm caring about myself.

601
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm afraid of being dragged down by you.

602
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,020
Being dragged down by me?

603
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,020
Good idea.

604
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
What's wrong with you?

605
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,430
I'm fine.

606
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,580
I'm not.

607
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,380
Why?

608
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,660
You're in my way.

609
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,860
I'm in your way?

610
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,460
You're thick as a brick.

611
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,820
Can't you see that I'm pursuing you?

612
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,580
Lu Qiyu said being nice to him always works.

613
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,150
How nicer do I have to be?

614
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,660
That's my chance.

615
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,900
Are you crazy? Watch where you're going!

616
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,160
You came out for dinner on your birthday…

617
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,960
Are you crazy? Watch where you're going!

618
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,110
Are you okay?

619
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,460
Are you okay?

620
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,510
I'm fine.

621
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,980
Keep your eyes on the road.

622
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,580
And you.

623
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,460
Well done, Song Yanqi.

624
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,470
Looks like cheesy lines work.

625
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,500
I forgot to wear perfume.

626
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,740
What's wrong this time?

627
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,820
I think I sprained my ankle.

628
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,880
It's a bit serious.

629
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
My bone is broken.

630
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:48,950
Here.

631
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,280
What's that scent?

632
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,620
What scent?

633
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,140
It's weird.

634
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,260
Weirdly nice, right?

635
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,260
Be normal.

636
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,510
Did you use some weird perfume?

637
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,220
No. I'm not wearing perfume.

638
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,490
Why?

639
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
You kind of smell.

640
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,260
I smell?

641
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,720
Did you pee your pants?

642
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,260
I…

643
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,020
No. Don't do it.

644
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,380
This guy concerns my future.

645
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,820
I can't kill him now.

646
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,080
I smell?

647
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,290
I doubt that.

648
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,220
Can't you stay?

649
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,140
Insensitive moron.

650
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,460
I'll get you eventually.

651
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
According to Great Pharmacopoeia,

652
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,450
boil three grams of ginseng,

653
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,230
six grams of atractylodes,

654
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,860
three grams of poria,

655
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,880
1.5 grams of licorice,

656
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,390
three slices of ginger,

657
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,700
one date

658
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,620
with two cups of water

659
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,140
to get one cup of decoction.

660
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,400
Drink it before meals.

661
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,110
It's called Four Gentlemen Decoction

662
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,500
and helps with digestion.

663
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,260
I see.

664
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,600
I'll go buy those herbs later.

665
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,180
Mr. Zhang,

666
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,790
medicine is toxic more or less.

667
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,390
You should eat more fruits and vegetables

668
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,400
and exercise more.

669
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,630
Get enough rest.

670
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,580
Okay.

671
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,020
Why did I lose again?

672
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,900
Li, you lost.

673
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,060
You said that whoever wins

674
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,740
can have this crayfish.

675
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,820
Forget it.

676
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,820
Mr. Li,

677
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,460
it's just a game.

678
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,820
I'm a man of my word.

679
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,020
This crayfish is yours.

680
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,750
The game is over.

681
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,520
Let's go

682
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,460
do some exercise.

683
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:09,940
Let's go.

684
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,420
-Okay. -Bye.

685
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:10,820
Go. Go.

686
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,060
-Let's go. -Okay.

687
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,199
You do have an old soul, don't you?

688
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,150
What are you doing here?

689
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,960
I came to practice Tai Chi.

690
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,940
All right.

691
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,280
Let's call it a day.

692
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,120
See you guys tomorrow.

693
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,060
Wait, sir.

694
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,060
I just arrived. You can't leave so soon.

695
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,060
I haven't learned anything yet.

696
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,860
I've never seen a young girl interested in Tai Chi.

697
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,440
I don't think she's here to learn Tai Chi.

698
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,130
I am. I like Tai Chi.

699
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
It's my new hobby and I'm a rookie.

700
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,620
Girl, we've done practicing today.

701
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,420
Why don't you…

702
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,620
Ji, you teach her.

703
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,660
Let's go.

704
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,190
Let's go.

705
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,540
You really want to learn Tai Chi?

706
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,020
Teach me, please.

707
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,400
I'll be a good student.

708
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,830
Feet shoulder distance apart.

709
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,660
Mr. Ji,

710
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,060
I learned online

711
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,660
that you need to hold my hands

712
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,740
to show me the moves.

713
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,830
Hold your hands?

714
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,300
I mean, I'm not very smart and just looking at you

715
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,100
is not enough.

716
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,740
Please, Mr. Ji.

717
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,910
Feet shoulder distance apart.

718
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Raise your hands.

719
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,820
Push.

720
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,030
Do you want to learn or not?

721
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,260
Well,

722
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,220
Mr. Ji.

723
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,910
Do you like drinking water?

724
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,010
Sort of.

725
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,710
Then you like 70 percent of me.

726
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,490
Time is running out.

727
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,420
I'm going back to work, Mr. Ji.

728
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,660
Hello?

729
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,030
How is it?

730
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,580
How do you like your gift?

731
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,020
Have you found the information I asked for?

732
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
I'm working on it.

733
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,900
I can give it to you tonight.

734
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,180
By the way, you haven't answered my question.

735
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,980
I have to get the report tonight.

736
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,240
Nothing else matters.

737
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,900
Buzz kill.

738
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,820
Don't even ask.

739
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,590
Those relationship blogs say

740
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,580
that having physical contact now and then,

741
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,620
showing your weakness in front of him,

742
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,140
and acting strong after falling

743
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,470
are all good ways to bring him closer to me.

744
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,900
But they turned out to be ways

745
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,780
that made him repulse me more.

746
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,090
Don't tell me

747
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,820
you've done all those pretentious things.

748
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,060
I even acted cute and said cheesy lines.

749
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,140
Song Yanqi.

750
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,970
Have you learned nothing

751
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,860
from all the romantic novels you read?

752
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,020
I suspect

753
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,860
that Ji Shu knows all the tricks used in novels.

754
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Did you wear perfume as I told you to?

755
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,060
That's how

756
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,660
I got Lu Qiyu.

757
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,940
I did.

758
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,060
But you know me.

759
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,140
I never wear perfume.

760
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,540
The scent makes me dizzy.

761
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,540
Come on.

762
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,620
Just show him your feminine side.

763
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,980
I want to.

764
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,710
But I just don't have that side.

765
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,220
I wore perfume for him despite the discomfort.

766
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,180
Guess what he said.

767
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,580
What?

768
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,700
He said I was smelly and asked if I had wet myself.

769
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,900
Seems that I have to do something.

770
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,980
Just wait.

771
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,900
Lu Qiyu told me that Ji Shu will go camping soon.

772
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,780
I'll find out where he plans to go.

773
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,990
Hurry up. I'll wait for your reply.

774
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,260
Done.

775
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,060
It's 10:10 now.

776
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,900
Can you sleep in ten minutes?

777
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,300
You said you must have it tonight,

778
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,500
so I sent it to you in person.

779
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,840
[Information of Bifengge.com]

780
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm exhausted.

781
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,580
Shan Hang?

782
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,940
Yes, I didn't expect it to be him.

783
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,980
I heard from Xingxing

784
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,660
that he's recently joined their company.

785
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,850
The previous person in charge went on a business trip.

786
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,460
He fixed all the breakdowns

787
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,540
of the system recently.

788
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,580
He did a great job with almost no flaws.

789
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,660
But I'm confused.

790
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,790
He's built his own website.

791
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Why is willing to work for another company?

792
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,100
Is he trying to steal business secrets?

793
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,030
Is it a coincidence?

794
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,760
What coincidence?

795
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,110
Nothing.

796
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,660
Now that I've got the information,

797
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,620
you can leave now.

798
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,220
By the way,

799
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,740
are you going camping this weekend?

800
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,060
What's wrong?

801
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,920
Nothing. I'm just asking.

802
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,940
Where are you going this time?

803
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,800
A nearby beach.

804
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,200
A beach?

805
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,860
Okay. I'm leaving.

806
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,520
Good night.

807
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,270
I can see myself out.

808
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,700
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is not available.

809
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,660
Sorry.

810
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,650
Ji Shu.

811
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,640
What brought you here?

812
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,780
I came to see you.

813
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,060
Let's have breakfast together.

814
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,520
No need.

815
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,940
Ji Shu,

816
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,860
despite what happened,

817
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,860
we went to high school and college together.

818
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,260
Can't we just be friends?

819
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,220
It's just breakfast.

820
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,150
Let's go.

821
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,590
Why didn't you go out this weekend?

822
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,180
I remember

823
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,040
that you enjoyed going out alone.

824
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,380
I'll go out this afternoon.

825
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,510
Where are you going?

826
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,140
I'm just asking.

827
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,920
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

828
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,780
I'll go camping on the beach.

829
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,510
Camping?

830
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,180
Sounds great.

831
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,360
The breakfast here is so good.

832
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,840
Do you come here often?

833
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,660
Are you still with Shan Hang?
