to shift the development strategy

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
I think

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
the so-called IPs

87
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,260
are novels and comics

88
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,620
and other forms of works with popularity.

89
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,580
The more popular ones

90
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,180
are big IPs.

91
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,110
The less popular ones are fake IPs.

92
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,340
But in the end,

93
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,290
it's all about content.

94
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,380
As long as the content is good,

95
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,659
real gold is not afraid of fire,

96
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,460
sooner or later,

97
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,290
the content will be known outside of the industry,

98
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,659
which will make the work a big IP.

99
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,260
So,

100
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,300
we should

101
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,980
focus on the content.

102
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,100

113
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,220
The hero gave up his career for the heroine.

114
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,900
The heroine sacrificed silently for the hero.

115
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,940

124

We can change the name.

125
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,980
It's mainly about the content.

126
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,140
Its mood is in line with

127
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,180
our company's mission.

128
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,220
High sweetness, no sadness.

129
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
And it fits the current market demand for sweetness.

130
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,680
Mr. Jia,

131
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,020
none of this author's works has been adapted into a drama yet.

132
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,820
Without the market inspection,

133
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,659
I don't recommend the company to take the risk.

134
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,700
The content of the novel fits the current market.

135
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,220
Besides,

136
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,620
it has good data and many fans.

137
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,020
Then we should be more careful.

138
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,860
It's not necessary good to have many fans.

139
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,740
Most book fans

140
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,340
don't like novels to be adapted.

141
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,500
When adapting popular novels into films and dramas,

142
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,230
we might be criticized for ruining the original.

143
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,540
I...

144
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,500
Song Yanqi, how about this?

145
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,460
You go talk to the author

146
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,590
about the copyright

147
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,030
and ask about the price.

148
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,700
We'll

149
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,300
see the cost performance first

150
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,230
before we decide

151
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,490
if we'll buy it or not.

152
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,260
Okay, I promise I'll complete the task.

Don't be happy too soon.

155

170

I didn't expect that Ji Shu lives near our neighborhood.

171
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
This high-end neighborhood is really different.

172
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,960
I need to register.

173
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,300
Luckily, I got in.

174
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,860
What should I say

175
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,390
to start the conversation?

176
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,170
Ji Shu!

177
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,690
No way.

178
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,750
I should be gentle.

179
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,260
Ji Shu.

180
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,790
He'll think I'm a fanatic fan.

181
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,550
I should be more professional.

182
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,180
Mr. Ji.

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,260
Hello.

Excuse me.

190

No.

No.

565
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,820
You don't?

566
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,790
The whole world knows he has a girlfriend.

567
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,080
She's right there.

568
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,600
Xining.

569
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,780
Be careful.

570
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,260
Xining.

571
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,780
Look at you.

572
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,300
Why are you hiding in that corner?

573
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,020
Let me introduce.

574
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,340
Yu Le's real girlfriend.

575
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,020
Xining.

576
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,020
Why are you hiding there all alone in aggravation?

577
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,750
You should come out and swear to the sovereignty.

578
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,380
OK.

579
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,580
Yu Le.

580
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,140
And you.

581
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,820
My good son.

582
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,940
Don't you want to fight for your career?

583
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,100
You can't be two-timing.

584
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,100
You're ruining your own future.

585
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,020
I...

586
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,260
Qi.

587
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,260
Why are you here?

588
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,310
What did you call me?

589
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,860
Qi.

590
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,740
Qi?

591
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,620
How did she know me?

592
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,140
You...

593
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:23,900

This dream is so real.
