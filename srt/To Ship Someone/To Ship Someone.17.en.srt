4
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,020
Ji Shu!

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,820
Are you crazy?

6
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,820
Ji Shu!

7
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,140
Ji Shu?

8
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,350
I didn't expect to see you after I died.

9
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,060
Song Yanqi!

10
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,120
Song Yanqi!

11
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,020
Ji.

12
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,540
How did she fall into the sea?

13
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,600
Call an ambulance!

14
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,720
Qin Hai Resort.

15
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,300
Someone fell into the sea.

16
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,740
Hurry!

17
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,140
Song Yanqi.

18
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,630
Don't do this again.

19
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,100
The coat.

20
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,460
Here.

21
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,020
Qi.

22
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,340
How did you fall into the sea?

23
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,940
You scared the hell out of me.

24
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,290
I…

25
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,860
I…

26
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,420
Did…

27
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,340
Did I die?

28
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,650
Am I dead?

29
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,660
You're not dead.

30
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,060
But I was scared to death.

31
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm alive?

32
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,340
That's good.

33
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,370
Lady Luck

34
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,660
is still

35
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,980
on my side.

36
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,100
Thank God you didn't die.

37
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,430
If it weren't for Ji Shu,

38
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,510
I'd have to come here to mourn you every year on this day.

39
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,980
What a pity.

40
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,420
You've lost an excuse

41
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,260
to travel to the sea every year.

42
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,340
Stop kidding.

43
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,860
Let's go to the hospital now.

44
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,140
I…

45
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,410
I don't need to go to the hospital.

46
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:09,980
I'm fine.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,420
-Luckily, Ji realized that you were in danger. -I'm fine.

48
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,080
Otherwise…

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,780
But Ji,

50
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,980
how did you know she was in danger?

51
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,810
Is this

52
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,700
some kind of telepathy?

53
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,060
Let's go.

54
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,899
Let's go back.

55
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,980
I'm sorry

56
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,440
for making you guys worry.

57
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,580
Come.

58
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,580
You really don't need to go to the hospital?

59
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,060
No. I'm fine.

60
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,180
Don't waste money.

61
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,909
You're so afraid of hospitals.

62
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,430
Let's go back first.

63
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,340
Ji,

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,100
should we keep going with

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,540
the activities we planned?

66
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,500
Of course not!

67
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,100
We'll go back to our rooms and rest.

68
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,620
No.

69
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,410
Stick to the plan.

70
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,830
Can Qi handle it?

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,460
Maybe she needs some rest.

72
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,460
I'm fine.

73
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
Stick to the plan.

74
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,330
Qingmiao.

75
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,540
You said you wanted ice cream.

76
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,100
I waited so long that it melted.

77
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,140
I bought you new ones of different flavors.

78
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,340
Which one do you want?

79
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,920
I have no appetite.

80
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,100
Let's go take a walk.

81
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,500
I've searched online

82
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,980
and found several great places.

83
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
They're all popular

84
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,240
and photogenic spots.

85
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,620
I want to rest.

86
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Did I do something wrong?

87
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,860
It's not your fault.

88
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,380
It's mine.

89
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,420
Then why did you…

90
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,940
Can we not talk about this?

91
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,100
You promised me

92
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,080
that you wouldn't contact him again.

93
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,390
Why did you lie to me?

94
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,210
Coming.

95
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,930
I kept calling you,

96
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,170
but you didn't answer.

97
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,260
So I came to check on you.

98
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,220
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.

99
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,659
I have something to tell you.

100
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,740
Come in.

101
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,640
Have a seat.

102
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,100
Did you have a good rest?

103
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,460
Yes.

104
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,180
I'm well enough now.

105
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,420
Then

106
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,420
let's comb through the whole thing

107
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,820
from the very beginning.

108
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,180
Okay.

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,700
Shan Hang is the mastermind behind the fan fiction world.

110
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,500
That's a fact.

111
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,820
But why?

112
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,460
Why did he do that?

113
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,500
Maybe

114
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,080
it's because of me.

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,540
Because of what happened in college?

116
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,700
We'll find out

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,800
when it's time.

118
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,020
Our priority now

119
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,100
is to find the evidence

120
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,780
that proves Shan Hang is the culprit

121
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,580
who hurt others intentionally.

122
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,150
What are you going to do?

123
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,480
Look for evidence.

124
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,380
How?

125
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,700
I'll confront him.

126
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,610
I'm a victim and a witness.

127
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,020
You have no solid evidence

128
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,260
to convict him.

129
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,620
Sit.

130
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,070
Don't worry.

131
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,659
We'll keep going with the vacation as we planned.

132
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,580
When Shan Hang knows we're back in the real world,

133
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,020
he'll definitely do something.

134
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,740
Okay.

135
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,940
Let's do what you say.

136
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,260
This boring pastime must be

137
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,700
the idea of the guy next to me, right?

138
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,580
Wrong.

139
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,900
It's the idea of the guy next to me.

140
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,540
I didn't expect Lu Qiyu

141
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,610
to have an old soul too.

142
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,340
Wrong again.

143
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,060
He's a "friendphile".

144
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,420
I know the word ailurophile

145
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,100
but never heard of "friendphile".

146
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,580
Me neither.

147
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,700
I can't stand it anymore.

148
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,420
I'm about to fall asleep.

149
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,370
It surprises me

150
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,830
that Lu can stand it.

151
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,480
You overestimate him.

152
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,540
He's kind of in a trance now.

153
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,740
A thumbs up to him.

154
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,660
I should've checked the horoscope before coming out.

155
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,300
Ji Shu.

156
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,340
I'm here.

157
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,380
People say

158
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,260
that men can never forget their first love.

159
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,140
They may move on,

160
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,580
but the scar will always be there.

161
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,740
Tell me.

162
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,620
Do you think Ji Shu can resist his first love

163
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,520
if she's still obsessed with him?

164
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,530
Fu Xingxing.

165
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,660
Are you still my friend?

166
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,980
Stop gloating.

167
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,980
I'm not gloating.

168
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,410
Just giving you a heads-up.

169
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,140
Don't worry.

170
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,680
I've always got your back.

171
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,030
You came uninvited!

172
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
You didn't invite me

173
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,850
but someone else did.

174
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,160
I asked her to come.

175
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,300
Since

176
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
we are all friends

177
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,460
and know each other,

178
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,060
we should hang out together.

179
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,660
Come.

180
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,900
Sit next to me.

181
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,610
Do you remember

182
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,020
the last time we went fishing?

183
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,300
We were sophomores then.

184
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,060
Yeah.

185
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,620
Time flies.

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,140
Song Yanqi.

187
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,660
Let me tell you something.

188
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,500
Back then,

189
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Ji Shu and I had a misunderstanding.

190
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,050
Ji Shu asked me out this time

191
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,900
to explain what happened.

192
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,340
A misunderstanding?

193
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,740
What misunderstanding?

194
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,740
If you hadn't

195
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,460
stolen Ji Shu's flash drive,

196
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
he wouldn't have been accused of plagiarism.

197
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,900
That's the truth.

198
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,370
Enough.

199
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,540
Fu Xingxing.

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,760
Don't call my name!

201
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,370
Ji.

202
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't tell me

203
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,190
you're still hung up on her.

204
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,210
What's wrong with Song Yanqi?

205
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,660
Yu.

206
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,850
You shouldn't be on her side.

207
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,860
You're supposed to be closer

208
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,490
to us than to them.

209
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,420
What are you talking about?

210
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,350
We're not close.

211
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,340
Xingxing.

212
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,980
Don't listen to her.

213
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,380
She's trying to sow discord.

214
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,900
Ji Shu,

215
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,740
do you agree with her?

216
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,060
Qi,

217
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,260
you and Qingyao are colleagues.

218
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,520
We all know each other.

219
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,730
It's just

220
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,770
hanging out together

221
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,700
and catching up.

222
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,700
Don't think too much.

223
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,300
You two are sitting so close

224
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,420
just to catch up?

225
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,180
All right.

226
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,620
Qingmiao.

227
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,340
I thought you were resting in your room.

228
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,600
Why are you out fishing

229
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,820
without me?

230
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,340
I invited her.

231
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,820
I thought

232
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,180
she would tell you

233
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,500
that I asked her out.

234
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,560
I didn't expect her

235
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,000
to keep it from you.

236
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,460
Yeah.

237
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,180
Not only did she not tell you,

238
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,100
but she's sitting close to her ex.

239
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,260
Luckily, I'm not his girlfriend.

240
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,780
If my boyfriend

241
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,260
was so intimate with his ex,

242
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,390
I'd hit the ceiling.

243
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,140
You came here just because he asked?

244
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,980
I'm here to talk about the copyright.

245
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,060
Copyright?

246
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,980
Since you arrived,

247
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,220
I haven't heard you

248
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,580
say anything about work.

249
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,660
You're so professional, aren't you?

250
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,900
What do you mean?

251
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,750
She doesn't mean anything.

252
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,570
She just told your boyfriend what was going on.

253
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,340
A storm is coming.

254
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,220
It's dangerous here.

255
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,300
Let's leave.

256
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,180
Lu Qiyu,

257
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,210
shame on you.

258
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,980
I understand that Qingmiao prioritizes her work.

259
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,180
She always keeps things professional.

260
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,580
We've known Ji Shu

261
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,700
for many years.

262
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,900
But you,

263
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,980
you would do anything

264
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,430
to get what you want.

265
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,980
Ji Shu.

266
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:49,900
I know

267
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,620
that Song Yanqi came to you first.

268
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,220
I shouldn't have come here,

269
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,620
but this is a task assigned by my superior.

270
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,480
I had no choice.

271
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,140
He didn't think Song Yanqi could do it

272
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,820
and asked me to help her.

273
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,950
If I gave you the wrong idea,

274
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,910
I apologize.

275
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,350
It's not your fault.

276
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,820
Qi shouldn't

277
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,150
have been so impulsive.

278
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,060
Fine.

279
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,940
It's all my fault.

280
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,500
Take your time.

281
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,230
I'm leaving.

282
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,300
Let's have dinner

283
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,230
together later.

284
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,460
Okay.

285
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,260
I'll go back and get prepared.

286
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
See you at the restaurant

287
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,220
at 6 p.m.

288
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,540
See you then.

289
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,860
Qingmiao.

290
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,100
Spill.

291
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,710
What's the matter with you?

292
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,060
Just now,

293
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,550
Qi and I were acting.

294
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,070
-Acting? -Acting?

295
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,180
For what?

296
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,780
You want to take whatever I have.

297
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,740
Ji Shu,

298
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,220
haven't you taken enough from me?

299
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,960
The teachers favored you.

300
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,460
Your readers love you.

301
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,790
The netizens trust you.

302
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,740
Even Song Yanqi helped you without hesitation.

303
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,730
Why do you want to have Lin Qingmiao too?

304
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,980
Now you know

305
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,420
everything.

306
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,820
It hurts?

307
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,420
Of course.

308
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,180
Why don't you pinch yourself?

309
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,040
One more thing.

310
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,110
I want to give up my pen name.

311
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,860
What?

312
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,220
You want to give up your pen name?

313
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,540
Ji Shu.

314
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,340
Are you crazy?

315
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,420
Do you know what it means

316
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,300
to give up your pen name?

317
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,940
I know.

318
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,340
Then why do you want to do it?

319
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,540
Song Yanqi is concerned.

320
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,470
I have no choice.

321
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,470
What do you mean?

322
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,870
Since I was accused of plagiarism,

323
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
Qi has stopped writing fan fiction.

324
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,260
We both thought

325
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,990
once she stopped writing,

326
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,740
we wouldn't be pulled into the fan fiction world.

327
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
But we were wrong.

328
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,980
As long as the novel keeps updating,

329
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,770
even if she stops writing fan fiction,

330
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,900
we'll be pulled into that world again.

331
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,460
My god.

332
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,300
I'm shocked that there's really a parallel world

333
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,560
and it's so close to me.

334
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,580
Can you believe it?

335
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,940
I-I do

336
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,620
or do not?

337
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,420
Ji,

338
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,100
did you really travel

339
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,960
into the novel?

340
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,300
How?

341
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,500
By

342
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,460
being electrocuted,

343
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,380
or jumping off a building,

344
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,110
or sleeping?

345
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,220
Can I do it?

346
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,660
Wait.

347
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
Do you really

348
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,140
believe me?

349
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,780
Yes.

350
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,700
Strange things happen every day.

351
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,300
Many things can't be explained by science.

352
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,980
Qi once mentioned traveling to another world too.

353
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,820
Tell me now.

354
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,620
How can you keep such a cool knack to yourself?

355
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,020
I've never seen what other worlds are like.

356
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,740
Well,

357
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,940
this website is the entrance.

358
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
Be more specific.

359
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,900
Are you sure?

360
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,500
Once you go in,

361
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,810
you won't be able to leave very soon.

362
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,780
-Yes. -Yes.

363
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,300
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

364
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,500
I'll take it as a trip.

365
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,700
Click this fan fiction

366
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,180
and you'll go there.

367
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,060
Ji,

368
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,180
today

369
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,340
is not April Fool's Day, right?

370
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,780
I never made things hard for you

371
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,940
at work, did I?

372
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,380
I'm not lying.

373
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,660
Why don't you

374
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,260
try again?

375
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,060
Ji Shu.

376
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,220
This is not fun at all!

377
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,900
I…

378
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,260
I swear I'm not lying.

379
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
This website was built by Shan Hang.

380
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,030
Besides,

381
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,500
he is the culprit.

382
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,380
I've known him for many years.

383
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,260
I can't recall him

384
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,140
making so ridiculous a joke before.

385
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,000
How about this?

576
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,890
The Art of War says

577
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,220
Dao is the spirit of skills.

578
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,580
Skills make the body of Dao.

579
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,620
Learn skills through Dao.

580
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,900
Attain Dao through skills.

581
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,060
I mean,

582
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,780
the soul can command the body.

583
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,060
The body's behaviors can in return

584
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,190
enlighten the soul.

585
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,620
Behaviors and thoughts can't be separated.

586
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,540
You don't want to

587
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,600
regret your decision one day, do you?

588
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,220
What's wrong?

589
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,100
Song Yanqi.

590
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,140
If you

591
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,450
made a mistake

592
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,500
and because of this mistake,

593
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,070
you lost the whole world

594
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
and even

595
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,920
couldn't feel it anymore,

596
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,850
what would you do?

597
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,500
Even someone as optimistic as you

598
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,030
doesn't know how to answer.

599
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,820
Emilia in Othello said,

600
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,240
why, the wrong is but a wrong in the world;

601
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,220
having the world for your labor,

602
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,300
it's a wrong

603
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,980
in your own world,

604
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,220
and you might quickly make it right.

605
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,300
Although

606
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,150
it's a bit out of context

607
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,760
and I don't know what is the mistake you made,

608
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,580
Ji Shu,

609
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,460
I trust you.

610
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,150
The key is in your hands.

611
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,060
You don't have to lock yourself in the cage.

612
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,880
Song Yanqi.

613
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,040
You've really read

614
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,620
a lot of novels.

615
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,460
You're quite persuading

616
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,740
and smooth-tongued.

617
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,060
I'll take it as a compliment.

618
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,180
Actually,

619
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,490
I had a sister.

620
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,280
Her name was Ji Fei.

621
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,220
The one in the novel?

622
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,260
Yes.

623
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,740
Where is she now?

624
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,570
When I was eight,

625
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
she was stillborn

626
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,020
because of me.

627
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,860
That's why

628
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,300
there's always a Ji Fei

629
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,740
in your every story.

630
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,350
When I was young,

631
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,460
my parents loved each other.

632
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,580
Then my dad

633
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,640
lost his business.

634
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,540
They started to quarrel a lot

635
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,340
because of money and many other trivial things.

636
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,180
Where's the money?

637
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,460
Why didn't you get the money back?

638
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,340
I'll get it back in a few days.

639
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,260
Can't you calm down?

640
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,100
How can I calm down?

641
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,260
You can't get the money back!

642
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,020
Shut up.

643
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,500
You're always complaining when I'm home.

644
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,100
You never stop complaining.

645
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,540
What's the result?

646
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,270
Take a guess.

647
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,910
Take a guess.

648
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,260
Just tell me.

649
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,580
The suspense is killing me! Tell me now.

650
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,230
-Ji Fei's existence -Look.

651
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:48,980
brought peace

652
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,780
to our family.

653
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,220
I once thought

654
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,520
that life would never change.

655
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,140
There were conflicts,

656
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,980
but the overall situation was good.

657
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,110
When Mother was five months pregnant,

658
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,240
Father's business failed again.

659
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,020
He lost money in a scam

660
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,740
and became despondent.

661
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,270
Get lost.

662
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,580
They quarreled

663
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,620
more and more often.

664
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,420
You're crazy!

665
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,660
You're crazy!

666
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,620
Shu.

667
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,220
I told you to do your homework.

668
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,620
Why are you playing here?

669
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,090
I'm sorry, Mom.

670
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,780
And I

671
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,000
ruined the only chance that we had to hold our family together.

672
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,500
Yeah.

673
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,730
Lu Qiyu thinks

674
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,580
that I'm not close with my parents

675
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,910
because they divorced.

676
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,550
That's just part of the reason.

677
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,900
I don't know

678
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,330
how to face them.

679
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
When I was little,

680
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,460
Mom asked me

681
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,630
whether I'd like to leave with her.

682
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,420
I refused.

683
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,220
You once asked me

684
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,820
why I wrote novels.

685
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,710
You said it was a way to treat your illness.

686
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,900
Yes.

687
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,300
After that accident,

688
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
I became more and more indifferent.

689
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,060
Many people think

690
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,220
the plagiarism scandal in college

691
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,550
had a great impact on me.

692
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,300
But actually,

693
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,580
it just made me realize

694
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,280
that I grew up with Childhood Emotional Neglect

695
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,340
and I'm a bit different from others.

696
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,120
I didn't care about

697
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
what others thought about me at all.

698
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,900
That's why you thought of

699
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,160
writing novels to cure yourself?

700
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,900
Do you know that storytelling has healing powers?

701
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,780
We often get surprised

702
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,500
by other people's life experiences

703
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,540
and forget

704
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,020
that our lives

705
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,730
are just like novels

706
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,540
that are full of drama

707
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,080
and unexpected turns.

708
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,620
My therapist advised me

709
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,220
to use storytelling as a way

710
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,280
to go through all the things that happened to me,

711
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,420
and to create new stories

712
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,740
with those things.

713
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,100
In that way, I can

714
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,920
observe as a bystander

715
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,780
what I've experienced.

716
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,340
What are they talking about?

717
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,260
Could it be

718
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,140
that Song Yanqi is confessing her love?

719
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,710
How can we miss this important moment?

720
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,490
Why did you

721
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,180
tell me this today?

722
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,740
Because

723
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,600
you've stepped into my heart.

724
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,110
I found that my feelings for you

725
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,500
are different.

726
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,720
Every time you were in danger,

727
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,190
I was also scared of losing you.

728
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,180
I know I have many shortcomings,

729
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,460
but

730
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,200
since I want to change our relationship,

731
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
I have to tell you

732
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,110
what kind of person I am.

733
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,900
The decision

734
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,000
is up to you.

735
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,580
What did he mean?

736
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,260
Was he confessing his love?

737
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,220
Does he like me?

738
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,580
But he didn't say those words.

739
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,110
What on earth did that mean?

740
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,340
Sorry.

741
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,680
What's wrong with you?

742
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,500
I…

743
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,580
You…

744
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,950
Why are you stuttering?

745
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,220
What were you talking about?

746
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,490
Nothing. Let's eat.

747
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,900
What were you talking about?

748
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,220
Nothing. Let's eat.

749
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,380
Let's eat.

750
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,020
Here.

751
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,400
Toast it up.

752
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,080
Cheers.

753
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,540
Ji,

754
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,860
just eating

755
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,870
is quite boring.

756
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,750
How about we play a game?

757
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,470
Let's play the very classic

758
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,300
Truth

759
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:55,940
or Dare.

760
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,020
Boring.

761
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,500
Then what do you suggest?

762
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,300
Play mahjong?

763
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,400
Truth or Dare it is.

764
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,380
Here we go. Truth or Dare.

765
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,710
I'll rotate this bottle

766
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,260
and see who it points at.

767
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,420
Qi.

768
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,150
You go first.

769
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,060
I'll choose for you.

770
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,699
Truth.

771
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,420
What were you two talking about?

772
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,020
What were you talking about?

773
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,380
You're keeping secrets.

774
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,340
You're keeping secrets.

775
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:22,900
Again.

776
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,070
Stop drinking. I'll drink.

777
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,469
Look! A shooting star!

778
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,130
Coming.

779
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,540
Everyone is here.

780
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,780
Let's start.

781
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,340
First bow to heaven and earth.

782
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,500
Second bow to our parents.

783
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,260
I'm ready.

784
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,610
Bow to each other.

785
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,420
Bow. Bow.

786
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,650
Why didn't you bow?

787
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,380
I'll bow now.

788
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,680
Don't make me make you.

789
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,620
That's right.

790
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,420
The ceremony is completed. Time to consummate the marriage.

791
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,630
I'll leave my best buddy

792
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,090
to you.

793
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,070
Let's go.

794
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,620
Hurry up.

795
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,620
Take your time

796
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,130
I'll leave him to you.

797
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,060
I'll come later.

798
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,020
I…

799
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,660
Bro.

800
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,290
Have you seen Ji Shu?

801
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,020
I'm looking for him. I…

802
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:50,990
Let's go.

803
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,340
Let's go find him.

804
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,460
Go find him.

805
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,100
What did he mean?

806
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,090
Why is the beer kicking in now?

807
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,780
I want to ask…

808
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,000
What do you want to ask?

809
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,860
You…

810
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,490
Just now,

811
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,740
were you saying

812
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,700
that you like me?

813
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,490
What do you think?

814
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,460
I'm asking you because I don't know.

815
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,540
D-Don't move.

816
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,540
I can't see clearly.

817
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
What did you mean?

818
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,100
What I meant is,

819
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,580
I like you.

820
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,350
So I've succeeded in pursuing you!

821
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,260
You were pursuing me?

822
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,380
Yeah.

823
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,900
You didn't know?

824
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,720
Congratulations.

825
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,600
You made it.

826
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,340
What?

827
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,440
You're too happy to speak?

828
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,380
I made a wish today.

829
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,220
What is it?

830
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,660
I wish

831
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,500
that someone

832
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,100
could like me.

833
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
No.

834
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,420
I can't be with you.

835
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,980
Why?

836
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,620
I'm a bad woman.

837
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,260
I…

838
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,620
I like you.

839
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,420
I also have feelings for the Ji Shu in the novel.

840
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,370
I don't want to be a despicable cheater.

841
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,420
So,

842
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,060
you like him?

843
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,590
What do you like about him?

844
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,500
He's handsome.

845
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:10,900
Me too.

846
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,820
He gave me a home

847
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,340
when I was the most helpless.

848
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,000
Song Yanqi.

849
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,620
He is me.

850
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,020
Yeah.

851
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,620
So many things happened,

852
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,580
but he is you.

853
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,340
This.

854
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,930
This is for you.

855
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,530
[Happiness]

856
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,140
For me?

857
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,700
My grandma left it to me.

858
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,740
It's a good luck charm.

859
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,000
It's supposed to keep me happy every day.

860
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,940
I hope you can be happy every day.

861
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,790
But a good luck charm

862
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,740
is supposed to keep you safe.

863
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,680
Then take it as a happiness charm.

864
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,910
Why did you give it to me?

865
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,660
Because

866
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,420
I don't want you to mope all day

867
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,540
at such a young age.

868
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,340
What should you do after getting old?

869
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,700
Cry all the time

870
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,120
and be a sad old man?

871
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,700
Ji Shu.

872
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,260
I know

873
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,590
that Ji Fei wouldn't blame you.

874
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,620
You gave her

875
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,420
the love of her parents

876
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,150

Don't be so hard on yourself.

879
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,080

You said that.

888
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,340
