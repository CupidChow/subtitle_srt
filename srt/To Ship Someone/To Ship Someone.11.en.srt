[Episode 11]

4
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,500
Ji Shu.

5
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,780
Here you are.

6
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,180
What's wrong?

7
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,220
I'm here to apologize.

8
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,420
You did it during the day.

9
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,780
But...

10
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,020
I know you didn't do it.

11
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,860
I don't even know if I did it.

12
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,980
How did you know?

13
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,540
If you were the one who had modified the novel,

14
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,620
it would've been the same from the beginning,

15
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,020
instead of being modified gradually.

16
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,820
Wait. What do you mean?

17
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,020
This is a pallet comparison Fu Xingxing made for me.

18
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,730
From the beginning,

19
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,579
the modified part took only a small portion.

20
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,140
Gradually, it became more and more.

21
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,420
That person was testing

22
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,460
or pretending that I was the one who plagiarized.

23
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,610
He was cautious at the beginning,

24
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,380
then he became bolder and bolder.

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,420
He obviously planned this for a long time and he was targeting you.

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,540
Could it be that I didn't change the novel because I traveled

27
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,579
but it was a coincidence?

28
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,900
Anyway,

29
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,030
this happened because of me.

30
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,980
I'll clarify it right away.

31
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,900
No need.

32
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,740
I'm also involved.

33
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,910
As the person involved,

34
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,860
I should clarify it.

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,540
Do not think that way.

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,380
Song Yanqi, remember.

37
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,740
Don't admit it if you didn't do it.

38
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,740
Otherwise,

39
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,150
you will regret it.

40
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,690
Ji Shu, I find that when you reject others,

41
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,400
you're not hesitant at all.

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,700
But it's a pity.

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,260
I was born to be clingy.

44
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,020
You can't get rid of me even if you want to.

45
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,740
Don't reject me so quickly.

46
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,420
Since this is my responsibility,

47
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,460
I'll take full responsibility.

48
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,579
How do you want to take responsibility?

49
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,140
Actually, I haven't decided.

50
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,730
What do you want to do?

51
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,860
I'll do my best to cooperate.

52
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,260
If you refuse, I'll take back my words.

53
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,700
Fu Xingxing will come to me tomorrow morning.

54
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,270
Then we'll discuss how to deal with it.

55
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,100
I'll be there in time.

56
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,579
Thank you.

57
00:03:59,420 --> 00:03:59,860
Okay.

58
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,700
Okay.

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,890
I see.

60
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,150
I think

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,899
I have to admit one thing first.

62
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,820
I'm the one who wrote the fan fiction.

63
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
-What?
-It's you?

64
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,060
Well, Ji.

65
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,140
So you knew it, right?

66
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,750
Then why did you look for the hacker?

67
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,420
Wait, what hacker?

68
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
The hacker who hacked into his computer

69
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,420
and changed his novel.

70
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,740
If it were you,

71
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,940
isn't that clear?

72
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,860
No wonder Shan Hang said

73
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,300
the IP address is near his house.

74
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,940
Don't you two live just across the street from each other?

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,500
What IP address?

76
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,820
So, the person who hacked into his computer

77
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,610
has an IP address that is near my house.

78
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,700
It's not you?

79
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,060
Then why is the content of your fan fiction

80
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,700
in his novel?

81
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,380
It's a coincidence.

82
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,620
That's easy now.

83
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,500
A world crisis has become

84
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,940
a domestic conflict.

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,410
Couples usually start with a quarrel, end in harmony.

86
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,060
How is that related?

87
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,020
This is just an internal misunderstanding.

88
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,500
I don't care if it's an internal misunderstanding or a domestic conflict.

89
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,700
Are you sure it wasn't Qi?

90
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,020
-I think...
-Not her.

91
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,020
Really?

92
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,140
I think

93
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,740
her IQ is similar to yours.

94
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,380
How could she hack Ji's computer?

95
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,820
Lu Qiyu.

96
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,140
You can insult her,

97
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,050
but not me.

98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,060
Your tacit understanding

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,610
is amazing.

100
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,380
Let's get down to business.

101
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,420
The boss called me just now

102
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,580
and asked Ji Shu to stay away from trouble for a while.

103
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,580
Okay, I agree.

104
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,740
No way.

105
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,370
If you stop updating,

106
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,500
isn't it to acknowledge it?

107
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,700
You didn't plagiarize.

108
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,250
You just need to clarify it.

109
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,180
Yes, Ji.

110
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,740
Let's make a clarification.

111
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,300
Qi. Come with me.

112
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,180
I want to talk to you.

113
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,370
Qi.

114
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,620
If you're not the fan fiction author,

115
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,820
I would ask him to clarify it immediately.

116
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,500
But this person is you.

117
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,260
I don't want you to get involved.

118
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,260
Why?

119
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Do you know

120
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,180
what the netizens will think

121
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,580
if you step out to clarify it?

122
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,380
If they believe Ji Shu,

123
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
they would say

124
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,620
you made all this up to be famous.

125
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,260
All cyber violence will point at you.

126
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,940
Xingxing, this is all because of me.

127
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,420
Whether there are hackers or not,

128
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,860
it started with me.

129
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,070
I cannot stand by and remain silent

130
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,060
while he is unjustly accused.

131
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,260
But you'll lose your peaceful life.

132
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,180
At least,

133
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,580
you won't be able to surf the Internet for a long time.

134
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,060
It's just disconnection.

135
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,060
Just think of it as quitting Internet addiction.

136
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,700
I hope you can think it over.

137
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:06,860
Xingxing.

138
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,580
If everyone in the world

139
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,580
weighs the pros and cons before doing something,

140
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,500
that's too cold.

141
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,060
You know I'm not that kind of person.

142
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,500
Let's go.

143
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,740
Should I write the statement myself

144
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,380
or your company will prepare one for me?

145
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,380
Mr. Ji.

146
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,500
I'll make a statement to clarify this.

147
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,180
And I won't write fan fiction again.

148
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,940
After this,

149
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,620
Mr. Ji,

150
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,740
please continue to cooperate with our company.

151
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,700
Song Yanqi.

152
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,810
I allow you to come here,

153
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,380
but it doesn't mean I allow you to interfere.

154
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,940
I don't want

155
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,700
to get her involved.

156
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,500
If the solution is for me

157
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,830
to admit plagiarism,

158
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,020
I will admit it.

159
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,300
Anyway, before this happened,

160
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,740
I already planned to stop writing.

161
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,740
Stop writing?

162
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,820
Why?

163
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,940
Is it because of my fan fiction?

164
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,620
I won't write it anymore.

165
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,380
It's none of your business.

166
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,020
Mr. Ji.

167
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,740
Mr. Ji.

168
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,020
I'm your loyal fan.

169
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,060
I can feel the power from your writing.

170
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,170
I also hope I can yearn for life

171
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,420
and love,

172
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,380
instead of just admitting to fate.

173
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,370
Song Yanqi, remember.

174
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,940
Don't admit it if you didn't do it.

175
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,260
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

176
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,340
Ji Shu.

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,860
Ji Shu.

178
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,020
If it had nothing to do with me,

179
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,660
why would you stop writing?

180
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,860
After all,

181
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,030
you're just timid.

182
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,780
You're afraid no one will believe you.

183
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,660
But if you don't tell the truth,

184
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
how will others believe you?

185
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
How can you convince them to believe you?

186
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,340
Will anyone believe me if I tell them the truth?

187
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,460
Most people would believe

188
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,260
what they want to believe,

189
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,100

don't mention it again.

372
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,020
Ji Shu.

373
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,540
I've never let it go.

374
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,460
I know

375
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,060
it was my fault.

376
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,980
I apologize to you.

377
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,300
What kind of a person is she?

378
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
She pretended to be innocent in front of him while speaking ill behind his back.

379
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,020
Ji Shu.

380
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,260
Don't let me down.

381
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Let bygones be bygones.

382
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,540
What about Song Yanqi?

383
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,260
I think you have a special relationship with her.

384
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,540
Before this,

385
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,740
did you plan to sign the copyright contract with her?

386
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,460
I...

387
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,500
We're just in touch at work.

388
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,020
You hesitated.

389
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,460
But do you know

390
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,340
she gave up immediately

391
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,740
as soon as you've been exposed for plagiarism?

392
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,780
See?

393
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,340
Everyone is realistic.

394
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,300
Lin Qingmiao.

395
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,940
When did you become like this?

396
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,980
When did you start to talk behind someone's back?

397
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,340
Listen.

398
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,220
She didn't give up.

399
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,220
I changed my mind and rejected her.

400
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,060
All right.

401
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,260
I'll go in if there's nothing else.

402
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,900
Don't worry.

403
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,180
He should be here soon.

404
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,660
Look at what I just said.

405
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,940
You're here.

406
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,980
Come on in.

407
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,030
I'm helping Ji with his research.

408
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,180
Why did you call me here so late?

409
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,820
Sit down.

410
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,660
Lu.

411
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,220
Lin Qingmiao told me

412
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,940
Ji Shu was involved in a plagiarism case back in college.

413
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,580
How do you know Lin Qingmiao?

414
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
We're colleagues.

415
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,820
They're destined to meet.

416
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,100
Because of her,

417
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,980
Ji lost his

418
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,780
all his designs, thesis manuscript and backup.

419
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,180
Later, he was accused for having plagiarized

420
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,980
and couldn't prove himself.

421
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,940
He dropped out.

422
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,180
Dropped out? That serious?

423
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,460
I still remember what happened back then.

424
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,740
Qi. You don't remember?

425
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,260
You were called away by the counselor.

426
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,500
I think it was because of this.

427
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,500
I was also involved?

428
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,060
Yes.

429
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,460
So, I was really involved?

430
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,720
You don't remember?

431
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,100
I thought you already told Ji Shu

432
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,820
after you met Ji Shu.

433
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,770
I don't remember anything.

434
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,100
What's going on?

435
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,020
Isn't Lin Qingmiao his ex-girlfriend?

436
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,100
Why did she do that?

437
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,260
It's a long story.

438
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,260
Lin Qingmiao was Ji's girlfriend in college.

439
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,740
We three went to high school together.

440
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,020
She always liked Ji.

441
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,020
She chased him for a long time before they got together.

442
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,820
But Ji was isolated.

443
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,740
He didn't think too much.

444
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,740
He didn't know that Shan Hang also liked Lin Qingmiao.

445
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,660
He agreed to be Lin Qingmiao's boyfriend.

446
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,260
They got along in a normal way.

447
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,810
But Lin Qingmiao couldn't stand it.

448
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,020
She felt insecure at that time.

449
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,420
Once neglected,

450
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,060
she would try her best to increase her presence.

451
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,300
You should focus on studies.

452
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm bored.

453
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,500
People say the library is a sacred place for dating.

454
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,020
I don't think so.

455
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,980
It's a sacred place for nerd like you.

456
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,420
If you're bored,

457
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,780
ask your roommates to go out with you

458
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,020
or go watch a movie.

459
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,300
Aren't you going to accompany me?

460
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,420
Everyone else's boyfriend would accompany them.

461
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,340
I'm not going with you.

462
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,300
I have to make designs.

463
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,300
You're always like this. You do design every day.

464
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,500
Aren't you tired of being with me every day?

465
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,500
Why don't you find someone else

466
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,020
to do something new with you?

467
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,180
Isn't it more fun?

468
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,780
Okay, I'll do as you say.

469
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,260
Ji Shu thought she took it.

470
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,100
But Lin Qingmiao didn't answer her phone or show up.

471
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,580
What she didn't know

472
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,680
was that Ji had a thesis and design to do at that time.

473
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
It was about whether Ji could get the spot for postgraduate recommendation.

474
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,780
He stayed in the library every day

475
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,100
to finish the design as soon as possible.

476
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,820
He wanted to find a time

477
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,020
to explain to Lin Qingmiao.

478
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,820
But she acted capriciously.

479
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,180
She found that Shan Hang liked her.

480
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,540
Qingmiao.

481
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,340
So she used Shan Hang to make Ji jealous.

482
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,500
I brought you buns today.

483
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,340
Thank you.

484
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,940
What filling?

485
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,540
Your favorite meat, beef.

486
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,180
How do you know I like beef?

487
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,200
But Ji

488
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,260
didn't realize her intention.

489
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
During that time,

490
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,740
Ji was busy looking for the design he lost.

491
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,660
But he couldn't find it.

492
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,730
So he rushed another one.

493
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,980
After that,

494
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,740
he realized that he neglected Lin Qingmiao.

495
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,300
He wanted to apologize to her,

496
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,740
but it's only been two days

497
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,980
before Ji was accused for plagiarism.

498
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,060
It would've been okay if the thesis hadn't been published.

499
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,500
But it had already been published.

500
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,260
Another highly similar thesis

501
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,940
was published a week ago.

502
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,740
It was done by a professor in our major

503
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,020
and his students.

504
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,900
One of the students

505
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,540
is Lin Qingmiao?

506
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,260
No.

507
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,500
It's Shan Hang.

508
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,460
He said he had already started long before

509
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,180
and had the full process recorded.

510
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,940
But that USB flash drive

511
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,700
is exactly the same as the one Ji lost.

512
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,180
But he insisted that it was his.

513
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,260
He also said

514
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,500
he had a witness.

515
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,500
Was I the witness?

516
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,180
Wait, let me think.

517
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,260
Excuse me.

518
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,660
Have you found a USB flash drive

519
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,820
and a stack of draft paper?

520
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,060
What color is the USB flash drive?

521
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,580
It's silver.

522
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,100
This one?

523
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,500
Yes, that's it.

524
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,340
And this stack of draft paper.

525
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,660
There are different dates on it.

526
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,260
I thought it's not rubbish.

527
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,660
It's will be troublesome if they were important design draft

528
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,270
and went missing.

529
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,020
Thank you.

530
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,100
This is really important to me.

531
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,900
Just keep it.

532
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,940
Which department are you from?

533
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,940
I'll treat you to dinner later.

534
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,540
Song Yanqi, a Chinese major.

535
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,460
You don't need to treat me.

536
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,700
Thank you.

537
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,240
You're welcome.

538
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,050
Bye.

539
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,980
Sir, are you looking for me?

540
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,700
Come in.

541
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,900
Here's the thing.

542
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,490
Are you familiar with these?

543
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,260
I found something similar in the library.

544
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,580
Do you remember who was looking for them?

545
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,340
Who?

546
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,540
Who?

547
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:44,980
I remember it was him.

548
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,580
Have you read the contents in the USB flash drive?

549
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,220
No.

550
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,260
It's fine. You may leave.

551
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,540
I'm leaving.

552
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:52,940
Okay.

553
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,820
You both said that

554
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,020
you've lost these in the library.

555
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,060
The person who found them has been found.

556
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,460
Do you have anything else to say?

557
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,220
Sir,

558
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,900
you can open the USB flash drive

559
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,020
and check the date.

560
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,460
I marked the date

561
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,900
for each paper.

562
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,340
And it's encrypted.

563
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm the only one who's able to modify the date and content.

564
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,900
The earliest date should be

565
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,740
November 7, 2017.

566
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,060
Shan Hang, do you remember the date?

567
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,460
October 15, 2017.

568
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,760
[Open the USB flash drive]

569
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,620
[Preliminary draft 2017. 10. 15]

570
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,740
Come and see for yourself.

571
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,930
[Preliminary draft 2017. 10. 15]

572
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,780
No way.

573
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Enter the password and make modifications.

574
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,300
See if it will work.

575
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,360
[Wrong password]

576
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,420
How could this happen?

577
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,980
[Wrong password]

578
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,980
[Wrong password]

579
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,740
What else do you have to say?

580
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,460
Ji Shu.

581
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,260
You know I always value you.

582
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,660
But this is too bad.

583
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,260
The school will punish you.

584
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,460
You won't get the spot

585
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,260
for postgraduate recommendation.

586
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,740
As to your academic status,

587
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,420
I'll try to plead with the department.

588
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,100
You're a senior now.

589
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,100
You're going to graduate soon.

590
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,420
Sir, it's okay.

591
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,980
I'll drop out.

592
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,660
I didn't know

593
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,580
what the counselor asked me to testify for.

594
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,940
It's not your fault.

595
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,060
After thinking about it,

596
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,060
we thought something was wrong.

597
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,010
Ji is not a forgetful person.

598
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,780
Only Lin Qingmiao,

599
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,700
and Shan Hang who lived in the same dorm with us can take away the USB flash drive.

600
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,730
Later I asked her.

601
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,740
She said she just wanted Ji to pay more attention to her.

602
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,820
She didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

603
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,660
Then why didn't she testify?

604
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,740
Her? Testify?

605
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,680
They broke up

606
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,980
two or three days before this happened.

607
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,700
Lin Qingmiao

608
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,300
was found cheating with Shan Hang.

609
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,580
She said the thing was long gone.

610
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,100
But coincidentally,

611
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,780
Shan Hang had a same one.

612
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,300
Well.

613
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
You didn't do a handwriting test on the draft?

614
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,790
We did.

615
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,340
But they have solid evidence

616
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,740
and got two professors involved.

617
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,340
In the end, the school thought it was too bad.

618
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,260
Ji didn't want to implicate others.

619
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,500
He took the responsibility

620
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:49,920
and quit.

621
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,740
What's wrong?

622
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,020
Bro.

623
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,220
Why didn't you answer my call?

624
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,430
My phone died.

625
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,740
I came here as soon as I heard you dropped out.

626
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,020
What happened?

627
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,580
I asked Shan Hang, but he didn't tell me.

628
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm fine now.

629
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,740
What do you mean?

630
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,100
You were scolded so badly on the forum.

631
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,060
You call that fine?

632
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,900
You dropped out of school. You call that fine?

633
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Yu, I have nothing to say this time.

634
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,740
I can't accept it.

635
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,020
I have no choice.

636
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,700
Ji.

637
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,010
For everyone,

638
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,740
this is the best result.

639
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,460
How come it's the best result?

640
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
Your thesis, your design...

641
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,460
I watched you stay up all night to make them.

642
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,740
When did Shan Hang make these?

643
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,300
Ji,

644
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,540
you didn't plagiarize.

645
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,220
Why should you be punished?

646
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,500
Yu.

647
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,540
I'm tired.

648
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,900
I want to be alone now.

649
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,810
Go back early.

650
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,580
No.

651
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,500
It was so serious. So...

652
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,960
If I didn't testify,

653
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,020
it wouln't have been that serious.

654
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,580
Qi, don't think too much.

655
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,740
You ddin't know what happened.

656
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,700
So even if he clarifies this time,

657
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,100
for him...

658
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,780
It'll be like a nightmare reappearing.

659
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,660
Ji was so popular at school.

660
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,920
After this incident,

661
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,770
many people talked about him behind his back

662
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,500
and many looked down on him.

663
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,340
Song Yanqi, remember.

664
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,740
Don't admit it if you didn't do it.

665
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

666
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,100
So he said that

667
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,780
because he was hurt by those comments.

668
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,500
Qi, what're you talking about?

669
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,660
People tend to follow the crowd.

670
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,260
So the clarification statement

671
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,740
won't work at all.

672
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,660
Maybe.

673
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,420
The online comments are quite harsh.

674
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,100
And now even you are scolded.

675
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,740
This is why Ji Shu and I

676
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,020
wanted you to stay out of it.

677
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,460
I became one of the accomplices.

678
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,700
I don't want to repeat the same mistake now.

679
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,780
What do you want to do?

680
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,980
Those who retwitted and made comments maliciously

681
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,500
should know that the Internet is not a lawless place.

682
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,780
They should be responsible for their actions.

683
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,020
Calm down.

684
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,020
Xingxing, help me think of ideas.

685
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,260
How can I help him?

686
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,940
He's an adult.

687
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,960
He should be able to get over it.

688
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,220
Besides

689
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,940
the clues we can collect,

690
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,420
there is no substantial evidence.

691
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,050
He can only count on time.

692
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,730
He won't be able to get over it.

693
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,580
This is Ji's scar.

694
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,980
He has been wandering around

695
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
between gain and loss.

696
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,250
He doesn't seem to care about it,

697
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,180
but I know.

698
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,100
I know he cares about being abandoned.

699
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,340
That's why he thinks

700
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,700
there is no comedy in life.

701
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,460
Although he looks cold,

702
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,510
he really cares about what others think.

703
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
He went to see a psychiatrist

704
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,180
and kept it from me.

705
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,260
Okay, I pretended I didn't know.

706
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,900
He was not interested in novels at all.

707
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,180
One day,

708
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,820
he started writing novels.

709
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,420
I knew something was wrong.

710
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,220
Later, I vaguely knew

711
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,580
it was the psychologist

712
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,020
who made him heal and change himself in a way of writing novels.

713
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,460
However,

714
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,300
the medicine to save him became poison to harm him.

715
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,260
It's all my fault.

716
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,580
Qi.

717
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,820
Don't take everything on yourself.

718
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,000
It's been twice now. Both times it was because of me.

719
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,980
He loves to challenge himself.

720
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,220
He won't get over this.

721
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,500
He...

722
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,540
Xingxing, what should I do?

723
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,740
I don't want anything to happen to him.

724
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,750
Let's figure out a solution.

725
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,140
[Ji Shu
What happened back then]

726
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,370
[Are you okay?]

727
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,140
Hello, Shu.

728
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,060
What is it?

729
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,820
Nothing.

730
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,940
I just want to know

731
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,300
how you've been.

732
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,900
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

733
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
I don't need your concern.

734
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,440
Hello, Yiyang.

735
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,980
I need your help with something.

736
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,980
Sure.

737
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,340
Here's the thing.

738
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,660
It's...

739
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,020
It's natural for me to care about my son.

740
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
You little brat!

741
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,050
Did you drink?

742
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
Just a little.

743
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,420
All these years,

744
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,340
you still can't quit.

745
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,940
Since you're drunk,

746
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,180
go to bed early.

747
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,100
I'm gonna hang up.

748
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,300
Okay.

749
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,230
Thank you, Yiyang.

750
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,420
Just send it to me.

751
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,420
Thank you.

752
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,420
Miss.

753
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,540
Why are you walking around here?

754
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,380
You makes my dizzy.

755
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,900
Nothing. I'm just worried about my friend.

756
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,500
Then go upstairs.

757
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,460
Are you afraid he'll take it too hard?

758
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,860
I don't think so.

759
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,020
As an adult,

760
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,620
no matter what happened,

761
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,940
he'll get over it after a night.

762
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,180
If you're really worried,

763
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,500
just sit there and wait for a while.

764
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:19,820
Okay.

765
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,700
Shu.

766
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,060
I'm getting married.

767
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,740
Don't blame me.

768
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,540
What does it matter to you if I drink or not?

769
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,740
I didn't expect Ji Shu to plagiarize.

770
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,900
I even used to admire him.

771
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,420
The school will punish you.

772
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,660
You won't get the spot for postgraduate recommendation.

773
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,700
He plagiarized openly.

774
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,500
He should be blocked.

775
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,780
Morning, Mr. Ji.

776
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,130
Miss, wake up.

777
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,180
It's dawn.

778
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,180
Hello?

779
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,940
Did I wake you up?

780
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,500
No, I'm up.

781
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,660
I've drafted the lawyer statement

782
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,100
and sent it to you via WeChat.

783
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,900
Take a look.

784
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,300
Okay, thank you, Yiyang.

785
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,490
[Fu Xingxing]

786
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,580
Xingxing.

787
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,380
Ask your official website to post this online.

788
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:58,400
[Fu Xingxing]

789
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,400
Got it.

790
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,780
I've contacted some fans of Ji Shu.

791
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,180
They are willing to help.

792
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,460
Thank you for yesterday, Sir.

793
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,020
You're welcome.

794
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,660
It's dawn.

795
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,170
Are you still going up to see your friend?

796
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,620
Forget it.

797
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,300
Mr. Ji probably doesn't want to see me right now.

798
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,380
Ji?

799
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,940
Mr. Ji who lives in Room 301?

800
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,020
Yes.

801
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,940
He went out just now.

802
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,100
He went out?

803
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,700
Yes.

804
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,620
So early?

805
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,180
Thank you.

806
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,420
He's not in the park at this hour.

807
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,700
Is he running by the beach?

808
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,700
Ji Shu,

809
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,460
no matter how bad you feel,

810
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,580
you can't commit suicide.

811
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,540
I didn't.

812
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,500
I saw everything.

813
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,540
You kept walking into the sea.

814
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,540
I'm not as fragile as you think.

815
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,060
Let go.

816
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,820
What are you doing here?

817
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
I'm here to see you.

818
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,620
I want to tell you

819
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,170
there's nothing that can't be overcome.

820
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,500
Just send me a message.

821
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,690
You don't have to come.

822
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,620
You don't understand.

823
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
You have to say it in person when you want to comfort someone.

824
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,780
Then start comforting me.

825
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,180
At here?

826
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,300
Mr. Ji.

827
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,420
Everyone is like the rising sun.

828
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,340
There are ups and downs.

829
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,980
There's no need to forget the joy of rising

830
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,980
because of landing.

831
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,700
You must be the sun for yourself.

832
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,090
What do you think?

833
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,540
Were you reciting poems?

834
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,540
Since you can still tease me,

835
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
it proves that I did well.

836
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Would you say it's harder to be physically tired

837
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,570
or mentally tired?

838
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,060
Mr. Ji.

839
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,070
Although I'm known as a human-shaped chicken soup manufacturer,

840
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,590
I'm unable to answer your question.

841
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,320
Why?

842
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,790
The question is like

843
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,310
"Is it a serious physical illness or a serious mental illness?"

844
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,700
Both are serious.

845
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,580
Of course.

846
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,780
Do you want to try?

847
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,500
What?

848
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,540
There are so many here.

849
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,940
Look, this one can move.

850
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,500
Beachcombers.

851
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,060
When I heard this phrase

852
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,140
when I first came to the beach,

853
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,480
I thought it was very romantic.

854
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,380
Beachcomers,

855
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,650
commonly known as Tidal Flats Gatherers.

856
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,860
It refers those who can't afford fishing boats

857
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,300
and use conch to fix the fishing net

858
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,780
on the beach for fishing.

859
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,580
Under the romantic appearance,

860
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,540
it's usually a real life.

861
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,020
The place where I lived as a child had mountains and rivers,

862
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,340
but no sea.

863
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,690
So, when I was little, I really wanted

864
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,990
to see the sea.

865
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,900
In order to see it one day,

866
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,700
I've been learning to swim since I was a kid.

867
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,420
Sometimes I would lie on the window,

868
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,100
imagining the vast sea behind the mountain.

869
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,180
Behind the mountain

870
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,940
is also a mountain.

871
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,500
People should have expectations.

872
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,150
It's good to have expectations.

873
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,500
But the greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment.

874
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,500
No.

875
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,020
My grandma used to tell me

876
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,340
about the Little Mermaid.

877
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,580
At that time,

878
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,540
I was looking forward to seeing the sea.

879
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,100
But when I did,

880
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,540
it was not as good as I thought.

881
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,380
The sea was destroyed by humans

882
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,360
and lost its radiance.

883
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,580
The Little Mermaid is a sad story.

884
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,300
You like it?

885
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,500
I do.

886
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,540
Although I didn't understand

887
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,420
why the Little Mermaid

888
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,940
can't be with the prince.

889
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,220
After I grew up,

890
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,660
I realized what I wanted to change

891
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,900
is not the ending of the princess.

892
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,540
If I were her,

893
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,510
I wouldn't exchange my voice

894
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,020
for a chance to walk on land.

895
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,050
She passed the right to choose to others

896
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,900
and lost the ability to speak.

897
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,460
How silly.

898
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,660
What would you do

899
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,500
if it were you?
