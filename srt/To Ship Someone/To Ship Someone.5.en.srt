What are you planning to do?

191
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,060
What are you doing?

192
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,580
Oh no.

193
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,500
Not only did the plot not reset,

194
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,780
but it’s upgraded to hell mode.

195
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,900
Mr. Ji, I’m sorry.

196
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,340
I’m sick. I’m going to take medicine.

197
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,220
I don't know if I can reset the plot

198
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,820
if I jump down from here.

199
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,210
Why not?

200
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,020
Isn't it random?

201
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,130
There are rules.

202
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,460
What’s the similarity between the first and the second time?

203
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,410
Mr. Ji, I can explain.

204
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,100
Follow me.

205
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,100
Okay.

206
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,460
Pick up the water.

207
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,820
Splash it on me.

208
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,780
Mr. Ji, what did you say?

209
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,890
I said,

210
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,900
"Splash it on me."

211
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,490
Mr. Ji, I’m really sorry.

212
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,540
Pick it up.

213
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,260
Mr. Ji.

214
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,980
I’ll be steady whenever I hold something in the future.

215
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,370
I won't spill it on you.

216
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,980
I'm not angry.

217
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,300
I told you to splash water on me.

218
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,770
Mr. Ji, have you lost your mind

219
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,780
because of anger?

220
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,700
You're that angry because of me.

221
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,620
It's really not worth it.

222
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,420
I...

223
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,180
Here.

224
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,180
Splash it.

225
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,890
Mr. Ji, I'll splash it.

226
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,570
Mr. Ji, I'm sorry.

227
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,500
I know I was wrong.

228
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,100
I know I was wrong.

229
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,980
I'm really sorry.

230
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,060
Mr. Ji, I'm sorry.

231
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,420
Sorry.

232
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,260
Here, wipe it.

233
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,100
Mr. Ji, are you really not angry?

234
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,340
I'm not.

235
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,660
Go out and get another glass of water

236
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,770
and finish what you haven't done.

237
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,300
Mr. Ji, are you okay?

238
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,060
You…

239
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,340
Fine.

240
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,580
You may leave.

241
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,860
I was late talking to Yingjun

243
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,820
for a while.

244
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,500
It's okay.

245
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,460
-You... -I...

246
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,380
What's wrong?

247
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,460
Yu Le,

248
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,370
have you received a script?

249
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,620
It's called "The Track".

250
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,700
I got it.

251
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,660
I heard the producer is contacting you.

252
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,460
Seems like it's true.

253
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,180
I said no.

254
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,140
Why?

255
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,340
We shouldn't show up together now.

256
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,020
You've been affected by our relationship.

257
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,980
You can't take the risk now.

258
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,380
Maybe we can turn things around

259
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,580
with this drama.

260
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,660
Even if we can,

261
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,060
it will be a year after the drama is released.

262
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,100
No one knows what will happen in a year.

263
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,940
We can only focus on the present.

264
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,060
Just think of it as

265
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,850
me not wanting the audience to think that

266
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
I took advantage of you because of this drama.

267
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,620
Xining.

268
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,460
You don't have to care about others.

269
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,740
Trust me.

270
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,900
No matter what happens,

271
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,090
I can protect you.

272
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,180
If you don't accept,

273
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:54,980
I won't either.

274
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,010
Are you stupid?

275
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,860
The male lead of this show suits you well.

276
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,220
Didn't you experience life

277
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,100
for this role?

278
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,980
It's not worth giving up now.

279
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,100
But I can't watch you...

280
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,820
No buts.

281
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,650
You must seize this opportunity.

282
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,540
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,100
What?

284
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,220
Nothing.

285
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,220
By the way, Yan recommended a show to you.

286
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,180
Tell Mr. Zhen

287
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
to send you to the audition.

288
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,380
Thank Yan for me.

289
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,660
Yu Le.

290
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,260
Can I go to Director Qian's

291
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,620
wrap party?

292
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,620
Sure.

293
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,780
I'll pick you up then.

294
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,500
What do you want to do today?

295
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,100
I'll accompany you.

296
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,060
Let me think carefully about it.

297
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,619
Are there any important plot points today

298
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,260
that I forgot?

299
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,619
Mr. Ji.

300
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,060
I have something to tell you.

301
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,050
Go ahead.

302
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,339
Xining refused to play the female lead of "The Track".

303
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,619
"The Track"?

304
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,339
The script that can boost their relationship?

305
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,500
Their fans will recognize them when they're on a date today.

306
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,980
How can I miss such an important plot?

307
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,530
Otherwise, how can I be a top shipper?

308
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,660
Now Ji Shu is distracted by Zhen

309
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,580
I should go.

310
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,220
Maybe I can even see today's sweet story on time.

311
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,180
Mr. Ji?

312
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:50,810
It's okay.

313
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,740
I trust you.

314
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,180
You can handle these things well.

315
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,060
Mr. Ji,

316
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,820
I didn’t expect you to trust me so much.

317
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,340
I won't let you down.

318
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,620
I will bring our artists

319
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,460
to a better tomorrow.

320
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,290
-Okay. -I...

321
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,780
Okay.

322
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,580
Where is Qi?

323
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,700
I don't know.

324
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,380
Maybe...

325
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,140
-the pantry. -the bathroom.

326
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,220
I'm glad I sneaked out.

327
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,100
Xi-Le couple. I'm coming.

328
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,020
Taxi.

329
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:59,600
[Taxi]

330
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,460
Yu Le and Xining will sit there later.

331
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,140
I need to find a perfect spot.

332
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,580
Excuse me.

333
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,940
Hello, what would you like?

334
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:28,820
No need.

335
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,420
Please serve your sweetest dessert

336
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,020
and drink.

337
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,500
Thank you.

338
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,500
Okay, please wait a moment.

339
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,380
What a coincidence.

340
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,340
What do you mean?

341
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,260
Mr. Ji.

342
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,460
Why are you here?

343
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,820
Then why are you here?

344
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,780
I'm here...

345
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,220
Of course I'm here for afternoon tea.

346
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,220
You left your spot during working hours.

347
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,340
Let me think.

348
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,980
Mr. Ji,

349
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,700
I'm in a bad mood.

350
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,100
I came out for something sweet.

351
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,020
Don't you care about your employees' mental state?

352
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,940
Hurry up and eat.

353
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,980
Then go back to work.

354
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,620
Mr. Ji,

355
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,220
you've never been here before, right?

356
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,140
Let me recommend some to you.

357
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,730
Waiter,

358
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,500
I would like to order another set of those.

359
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:30,940
Thank you.

360
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,940
Okay, just a moment.

361
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,740
Can I have another glass of water?

362
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,560
Okay.

363
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,860
Mr. Ji.

364
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,460
Try it.

365
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,860
You eat first.

366
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,940
I...

367
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,300
Don't be upset.

368
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,220
This is a great opportunity.

369
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,020
And the character of the female lead

370
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,940
is not that outstanding.

371
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,340
Fine.

372
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,980
Since you said so,

373
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,420
I have no choice.

374
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,420
The benefit of a couple shipper.

375
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,740
The damn author finally has a conscience.

376
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,980
He let them be sweet after such a long time.

377
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,220
Your water.

378
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,570
So sweet.

379
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,500
Hold hands.

380
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,340
Holding hands and feeding each other cake.

381
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,020
This is too sweet.

382
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,020
No, my blood sugar is rising.

383
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,140
What are you shooting?

384
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,860
I, I'm taking a selfie.

385
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,690
Mr. Ji, what are you doing?

386
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,860
There’s cream on your nose.

387
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,460
Mr. Ji, why do you only drink water?

388
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,380
You're not eating?

389
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,460
I don't like sweet food.

390
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,300
If you don't like sweet food,

391
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,220
why are you here?

392
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,860
Are you here to catch me?

393
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,940
Is your position so idle?

394
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,300
How can you have time to catch a runaway employee?

395
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,620
Others can do whatever they want, but you can't.

396
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,170
You...

397
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,580
Yu Le's fans will appear soon.

398
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,900
If I don't help them,

399
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,500
the dating plot I've been waiting for

400
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,380
will be gone.

401
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,580
Look, is that Yu Le?

402
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,020
Yes, he looks similar.

403
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,740
That's Ye Xining next to him.

404
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,380
Let's go and take a look.

405
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,740
Let's go.

406
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,780
Excuse me.

407
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,100
Excuse me.

408
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,010
Mr. Ji, what are you doing?

409
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,460
You’re in their way.

410
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,500
Yu Le!

411
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,820
Yu Le in person.

412
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,660
So handsome.

413
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,700
Where?

414
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,820
He's really there, let’s go and have a look.

415
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,500
Yu Le!

416
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,540
Let’s go have a look.

417
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,180
The real Yu Le!

418
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,060
In person!

419
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,380
It's the first time I've seen him in person.

420
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,780
Hurry up. Let's go.

421
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,620
Yu Le!

422
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,220
Yu Le! Wait for me! Yu Le!

423
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,460
Yu Le!

424
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,380
Didn’t you see him?

425
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,280
Superstar Yu Le.

426
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,100
Where are you, Yu Le?

427
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,500
-Let go. -Over there.

428
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,060
Where is he?

429
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,940
Over there. Do you see him?

430
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,300
Where? He's not there.

431
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,610
Ask him. He saw Yu Le.

432
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,340
He saw him just now.

433
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,660
Where? Where?

434
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,620
I don't know.

435
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,100
-Yu Le. -I really don’t know.

436
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,940
Where is Yu Le? Yu Le.

437
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,020

and got rid of the second male lead.

439
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,140
What do you want to eat?

440
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,900
I want egg waffle.

441
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,780
Boss, an egg waffle.

442
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,260
Okay.

443
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,380
I need to take this call.

444
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:06,860
Okay.

445
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,460
Hey, Yingjun.

446
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,620
Yes?

447
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,660
Really?

448
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,220
Okay.

449
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,180
I'll prepare for it.

450
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,980
Why are you so happy?

451
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,140
Director Qian told me to go for an audition.

452
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,140
Really?

453
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,140
That's great.

454
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,300
You must get the role.

455
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,380
Okay.

456
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,980
Hello, it's done.

457
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,460
Thank you, boss.

458
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

[Grilled Squid]

460
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,380
Mr. Ji,

461
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
did you install a GPS

462
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,180
on me?

463
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,940
Why are you following me wherever I go?

464
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,060
What a coincidence.

465
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,260
Why are you here again?

466
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,860
Mr. Ji,

467
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,900
are you walking on the streets alone?

468
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,460
Why?

469
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,300
Can't I go on a stroll myself?

470
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,740
Aren't you also alone?

471
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,980
Who said that...

472
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,290
Fine, walking alone is not a problem.

473
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,660
I suddenly remembered that I have some work to do.

474
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,860
Mr. Ji, take your time.

475
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,780
I'm leaving.

476
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,580
I suddenly remembered that I have work to do too.

Pork belly or crayfish?

479
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,900
I thought you were going back?

480
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,900
This is the company?

481
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,780
Mr. Ji,

482
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,570
I think you have a unique skill called haunting.

483
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,860
I don't think so.

484
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,460
Mr. Ji.

485
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,260
Why are you following me?

486
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,770
Why do I have to follow you?

487
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,460
Am I bored?

488
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,580
I told you it was a coincidence.

489
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,900
The view is nice.

490
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,940
I don't believe you.

491
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Then tell me,

492
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,500
why am I following you?

493
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,180
You covet my beauty.

494
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,100
You sure?

495
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,500
Am I not?

496
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,740
Or are you moved by my crush on you?

497
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,260
You miss me when you can't see me.

498
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,620
So you can't control yourself

499
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,620
and want to follow me?

500
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,900
What are you thinking?

501
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,900
Are you shameless?

502
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,620
Right?

503
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,700
I don't think so.

504
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,340
Was it really a coincidence?

505
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,060
It was.

506
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
That place seems good.

507
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,020
I can't drink anymore.

508
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,330
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

509
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,780
Other people may be generous

510
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,620
but I thought that you

511
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,940
could even forgive the entire universe.

512
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,980
Mr. Ji, how about this?

513
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,540
I’ll give you three minutes to laugh at me.

514
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,380
After three minutes,

515
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,100
forgive me for skipping work.

516
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,540
Deal?

517
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,940
Mr. Ji, you're a big boss.

518
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,500
You're a generous person.

519
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,900
Please forgive me.

520
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,180
Don't do it again.

521
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,260
Okay.

522
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,820
Hello?

523
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,060
Mr. Ji.

524
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:03,980
as you said,

525
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,860
I've contacted the producer of "The Track".

526
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,060
I think this role

527
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,610
suits Ziheng better than Director Wang's movie.

528
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,020
Ziheng will go for an audition tomorrow.

529
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,580
You can make the arrangements for work.

530
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,500
Let's go.

531
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,860
Back to the company.

532
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,420
Okay, boss.

533
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,140
Seatbelt.

534
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,810
What seat belt?

535
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,090
What's wrong?

536
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,140
How do I adjust the seat?

537
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,380
On the right.

538
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,500
Okay.

539
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,090
Mr. Ji, stop by the road.

540
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,820
I have something to do.

541
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
You should go back first.

542
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,980
Over there.

543
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,140
I entered this story twice and both times I appeared at this bus stop.

544
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,260
It shouldn't be a coincidence.

545
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,300

00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,380
But my location is right.

549
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,260
I was sitting here when I came here.

550
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,740
Is the posture wrong?

551

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
What are you doing?

553

555
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,900
I came down to get some fresh air.

It's really hot today.

557
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,940
Excuse me.

558
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,140

Wait.

00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,460

00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,580
It won't end well if you really bang into the wall.

563
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,860
No.

564
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,940
I just want to see if the billboard is tough.

565
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,300

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,100
Let's go.

568
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,820
If I don't go back,

569
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,740
I don't know

570
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,500
what will happen next.

571
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,460
Who knows what

572
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,460
dramatic story

573
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,980
that damn author will write.

574
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,260
Are you getting in?

575
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,100
If you don't, walk back by yourself.

576
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,420
I'll go.

577
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,780
The audition is the only thing left.

578
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,530
I don't know what the audition result is.

579
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,780
According to the damn author's habit,

580
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,530
something big will happen.

581
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,020
If I can't go back now,

582
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,820
I must be prepared.

583
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,250
I have to find a way to stay with Xining.

584
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,330
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

585
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,900
If I can't go back now,

586
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,140
I have to keep an eye on Song Yanqi

587
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,940
to stop her from modifying the plot.

588
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,060
Mr. Ji.

589
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,940
Is it hard for you to drive for so long?

590
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,300
Why don't you let me drive?

591
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,660
How can an employee

592
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,940
let their boss drive a car, right?

593
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,980
You?

594
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,500
I want to live longer.

595
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,260
My driving skills are that bad?

596
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,220
Impossible.

597
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,020
Last time I drove you safely

598
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,940
back to the company.

599
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Trust me.

600
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,020
I don't believe you.

601
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,780
Fine.

602
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,660
Are you thirsty? Are you tired?

603
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,340
You've been driving for so long.

604
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,260
Why don't we take a break?

605
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,180
What are you going to do?

606
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,700
I just care about how hard you drive.

607
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,860
You're being nice to me for no reason.

608
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,820
Are you going to Ye Xining?

609
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,180
Impossible.

610
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,020
Mr. Ji,

611
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,420
I find that when you reject people,

612
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,100
you seem like the damn author.

613
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,100
Damn author?

614
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,660
I'm not talking about you,

615
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,060
but someone else.

616
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
How can I call you damn?

617
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
You're a thousand times better than him.

618
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,940
Then tell me

619
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,020
why am I better than him?

620
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,500
You're...

621
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,380
For your own good,

622
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,500
you'd better let go of me right now.

623
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,340
Or else don't think about promotion or increasing salary.

624
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,690
I'll make you leave immediately.

625
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,620
You're domineering.

626
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,700
Are you Other Flower?

627
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
It doesn't matter.

628
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,900
As long as it's not Xining.

629
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,179
It's none of your business whether I like her or not.

630
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,980
I'll pretend I never heard that.

631
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,300
And...

632
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,620
You have a conscience and a bottom line.

633
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,500
So that means I have no conscience and no bottom line?

634
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,250
No.

635
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:25,980
Mr. Ji,

636
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,100
I mean you have a conscience and a bottom line.

637
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,219
That damn author is the heartless one.

638
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:30,940
I...

639
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,699
What did he do to you?

640
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,210
What did he...

641
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,580
Because of him, I might not be able to become a regular employee

642
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,300
and lose my job.

643
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,699
He even refused the money.

644
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,179
No, he's worse than being a damn author.

645
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,980
Even animals don't refuse food given to them.

646
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:53,580
Okay.

647
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,100
What will you do

648
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,460
when you meet him again?

649
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,380
I... I'll eat and eat without spitting out bones.

650
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Dogs don't spit bones.

651
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,380
Mr. Ji,

652
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,820
I was talking about that guy.

653
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,300
And you're definitely not like him, right?

654
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,690
You agreed.

655
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,100
You won't get involved in others' relationship.

656
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,660
You'll keep your promise, right?

657
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,020
When did I say that?

658
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,250
Why don't I remember?

659
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,740
Mr. Ji, you can't go back on your word.

660
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,180
Who can tell me.

661
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,300
Are men also

662
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,820
emotionally unstable once every month?

663
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,420
Every time you come back,

664
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,540
you seem different.

665
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,340
Right?

666
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,860
What's wrong?

667
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,620
I experienced it.

668
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,020
Men has their own type of period.

669
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,460
Did you offend Mr. Ji again?

670
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,380
I praised him all the way.

671
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,740
My mouth is worn out.

672
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,900
Yet he looks like he's in pain.

673
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,260
I...

674
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,020
Your metaphor...

675
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,540
I don't know what is going on in the real world.

676
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,100
If I can't go back for a while,

677
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,460
shouldn't I communicate with Song Yanqi?

678
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,900
What would you do

679
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,140
if you meet him again?

680
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,460
I... I'll eat and eat without spitting out bones.

681
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,660
Forget it.

682
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,620
I think about it later.

683
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,580
Mr. Ji.

684
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,340
The interview time for Ziheng and Xining overlaps.

685
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,940
I'm worried if she goes alone.

686
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,660
So do you want to find another colleague

687
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,380
to go with her?

688
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,420
Mr. Ji,

689
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,820
I think I can do this job.

690
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,580
Yes, Qi can go.

691
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,420
No.

692
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,300
Why?

693
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,610
You go ahead.

694
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
You can't even be a CEO's assistant.

695
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,020
Do you think you can do this?

696
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,140
Mr. Ji, I think you’re being unreasonable.

697
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,300
Is it the same as an assistant of an artist?

698
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,210
They're both assistants.

699
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,050
Right?

700
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,890
Yes.

701
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,300
You're the boss. You're right.

702
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,900
You can go if you want.

703
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,820
You mean

704
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,660
if I can be a good assistant to you,

705
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,820
I can go?

706
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,660
Do you have any work plans?

707
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,660
No.

708
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,490
How can you go there in person?

709
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,220
Let me.

710
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,900
Mr. Ji, look.

711
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,820
Hot water, tea and all kinds of tea drinks.

712
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,980
Which one do you want?

713
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,740
What else?

714
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,660
Why are you reading it yourself?

715
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,660
Let me help you.

716
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,980
You want to see?

717
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,260
Okay.

718
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,660
Take it.

719
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,260
Everyone, give her all of your unfinished scripts.

720
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,640
Before you get off work,

721
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,540
finish reading it and make an overall evaluation report.

722
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,460
Mr. Ji,

723
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,490
we have several scripts each.

724
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,540
All of them?

725
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,260
Of course.

726
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,420
Mr. Ji, you…

727
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,580
I'll think about it after reading your report.

728
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,010
Are you looking for an all-round girlfriend

729
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,460
or a stand-in assistant?

730
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,900
You can choose not to do it.

731
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Fine, I can.

732
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,140
You said it.

733
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,820
Come on, everyone.

734
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,580
Come on.

735
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,420
Please.

736
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,220
What a poor thing.

737
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,260
I'll give you the evaluation report

738
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,740
before I get off work.

739
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,500
Okay.

740
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,700
I'll wait.

741
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,540
I feel like I'm in a rat race.

742
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,980
The script evaluation.

743
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,020
So fast?

744
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,340
Of course. I've read novels since I was a kid.

745
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,420
I don't have the ability to scan over other texts,

746
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,860
but I'm more than able to read the script.

747
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,580
Misspelling.

748
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,050
I didn't have much time.

749
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,540
I won't do it again.

750
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,180
Next time?
