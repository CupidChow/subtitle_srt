[To Ship Someone]

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,000
[Episode 16]

4
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,539
I said

5
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,120
I'm not Ji Shu from this world.

6
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm just like you.

7
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm Ji Shu from the real world.

8
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,259
You...

9
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,400
Are you really the damn...

10
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,340
Mr. Ji?

11
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,180
Yes.

12
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,080
How do you prove it?

13
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,260
How do you want me to prove it?

14
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,259
Didn't you scold me as the damn author behind my back?

15
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,259
My goodness.

16
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,790
How did he know I was scolding him as damn author behind his back?

17
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,300
I can hear what you are

18
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,200
thinking in your mind.

19
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,980
Who are you lying to?

20
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,840
-Do you have superpower?
-Try it.

21
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,300
I like you.

22
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,500
I heard it.

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
What did you hear?

24
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,690
You said,

25
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,810
"I like you."

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,140
Don't come near me.

27
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,820
You...

28
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,540
God.

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,260
I'm doomed.

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,780
It's so scary.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,100
When did you

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,579
come in for the first time?

33
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,640
At the restaurant.

34
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,240
Restaurant?

35
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,750
So early?

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,020
Then I...

37
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,870
Did Ji Shu become a fool after I splashed it on him?

38
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,510
What did you say?

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,820
I said

40
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,290
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,130
Not that.

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,500
Mr. Ji,

43
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,290
I’m so obsessed with love.

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,100
I don't want you to see others.

45
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,700
You like me?

46
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,820
I like you.

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,500
I've liked you for ten years.

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,660
I know

49
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,540
you are the moon in the sky.

50
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,070
I'm not good enough for you.

51
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,340
But if you keep me by your side,

52
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,700
I wouldn't be able to control my delusion.

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,460
I find that the way you reject people

54
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,010
is like that of the damn author.

55
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,820
Then stay for dinner.

56
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,900
Okay, dear Ji Shu.

57
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,780
Qi.

58
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,260
Stay away from me.

59
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,220
Well...

60
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,820
Let me ask you.

61
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,380
How far away are you from me to not hear the voice in my heart?

62
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Well, I don't...

63
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,100
I'm not sure.

64
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,980
Don't come near me.

65
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,900
Qi.

66
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,860
Are they fighting?

67
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,230
I don't think so.

68
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,380
Indeed.

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,060
I can't control it.

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,500
Let me ask you.

71
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,260
Can you hear me from outside?

72
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,780
No.

73
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,940
It seems like

74
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,300
flirting.

75
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,940
I scolded you as a damn author.

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,260
How come you didn't get angry and endured it for so long?

77
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,220
I was angry at first.

78
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,420
I knew you were angry.

79
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,260
So you didn't tell me your identity

80
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,660
just wanted to laugh at me.

81
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,170
Right?

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,740
I didn't tell you at first

83
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,500
to stop you from changing the story.

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:33,860
But then,

85
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,590
every time I wanted to tell you,

86
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,860
someone always interrupted me.

87
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,860
And I've told you in the real world.

88
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,250
You just forgot.

89
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
How is that possible?

90
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,700
How can you believe it?

91
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,409
Stop!

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,540
Keep a safety distance from me.

93
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,600
I need to calm down.

94
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,740
The ground is slippery.

95
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,300
Right.

96
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,180
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

97
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm fine.

98
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,500
Me too.

99
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,260
That's good.

100
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,300
You...

101
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,670
Brother.

102
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,060
I saw the lights of her house are on on the balcony.

103
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,420
But she wouldn't open the door for you.

104
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:13,740
Did you

105
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,020
make her angry?

106
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,730
If

107
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,020
a person always knows

108
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,280
what you're thinking.

109
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,300
What will you do after you know it?

110
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,420
It depends on the person.

111
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,060
If he's my boyfriend,

112
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,420
there are advantages and disadvantages.

113
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,470
The advantage is

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,180
he knows everything that I'm thinking.

115
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,180
That way, we won't quarrel anymore.

116
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,060
The disadvantage is...

117
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,060
My goodness.

118
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,900
He knows everything.

119
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,300
We'll break up sooner or later.

120
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,940
Is it that serious?

121
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,020
Of course.

122
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,620
Do you know something

123
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,780
that Qi can't tell you?

124
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,580
No.

125
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,260
Go back and rest.

126
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,620
Mr. Ji.

127
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,860
What is

128
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,580
the matter?

129
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,640
I have something serious to tell you.

130
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,390
Go ahead.

131
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,420
Just say it.

132
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,380
The recent spate of accidents

133
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,340
didn't happen by accident.

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,290
They were man-made.

135
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,020
From now on,

136
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,240
you are not allowed to leave my sight.

137
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,020
Mr. Ji,

138
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,980
you are too domineering.

139
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,620
I'm not kidding.

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,820
You're in danger now.

141
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Why do I think

142
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,580
you are more dangerous?

143
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,020
What are you thinking?

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,580
Do I have any improper thoughts about you?

145
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,560
From now on,

146
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,180
you have to tell me wherever you go.

147
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,110
I'll be with you.

148
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,020
Be with me?

149
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,100
Whenever I eat, sleep or take...

150
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,650
you'll always be with me?

151
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,370
Yes.

152
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,780
That means I won't have

153
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,840
any private space?

154
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,980
Is life more important or freedom?

155
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,110
Both are important.

156
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,100
All right. It's more important to save my life now.

157
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,300
The man in black may be Shan Hang.

158
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Shan Hang?

159
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,980
Why is he targeting me?

160
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,180
I only met him twice.

161
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,660
Is it because Lin Qingmiao is targeting me?

162
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,730
No way.

163
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,340
Ji Shu, it's really you.

164
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,420
When did you come in?

165
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,880
You had so many chances today.

166
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,340
Why didn't you stop her from changing the story?

167
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,620
You've changed.

168
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,659
Does it have anything to do with her?

169
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,500
The story can be changed,

170
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,220
but you shouldn't.

171
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,940
I'll help you restore the story.

172
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
What do you think?

173
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,700
Why are you staring at me?

174
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,500
Because of me.

175
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,740
Because of you,

176
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,340
he wants to harm me?

177
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,500
That doesn't make sense.

178
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,540
Is there something wrong with his brain?

179
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,740
He framed you for plagiarism

180
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,940
and stole your girlfriend.

181
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,220
Shouldn't you take revenge on him?

182
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,290
It's my ex-girlfriend.

183
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,860
Fine. Ex-girlfriend.

184
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,420
You're so cautious.

185
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,620
Your appearance

186
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,620
changed my feelings.

187
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,820
Maybe that's why he targeted you.

188
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,610
What are you talking about?

189
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
Because

190
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,300
I showed up, you...

191
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,420
Excuse me. I'm leaving.

192
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,780
Excuse me.

193
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,179
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,060
Well...

195
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,940
This is my house.

196
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,300
I know.

197
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,940
It's getting late. You...

198
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Can...

199
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,020
You...

200
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,780
Why are you blushing?

201
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,710
Who is blushing?

202
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,380
You're blushing.

203
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,060
Your whole family is blushing.

204
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,720
I'm going to sleep. Leave now.

205
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,540
I know.

206
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,020
You said I liked you.

207
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,530
You were kidding, right?

208
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,270
No.

209
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
You... I...

210
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,050
Impossible.

211
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,760
I...

212
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,380
If you can hear me,

213
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,660
I've scolded you so many times.

214
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,060
It's impossible...

215
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,460
I don't believe you wouldn't...

216
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,180
When I first knew,

217
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,820
I was really angry.

218
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,420
Not anymore?

219
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,700
Are you a masochist?

220
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,900
All right, let's be serious.

221
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,140
The most important thing now

222
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,260
is to ensure your safety

223
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,590
and find a way to go back.

224
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,780
It's getting late.

225
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,820
I'll go back first.

226
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,540
Anything else?

227
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,940
I've thought it over.

228
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,180
For your safety,

229
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,700
I have to stay with you.

230
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,890
I think

231
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
it's safe for me to stay at home.

232
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,340
Not necessarily.

233
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,060
We came in through the website.

234
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,260
Shan Hang is the founder of the website.

235
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,430
What if he has higher authority

236
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
which allows him to show up anytime?

237
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,660
Don't tell me

238
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,110
you want to live with me.

239
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,780
You can live with me.

240
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,310
As long as you don't mind having someone else.

241
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,300
I was just kidding.

242
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,370
I'm not joking.

243
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,180
I think

244
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,180
I'm safe here.

245
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,780
How about

246
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,420
I'll call you if I'm in danger?

247
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,770
What if he showed up

248
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,900
with a dagger or other weapons?

249
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
When I arrived,

250
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,190
you would have died.

251
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,650
Do you have a way with that?

252
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,710
That won't happen.

253
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,060
It may happen.

254
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,940
If

255
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,260
you're afraid that

256
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,540
I have improper thoughts about you.

257
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,730
Don't worry. I don't.

258
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,020
I'm afraid I have improper thoughts about you.

259
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,010
This is my house.

260
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,340
Can't I go in?

261
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
Of course you can.

262
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
How about

263
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,460
we watch a movie together?

264
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,020
Sure.

265
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,350
[Sweet Life]

266
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,380
Snacks and movies are a perfect match.

267
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,940
You used to drink alone at home?

268
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,780
Being alone at home, with the curtain closed and the movie going on,

269
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,420
and drinking a little,

270
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,480
isn't it romantic?

271
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,780
Not bad.

272
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,380
When two people do this,

273
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,180
it seems not bad at all.

274
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,940
They're so happy.

275
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,130
I'm so sad.

276
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,700
They...

277
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,300
That's...

278
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,020
a happy ending.

279
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,530
If they

280
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,980
hadn't met each other,

281
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,250
they would have killed themselves from depression.

282
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,260
It may look tragic, but it's actually a comedy.

283
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,660
There's someone who can accompany you to walk out of the darkness with you.

284
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,420
That's too happy.

285
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,580
When can I meet such a person?

286
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,540
They...

287
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,170
You...

288
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,700
What are you doing?

289
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,230
I want to play claw machine.

290
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,780
Well.

291
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,580
I've never succeeded in this game

292
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,700
in my life.

293
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,540
I'm not complete at all.

294
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,260
I'm so unhappy.

295
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,240
But does playing claw machine

296
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,460
have anything to do with happiness?

297
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,700
Yes.

298
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,530
But it's night now.

299
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,310
I'll play the claw machine.

300
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,100
Can we play it tomorrow?

301
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,650
No.

302
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,580
I have an appointment with the dolls.

303
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,540
They are all waiting for me there today.

304
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,580
They are waiting for me to catch them.

305
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,530
Wait. Let me think of a way.

306
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,060
Dolls.

307
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,590
Let me think of a way.

308
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,460
I've told them that I'll go today.

309
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,390
Here's the doll.

310
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,020
Catch it.

311
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,860
This is too small.

312
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,140
I don't want this.

313
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,660
I want a big doll.

314
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,420
This one.

315
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,180
What a big doll.

316
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,180
Boss,

317
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,180
I caught a big doll.

318
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,910
Give it to me.

319
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,380
Give him to me!

320
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,420
Song... Song Yanqi!

321
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,080
Don't move!

322
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,420
This doll can move.

323
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,480
He's attacking me.

324
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:09,940
Song Yanqi.

325
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,380
Boss, there's something wrong with this doll.

326
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,460
Let me teach him a lesson.

327
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,490
-Boss.
-Song!

328
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,140
Boss, I got him.

329
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,940
Give it to me!

330
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,130
Song Yanqi!

331
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,780
Fei.

332
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,060
When did your brother come back last night?

333
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,790
I don't know.

334
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,420
Go get him for breakfast.

335
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,020
He can go back to sleep after breakfast.

336
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,350
Okay.

337
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,470
Brother.

338
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,830
Brother!

339
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,110
Brother!

340
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,910
Brother!

341
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,140
My brother stayed out all night.

342
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,150
There must be something wrong.

343
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,460
I asked you to get him.

344
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,700
Why are you standing here?

345
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,180
Mom.

346
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,700
My brother went out early in the morning.

347
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,300
He told me

348
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,540
to tell you.

349
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,250
I forgot.

350
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,520
He said he had something important to deal with in the company.

351
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,660
How come I didn't

352
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,310
see him go out this morning?

353
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,780
Maybe you've missed him.

354
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,780
Let's eat breakfast.

355
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,940
What's so important?

356
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,670
He didn't even have breakfast.

357
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,180
Mom, he's an adult.

358
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,710
He can take care of himself.

359
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,670
Please worry about me.

360
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,420
Okay, eat up.

361
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,350
The milk is cold.

362
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,700
Stop looking.

363
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,380
Let's eat.

364
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,860
Shush.

365
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,320
Your sister is here. Hide.

366
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,620
Why should I hide?

367
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,660
Stop asking and hide.

368
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,920
We can't let her see us. Hurry up and hide.

369
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,700
Hurry.

370
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,980
Why not?

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,630
Hush.

372
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,180
It's too dangerous here.

373
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,140
This way.

374
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,380
-It's safer inside.
-I...

375
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,180
-We didn't do anything.
-Shush.

376
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,620
What brings you here so early?

377
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,420
Good morning.

378
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,380
Is my brother here?

379
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,140
Your brother? Your brother?

380
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,980
How could he be with me?

381
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,500
This doll...

382
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,900
It's a good doll.

383
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,050
Take it if you like it.

384
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,860
The bedroom.

385
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,180
There are many dolls in the bedroom, right?

386
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,240
I'll go take a look.

387
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,150
The bedroom.

388
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,550
Take whatever you like.

389
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,340
Qi. My stomach suddenly hurts.

390
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,940
Can I use your bathroom?

391
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,660
No.

392
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,420
The bathroom.

393
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,220
No, I have mysophobia.

394
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,820
I can't hold it anymore.

395
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,660
Your house is right next door.

396
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,380
Go to your own house.

397
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,100
Please.

398
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,700
No.

399
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,100
My stomach doesn't hurt anymore.

400
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm going home.

401
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,820
By the way, Sister-in-law.

402
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,480
if you see my brother, tell him

403
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,740
my parents went out.

404
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,260
If he wants to go home and change,

405
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,620
I'll pretend I can't see him.

406
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,180
What sister-in-law? Your brother...

407
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,420
No.

408
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,860
How could Mr. Ji sleep in my house?

409
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,590
Don’t worry.

410
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,100
I

411
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,540
won't tell anyone.

412
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:17,860
Bye.

413
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,420
Well.

414
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,900
Come out.

415
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,380
She didn't see you, did she?

416
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,710
I don't think she saw me.

417
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,970
I was so scared.

418
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,400
Mr. Ji, what are you doing?

419
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,500
Get changed.

420
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,500
You can't go.

421
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,380
Aren't you incriminating yourself by doing that?

422
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,660
What we did...

423
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,020
Are you an actor or not?

424
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,860
Can you act?

425
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,420
When you should be nervous,

426
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,660
you have no expression.

427
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,940
Being it happy, excited, worried, or scared,

428
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,460
you always put on this poker face.

429
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,520
What are you doing?

430
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,900
Can you act or not?

431
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,120
If you can't, you'll be replaced.

432
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,340
He wants to transform into an actor?

433
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,940
Dream on.

434
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,980
Don't insult the profession of an actor.

435
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,140
Just quit the business.

436
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,330
As an idol, he casually announced his love affair.

437
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,180
He even got involved with other women when he had a girlfriend.

438
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,240
Don't come to ruin the show business.

439
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,030
What's wrong with him?

440
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,440
He was fine yesterday.

441
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,260
He wanted to find a camera

442
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,700
to practice in front of it.

443
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,820
So I found him one.

444
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,820
But

445
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,180
as soon as the device is plugged in,

446
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,380
he has been like this.

447
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,180
He seems to be afraid of the camera.

448
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,430
Well.

449
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,110
He wasn't like this before.

450
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,000
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

451
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,260
Yu didn't let me tell you.

452
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,190
He said he'll get used to it.

453
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,180
But it's been a night.

454
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,250
The audition is coming.

455
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,340
What should we do?

456
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,380
Yan,

457
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,010
I saw in the morning

458
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,620
something bad

459
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,660
about Xining.

460
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,340
Should I tell Yu Le?

461
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,340
He can’t even protect himself.

462
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,740
What can he do if he knows?

463
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,820
Let's wait after the audition.

464
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:43,860
Okay.

465
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,940
But with his condition,

466
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,920
will he pass the audition?

467
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,680
Do our best and leave the rest to fate.

468
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,980
Yu Le.

469
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
It's time.

470
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,100
Let's go.

471
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,180
I was so scared.

472
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,140
Why are you so scared?

473
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,180
You didn't do anything to me.

474
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,660
Right.

475
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,940
I didn't do anything shameful.

476
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,220
Ji Fei must have found out.

477
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,580
I was trying to cover it up.

478
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,140
She would laugh at me.

479
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,130
She wouldn't.

480
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,010
Why?

481
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,950
If she dares to laugh at you,

482
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,140
I'll cut off her pocket money.

483
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,140
Where are we going?

484
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,040
I'll take you to ship a couple.

485
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,380
Really?

486
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,220
Let's go.

487
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,500
Yan.

488
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,860
What if Yu fails

489
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,220
this audition?

490
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,580
What else can he do?

491
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,740
He should bear the consequences of his mistake.

492
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,140
If he can bear it,

493
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,520
there will be a future.

494
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,740
If he can't bear it,

495
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,800
the industry will forget him.

496
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,420
Yu Le.

497
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,100
You've had your way once.

498
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,490
You have also tasted the consequences.

499
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,290
Just follow my plan in the future

500
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,430
and behave well.

501
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,380
How was the audition?

502
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,950
I was not in a good state.

503
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,590
I don't think I did well.

504
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,220
The result is not out yet.

505
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,230
Don't be discouraged too soon.

506
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,420
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,750
There's nothing to be sorry for me.

508
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,180
You should only feel sorry for yourself

509
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,900
and those fans

510
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,030
who have been supporting you till now.

511
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,620
I know.

512
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,020
Did you try your best?

513
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,940
Will it help?

514
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,100
They all said

515
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,580
I turned a great hand

516
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,620
into a bad hand.

517
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,220
I used to insist

518
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,460
my choice was right.

519
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,940
But now,

520
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,430
I don't know if I'm right or not.

521
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,850
Just try your best.

522
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,550
As long as you work hard,

523
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,580
you will be able to give yourself the best account.

524
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Thank you, Sis.

525
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,660
Get yourself together.

526
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,190
You have another job later.

527
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,100
The shooting of the promotional video

528
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
of the water park.

529
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
The water park?

530
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,420
The one with Xining?

531
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,630
Do you regret it?

532
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,310
You don't want to go?

533
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,660
But can I still film like this?

534
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,940
Whether you can or not,

535
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,820
before the audition results come out,

536
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,220
don't let anyone

537
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,860
know your fear of the camera.

538
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,860
Otherwise, it's really over.

539
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,020
I know.

540
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,010
Gao Ming. Let's go.

541
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,370
Okay.

542
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,420
Xining.

543
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,340
You...

544
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,420
You're here early.

545
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,740
I was afraid there'll be a traffic jam,

546
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,140
so I came here in advance.

547
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,700
By the way,

548
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,020
how is your mother doing?

549
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
If you need help,

550
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,000
come to me anytime.

551
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,330
Her condition stabilizes.

552
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,730
She just needs more rest.

553
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,300
Thank you for that day.

554
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,390
You're welcome.

555
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,030
This is what I should do.

556
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,510
There is nothing that you should do for me.

557
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,220
Yu Le,

558
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
thank you for being my friend.

559
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,380
-You just arrived, right?
-I...

560
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,980
Go do makeup and get changed.

561
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,240
We need to discuss the filming with the director later.

562
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,410
Okay.

563
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:45,740
Yu Le.

564
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,740
Come here.

565
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,510
Why are you here?

566
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,940
Aren't I going to shoot the promotional video?

567
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,660
Lei.

568
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,080
Director, coming.

569
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,490
Didn't I tell the producers that I wanted a replacement?

570
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,420
What's going on?

571
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,900
Don't you know if he has had any negative news recently?

572
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,220
Why did they still call him here?

573
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,940
Director.

574
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,820
We've communicated

575
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,550
with the producers about this.

576
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,940
They still want us to act together.

577
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,820
Why don't you check it again?

578
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,860
Okay, I'll make a call.

579
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,670
I didn't expect this to happen.

580
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,810
Don't think too much.

581
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,660
Maybe they didn't communicate well.

582
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,940
Since I've done it,

583
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,820
I knew this would happen.

584
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,090
You...

585
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,660
However,

586
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,860
you're getting more and more confident now.

587
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I’m happy for you.

588
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,660
Yu Le,

589
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,940
don’t feel too burdened.

590
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,320
You'll get better.

591
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,730
OK.

592
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,980
Since the producers insist on having you to act,

593
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,460
fine.

594
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,360

Go ahead.

597
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:58,660
OK.

598
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,940
You really brought me here to ship the couple?

599
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,030
What? You don't believe me?

600
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,620
No.

601
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,660

602
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,940
you've changed recently.

603
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,330
How?

604
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,380
You used to be cold and domineering

605
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,140
and didn't let me ship couples.

606
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,400
You said the couples I shipped were fake.

607
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,580
I just didn't want you to feel sad

608
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,780
after you knew the truth.

609
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,260
Then why did you bring me here today?

610
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,420
Because I don't know

611
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,680

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,340
Okay, don't worry. We'll handle it.

760
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,260
Go.

761
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,810
OK.

762
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,420
Three, two, one, action.

763
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,510
What a coincidence.

764
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,740
Cut.

765
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,260
Very good.

766
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,380
Xining, Yu Le.

767
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,580
Have a rest.

768
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,820
Thank you, Director.

769
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,940
Let's get ready for the next scene.

770
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,739
Okay, Director.

771
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,300
Okay, Director.

772
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,219
Get changed.

773
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,940
Bro, something happened.

774
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,739
What's wrong?

775
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,310
Fang Yan.

776
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,139
I have good news and bad news.

777
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,860
The director saw Yu Le’s state

778
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,739
and the character insights he wrote.

779
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,460
He thinks he is the right person for the male lead character of this movie.

780
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,060
But

781
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,020
Yu Le has once again made it to the negative trending topics.

782
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,900
I hope you can handle it well.

783
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,540
Otherwise, it'll be hard for me to explain to the investors.

784
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,980
I can't stop them

785
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,510
if they want to replace him.

786
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,860
I believe in your public relations ability.

787
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,500
I will give you a satisfactory response

788
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,690
in the future.

789
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,500
I promise

790
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,210
this will never happen again.

791
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,540
Director Wang and I are very satisfied with Yu Le this time.

792
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,660
Everyone has psychological barriers.

793
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,460
As long as he can overcome,

794
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,520
it's not a problem.

795
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:00,980
Of course.

796
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,740
Don’t worry. Yu Le will be fine.

797
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,220
Bye.

798
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,980
Yan.

799
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,960
What happened?

800
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,320
I'll talk to you later.

801
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Gao Ming, how is it going over there?

802
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,940
The source of the videos and photos is unclear.

803
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,500
They could be digitally manipulated.

804
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,300
The brand said

805
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,940
we only have 24 hours

806
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
to deal with this.

807
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,420
They said they gave us face last time.

808
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,980
If we can't handle it well this time,

809
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,900
they'll terminate the contract.

810
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,030
What about the CCTV?

811
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,530
I've talked to the hotel manager.

812
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,060
He said it'll take some time to check the CCTV.

813
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,460
Okay, I got it.

814
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,260
Yan.

815
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,700
I'm sorry

816
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,510
for causing you trouble again.

817
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,340
You did cause me a lot of trouble.

818
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,300
However,

819
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,260
fortune and misfortune depend on each other

820
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,420
and negativity is the key to success.

821
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,580
Your state at that time

822
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,540
was exactly what the director wanted.

823
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,780
And your character insights have moved the director.

824
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,740
The producer and director both chose you.

825
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,420
Really?

826
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,540
Really?

827
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
Of course.

828
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Great, Yan.

829
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,780
Someone finally saw me.

830
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,100
All your hard work and efforts are not in vain.

831
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,260
I'll do my best.

832
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,900
Film the promotional video well first.

833
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,420
Leave the rest to me.

834
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,420
OK.

835
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,460
Go.

836
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,380
Catch it.

837
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,150
OK.

838
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,170
Here.

839
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,340
Did you see the trending topics today?

840
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:30,940
Let me see.

841
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,900
Yu Le is so unlucky.

842
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,890
He had a camera panic

843
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,920
before he successfully transformed into an actor.

844
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,300
Do you think

845
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,980
he is making an excuse

846
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,420
for him to be bad at acting?

847
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,340
But he seemed not like that

848
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,740
when I saw him acting just now.

849
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,540
You're right.

850
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,500
Maybe people are exaggerating.

851
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,690
But Ye Xining is really scheming.

852
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,420
They already broke up.

853
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,580
She posted it on Weibo first.

854
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,060
Guess what?

855
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,450
Before the filming,

856
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,700
she took the initiative to hold Yu Le’s hand.

857
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,760
Why didn’t I see it?

858
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,100
But I didn't expect

859
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,340
her father would also make mistakes and go to jail.

860
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,260
It's normal

861
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,580
for a person like her to be scheming.

862
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,020
Unfortunately, it is Yule who is suffering.

863
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,480
Indeed.

864
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,820
What trending topics are you talking about?

865
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,740
What camera panic?

866
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,860
Who's going to jail?

867
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,980
It just came out online.

868
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,420
Look.

869
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,160
[Hot search on Weibo]

870
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,540
These are all fake.

871
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,800
They are not like that.

872
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,300
Who knows?

873
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,860

874

877
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,540
How are you? Are you hurt?

878
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,220
I'm fine.

879
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,620
Fortunately.

880
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,100
Actually,

881
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,420
I'm not fine.

882
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,200
Where are you injured?

883
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,620
The water in the pool

884
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,010
tastes terrible.

885
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,940
I just choked on two sips.

886
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,460
I feel like vomiting.

887
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,100
Stop laughing.

888
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,540
Well, I...

889
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,220
So many people are soaking in it.

890
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,020
You don't believe me?

891
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,690
Try it.

892
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,780
I won't laugh.

893
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,580
All right, stop pulling a long face.

894
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,910
Smile, and you'll look ten years younger.

895
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,540
Smile.

I haven't seen you for the last time.

902

908
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,020
Let's go down and look for her.

909
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,500
If we can't find her, we'll call the police.
