1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,420
That moment came with the
beginning of summer vacation.

2
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,340
I don't know if what I did was right.

3
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,280
If time had passed,
would I have understood?

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Would I have forgotten before I understood?

5
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,615
But even ten years, or a hundred years
in the future,

6
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:03,482
I'll still love Mika more than anyone.

7
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,060
I could still say that
feeling of mine was true.

8
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,420
Hey, Mika.

9
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,560
I really don't know how to say it.

10
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:22,568
"Love" is a cheap word, and I hate saying it.
But I don't know any other word to use.

11
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:25,513
I love you, that's all.
That simple word is the best one.

12
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:28,310
Falling in love with someone
was such a simple thing.

13
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:33,982
- From the novel "Finding the Adolescence
Chapter 3 - Chiho's Confession" by Namie Hanaoka.

14
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:49,490
"Finding the Adolescence"

15
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,820
Okay, that's fine. Thanks.

16
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,340
Wait!

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
Stop it, you pervert.

18
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,040
Did you get bigger? Let me try once more.

19
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,400
Takane?

20
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:35,404
It's in the basement storeroom, supposedly.

21
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:37,771
You're right.

22
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:39,802
Hold on a second.

23
00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:58,060
Excuse me.

24
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,320
This says it's in the basement.

25
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,920
Alright. Just a moment.

26
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,193
What's wrong?

27
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,943
I'm just here to get a book.

28
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,833
A book?

29
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:51,006
Is there anything else here?

30
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:51,940
I see.

31
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,440
What?

32
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,440
May I go through?

33
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,140
Thanks.

34
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,740
You're really not coming?

35
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,240
Yeah, I'm busy.

36
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,240
Okay. Bye.

37
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,680
Bye!

38
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,720
Bye-bye!

39
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:28,700
I'm glad it was there.

40
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,420
Yeah.

41
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,440
Mika, hurry!

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,840
Hey, wait!

43
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,080
Hurry!

44
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,080
Right now?

45
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,800
Yes.

46
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:01,780
Good luck.

47
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,000
Good luck, he says.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Mizushiro's so annoying.

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
"Good luck."

50
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
How creepy.

51
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,360
Like that?

52
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,620
Yeah, it kind of sounds like him.

53
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Hey, Mika.

54
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,250
What do you think about kissing, Mika?

55
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,200
What's this, all of a sudden?

56
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,060
No, well... Sonoko kissed
somebody, supposedly.

57
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,680
Oh, I heard.

58
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,320
What about you, Mika?

59
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,960
Have you ever done that?

60
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,870
Of course not.

61
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,860
Me too.

62
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,860
Sit down.

63
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay.

64
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,000
What's it like, you think?

65
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,480
No idea.

66
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Ask Sonoko or Suga.

67
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
Yeah.

68
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,640
Those two have boyfriends.

69
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,240
I guess Sonoko used to, anyway.

70
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,580
Yeah. A sophomore?

71
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,520
Hey.

72
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
What's up?

73
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,940
Want to try one?

74
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,420
Want to?

75
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,980
What are you saying?

76
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,360
Yeah.

77
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,780
Dummy.

78
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,100
What are you reading?

79
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
"Finding the Adolescence."

80
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,520
By who?

81
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,000
Namie Hanaoka.

82
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,040
Is she famous?

83
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,380
I don't know.

84
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,060
But listen to this, she
graduated from our school!

85
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,700
Mizushiro told me during my interview here.

86
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,140
He told me about this book too.

87
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,140
You're talking about Mizushiro again.

88
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,340
She wrote it at age 14. Isn't that amazing?

89
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,740
Same age as us. A year younger, actually!

90
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,080
That's amazing, isn't it?

91
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,080
Is it good?

92
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,540
Yeah. I like it.

93
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,760
I see.

94
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,420
Then you know,

95
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,040
you've gotta do your best too, Mika.

96
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,600
Hey,

97
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,980
did you decide what book
you're using for story time?

98
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,980
Not yet.

99
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,760
When will you decide?

100
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,500
Why?

101
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,280
You wouldn't want to pick the
same book as somebody else.

102
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,840
Don't worry about it. I'm a storyteller.

103
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,610
That's right. You used to be an author.

104
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,840
Sorry. But you quit, right?

105
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,400
I don't know if I quit...

106
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,400
I see.

107
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,180
But you like books, right?

108
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,060
This is the ideal workplace, since
you're surrounded by what you like.

109
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,180
Why did you chose this job, Ms. Ando?

110
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,380
No real reason.

111
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,040
I've got the certification.
And it's just a part-time job.

112
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,460
Excuse me.

113
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,320
What? Story time?

114
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,550
Yes. I wasn't sure which was best.

115
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,520
It's your first time, right?
Probably something simple.

116
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Yeah.

117
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,140
Okay, get ready.

118
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,340
Next.

119
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,685
Next.

120
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:42,260
(Tsujisawa)

121
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,040
Hasumi, you're late.

122
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,120
What? Are you sitting out too?

123
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,700
Excuse me! I'm on my period!

124
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,340
Hey.

125
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,560
I see. Then sit out.

126
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,160
Okay.

127
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,200
Next.

128
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,160
Gotcha.

129
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,740
Yeah, you can see through it now.

130
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,140
Naughty!

131
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,000
Stop it, it's embarrassing.

132
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,260
What, are the both of you sitting out?

133
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,440
That's boring.

134
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,360
She's lucky. I wanted to swim too.

135
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,900
Hey!

136
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,480
Well?

137
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I'll get you back.

138
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,280
No! Stop!

139
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,960
Excuse me.

140
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,680
Yes?

141
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,540
I'd like this...

142
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,260
One moment.

143
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,120
Want me to do it?

144
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,780
Yeah, thanks.

145
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,720
We don't have this here.

146
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,052
I see.

147
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,592
Thank you.

148
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:04,900
I guess Suga's not peeing.

149
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,880
That takes a while.

150
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,460
I see.

151
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,840
You didn't paint today.

152
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:24,153
Sorry.

153
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,474
- You're late!
- I'm back!

154
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:28,013
Hey, wait! What was that?

155
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,140
Wipe yourself, seriously!

156
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,662
Jeez, don't do that!

157
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,307
It's dripping here too!

158
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:39,952
Hey, what are you doing?

159
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,170
Why didn't you wipe yourself
dry first? That's nuts.

160
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:56,318
That magazine...

161
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,732
That magazine you wanted...
want me to lend it to you?

162
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,280
Those cakes are delicious.

163
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
They totally are.

164
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,820
Bye-bye.

165
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,560
Bye!

166
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,040
Bye!

167
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,240
Bye-bye!

168
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Hasumi?

169
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,940
Ohagi.

170
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,080
Would you not call me that?

171
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,580
Sorry.

172
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,020
Mr. Mizushiro is calling you.

173
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,580
Mizushiro?

174
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,840
Here.

175
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,020
If you're serious about taking entrance
exams you should think about it.

176
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,040
No, I...

177
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,860
Tsujisawa came to me and
asked me to look out for you.

178
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,000
Mika did?

179
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:40,840
It'd be best if I could teach you, but...

180
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,900
Thank you.

181
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,720
Are you going again today, Hasumi?

182
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,780
No, not today.

183
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,500
I see. Well, good luck.

184
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:03,660
Thank you.

185
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,740
You can keep it.

186
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,800
No...

187
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,800
I'll just read it here.

188
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
Here.

189
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,560
Thank you.

190
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,580
You're not doing it today?

191
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,300
No, she's busy.

192
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,020
Want me to do it?

193
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,160
There's no point doing it with you, Sonoko.

194
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,380
Huh? What does that mean?

195
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,390
Let's go.

196
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,020
Yeah.

197
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:11,160
Wait!

198
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,100
Thank you!

199
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:40,520
You're done?

200
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,193
Yes.

201
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,600
Aseia Academy?

202
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,820
Yes.

203
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,660
I went there too.

204
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,660
I see.

205
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,940
It was a long time ago.

206
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:03,574
Then do you know who this is?

207
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,860
(Namie Hanaoka)

208
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,100
She went to Aseia too!

209
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,200
What? You've got a fan, Ms. Hanaoka?

210
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,440
I guess authors are popular.

211
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,300
No way.

212
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,300
You're Namie Hanaoka?

213
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,480
Yeah...

214
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,260
Really? Really? Really?

215
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,300
Umm...

216
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,640
Oh wow, I should've brought my book!

217
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,100
Wow.

218
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,680
You're really Namie Hanaoka?

219
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,320
Yeah.

220
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,380
Oh wow... can I get an autograph?

221
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,842
Do you have anything to write with?

222
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,680
Thanks!

223
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,849
I'm sorry for getting so excited earlier.

224
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,840
It's fine.

225
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,240
You were looking for an
art book earlier, right?

226
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,920
How did you know?

227
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,540
I'm the one who gave it to you.

228
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,260
I'm sorry, I didn't notice.

229
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,260
Of course you didn't.

230
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,260
Um... do you smoke?

231
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,420
Huh?

232
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,340
No... Chiho, in the book, she smoked.

233
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,700
Oh.

234
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,960
I don't smoke, I guess.

235
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
Of course not.

236
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,280
So you know how Chiho falls in
love with her best friend, Mikako?

237
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,820
Was there a model for that?

238
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,700
A model...

239
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,240
Do you have someone like that?

240
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,860
I don't understand.

241
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,860
I see.

242
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,530
What about you?

243
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,460
I did.

244
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,420
I don't know if I loved them.

245
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,400
I looked up to them.

246
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,880
Then...

247
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,880
Like Chiho?

248
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,000
No, no. It's a book.

249
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,180
That surprised me.

250
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,110
But it's rare to see somebody read my book.

251
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,260
Do you like books, Mika?

252
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,280
Good morning!

253
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,120
Morning!

254
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,720
Morning!

255
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,510
Morning!

256
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,080
Hey, guess who I met yesterday?

257
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,880
What's this about?

258
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,220
A celebrity?

259
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,380
Something like that.

260
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,580
No way. Who?

261
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,860
Do you know who Namie Hanaoka is?

262
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,800
Who?

263
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
You don't know her? She wrote
a book called "Finding the Adolescence."

264
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,300
Do you know her?

265
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,040
No.

266
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,600
She went to our school, and published
the book while she was here.

267
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,300
She was about our age. Isn't that amazing?

268
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,530
Good morning.

269
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,320
Listen to this, Takane!
I met Namie Hanaoka yesterday!

270
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,500
Hanaoka?

271
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,740
You know, the woman who graduated
from our school I told you about.

272
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,100
Oh, right. Right. Right.

273
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,180
I was looking for her book at the library,
and then she was working there!

274
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,090
What a coincidence.

275
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,480
I was so surprised! I asked a
dozen times if it was really her!

276
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,440
But it was! Wasn't that crazy?
It totally was!

277
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,820
Yeah, it is.

278
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,480
Listen... was that what you had to do?

279
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,280
Huh?

280
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,940
Oh, since you haven't been
coming to my painting lately.

281
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Oh, sorry I couldn't help you.

282
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,680
Nah. I was busy too.

283
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,920
I see. What about today?

284
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,080
I'm free. What about you?

285
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,160
I'm free.

286
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,520
She's an author!

287
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,040
- I didn't know!
- I had no idea!

288
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,300
What kind of book is it? You
know, we're a little too old to-

289
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,670
She's an author!

290
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,400
Okay, break time.

291
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:07,320
What are you doing?

292
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,120
You smell good, Mika.

293
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,440
Stop it. I'm sweaty.

294
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,120
I like that.

295
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,840
What?

296
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
That's cold. Stop it.

297
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,320
I'll get you back!

298
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,200
Don't run away!

299
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,780
Why?

300
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:15,400
Don't run!

301
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,580
Takane?

302
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:33,900
What's wrong?

303
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,140
Did something happen?

304
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,040
Got you!

305
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,529
You scared me!

306
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,820
I give up.

307
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,900
You're really going to swim?
Aren't you on your period?

308
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,540
I'm okay. Is that a problem?

309
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
It's not a problem.

310
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:37,080
Huh?

311
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,460
What's wrong?

312
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,680
My swimsuit's not here.

313
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,400
Want to borrow mine?

314
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,920
You aren't swimming?

315
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:51,710
I just got here.

316
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,120
Then maybe I won't either.

317
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,820
You swim, Mika. I'll watch.

318
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,820
Thanks.

319
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,740
Hey!

320
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,880
You doing anything next Sunday?

321
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,748
Nope!

322
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,340
I'm thinking of going to
check out a cram school.

323
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,920
A cram school?

324
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,080
So you've decided to go
to an art school, Takane?

325
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,740
But you know,

326
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,920
to be honest I don't have
much confidence now.

327
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,920
That's not true.

328
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,520
There's a limit to what I can do alone.

329
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:00,969
I think I need to study the basics.

330
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,120
Namie said there are no basics.

331
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,920
It's not something you learn. It's
something you have a sense of.

332
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,660
She was talking about books, wasn't she?

333
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,935
They're the same. They're both art.

334
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,200
But I'm thinking of going
to check it out anyway.

335
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,700
Okay.

336
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,760
Let's go together.

337
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,900
Want some?

338
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:46,766
It's good!

339
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:47,638
It's good?

340
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:49,640
Yeah, it's good.

341
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,260
(Finding the Adolescence)

342
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
You're still here, Tsujisawa?

343
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,100
Oh, Ohagi.

344
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,920
Stop calling me that.

345
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Why? You're Ohagi.

346
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,400
Have you seen Takane?

347
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,800
She wasn't in the classroom.

348
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,700
I see.

349
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:03,040
Hey, what are you reading?

350
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,780
Oh, this.

351
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,900
You like books, right Ohagi?

352
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,540
Let me see.

353
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,200
Okay.

354
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,800
This looks good.

355
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,340
Doesn't it?

356
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,020
Thank you.

357
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:49,860
How many books have you read lately?

358
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,220
Two a week, I suppose.

359
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,900
Wow.

360
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,020
Okay, see you later.

361
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,160
Bye.

362
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Bye, Ohagi!

363
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,700
Hasumi!

364
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,820
Excuse me.

365
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,760
Sorry to call you here like this.

366
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,080
No, it's fine.

367
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,930
These are the books I was talking about.

368
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,300
Thank you!

369
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,540
Is this a few too many?

370
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,220
No, I can read them all.

371
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,500
They're books you recommended, Namie.

372
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,360
I've brought a book too.

373
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,000
If you'd like, please read it.

374
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:32,412
Want to sit down?

375
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,820
Sorry!

376
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,480
Nah.

377
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,600
Did you see my message?

378
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,440
Message?

379
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,740
I sent a message that I'd be late.

380
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,860
You did. Sorry, I didn't notice.

381
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,180
I'm sorry too.

382
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,580
Want to get started?

383
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,300
Yeah.

384
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,100
Namie?

385
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,420
Look at all the books she gave me!

386
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,760
Look, there's all these really thick books.

387
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,040
And she lent me a dozen of them!

388
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,680
I can't wait to read them!

389
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:56,013
Ms. Hanaoka, a word.

390
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:57,080
Yes?

391
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,760
Did you decide on what you'll
read for the next story time?

392
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,360
I'm thinking of doing
something off the cuff.

393
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,060
I wanted to talk to you about that.

394
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,700
Yes?

395
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,880
Would you do your own story?

396
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,060
The patrons requested it.

397
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:24,080
That's impossible. It's
not a story for children.

398
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,974
I see.

399
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:29,889
Then could you write one?

400
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,060
A story for children.

401
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,920
That's even more impossible.

402
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:41,460
They're kids, so it could
just be a simple story.

403
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,080
It's not that easy.

404
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,780
Please. Just dash off a story.

405
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:49,160
It's impossible.

406
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,170
Please. Miss author!

407
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,640
Well...

408
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,360
I don't know if I can write one,

409
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:07,435
but I'll think about it.

410
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,000
Really?

411
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,780
I don't know if I can do it.

412
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,340
"Dream Eater" Mika Tsujisawa.

413
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,500
Are you going to write?

414
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:31,700
Well...

415
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:35,702
Did you write that?

416
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:39,655
This?

417
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,220
I didn't write this.

418
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,020
A girl I know... she's
still in middle school.

419
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,600
But she's a good writer.

420
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,400
Maybe because she reads a lot.

421
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,490
She asks me for recommendations, but I
haven't been reading that often lately.

422
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,980
Are you telling her?

423
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:05,060
Yeah.

424
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,700
All old stuff.

425
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,740
Have you read any books lately, Ms. Ando?

426
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,545
No, I mean are you telling her
how to write?

427
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:20,146
I couldn't.

428
00:39:22,357 --> 00:39:23,257
I'm sure.

429
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,060
Sorry.

430
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,180
What does that mean?

431
00:39:36,955 --> 00:39:38,904
You couldn't teach anybody.

432
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,443
All you did was get in a magazine
for a little.

433
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:48,609
Well, that's true.

434
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,360
I did publish a book, too.

435
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,000
Just one. And a long time ago, right?

436
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,240
What are you trying to say?

437
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,560
No...

438
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,780
I just thought it's kind of pathetic.

439
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,420
The way you're getting so excited about
something that happened a long time ago.

440
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,600
I'll be looking forward to it.

441
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,780
Goodnight.

442
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:52,760
You read it?

443
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,760
It was easy to read.

444
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,802
And well-written too.

445
00:40:57,318 --> 00:40:58,420
That makes me so happy.

446
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,820
I thought the story was a
little childlike, though.

447
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:09,089
Yeah. I wanted kids to read it.

448
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:13,120
I was really weak when I was little
so I used to read picture books.

449
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,940
So I wanted to write a story like that.

450
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,040
Then it might be interesting to have
your artist friend draw pictures for it.

451
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:26,778
That's a great idea.
I'll talk to her about it!

452
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:39,734
But reading your story

453
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,820
gave me a good push.

454
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:46,140
I've gone back to writing.

455
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:48,140
Really?

456
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:49,998
It's a story for kids.

457
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:51,709
So your book really helped.

458
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,480
Thanks.

459
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,560
Can I read it somewhere?

460
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,584
We're having story time
next Sunday at the library.

461
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,700
I'm going to read it there.

462
00:42:07,451 --> 00:42:08,180
Want to come?

463
00:42:08,535 --> 00:42:09,881
Anybody can come.

464
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,840
Sunday...

465
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,654
That's not a good day for me.

466
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,000
It's fine.

467
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,302
But I might be able to come. I'll ask.

468
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,920
Don't worry about it if you can't.

469
00:42:24,203 --> 00:42:24,963
Yeah.

470
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:23,060
(Finding the Adolescence)

471
00:45:23,107 --> 00:45:27,140
Oh, I talked to Namie yesterday and
she said she'd look at your picture.

472
00:45:27,677 --> 00:45:29,480
She doesn't know anything about painting,

473
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,440
but she's got a good sense
so she'll give you good advice.

474
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,146
Sorry.

475
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,800
Can you be quiet? I want to concentrate.

476
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,800
Sorry.

477
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,680
<i>There was a man lying there, asleep.</i>

478
00:46:11,922 --> 00:46:14,302
<i>The man was wearing an old suit.</i>

479
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:16,935
<i>I apologized.</i>

480
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,513
<i>Because I'd stepped on his leg.</i>

481
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,920
<i>The man stared at me and continued.</i>

482
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,140
<i>"Why do you want to be a doctor?"</i>

483
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,720
<i>I wasn't sure what to say.</i>

484
00:46:52,138 --> 00:46:52,700
(July Story time)

485
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,520
<i>"What should I do?"</i>

486
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,320
<i>All the people at the plaza looked sad.</i>

487
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,940
<i>And then from the back I heard a sound.</i>

488
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,500
It's been a long time since
there's been so many.

489
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,080
Aren't there a lot of adults?

490
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,540
It's fine.

491
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,260
You've got the same book I do!

492
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,820
You need to tell me what
you're going to read.

493
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,180
I did tell you.

494
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,200
Did you?

495
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,060
I did.

496
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,280
No, I didn't hear anything.

497
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,980
You just weren't listening.

498
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,940
Okay, next.

499
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,860
Okay!

500
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:32,802
He-

501
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,580
Just go and grab something.

502
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,100
I haven't practiced.

503
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,480
It doesn't matter.
You just have to read it.

504
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,755
<i>It was raining outside.</i>

505
00:47:45,318 --> 00:47:48,154
<i>Taro was looking outside from his window.</i>

506
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,500
<i>"Mom, we can't go for a walk, can we?"</i>

507
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,920
She's pretty calm.

508
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,560
And so the two of them
lived happily ever after!

509
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,820
The end.

510
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,260
That was amazing.

511
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,025
You can do it if you try.

512
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,660
<i>Eating Dreams.</i>

513
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,920
<i>"Oh, I'm sorry."</i>

514
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,911
<i>There was a man lying there, asleep.</i>

515
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,460
<i>The man was wearing an old suit.</i>

516
00:50:17,505 --> 00:50:19,685
<i>I apologized.</i>

517
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,880
<i>Because I'd stepped on his leg.</i>

518
00:50:25,044 --> 00:50:29,216
<i>But I was actually a little upset.</i>

519
00:50:30,384 --> 00:50:34,044
<i>Because that was my spot!</i>

520
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:37,818
<i>There were big pipes in the park.</i>

521
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:40,661
<i>So we called it pipe park.</i>

522
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,669
<i>There were three pipes on
the bottom, and two above,</i>

523
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:51,940
<i>and then one on top of those,
forming a little pyramid.</i>

524
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,599
<i>The left pipe on the second row
was my spot.</i>

525
00:50:57,474 --> 00:51:02,505
<i>There was never anybody there,
but today this man was.</i>

526
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:07,540
<i>I apologized, but the man
just kept staring at me.</i>

527
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,780
<i>"I'm sorry I woke you,"</i>

528
00:51:12,097 --> 00:51:17,137
<i>I said, and he shook his head.</i>

529
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:24,313
<i>"I'm hungry, so I was just
lying down for a little."</i>

530
00:51:25,754 --> 00:51:27,458
<i>"You're hungry?"</i>

531
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,263
<i>"Yeah. I haven't had any food for a while."</i>

532
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,300
<i>He answered in a tired voice.</i>

533
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,966
<i>I remembered I had a cookie in my pocket.</i>

534
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,763
<i>"You can have this if you want, mister."</i>

535
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:50,043
<i>I offered the cookie to the man.</i>

536
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,680
<i>The man laughed, tiredly,
and shook his head again.</i>

537
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,680
<i>"It's good. Don't you want one?"</i>

538
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,052
<i>"I can't eat it."</i>

539
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:05,151
<i>"Do you not like cookies?"</i>

540
00:52:06,734 --> 00:52:10,357
<i>The man shook his head again,
and this is what he said.</i>

541
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,240
<i>"All I could eat was dreams."</i>

542
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,640
<i>"Dreams?"</i>

543
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,020
<i>"What is your dream?"</i>

544
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,840
<i>He nodded and softly closed his eyes.</i>

545
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:31,069
The end.

546
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,900
I wanted to talk to you about it.

547
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,940
But there was no time.

548
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,080
It wasn't everything.

549
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,080
I just based some of your story off of it.

550
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,780
It was your first story, right?
So parts were hard to read.

551
00:54:33,507 --> 00:54:35,627
You said it was easy to read.

552
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:39,600
And that it was well-written.

553
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,480
I did.

554
00:54:48,135 --> 00:54:53,320
But... then... it's different when
you're showing it to somebody else.

555
00:54:56,238 --> 00:54:58,198
Why aren't you apologizing?

556
00:55:03,214 --> 00:55:04,720
All you care about is yourself.

557
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,140
You know how hard it is to write
something yourself, right?

558
00:55:21,135 --> 00:55:23,206
I do. But...

559
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:24,323
Namie...

560
00:55:26,562 --> 00:55:28,307
Have you read any books lately?

561
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:33,167
They're all old.

562
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:38,130
All the books and movies
you recommend are so old.

563
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:47,560
I'm sorry.

564
00:55:48,505 --> 00:55:50,510
I didn't realize you were
thinking about that.

565
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,640
I feel like an idiot

566
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:01,905
for admiring somebody like you.

567
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,000
(Can I kiss you?)

568
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,510
(I'm sorry.)

569
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,680
(What?)

570
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,810
(There's somebody I'm in love with.)

571
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:16,140
(So, I'm sorry.)

572
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,260
Are we done for the day?

573
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,560
What do you want to do?
Keep working on it over summer break?

574
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,200
What happened yesterday?

575
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:37,487
Sorry, I was busy.

576
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,060
You were with Namie again, right?

577
00:57:50,785 --> 00:57:53,385
I've decided to go to cram
school, so it doesn't matter.

578
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,820
We should go somewhere now
that school's out.

579
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,040
That's a great idea.

580
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,760
Let's go to the usual place then.

581
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:49,760
Sorry, sorry.

582
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,760
I have to go home today.

583
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,500
I see.

584
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,440
See you later.

585
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,600
Bye!

586
00:58:55,182 --> 00:58:56,840
What should we have today?

587
00:58:58,464 --> 00:58:59,346
Strawberry?

588
00:58:59,776 --> 00:59:00,740
Want to get that?

589
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,640
What's wrong, Takane?

590
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:07,640
Sorry, Takane.

591
00:59:09,553 --> 00:59:11,173
I need to talk to you.

592
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,780
We'll wait.

593
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,780
See you later.

594
00:59:23,737 --> 00:59:25,460
I'm busy. Really.

595
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,340
I understand that.

596
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,640
No you don't.

597
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,520
I'm sorry.

598
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,780
But I don't know what to do.

599
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:44,835
She's still calling you?

600
00:59:45,008 --> 00:59:45,748
Yeah.

601
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,400
What's wrong with that?
You admire her, right?

602
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,200
No!

603
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,500
Just write something else for her!

604
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,620
She stole it!

605
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,360
I didn't think she was like that!

606
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:23,081
Mika's not writing anything anymore.

607
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:24,815
Stop calling.

608
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:34,338
I'm going.

609
01:00:55,409 --> 01:00:56,620
I wanted to apologize.

610
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:02,942
I tried to write but I couldn't.

611
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,229
It's not my problem anymore.

612
01:01:14,682 --> 01:01:16,200
Stay away from me.

613
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:28,865
Really.

614
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,182
I'm sorry.

615
01:01:40,995 --> 01:01:45,640
I don't think I'll ever see you again.

616
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:50,050
So I wanted to at least say that.

617
01:02:57,609 --> 01:02:58,839
What happened?

618
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,840
Just something.

619
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,753
"Something?" That looks really bad!

620
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,120
It's okay.

621
01:03:17,104 --> 01:03:17,960
Good morning.

622
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,160
Takane!

623
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,580
What happened to you?

624
01:03:36,597 --> 01:03:37,777
It's nothing.

625
01:03:37,802 --> 01:03:39,622
It's nothing? You're hurt!

626
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,400
It's got nothing to do with you.

627
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,090
What?

628
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:55,640
It's not your problem.

629
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,680
I thought you might need
somebody to take you home.

630
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,340
I'll be like this for a while
so I've got to get used to it.

631
01:04:27,253 --> 01:04:28,280
I'm really...

632
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,900
I'm really sorry.

633
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,740
It's fine.

634
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,560
What are you doing?

635
01:04:44,563 --> 01:04:45,995
I came to take her home.

636
01:04:46,323 --> 01:04:47,894
It's my fault this happened.

637
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:50,831
It's not your fault.

638
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,260
It was an accident, really.

639
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,948
I'm amazed you can even come here.

640
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,721
Aren't you ashamed?

641
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,160
It's not about being embarrassed...

642
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,220
You betrayed her!

643
01:05:13,057 --> 01:05:14,020
Stop it.

644
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,500
It's fine.

645
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,420
It's not fine.

646
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,040
You need to tell her or
she'll follow you forever!

647
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,360
Don't say it that way.

648
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,320
So you're taking her side.

649
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,760
It's not your problem, Takane!

650
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,620
You keep saying it's not my problem!

651
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,600
You've got your pictures, right?

652
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:33,860
Leave me alone.

653
01:06:17,777 --> 01:06:20,362
Can we talk?

654
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,807
Hey.

655
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,580
Sit down.

656
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,360
Huh?

657
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,420
Sit there.

658
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,640
I'm going to paint. So sit down.

659
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,729
I told you not to move.

660
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:32,700
That...

661
01:07:38,077 --> 01:07:40,221
was where Mika always sat.

662
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,885
She would always, always, always,

663
01:07:59,638 --> 01:08:01,658
read your book over and over again.

664
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,650
When she...

665
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,340
When she met you, she changed.

666
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,987
She stopped showing up to be my model.

667
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:20,847
That time was mine and hers alone!

668
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:23,175
And you wrecked it!

669
01:08:28,378 --> 01:08:29,360
But...

670
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,159
Leave!

671
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,760
Leave!

672
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:16,594
Takane?

673
01:10:23,437 --> 01:10:24,837
Takane!

674
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:31,078
Takane!

675
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,560
Takane!

676
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:47,994
Did I scare you?

677
01:10:49,839 --> 01:10:51,487
Of course you scared me.

678
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:53,377
Don't do that.

679
01:10:53,402 --> 01:10:54,562
Sorry, sorry.

680
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,737
What is that?

681
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,200
That swimsuit...

682
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,620
Oh, this? That's right, it's yours.

683
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,240
Why?

684
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,151
Why do you think?

685
01:11:30,339 --> 01:11:31,500
What are you doing?

686
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:35,120
Stop it!

687
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,600
I...

688
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,960
I love you, Mika.

689
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,080
I love you, Mika!

690
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,560
So I don't want you to see Namie anymore.

691
01:11:49,854 --> 01:11:50,780
Wait a second.

692
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:55,560
You said you loved me, right?
That we'd be together forever?

693
01:11:55,888 --> 01:11:58,028
I feel the same way! So...

694
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,780
So... so...

695
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:05,040
Let's paint another picture together, okay?

696
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,706
Let me paint you, Mika.

697
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,909
Please. Let me paint you!

698
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,200
Wait, what's wrong? You're acting weird.

699
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,700
I'm not acting weird at all.

700
01:12:14,066 --> 01:12:15,534
Please.

701
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:17,880
Please, Mika!

702
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,320
Stop it! That's disgusting!

703
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:33,329
It's not like that with Namie.

704
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,714
This is weird.

705
01:12:42,184 --> 01:12:43,584
Mika...

706
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:47,448
You're an idiot, Takane.

707
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,280
What happened?

708
01:14:12,559 --> 01:14:13,900
Get yourself dry.

709
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,720
You'll catch cold.

710
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:31,220
It's just like...

711
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,260
Chiho and Mikako.

712
01:15:46,181 --> 01:15:47,175
What?

713
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,223
I'm sorry.

714
01:15:52,755 --> 01:15:54,067
You scared me.

715
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,457
Are you okay?

716
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:04,418
I'm sorry.

717
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:13,480
Mizushiro said you were here.

718
01:18:20,621 --> 01:18:21,540
I see.

719
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,380
Is the picture going well?

720
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,940
It's got nothing to do with you.

721
01:19:00,177 --> 01:19:01,660
You're an idiot too.

722
01:19:25,629 --> 01:19:26,480
Here.

723
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:35,879
This is way overdue,
but give it back to her.

724
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,280
I'm leaving.

725
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:56,702
And this painting.

726
01:20:04,657 --> 01:20:05,918
I don't need it anymore.

727
01:20:05,942 --> 01:20:07,700
If you don't need it throw it away.

728
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:43,631
Are you done?

729
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:07,598
Did you get into a fight?

730
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:28,880
You're almost done.

731
01:21:32,631 --> 01:21:34,351
This is good.

732
01:21:37,227 --> 01:21:40,907
I wonder if Hasumi would paint me, too.

733
01:22:18,249 --> 01:22:22,567
<i>Even when second quarter came around,
Takane's painting hadn't changed.</i>

734
01:22:24,351 --> 01:22:28,531
<i>Time passed in the blink of an eye,</i>

735
01:22:29,925 --> 01:22:31,988
<i>and it was time for us to graduate.</i>

736
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,710
Excuse me.

737
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:39,400
This is way overdue, but...

738
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,567
Oh, alright. One moment.

739
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,940
I'll do it.

740
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,960
Oh, okay. Thanks.

741
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,856
Okay, this is fine.
Be more careful next time.

742
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:07,670
Yeah. Sorry.

01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:56,460
Even after summer vacation ended,
I kept going to cram school.

744
01:23:58,370 --> 01:24:03,940
After that, even if I saw Mika, I
couldn't talk to her like I used to.

745
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:11,640
I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother
me, but that's just how it ended up.

746
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,120
Your friends change as time passes.

747
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,720
Is that all there is to it?

748
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:28,360
But the reason I still sometimes find
myself thinking about that time,

749
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,640
is because all of that really happened.

750
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,210
Mika!
