Let's get started then.

91
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,567
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.

92
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:50,276
How was Tomoharu's character created?

93
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,778
Let's see...

94
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,782
For the first few years since my debut,

95
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,686
I aimed to create "a cool guy" suitable for a girl's manga.

96
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:05,090
But then I wasn't sure what "cool" was after a while.

97
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,096
Then I started to think the character looked familiar,

98
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:15,334
and I realized it was the character that I'd created before.

99
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,369
So...

100
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,439
I dropped the stereotype of how a girl's manga should be,

101
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,942
or what the readers would think.

102
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,712
I decided to create a character that

103
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,014
I fell in love with.

104
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,419
But as soon as the series started,

105
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,621
I was worried that it may not be the character

106
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,990
the readers wanted.

107
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,458
That's not true at all!

108
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,962
I've really liked Tomoharu since the very first chapter.

109
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,599
I liked how pathetic Tomoharu was at the beginning.

110
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,003
When Rin came into his life, he became more dependable.

111
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,138
I was even more drawn to him.

112
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,940
Did you notice that?

113
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,243
Tomoharu was indeed becoming cooler little by little.

114
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,378
I know, right?

115
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,500
Tomoharu who was casually cool is just so irresistible.

116
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
I'm so happy!

117
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,119
I wasn't sure how "cool" I should make him.

118
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,720
- Is that so?
- Yes.

119
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,823
- I didn't sense that at all.
- Really?

120
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,759
Tomoharu has always been cool.

124

126
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,553

139
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,351

140
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,088

141
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,929

176
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,290
But...

177
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:43,362
Hanai is the only woman I love.

178
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,633
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,950
You are too honest.

180
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,856
I get it though. Hanai Sensei is so cool.

181
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,227
I'm okay if it's her.

182
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,464
I can move on now.

183
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:26,405
I know! I'm going to be friends with Hanai Sensei now!

184
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,142
<i>Hanai Sensei!</i>

185
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,978
<i>Could I get your LINE address?</i>

186
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,316
<i>Hey, Sensei, don't you know?</i>

187
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:43,420
<i>It seems that I'm not the only one to be captivated by your charm.</i>

188
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:53,110
Hanai, your new article came out again.

189
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,400
Eh?

190
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,904
Riichi, that's all you've been saying.

191
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,106
Because I'm happy!

192
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:05,108
Hanai's hard work is paying off this way.

193
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:11,416
I was able to work hard because I had you, Riichi.

194
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,252
Thank you.

195
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:31,503
Hanai, your hair is beautiful.

196
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,239
Is it?

197
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,443
Are you taking care of it properly?

198
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:43,015
Not at all. My hair has always been strong though.

199
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,652
That was the only thing I was proud of when I was in school.

200
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:55,158
By the way, did you move to Tokyo after graduating from high school?

201
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,762
Yes.

202
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,600
I made my debut during my senior year in high school.

203
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,269
I thought it would be more convenient to work in Tokyo.

204
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,871
So I moved to Tokyo as soon as I graduated.

205
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,543
Were you creating manga while you were still in high school?

206
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,681
That's incredible.

207
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,352
It would be so cool to have such a friend in my classroom.

208
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,887
So...?

209
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,824
Have you been living like this ever since then?

210
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,628
In the beginning, I used to create short mangas while working as a manga assistant.

211
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,469
Kiritani...?

212
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,838
<i>Hello.</i>

213
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,046
Has Kiritani been your editor the whole time?

214
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,418
No, I had someone different at the beginning.

215
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:57,156
Kiritani became my editor a little after "You Are No Good" started.

216
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,800
Mr. Kiritani is cool.

217
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,903
You were never attracted to him?

218
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:21,476
Is it possible that are you jealous, Riichi?

219
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,090
Riichi?

220
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:38,998
Don't you think I deserve a reward now?

221
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,605
Hey, Hanai.

222
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:53,178
I really want to do it with you now.

223
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,660
