[<i>You Are No Good</i>]

176
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,785
You're impressive as always.

177
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:39,325
[<i>Hanai Ao</i>]

178
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,843
[<i>I want to tell you something. Can I come over?</i>]

179
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,782
She must be working on her storyboard about now.

180
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,603
<i>Why wouldn't she tell me that it's going to be a drama?</i>

181
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:29,008
<i>We're talking about Hanai, so she'd probably say</i>

182
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,543
<i>"I wanted to tell you in person!"</i>

183
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,621
<i>Exactly! I dyed my hair black to fit Rin's image.</i>

184
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,655
Hello.

185
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,158
<i>I'm so happy! You are like Rin in real life!</i>

186
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,698
Good timing! He is the one who did my hair.

187
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,401
He'll be doing my hair and makeup.

188
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,203
Riichi?

189
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,479
Why? What's going on?

190
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:11,650
I'll be in charge of Nanase's hair and makeup.

191
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,988
I wanted to tell you about it, but you seemed busy.

192
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,600
[<i>I want to talk to you about something. Can I come over?</i>]

193
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,935
<i>I need to work.</i>

194
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,175
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:43,349
It's incredible. You're impressive, Hanai.

196
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:50,188
I'll try my best not to ruin your outlook.

197
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:52,358
Riichi...

198
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:56,295
I wish you would have told me by text or by phone.

199
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:06,372
I actually wanted you to be the first to know.

200
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,390
Hanai? What's the matter?

201
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,926
Nothing.

202
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:32,131
If you won't tell me, I'm going to kiss you now.

203
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,902
Are you okay with that? People will see us.

204
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,207
No, well...

205
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:46,079
I actually went to your salon when I found out

206
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,881
about my piece becoming a movie.

207
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,584
I wanted to tell you first.

208
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,589
But then...

209
00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:00,593
Riichi... you were with a woman.

210
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,299
That must have been Nanase.

211
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,135
Nanase?

212
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:14,104
That's when she asked me to do her hair and makeup.

213
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:17,776
What? You mean...?

214
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,547
I'm sorry. You didn't like that, did you?

215
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,187
She's really friendly.

216
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,623
She thinks of me as her older brother or something.

217
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,491
Does she?

218
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,563
Hanai, are you jealous?

219
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:46,939
Do you meet other celebrities besides Nanase?

220
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:53,946
Well, I do meet lots of models.

221
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,588
I don't like that.

222
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,760
Riichi, you are surrounded by cute girls.

223
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:13,766
I'm sorry. You don't want to hear that, right?

224
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,607
Hanai.

225
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,887
Hanai, you are so much cuter.

226
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:19,198
<i>Hey, Sensei, don't you know?</i>

227
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:26,205
<i>A girlfriend being jealous is really adorable.</i>

228
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,278
Riichi, someone will see us.

229
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,315
I don't care. I want to show it off.

230
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,750
No!

231
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,520
No?

232
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,625
You're cute, but no!

233
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,661
Get back to work.

234
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,733
Well, once it's over, I want my reward.

235
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,563
She is your girlfriend, right?

236
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,634
What?

237
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:31,638
That photograph you showed me the other day, that's Hanai Sensei.

238
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,473
<i>What is she like? Do you have a picture of her?</i>

239
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,412
<i>She's not what I imagined Riichi's girlfriend to be.</i>

240
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:46,051
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

241
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,729
Let's see...

242
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:03,469
Considering your role, this lipstick would be better, but...

243
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,838
But...?

244
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:10,470
I think this color suits you better, Nanase.

What? An interview with Nanase for a magazine?

260
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,818
Yes, they would like to do it.

261
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,154
I don't want to. I definitely don't want to!

It's impossible! I can't show my face in a magazine!

You don't have to show your face if you don't want to.

Nanase seems to be your fan; an interview would be interesting.

Do your best to advertise the drama!

When you say "Nanase," do you mean Nanase Hoshino?

272
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:01,079
That's no joke! You're going to be in a magazine?
