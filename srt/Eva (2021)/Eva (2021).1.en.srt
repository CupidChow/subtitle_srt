1
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,020
Could be.

2
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,605
Don’t you think?

3
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,690
Could be.

4
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,339
- Good morning, Mr. Tornillo.
- Good morning.

5
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,941
I’m so excited because
you got here just in time.

6
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:07,086
Everything is ready, everything is set,
especially our models.

7
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,181
Where are your models?

8
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,682
They’re here, and they’re ready.

9
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,096
I’m so excited because our pictures
will surely be trending.

10
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,469
Girls, let’s go.

11
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:18,580
Shall we?

12
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:19,773
Let’s go.

13
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,174
<i>You might forget this.</i>

14
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,451
Goodbye. Take care
of the messenger later.

15
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:47,195
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it.

16
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,869
Just a moment sir,

17
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,395
there’s some dust.

18
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:53,017
Goodbye.

19
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:53,918
Take care, sir.

20
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,717
I know what you’re going to say.

21
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:11,422
Visit me, I’ll serve you pancit canton.

22
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:12,455
You’ll serve noodles?

23
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,203
<i>You’re getting excited again.</i>

24
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,253
Dinah!

25
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:22,031
Am I paying you to gossip?

26
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:24,818
You, wherever you came from,
go back to it.

27
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,821
And you, I told you to do something.

28
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,013
Should I be the one to finish it?

29
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,001
Get inside! What are you
gossiping about?

30
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,752
What are you doing?

31
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,586
It has to be more sexy.

32
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,203
Sexier!

33
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:48,591
More!

34
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,869
<i>We’re selling condoms. Make it sexier!</i>

35
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:51,811
Look here!

36
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,226
<i>You should be sexy!</i>

37
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:57,155
More sexy!

38
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,709
<i>Sexier!</i>

39
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:01,912
<i>More wild!</i>

40
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:05,467
Nice.

41
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,724
<i>Very nice!</i>

42
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,530
Are you okay, Frankie?

43
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:12,248
Yeah, I’m good.

44
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:17,076
We’re selling condoms, not a memorial park,
my goodness.

45
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,404
Okay, change pose.

46
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:26,607
<i>Charlene, Victoria, put Andrew</i>
<i>between the two of you.</i>

47
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,073
<i>Fight over him.</i>

48
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,223
<i> Clash into him.</i>

49
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:32,165
<i>Wilder!</i>

50
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,262
<i>The boss wants more wild!</i>

51
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:35,205
<i>Yes! That’s it!</i>

52
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,307
<i>How can we sell condoms with</i>
<i>lousy marketing?</i>

53
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:38,834
<i>Wilder!</i>

54
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:40,727
<i>There you go!</i>

55
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:42,645
<i>More! More!</i>

56
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,605
There!

57
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,880
I like it!

58
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:47,050
That’s the kind of kiss I like later, okay?

59
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,387
<i>There!</i>

60
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,888
<i>Yes!</i>

61
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:56,517
<i>Wilder!</i>

62
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:58,284
<i>Yes, that’s it!</i>

63
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,480
<i>Do it better!</i>

64
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,248
Shall we do solo shots?

65
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:03,107
Sure.

66
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,943
May I go to the washroom?

67
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,296
It’s okay. I’ll have to adjust the lights.

68
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,281
Sure. We’ll first work with Charlene.

69
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,529
What about you? Don’t you need to go?

70
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,077
Maybe later.

71
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:15,954
Why not now?

72
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,958
Alright. Solo shots, Charlene.

73
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:21,912
Center, please.

74
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:30,660
What was that?

75
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:33,429
Didn’t I tell you, later?
You want to rush things.

76
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:36,432
So, what are you looking at?

77
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:37,892
What’s happening?

78
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:39,185
Back to work!

79
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:25,124
Miss Victoria?

80
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,667
Miss Victoria?

81
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,920
Are you in there?

82
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,172
They need you.

83
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,199
Your shots are up next.

84
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,594
We’re not done yet.

85
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:43,851
Yes?

86
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:47,814
Miss Victoria, I’m sorry.
But they need you now.

87
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,924
It’s alright. Thank you.

88
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:52,193
Have you seen Andrew?

89
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,153
I wonder where he went.

90
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:56,739
Ah, he probably got thirsty.

91
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,493
He could have just asked for some water.

92
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,203
Let’s go.

93
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:47,169
You had an affair with your boss,
and “that’s the way it is?”

94
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:50,130
But that’s how it is, Papa Dax.

95
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,587
I really can’t explain.

96
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:56,130
The affair with my boss just happened.

97
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,404
How could it “just happen”?

98
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:04,137
You tripped, is that it? Lost your wits?

99
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:06,904
Then woke up, and suddenly
you’re with your boss?

100
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:11,397
It’s not that simple. Of course,
not all of a sudden.

101
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,300
You got me confused, sister.

102
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:17,794
You said it just happened,
but not all of a sudden?

103
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,590
What if the wife of your boss finds out?

104
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,408
That will mean the pits for you.

105
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:27,872
That’s precisely my problem, Papa Dax.
If she finds out, she will throw me out.

106
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:32,130
That will be the end of my
relationship with my boss.

107
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:37,440
Why? You think your affair with your boss
is going anywhere?

108
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:41,652
Sister, he has a wife.
You’re a househelp.

109
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,537
Tell me the truth.

110
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,324
Your boss was your first, right?

111
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:49,685
And you found pleasure.

112
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,677
So now you can’t help it.
You’re craving for it.

113
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:58,290
Why? Is he as big as a cucumber?

114
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,498
That’s far too big!
I can't handle that, Papa Dax!

115
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:09,857
Maybe more like— an eggplant.
A big one.

116
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,810
I knew it.

117
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:17,230
You’re craving for it.

118
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:20,341
Put a stop to it. That won’t get anywhere.
He’s your boss!

119
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,118
He surely still treats you
as an employee,

120
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:24,731
maybe even his property.

121
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,394
Ma’am, will you still have dinner?

122
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,004
Shall I reheat the sour stew?

123
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,939
No need. We’ll go up now.

124
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:18,982
We’ll have dinner in the room.

125
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:22,499
You can lock-up now.
Surely, you know how?

126
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:23,909
Yes, Ma’am.

127
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:31,163
Your housemaid?

128
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,979
A new one–

129
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:36,042
I’ve had her for a few days.

130
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,263
From Samar.

131
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:22,755
Let’s finish this.

132
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:25,049
I haven’t even started.

133
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:46,381
Good morning.

134
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,045
Good morning, sir. Will you
have breakfast now?

135
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:58,702
No, thank you.

136
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,920
Not even a cup of coffee?

137
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:02,456
I’m fine.

138
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:03,749
I’m leaving now

139
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:05,876
Okay, sir.

140
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:25,104
Can you open the door?

141
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:27,231
Oh, just a moment.

142
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,579
I’m sorry. I’m new here.

143
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,356
I’m not used to this yet.

144
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:46,792
You’ve also just begun
working as a housema—

145
00:17:48,752 --> 00:17:49,670
—a househelp?

146
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:53,465
No, I’ve worked for others before.

147
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:55,467
You don’t look like a housema—

148
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,303
—a househelp.

149
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:00,890
What should a househelp look like?

150
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:11,692
Oh! The gate.

151
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:14,407
Look, I’m sorry. It’s just—

152
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,018
You seem smart.

153
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,706
Did you earn a degree?

154
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,245
I didn’t finish high school.

155
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:26,831
My father died when I was in Third Year.

156
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,768
We fell into debt.

157
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,995
<i>But this is your first job?</i>

158
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,589
Is it?

159
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:36,979
No.

160
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:40,652
With my first employer, my male boss
made advances.

161
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:43,655
He wouldn’t let me be.

162
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,378
I got so frightened, I quit.

163
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,135
So, what happened to your debts?

164
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,018
Did you pay them back?

165
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:57,948
Not yet. I worked for other employers.

166
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:02,096
Then what happened?
You got courted again?

167
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:07,081
Yes.

168
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:15,096
So, what did you do, give in finally?

169
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,690
You gave in to your boss?

170
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:19,203
Was he handsome?

171
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:20,956
He was kind.

172
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:24,197
If my female employer
would be mad at me,

173
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:26,036
he would console me.

174
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,916
He made me feel better.

175
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:28,936
And then?

176
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:31,768
His wife sent me away.

177
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:36,475
Why? If you weren’t doing anything—

178
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:42,986
Ah, he caught the two of you in the act?

179
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,706
So that’s why you work
for a female boss now?

180
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,175
My mother requested it from the agency.

181
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:59,636
You told your mother what happened
with you and your boss?

182
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,125
Of course, not.

183
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,135
All she knows is that my female employer
wanted to get rid of me.

184
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,401
But my mother still blamed me,
calling me a tease,

185
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,753
of that I gave my boss a reason.

186
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:15,861
Don’t worry.

187
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:17,874
It will be our secret.

188
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:24,616
Have you been with madam for some time?

189
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,231
You mean Victoria?

190
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:33,927
No, we were just introduced
yesterday, at the pictorial.

191
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:39,093
What’s your name?

192
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:40,636
Eva.

193
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,088
It’s Eva.

194
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:44,178
I’m Andrew.

195
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:53,988
Thank you, Eva.

196
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:00,828
You know what Eva,

197
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,774
I’m not really surprised at what
you had to go through.

198
00:21:05,142 --> 00:21:06,575
You’re temptation itself.

199
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,861
Your name alone proves it.

200
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:14,862
It’s probably good that you’re
now working for a woman.

201
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,968
Hey!

202
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,220
Lauro! What are you doing?

203
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:03,097
I made it very clear to you.

204
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,517
I leave early today,
you need to clean the car at once!

205
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:07,853
What were you doing last night
that made you wake up late?

206
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:09,838
Were you masturbating
all through the night?

207
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:11,940
Answer me!

208
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:14,257
- You see…
- What?

209
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,654
What are you saying?
I can’t hear you!

210
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:21,360
I can’t make up my mind whether
you’re deaf or truly inept!

211
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:24,536
Clean the car! Do it quickly or
I’ll be late for my appointment!

212
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:25,562
Yes sir.

213
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:45,641
<i>Eva.</i>

214
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:47,149
Yes ma’am?

215
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:51,401
Ma’am?

216
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:53,557
Come inside.

217
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:01,790
Good morning, Ma’am.

218
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,064
Has Andrew left?

219
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:06,179
Yes, ma’am.

220
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:15,490
Was I too loud last night?

221
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,046
I’m sorry? What was it?

222
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,469
Get used to it. I’m truly a screamer.

223
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,245
- Did you prepare breakfast?
- Yes, ma’am.

224
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,695
- What did you prepare?
- Sausage and egg, ma’am.

225
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:41,540
<i>What did you say?</i>
<i>I can’t hear you.</i>

226
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:48,726
Sausage and egg.

227
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,371
That was what I had for dinner.

228
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:57,230
Shall I bring it up?

229
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:00,486
No need. I’ll come down for it.

230
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:36,643
Ah!

231
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:39,713
Sorry!  I didn’t mean to startle you.

232
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:41,902
I’m Larry.

233
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,564
You won’t find anyone as good-looking
in the whole village.

234
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:49,053
What about you, what’s your name?

235
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:52,957
But your boss calls you Lauro, right?

236
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,792
Don’t call me Lauro. It sounds so old.
Just call me Larry.

237
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:57,055
Just call me Larry.

238
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,485
What's your name?

239
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,636
Eva.

240
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:04,723
You’re new here, right?
I only saw you yesterday.

241
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,369
I’ve just been here for a few days.

242
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:11,021
How’s your employer?

243
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,564
Is she kind?

244
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,415
Seems so.

245
00:25:16,197 --> 00:25:17,459
And yours?

246
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,480
Gets mad easily.

247
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:21,424
His blood often boiling.

248
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:24,076
I noticed.

249
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:26,228
He’ll just keel over one day.

250
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:28,072
He’s a mental case.

251
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,300
Couldn’t find anyone to dump on but me.

252
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:35,438
He is loud.

253
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:39,465
So is your boss, she’s loud too.

254
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,240
Nights mostly. I can hear her
from my room.

255
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:43,935
Really?

256
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:45,509
Yes!

257
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:47,619
I enjoy it really! Just like porn,

258
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,255
but without video.

259
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:52,289
That’s why I know when she has
someone with her in her room.

260
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:55,438
When I start hearing her
grunts and shouts—

261
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,125
What?

262
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,110
Here, I’ll show you.

263
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:02,500
<i>Lauro! </i>

264
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,222
<i>Get yourself here! Lauro!</i>

265
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,680
Yes sir! Coming!

266
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:07,647
Let’s talk again, shall we?

267
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,954
- Lauro!
- On my way!

268
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:49,018
What are you looking for?

269
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,748
Nothing, really.

270
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,413
I’m leaving. Please open the gate.

271
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,741
Yes, ma’am.

272
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:17,048
Don’t wait up for me tonight.

273
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:18,570
I have my keys.

274
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,596
Yes. ma’am.

275
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:23,338
- Please clean my room.
- Ma’am?

276
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,763
I said, clean my room.

277
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:30,083
Even if you find anything to steal there,
you’re not a thief, are you?

278
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,003
- Yes, ma’am...
- Bye.

279
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:32,779
No, ma’am.

280
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:45,509
Vegetables!

281
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:49,177
Eggplants of Mang Kanor!

282
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:54,830
Okra for lubrication.

283
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:00,409
Neneng’s pechay!

284
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:03,288
Eggplants of Mang Kanor!

285
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:09,091
Okra for lubrication. Come and get
your vegetables, every all,

286
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:13,330
because we will have a raffle later on.

287
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:17,734
- Come buy here!
- Hello Manang.

288
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,386
Buy.

289
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:22,062
- Hello!
- Hello.

290
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,339
You’re the new girl
from that house, right?

291
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:26,072
Yes.

292
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:32,097
I’m Desiree. I’m a nanny from
that house with the pink gate.

293
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:35,757
This is Dinah. She’s from
the house next to yours.

294
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:37,077
- Eva.
- Eva.

295
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:38,619
Here’s Adam.

296
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,000
- Dinah!
- Manang.

297
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,460
You haven’t bought anything.
Buy something!

298
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:49,631
Don’t just gawk there.
Have a feel for what you want.

299
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:52,159
I want to see if it’s hard enough.

300
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:54,812
What about you, girl?
Do you like eggplants?

301
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:58,749
There's so much you can do with it.

302
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,836
Manang! You’re lewd!

303
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:08,982
Lewd? But it’s true.

304
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:14,848
You can make omelet with it.
You can grill it…

305
00:29:14,873 --> 00:29:19,895
Grill it, did you hear?
Not flipped.

306
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,776
Don’t listen to them.

307
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:30,989
You might become like them, poor you.

308
00:29:31,014 --> 00:29:33,508
Why, what are we?

309
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:36,439
You have enjoyed your lives.

310
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:39,300
Better that we enjoyed,
rather than soiled.

311
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,875
And the one who isn’t soiled
dares to speak.

312
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:44,568
It’s true, Manang.

313
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:49,829
My boyfriend is a seaman.
We have a long-distance relationship.

314
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:53,904
So you have use for my eggplants after all?

315
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,972
Oh, I don’t go for that.

316
00:29:55,997 --> 00:30:00,210
I’d rather wait til my boyfriend gets back.
Then, one-time, big-time.

317
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:04,606
For your one time-big time,
you go like this.

318
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,084
Stop it!

319
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:11,004
What about you?
You want these, right?

320
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:14,825
Don’t bother asking her.

321
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,012
She’s not barren at all.
She gets watered regularly,

322
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:20,455
though the connection’s illegal.

323
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,483
I hope she’s not found out,

324
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:27,830
or else the tubes will be cut
and the water stops dripping.

325
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:34,302
That’s not true. You’re babbling
about so many things.

326
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:41,768
What about you? Have you decided
what you want to do with my eggplants?

327
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:44,273
<i>Look at my eggplants.</i>

328
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:04,180
<i>Eva!</i>

329
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:05,829
<i>Eva!</i>

330
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:09,641
<i>Eva!</i>

331
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:17,911
Eva!

332
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:19,900
Eva!

333
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,495
Eva!

334
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,347
Why?

335
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,321
What are you doing?

336
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:45,285
What are you doing?
My boss might see you!

337
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,549
Shh!

338
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:08,075
What are you doing?

339
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,487
Go away! Go away now!

340
00:35:12,147 --> 00:35:14,900
I will shout. I will call for help.

341
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,356
Eva?

342
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,501
Come up here. Eva?

343
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,596
Coming!

344
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,976
Did you prepare breakfast?

345
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:38,077
Yes, ma’am.

346
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:41,479
Prepare for two. Bring them up.

347
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,248
Yes, ma’am.

348
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,127
Come here. I’m having
breakfast brought up.

349
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:48,554
Don’t bother.

350
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:22,573
Did you really clean the car?

351
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:23,891
How come the tires are still dirty?

352
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:25,125
You’re really good-for-nothing!

353
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,617
I don’t know why I still keep you!

354
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,435
You are useless!

355
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:51,278
Eva, I’ve been calling for you.

356
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:54,480
Ma’am, sorry, I didn’t hear.

357
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:58,217
When I call you, answer and come at once.
Is that clear?

358
00:40:58,484 --> 00:40:59,446
Yes, ma’am.

359
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:02,224
Bring up some water.
We’ve run out of it upstairs.

360
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:34,337
Do you still need anything?

361
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:36,531
None for now.

362
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,054
Eva!

363
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,702
Eva!

364
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:06,702
What are you doing here again?

365
00:42:07,202 --> 00:42:08,996
I’d like to say sorry.

366
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:11,457
For what? For last night?

367
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:15,044
I got carried away with…

368
00:42:15,628 --> 00:42:17,713
you know. You liked it too, didn’t you?

369
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:19,715
Wait a minute, Lauro.

370
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,491
Larry…

371
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:21,551
Lauro.

372
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:24,997
First, there’s nothing between us.

373
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:28,867
I don’t even know why I let you do
what you did last night.

374
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:34,409
It’s simply because you can’t help yourself
because you met a good-looking guy like me.

375
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,114
If you repeat what you did,

376
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,712
I’ll tell my boss about it,
maybe even your boss.

377
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:43,364
Wait, easy.

378
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:45,479
I have no evil plans.

379
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:47,492
It’s the fault of your boss.

380
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,525
And yours too—

381
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:52,251
because you’re too pretty.

382
00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:55,644
I got carried away.
I'm sorry.

383
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:04,093
Eva!

384
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:06,112
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Go now!

385
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:07,930
- See me again tonight.
- I told you to leave!

386
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:09,765
Please, tonight.

387
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:12,351
Fine! Just leave.

388
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,941
Eva, where the hell are you?

389
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:23,563
I went to open the gate because
I know you’re leaving.

390
00:43:30,593 --> 00:43:31,594
Let’s go.

391
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:48,738
<i>In Kuwait, Filipina overseas worker
Nadia Ismail</i>

392
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:50,848
<i>has been charged with murder</i>
<i>for killing her employer. </i>

393
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,100
<i>In her sworn statement,</i>

394
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:55,228
<i>Nadia accused her employer of raping her</i>

395
00:43:55,253 --> 00:43:58,881
<i>one day that her employer’s wife</i>
<i>and their children were away.</i>

396
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,607
<i>After the alleged incident, </i>

397
00:44:00,632 --> 00:44:04,826
<i>Nadia stabbed her employer,</i>
<i>a Kuwaiti national, several times.</i>

398
00:44:05,002 --> 00:44:05,837
Eva!

399
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:07,075
Eva!

400
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:08,724
Eva!

401
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:11,782
Your boss isn’t here yet?

402
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:12,740
No.

403
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:14,610
What did you want to say?

404
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:17,250
Come on. Don’t be in a rush.

405
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:18,613
Let’s talk.

406
00:44:19,248 --> 00:44:21,917
Madam might come. Come on.

407
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:23,444
Why did you call me?

408
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,974
As you know, about last night…

409
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:29,220
You’re apologizing for what you did.

410
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:33,504
Because, you see,
you weren’t ready yet.

411
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:35,365
Ready for what?

412
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,689
You know…

413
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:39,730
that we become “us”!

414
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,208
How can we become “us”?

415
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:46,416
Come on, don’t make it hard for me.

416
00:44:46,575 --> 00:44:48,994
You know I like you.

417
00:44:49,614 --> 00:44:53,618
And I hope you like me too.

418
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:58,330
Even if I like to,

419
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:01,648
did you even bother asking
if it is you I want?

420
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:03,410
No need to ask that,

421
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:06,146
it’s clear you have
a thing for me too.

422
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,126
Lauro,

423
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:10,732
can’t you be bothered to ask me, please?

424
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,890
I will answer you truthfully.

425
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:19,228
But don’t assume that you can simply get
or use anyone anytime you want to.

426
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:23,180
All right.

427
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:30,343
Eva, Eva, I really like you.

428
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,891
And then?

429
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:34,266
That’s it. I like you.

430
00:45:34,854 --> 00:45:36,054
Do you like me, too?

431
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:38,724
Yes.

432
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:41,626
What? You like me, too?

433
00:45:42,134 --> 00:45:44,303
Then why did we have to go
through all the motions.

434
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:49,526
Even if I like you, I don’t want to be
forced to do so.

435
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,435
Of course not! I’m not forcing you.

436
00:45:53,442 --> 00:45:56,862
If you really like me, then “wow”!

437
00:45:57,273 --> 00:46:00,652
So, we’re together now.
We’re “us” now.

438
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,693
Maybe.

439
00:46:03,356 --> 00:46:04,899
And if we’re “us” now,

440
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:07,693
may I—

441
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,838
may I kiss you?

442
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:13,349
See, I’m asking for your permission.

443
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,087
What? You’re too much in a rush.

444
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:19,168
It was you who was rushing earlier.

445
00:46:23,123 --> 00:46:24,126
Madam is here.

446
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:25,432
You have to leave.

447
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,363
I’ll court you. Say yes at once.

448
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:29,209
Go!

449
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:35,428
- Ma’am!
- What was that?

450
00:46:36,117 --> 00:46:38,745
Nothing, ma’am. I thought
there was something…

451
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:42,566
You may go to bed after
locking up the doors.

452
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,134
Yes, ma’am.

453
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:05,261
Good morning.

454
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:07,218
Good morning, ma’am.

455
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:19,359
You broke the yolk.

456
00:47:19,384 --> 00:47:23,445
Yes. Would you like me to
cook another one?

457
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,010
No need. That will be fine.

458
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,327
I will leave again today.

459
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:39,662
Don’t bother waiting up for me tonight.

460
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:45,206
Yes, ma’am.

461
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:04,236
Why are you here again?

462
00:49:04,813 --> 00:49:06,022
To court you.

463
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,901
Your boss isn’t here, right?
I saw her leave earlier.

464
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:12,661
What are those?

465
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,859
Flowers.

466
00:49:15,672 --> 00:49:16,423
What for?

467
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,972
Come on! They’re for you.

468
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:21,676
And from where did you get these?

469
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:25,182
Come on, you shouldn’t be
asking those questions.

470
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,355
You said you would court me.

471
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,409
Go ahead.

472
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:35,561
You’re rushing again.

473
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,476
You like me.

474
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,009
Yes.

475
00:49:39,423 --> 00:49:40,716
And then,

476
00:49:40,741 --> 00:49:41,617
why?

477
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:43,009
What did you mean why?

478
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:46,589
What did you like about me?

479
00:49:47,313 --> 00:49:48,939
What did I like about you?

480
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:49,802
What else?

481
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:50,691
You.

482
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:51,978
Just you.

483
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,576
What else?

484
00:49:54,601 --> 00:49:56,228
What do you mean?

485
00:49:57,034 --> 00:49:58,774
What do you
want to happen now?

486
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:00,926
Hopefully, you like me too.

487
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:02,036
Because I like you.

488
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,020
I hope you would
also like what I like.

489
00:50:04,394 --> 00:50:05,854
What is it that you want?

490
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:06,755
I want...

491
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,785
to become closer to you!

492
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:13,105
Like the other night?

493
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:15,585
Well, yes.

494
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:19,372
You went ahead with what you wanted
without even asking me first.

495
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:23,151
Ask you? “Eva, may I kiss you?”
That’s what you mean?

496
00:50:23,406 --> 00:50:25,158
You should’ve asked first.

497
00:50:25,183 --> 00:50:27,352
Ask how? If I had asked first,

498
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:29,371
would you have said yes?

499
00:50:29,747 --> 00:50:30,664
Yes.

500
00:50:30,853 --> 00:50:34,481
If I had asked, “May I kiss you”

501
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,745
you would’ve agreed?

502
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,479
Yes.

503
00:50:38,942 --> 00:50:39,818
Eva,

504
00:50:44,068 --> 00:50:45,986
may I kiss you?

505
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:47,266
Yes.

506
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:23,150
Madam’s here.

507
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:24,176
Wait.

508
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:26,269
Hurry up.

509
00:51:26,294 --> 00:51:28,322
- Wait!
- We might get caught.

510
00:51:28,347 --> 00:51:30,666
- Hurry up!
- Wait!

511
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,768
Please wait.

512
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:04,724
Wait.

513
00:53:05,273 --> 00:53:06,441
Not here.

514
00:54:09,886 --> 00:54:12,038
Lauro, what are you doing!?

515
00:55:11,259 --> 00:55:12,761
I’ll see you tomorrow.

516
01:03:23,126 --> 01:03:25,128
Eva?

517
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:27,306
Eva?

518
01:04:38,406 --> 01:04:40,522
What are you doing in my room?

519
01:04:40,903 --> 01:04:44,233
Who said you could
use my bathroom?

520
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,841
Your clothes are wet.
You better change.

521
01:04:50,866 --> 01:04:52,201
Wear these.

522
01:05:29,995 --> 01:05:31,162
Looks good on you.

523
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:50,179
Did you sleep soundly last night?

524
01:05:52,408 --> 01:05:56,412
I was calling for you this morning
but you had no reply.

525
01:05:59,509 --> 01:06:01,886
Is there something I should know?

526
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:07,634
I like someone who resists.

527
01:06:08,027 --> 01:06:10,071
I get more excited.

528
01:08:02,272 --> 01:08:03,481
Lauro!

529
01:08:04,172 --> 01:08:05,843
- Lauro!
- What?

530
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:07,553
My boss is here.
He might hear you.

531
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:09,705
- I’d be done for.
- Listen carefully.

532
01:08:09,802 --> 01:08:12,638
You will come to my room tonight.

533
01:08:12,663 --> 01:08:14,456
I will be waiting.
Do you understand?

534
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,799
If you don’t show up,

535
01:08:16,824 --> 01:08:19,327
I will tell on you to my boss
and to your boss.

536
01:08:19,377 --> 01:08:22,213
I will tell them you forced
yourself into my room last night.

537
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:24,404
I’ll show them the gashes on my hands

538
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:26,621
and marks on my body.

539
01:08:26,646 --> 01:08:29,524
I will tell them you broke into my room.

540
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:32,136
Maybe to steal.

541
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:34,288
You will surely be
arrested and imprisoned.

542
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:36,866
It won’t only be invectives from your boss
that you’ll have to bear.

543
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:39,380
He might even beat you up.

544
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,628
But you will surely lose your job.

545
01:08:43,597 --> 01:08:47,241
I will be waiting for you. Tonight.

546
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,998
- Hurry up!
- No, please!

547
01:08:59,022 --> 01:09:00,815
Get out of my house!

548
01:09:01,025 --> 01:09:03,569
You ingrate!

549
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:07,905
I treated you well, yet you have the nerve
to destroy my family!

550
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:11,451
Don’t make me leave.
This is the only job I know.

551
01:09:11,476 --> 01:09:13,302
You pretend to be all nice?

552
01:09:13,327 --> 01:09:16,706
You slut!

553
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:17,765
What?

554
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:20,143
Stop that. You’re creating a scandal.

555
01:09:20,168 --> 01:09:21,627
A scandal?

556
01:09:21,652 --> 01:09:25,907
What about what you did with this woman?
Isn’t that a scandal?

557
01:09:25,965 --> 01:09:28,509
Have some shame.
People are watching.

558
01:09:28,534 --> 01:09:29,702
Now you’re ashamed?

559
01:09:29,998 --> 01:09:31,457
Wait here.

560
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:34,323
Enough, please. Enough.

561
01:09:34,348 --> 01:09:35,867
Were you hurt?

562
01:09:35,892 --> 01:09:40,104
I turned my back for a moment
and you’re at it again?

563
01:09:40,129 --> 01:09:44,317
Hey, you listen to me!

564
01:09:44,342 --> 01:09:45,501
Enough.

565
01:09:45,526 --> 01:09:47,028
Let go of me!

566
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:50,882
The moment I see your face again,
I might kill you.

567
01:09:50,907 --> 01:09:53,076
I don’t want to see you ever again.

568
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:57,555
Why do you have your hands on her?

569
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:58,956
Leave!

570
01:10:02,418 --> 01:10:04,003
Get away from here!

571
01:10:20,056 --> 01:10:21,182
Eva!

572
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:30,367
Here I am.
What is it you want?

573
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,191
I want you to answer my questions.

574
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:41,739
What do you think I am?

575
01:10:41,764 --> 01:10:43,307
What am I to you?

576
01:10:49,273 --> 01:10:53,068
Do you see me as a woman to marry
or someone to get off on?

577
01:10:53,886 --> 01:10:56,430
Didn’t I tell you I like you?

578
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:59,454
And don’t you like me, too?

579
01:10:59,524 --> 01:11:02,277
If I get pregnant,
will you take responsibility?

580
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:07,652
Admit it, Lauro.

581
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:10,256
Did you enjoy doing me?

582
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:12,079
Yes, of course.

583
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,654
I didn’t.

584
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:17,555
I was hurt with what you did.

585
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,581
Why?

586
01:11:19,038 --> 01:11:20,206
What is it that you want?

587
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:24,743
If you want a relationship
based on lust,

588
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:27,664
I’ll do it.

589
01:11:28,092 --> 01:11:29,843
I can accept that.

590
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:32,704
But you can’t be the only one
who gets pleasure.

591
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:37,054
It’s not fair for you to be
the only one who’s satisfied.

592
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:42,674
It can’t be that we’d do it
only when you feel like it.

593
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,380
Just like now.

594
01:11:46,772 --> 01:11:49,108
I want you to please me.

595
01:11:49,812 --> 01:11:52,648
I want to feel that you love me.

596
01:11:53,487 --> 01:11:55,698
I want to see that...

597
01:11:55,948 --> 01:11:58,367
I’m important to you.

598
01:12:00,411 --> 01:12:02,580
Is that all? Then let’s do it.

599
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:03,814
Wait.

600
01:12:04,999 --> 01:12:07,293
Take your clothes off but stay there.

601
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:09,284
Are you serious?

602
01:12:15,588 --> 01:12:17,048
Lie down.

603
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,551
I said lie down.

604
01:12:45,478 --> 01:12:46,707
Don’t rush.

605
01:12:47,673 --> 01:12:49,191
Wait for me.

606
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:52,586
Eva?

607
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,458
Eva?

608
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:58,003
I’m busy.

609
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:06,998
Eva, I’ve been calling you.

610
01:15:07,563 --> 01:15:09,440
I’m still busy.

611
01:15:09,465 --> 01:15:12,802
Eva, when I call for you,
whatever else you’re doing, stop it.

612
01:15:13,194 --> 01:15:16,614
Come here, come with me to my room.

613
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:44,507
Come sit by my side.

614
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:48,532
Why?

615
01:15:49,113 --> 01:15:51,032
Why don’t you want to come here?

616
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:52,697
Come here beside me.

617
01:15:53,483 --> 01:15:55,193
Are you going to tell me to do something?

618
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,858
Come closer and you’ll find out.

619
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:00,704
- Is that an order?
- Yes.

620
01:16:00,975 --> 01:16:04,354
I’m your boss,
so I’m giving you an order.

621
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:09,024
If you want me to do anything
related to my job,

622
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:12,708
I have no right to refuse
or complain.

623
01:16:12,794 --> 01:16:14,337
I’m glad that you know it.

624
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:18,408
But if what you want is a repeat
of what happened between us yesterday,

625
01:16:18,685 --> 01:16:20,896
there’s something
we need to make clear

626
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:22,688
What is it?

627
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:26,064
My body is mine.

628
01:16:27,532 --> 01:16:30,618
I am the only one who can decide
what I want to do with my body.

629
01:16:30,813 --> 01:16:32,315
No one else.

630
01:16:32,933 --> 01:16:35,227
If something were to happen
between us,

631
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:37,897
it is because I want it, too.

632
01:16:38,044 --> 01:16:41,297
not simply because I am
complying with your order.

633
01:16:41,715 --> 01:16:43,467
I like you.

634
01:16:44,512 --> 01:16:46,848
I want to be with you.

635
01:16:47,085 --> 01:16:50,755
I hope that is also something you want.

636
01:19:05,794 --> 01:19:09,507
Next time, if you want me
to be in bed with you,

637
01:19:10,424 --> 01:19:12,801
you will have to
come to my room.

638
01:19:14,535 --> 01:19:18,956
And if you were the
one who wanted it?

639
01:19:19,516 --> 01:19:21,118
I will tell you.

640
01:19:21,627 --> 01:19:24,352
I will be the one
to come to your room.

641
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:33,952
I have an idea.

642
01:19:34,657 --> 01:19:35,658
What is it?

643
01:19:40,422 --> 01:19:42,925
I’m not sure whether you’ll like it.

644
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,478
Say it.

645
01:20:00,992 --> 01:20:01,952
Where are we going?

646
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:04,146
Trust me, I’ll take care of you.

647
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:10,585
What are we going to do?

648
01:20:12,364 --> 01:20:13,949
Your boss might catch us.

649
01:20:14,113 --> 01:20:15,614
That won’t happen.

650
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,761
What is it?

651
01:20:49,397 --> 01:20:50,482
Come in.

652
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:59,042
Stay there.

653
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:03,846
Whatever happens now,
it will be because that is what we want.

654
01:22:15,103 --> 01:22:16,522
Wait, wait.

655
01:22:22,212 --> 01:22:23,296
Why?

656
01:22:24,912 --> 01:22:26,205
Don’t you like it?

657
01:22:27,015 --> 01:22:31,517
Isn’t it every man’s fantasy to
have a threesome with two women?

658
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:34,455
Eva,

659
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,162
believe it or not

660
01:22:39,207 --> 01:22:40,500
I love you, Eva.

661
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:42,742
I want you for myself.

662
01:22:43,283 --> 01:22:45,264
And I hope you want me, too.
Just for yourself.

663
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:48,177
Not just

664
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:50,581
sharing me between yourselves.

665
01:22:53,549 --> 01:22:54,439
Lauro!

666
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:56,859
Is he stupid?

667
01:22:56,906 --> 01:23:00,056
He’s being given a blessing,
yet he turns his back to it.

668
01:23:01,548 --> 01:23:03,466
He might have a point.

669
01:23:04,389 --> 01:23:05,474
What?

670
01:23:08,272 --> 01:23:10,316
I thought you were smart.

671
01:23:12,478 --> 01:23:14,522
I didn’t realize you’re just as stupid.

672
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:17,682
He wasn’t talking about being smart.

673
01:23:18,984 --> 01:23:20,152
Then what?

674
01:23:21,085 --> 01:23:22,086
Lust?

675
01:23:22,754 --> 01:23:23,755
Heart?

676
01:23:24,456 --> 01:23:25,457
Love?

677
01:23:28,398 --> 01:23:31,939
Don’t tell me you’re actually
in love with that idiot?

678
01:23:45,483 --> 01:23:46,643
Remember...

679
01:23:47,463 --> 01:23:50,007
We had a deal.

680
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:04,833
Lauro!

681
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:07,986
Lauro!

682
01:24:08,876 --> 01:24:10,002
Lauro!

683
01:24:12,101 --> 01:24:13,227
Larry!

684
01:24:14,821 --> 01:24:15,530
Why?

685
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:18,252
I don’t know, but...

686
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:20,312
What?

687
01:24:21,195 --> 01:24:22,321
Did she force you?

688
01:24:22,705 --> 01:24:23,831
Or did you want it, too?

689
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:29,620
Or are you confused with what
you really wnat for yourself?

690
01:24:31,444 --> 01:24:32,570
What do you need to do?

691
01:24:33,232 --> 01:24:34,358
That your boss told you?

692
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:43,115
It’s alright.

693
01:24:43,775 --> 01:24:44,901
I understand.

694
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,916
If you don’t please your boss,

695
01:24:49,082 --> 01:24:50,709
you’ll be out of a job.

696
01:24:55,025 --> 01:24:56,652
You know what’s funny?

697
01:25:03,153 --> 01:25:04,780
I may actually be in love with you.

698
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:47,291
Junjun!

699
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,879
Where did that boy go?

700
01:25:50,904 --> 01:25:53,732
The latest on the case of Nadia Ismail

701
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:58,345
a Filipina overseas worker
charged with killing her employer

702
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,539
who allegedly raped her.

703
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:04,312
The spokesperson of the
Philippine Embassy in Kuwait

704
01:26:04,337 --> 01:26:08,508
announced that they are doing everything
to prove Nadia acted in self-defense

705
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:14,882
against the transgressions of her employer.

706
01:26:14,907 --> 01:26:18,122
We will continue to follow
this case later tonight.

707
01:26:18,147 --> 01:26:19,982
Why did you let him go?

708
01:26:22,056 --> 01:26:27,299
I’m sorry, Ma’am. I tried to hold on,
but he broke free.

709
01:26:27,324 --> 01:26:29,588
Wait, Junjun is right there.

710
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:33,225
He’s playing, making sandcastles.

711
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:37,752
Mommy’s coming!

712
01:26:40,232 --> 01:26:41,525
Don’t follow her.

713
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:47,268
Order drinks for us.
Get water for Junjun.

714
01:26:49,098 --> 01:26:50,724
Order something for yourself.

715
01:26:51,963 --> 01:26:53,487
Thank you, sir.

716
01:26:53,738 --> 01:26:54,989
Pay with this.

717
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:56,895
As for the change,

718
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:58,730
keep it.

719
01:27:00,067 --> 01:27:01,026
Thank you.

720
01:27:03,693 --> 01:27:05,142
Sir,

721
01:27:05,948 --> 01:27:07,783
One orange juice, please.

722
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,426
You know what?

723
01:27:15,236 --> 01:27:19,010
You’re in a difficult situation
but I understand what you’re going through.

724
01:27:20,067 --> 01:27:23,528
Your male employer is kinder to you
than the female.

725
01:27:23,553 --> 01:27:24,972
Because of it,

726
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:27,549
you’re closer to him than to her.

727
01:27:28,672 --> 01:27:30,857
I don’t really know,
and neither do you

728
01:27:30,882 --> 01:27:32,968
if he’s really just kind to you

729
01:27:33,209 --> 01:27:35,253
or he wants you for something else.

730
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:39,346
If his intentions are good or bad,

731
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:41,061
we can’t really know.

732
01:27:43,266 --> 01:27:44,791
But whatever it is,

733
01:27:45,075 --> 01:27:48,380
I’m sure it will turn out badly for you.

734
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:53,502
It might not even be true,
with no basis in fact

735
01:27:53,837 --> 01:27:56,715
the wife will likely
become jealous of you.

736
01:27:57,534 --> 01:28:00,635
Or the husband might really
take an interest in you.

737
01:28:01,219 --> 01:28:02,471
He will soothe you,

738
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,171
be very nice to you

739
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:06,947
even give you gifts.

740
01:28:07,705 --> 01:28:09,164
But in the end,

741
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,328
it will still not be good for you.

742
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:13,332
Because

743
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:15,057
he is married.

744
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,319
And no matter how you look at it,

745
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,819
he’s there at the top,
and you’re at the bottom.

746
01:28:24,102 --> 01:28:25,604
We’re at the bottom.

747
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:28,978
If you can’t find a way to the top,

748
01:28:29,858 --> 01:28:32,338
I advise you to leave.

749
01:28:32,696 --> 01:28:34,197
Get away from them.

750
01:28:34,802 --> 01:28:36,262
Leave them.

751
01:28:37,005 --> 01:28:40,298
Find a new employer or a new job.

752
01:28:47,034 --> 01:28:48,994
Please charge this to Cottage One.

753
01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:56,864
Believe me. I know.

754
01:28:57,646 --> 01:28:58,813
You can do it.

755
01:29:16,425 --> 01:29:18,060
Thank you. What did you
get for yourself?

756
01:29:18,085 --> 01:29:20,003
Nothing. I didn’t want anything.

757
01:29:29,855 --> 01:29:31,774
What do you think?

758
01:29:32,154 --> 01:29:33,247
Could be.

759
01:29:47,477 --> 01:29:48,697
Could be, too.

760
01:29:50,169 --> 01:29:53,817
So, you’re sure of your decision?

761
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:58,829
Don’t worry. I won’t take it against you.

762
01:29:58,854 --> 01:30:00,314
I understand.

763
01:30:05,462 --> 01:30:07,380
I told your boyfriend

764
01:30:08,013 --> 01:30:10,744
to ask permission from his boss.

765
01:30:11,345 --> 01:30:14,017
Say he has a family emergency.

766
01:30:14,818 --> 01:30:17,723
Maybe his boss was in a good mood
because he followed you here.

767
01:30:18,615 --> 01:30:21,868
It was more difficult for me convince him
that you love him, too.

768
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,783
Did you know we only communicate
over the fence?

769
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,853
I was afraid you’d catch us.

770
01:30:32,829 --> 01:30:36,583
I’ll leave the two of you together
and you can take the rest of the day off.

771
01:30:37,376 --> 01:30:41,129
Don’t wait up for me or look for me.
