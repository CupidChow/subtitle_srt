1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,270
Continuing from where we left off.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,590
Last time we talked about,

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,510
Huang Yi-suo's tragic death and how Wang Mei-ren fainted from fear.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,470
Gu Ying gave chase to the back of the stage,

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,190
but fell unconscious as well.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,350
Gu Ying woke up in Dragon King Temple,

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,070
and remembered that a fat, bald man

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,390
threw some sort of fragrant powder at her, then she lost consciousness.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,430
Guo De-you dressed up as a funeral usher to sneak into the House of Huang,

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,390
and found out that Hung Yi-suo was a lover of women and wine.

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,270
He ran into Ding Mao and Gu Ying while investigating.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,950
The three of them wanted to investigate further,

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,990
but was stopped by Huang Yi-suo's mother.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,950
Huang Yi-suo's younger brother Huang Yu,

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,430
published in the newspaper that he was challenging the culprit of his brother's death to a duel.

17
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,950
All evidence points to,

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,430
the culprit being Wu-Laoxian,

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,070
who was expelled from the House of Huang years earlier for being a disloyal disciple.

20
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,470
They found out where Wu Lao-xian lived,

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,030
and planned to go there to capture him.

22
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,710
At that time, Huang Yi-suo's brother Huang Yu disappeared mysteriously.

23
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,750
It came to light that

24
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,150
this was all planned by Wu Lao-xian.

25
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,270
Detective Ding ran into an old acquaintance.

26
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,310
And Qi Mou suddenly appeared.

27
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,670
What is it?

28
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,790
Are you men all like that?

29
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,030
Like what?

30
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,390
Are those flowers beautiful?

31
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,830
Yes, they are.

32
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,310
They are as ostentatious as that actress!

33
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,910
I can smell them standing outside.

34
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,230
I can tell with one glance that they are bad news.

35
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,230
Go find him quickly.

36
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,550
Who are you?

37
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,790
What are you doing up there?

38
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,990
Get down from there.

39
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,750
You come up.

40
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,870
You come down.

41
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,830
You come up.

42
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,590
Fine. I will come up.

43
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,830
You, stop right there!

44
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,390
Stop!

45
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,990
You, stop right there!

46
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,270
Wu Lao-xian!

47
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:43,950
Stop right there!

48
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,790
What is going on?

49
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,310
If I hadn't held on to you,

50
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,110
you would have already jumped into the river.

51
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,590
Brother Guo-er would have had to save you again.

52
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,430
I was chasing Wu Lao-xian just now,

53
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,430
I was running for a long time.

54
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,270
You were never far away from that hut.

55
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,070
We were under Wu Lao-xian's spell.

56
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,190
Spell?

57
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,430
No wonder I was reminded of that actress,

58
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,550
when i saw those flowers.

59
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,190
The problem is with those flowers.

60
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,950
The smell is similar to when I smelled them at Juhua Grand Hotel.

61
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,750
What did you just throw on me?

62
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,070
Last time when Huang Yi-suo died,

63
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,630
he was under the same spell as me.

64
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,790
Afterwards my mom concocted this powder,

65
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,030
to break the spell.

66
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,750
These little tricks can't fool me.

67
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,150
What do we do now?

68
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,230
Let's split up and look for him.

69
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,030
I will check along the river, you search along the road.

70
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,750
We can outflank him.

71
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,790
Hey, kid!

72
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,230
Why are you here all alone?

73
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,430
Where are your parents?

74
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,030
Young Master, long time no see.

75
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,510
Uncle Hu?

76
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,510
What are you doing here?

77
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,550
Shouldn't you be in that jail?

78
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,350
In Tianjin,

79
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,790
there is no place that can keep me imprisoned.

80
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,590
Back in the days, your father, Old Guo, and I

81
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,310
wiped out the Demonic Cult together.

82
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,030
We did not expect that the Demonic Cult would not stay dead,

83
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,790
and is even showing signs of recovery now.

84
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,230
We had no choice but to do this.

85
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,510
With the goal of eradicating,

86
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,549
the remaining members of the Demonic Cult.

87
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,429
What about him?

88
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,590
He was also a member of the Demonic Cult?

89
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,950
Exactly.

90
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,030
You wanted to eradicate the Demonic Cult,

91
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,510
as revenge for your father.

92
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,750
Kill him.

93
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,150
Wait, what?

94
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,310
Kill him.

95
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,310
Impossible...

96
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,510
Don't you recognize me?

97
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,830
It... it must be a spell.

98
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,870
Don't try to fool me.

99
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,310
Come touch me and find out for yourself.

100
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,470
Trust me. These are all the tricks of the Demonic Cult.

101
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,270
Kill him.

102
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,230
Brother Guo-er?

103
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,550
See.

104
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,390
You do recognize me.

105
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,990
That person is dead.

106
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,470
What?

107
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,550
The human trafficker.

108
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,870
To save you, I killed him.

109
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,630
So, you owe me your life.

110
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,590
I regret it. I regret giving my life to you.

111
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,350
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

112
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,310
Give me back what is mine.

113
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,110
What are you trying to do, Brother Guo-er?

114
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,310
Now, I will take back your life.

115
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,590
Brother Guo-er.

116
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,990
Give me back your life.

117
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,350
Kill him.

118
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,470
And all these illusion will disappear.

119
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,110
Kill him. Kill him.

120
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,350
Kill him.

121
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,870
Trust me.

122
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,390
Kill him. Kill him.

123
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,270
Brother Guo-er, my life was saved by you.

124
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,750
How can you bear to kill me?

125
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,790
Brother Guo-er.

126
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,990
Master.

127
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,510
Look.

128
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,070
Look at what you have done to Tianjin.

129
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,150
Where have you been all these days?

130
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,990
If I didn't return, you would have created enough trouble to shake the heavens.

131
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,590
Master, we must investigate this case.

132
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,110
We can't just leave them be.

133
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,870
You have disrespected and disobeyed your Master and your clan.

134
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,190
How are you worthy of the title of Tientsin Mystic?

135
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,190
If I am not worthy,

136
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,510
are you?

137
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,430
You!

138
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,590
How dare you talk back to me?

139
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,990
Kneel.

140
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,030
I only kneel for my Master.

141
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,150
What are you saying?

142
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,430
You are not my Master.

143
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,550
You would dare to not recognize your Master?

144
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,350
My Master would never smoke in front of me.

145
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,790
Impressive, you do recognize your Master.

146
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,710
Of course.

147
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,750
How can these little tricks fool me?

148
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,830
Little tricks?

149
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,430
Do you know where you fell for them?

150
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,150
Do you know how you fell for these tricks?

151
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,470
Master, you can stop beating around the brush.

152
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,790
You are still amidst the tricks.

153
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,590
What should I do, Master?

154
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,510
Please help me.

155
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,990
You want me to help  you?

156
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,350
Of course.

157
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,990
What are you doing, Master?

158
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,590
Looks like you're deep amidst the tricks.

159
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,670
What's wrong with you both?

160
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,230
Answer me! Are you deaf?

161
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,990
Why are you so dumb?

162
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,270
Why don't you ever listen to me?

163
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,190
How can you still not know

164
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,870
how I feel deep down in my heart?

165
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,950
I don't want to involve

166
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,910
or trouble you,

167
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,430
but you rush forward

168
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,070
and insist on being a part of it.

169
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,390
So silly of you!

170
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,590
I am to blame as well.

171
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,830
It's my fault for not listening to my Master.

172
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,830
I insisted on getting myself involved.

173
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,790
I insisted on minding the wretched business of the Caoyun Chamber of Commerce.

174
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,750
You think you are the only one who can hold your breath?

175
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,950
No matter how smart you are,

176
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,990
you can't outsmart me!

177
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,470
Brother Guo-er, you are no exception.

178
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,710
You think that's funny?

179
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,150
Are you guys serious?

180
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,590
Actually... in the beginning,

181
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,829
I didn't agree to her prank.

182
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,349
But to be frank, it is pretty funny.

183
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,630
Brother Guo-er, did you mean what you said just now?

184
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,150
What are you guys doing here?

185
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,670
To catch the suspect, of course.

186
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,550
Did you catch him?

187
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,349
We lost him.

188
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,190
Ding Mao! Wake up!

189
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,430
Ding Mao!

190
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,390
Wake up!

191
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,990
Wake up!

192
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,150
You have to wake up!

193
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,990
Even I woke up, why haven't you?

194
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,230
Wake up! Wake up!

195
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,710
We both took

196
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,230
the powder made by my mom,

197
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,510
so why couldn't we break the spell?

198
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,190
I didn't feel like

199
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,230
I was in an illusion at all.

200
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,710
Even my sense of touch felt real.

201
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,470
How did you two fall under the spell?

202
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,390
Those flowers!

203
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,470
Thornapple, sage,

204
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,430
and many other types of fungus

205
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,790
can all cause hallucinations.

206
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,230
In the Amazon Basin,

207
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,990
there are some tree frogs...

208
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,830
In the Mediterranean,

209
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,670
there is a type of fish called the sarpa salpa...

210
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,670
All of these can induce hallucinations

211
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,750
in humans for several days.

212
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,630
But these only work

213
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,630
when ingested.

214
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,150
We only smelled

215
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,030
the flowers planted by Wu Lao-xian.

216
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,870
How could it have such a strong effect?

217
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,750
If the effect is as strong as you say,

218
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,190
how did you guys break the spell?

219
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,950
Thanks to me of course!

220
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,990
Of course... it is all because of her

221
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,270
that my foot is like this.

222
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,350
What are you guys talking about?

223
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,830
I injured my foot by accident when I was under the spell.

224
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,350
It was bleeding so much,

225
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,830
but my consciousness slowly recovered.

226
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,190
I concluded that

227
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,030
my injury must have helped to break the spell.

228
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,670
So you decided to

229
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,150
inflict me with the same injury?

230
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,670
Well, did you wake up?

231
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,550
All I am concerned with is whether you woke up or not.

232
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,070
I woke up because of the pain!

233
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,150
The pain stimulated my nerves,

234
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,230
and that's how I woke up.

235
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,190
Pain?

236
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,230
In the illusion, Brother Guo-er kept trying to strangle me.

237
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,310
I was also in pain.

238
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,590
How come I didn't wake up?

239
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
It's the blood.

240
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,190
Yes, it's because of the bleeding.

241
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,070
We broke free from the illusion

242
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,870
after we bled.

243
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,990
Is anyone there?

244
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,350
Let's go.

245
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,830
He was trying to kill me.

246
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,270
Don't move! It's the police.

247
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,910
Yu-er!

248
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,790
Be careful, Mrs. Huang.

249
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,070
Are you hurt?

250
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,390
You guys again.

251
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,950
This is Wu Lao-xian?

252
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,910
Yes.

253
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,430
How come he's dead?

254
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,590
I killed him.

255
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,030
Young Master Huang, be careful of your words.

256
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,310
He kidnapped me from my home while I was asleep

257
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,870
and brought me here.

258
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,910
Everyone knows that the House of Huang is famous for our

259
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,350
knot-tying and untying skills.

260
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,310
He is just a disciple.

261
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,030
How can he keep me tied up?

262
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,750
So, I took the chance and...

263
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,270
Yu-er, don't worry about it.

264
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,190
A bastard like him deserved it.

265
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,630
Now that this matter is concluded,

266
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,910
I will take my son back home.

267
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,670
After his health has recovered,

268
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,750
we will come to officially give our thanks.

269
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,350
Wait, Mrs. Huang.

270
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,110
I have one more question.

271
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,790
Please.

272
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,510
There was some kind of white flower planted at Wu Lao-xian's house.

273
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,430
It looked very coquettish.

274
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,790
Do you know what kind of flower it is?

275
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,910
You are talking about the camel flower.

276
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,350
It's an important ingredient for medicine-making at the House of Huang.

277
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,510
Even though it can cause hallucinations,

278
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,950
it is just one of many ingredients.

279
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,710
If it's just the camel flower on its own,

280
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,910
anyone with basic pharmacological knowledge

281
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,830
can come up with an antidote.

282
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,070
How about this powder made by my mom?

283
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,830
Ms. Gu, this is just flour mixed with brown sugar.

284
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,950
Are you saying that it's completely useless?

285
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,910
But we used it to break some spells.

286
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,950
That's called the placebo effect.

287
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,670
Like when a dying patient

288
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,110
believes that he is cured

289
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,190
after taking some magical medicine.

290
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,670
This Wu Lao-xian is known for being malicious.

291
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,670
There should be other traps set by him nearby.

292
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,030
If we don't do anything about it,

293
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,390
the civilians in the area might get hurt.

294
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,550
Captain Fu.

295
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,030
I think you should

296
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,870
search the area again with care.

297
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,270
Indeed, great minds think alike.

298
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,510
Come.

299
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,990
Search this area for me.

300
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,870
Yes, sir!

301
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,750
Hold on a moment.

302
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,790
What now?

303
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,190
Wu Lao-xian uses spells from the streets，

304
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,750
ones we are all unfamiliar with.

305
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,550
Mrs. Huang,

306
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,070
you are experienced in this area,

307
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,990
and Wu Lao-xian was a disciple of yours.

308
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,150
You must be familiar with his ways.

309
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,430
Could you please

310
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,950
take Captain Fu

311
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,510
and my junior

312
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,910
to go and take a look around together.

313
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,910
But...

314
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,710
Don't worry, I will take good care of your son.

315
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,750
He will definitely  be safe with me.

316
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,310
You guys go check over there.

317
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,470
The House of Huang has two secret skills.

318
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,030
One is knot-tying,

319
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,030
and the other one is psychedelic medicine-making.

320
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,950
Mrs. Huang,

321
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,710
can the hallucinations be cured with blood?

322
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,750
That is the Huang family's secret.

323
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,950
I am afraid I cannot answer Chairman Ding.

324
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,990
There is a kind of psychedelic medicine

325
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,150
that can cause strong hallucinations.

326
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,710
The victims of this spell

327
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,950
can only wake up after bleeding.

328
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,670
This is a secret skill of the House of Huang, no?

329
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,710
How do you know about that?

330
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,310
Because we both fell victim

331
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,430
to this type of spell today.

332
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,070
You?

333
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,990
Impossible.

334
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,350
The spell you were talking about,

335
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,790
the one that can only be broken with blood,

336
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,670
is the House of Huang's top secret skill.

337
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,230
But it has not been passed down

338
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,030
since my father's generation.

339
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,150
It is simply too dangerous.

340
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,110
If it

341
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,390
falls into the hands of those who intend to do evil,

342
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,470
there will be great disaster.

343
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,030
Are you saying

344
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,110
that this skill has been lost to the world?

345
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,390
Not quite.

346
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,670
It can still be inherited

347
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,390
by the Head of the family that we elect.

348
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,150
Then, since Master Huang has already passed away,

349
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,110
who is in possession of the skill now?

350
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,270
Me, and only me.

351
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,350
What is it?

352
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,670
You suspect that I am the one who cast the spell?

353
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,390
Mrs. Huang, you just arrived here,

354
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,750
so the timing doesn't add up.

355
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,190
It couldn't have been you.

356
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,590
Other than Wu Lao-xian,

357
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,590
who arrived here

358
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,950
before us?

359
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,950
Young Master Huang,

360
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,190
among the younger generation of Tianjin,

361
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,830
you are undoubtedly

362
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,470
the wisest and bravest.

363
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,110
Please give me guidance and support in the future.

364
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,310
I am just lucky.

365
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,230
I am not deserving of the honour.

366
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,150
If you ever need my help in the future,

367
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,270
I will be there for sure.

368
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,190
Young Master Huang, you are too kind.

369
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,830
There is something that I want to ask you.

370
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,150
In order to protect you,

371
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,310
I scattered a layer of limestone powder outside your window.

372
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,630
If Wu Lao-xian really snuck in through the window

373
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,550
to kidnap you,

374
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,470
why is there limestone powder on your shoes,

375
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,590
but not his?

376
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,510
Earlier at Juhua Grand Hotel

377
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,990
when I saw the knot around your brother's neck,

378
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,230
I noticed that something was off.

379
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,950
But those brainless police

380
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,030
cut the knotted rope with a knife,

381
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,830
leaving me confused.

382
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,710
It was not until

383
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,630
I saw the knot around Wu Lao-xian's neck

384
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,910
that I confirmed my suspicions.

385
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,910
My goodness, it has finally come full circle.

386
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,030
The fish knot.

387
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,750
What?

388
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,190
A knot that can trap a live fish.

389
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,470
It becomes tighter

390
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,550
as the trapped person struggles.

391
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,710
Only members of the Huang family

392
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,830
know how to untie it.

393
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,110
Medicine-making and knot-tying

394
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,910
are unique skills of the School of Magic.

395
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,870
But the fish knot...

396
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,550
That is something new.

397
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,510
What a pity.

398
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,190
If you had exposed me in front of everyone earlier,

399
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,510
I might have spared your life.

400
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,310
But now,

401
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,790
I can only let you experience

402
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,630
the beauty of the fish knot for yourself.

403
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,310
Young Master Huang,

404
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,670
didn't you feel anything strange

405
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,710
when I patted your shoulder earlier?

406
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,670
I will take good care of your son.

407
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,710
He will definitely be safe with me.

408
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,430
I am nothing but a labourer

409
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,110
who retrieves corpses from the river,

410
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,110
but medicine-making happens to be my Master's hobby.

411
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,590
The drug on this needle is really something.

412
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,270
It is brewed from fresh tobacco leaves and the blood of the puffer fish.

413
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,830
Without the antidote,

414
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,750
you will not walk out of here alive today.

415
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,030
Young Master, do you feel your arms and legs becoming numb?

416
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,110
I've heard that among the medicines made by the House of Huang,

417
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,590
there is one that can only be passed on

418
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,790
to the Head of the family.

419
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,870
Would you like to tell me about it,

420
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,350
Young Master Huang?

421
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,310
What?

422
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,430
You think I don't have enough money to pay?

423
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,710
Master Huang, you are our distinguished guest.

424
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,990
But you haven't paid in two months.

425
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,790
You lack foresight.

426
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,110
I am the Head of the Huang family.

427
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,110
Money means nothing to me.

428
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,110
I am Huang Yi-suo, my skills are priceless.

429
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,030
This is the House of Huang's secret medicine-making techniques.

430
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,070
It is worth ten of your brothels.

431
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,510
What? Hey, stop right there!

432
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,910
Someone come! Get him!

433
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,670
Master Huang.

434
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,190
You are trying to pay for food and drink with this tattered book?

435
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:30,830
Master Huang. Master Huang.

436
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,870
Hurry up!

437
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,310
Sorry to offend, sorry to offend.

438
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,950
Our Master behaves like this only when he's drunk.

439
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,710
So sorry for that.

440
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,790
This is too much, much more than necessary.

441
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,190
Then, could you please return the book to our Master?

442
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,150
Here you go.

443
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,310
Ever since I was a child,

444
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,510
it was common knowledge that I am more talented than my brother.

445
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,510
My mother was extremely strict when it came to my studies.

446
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,910
I didn't expect that

447
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,310
in the end,

448
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,830
she would appoint my stupid brother

449
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,390
as Head of family.

450
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,710
Huang Yi-suo didn't care at all

451
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,150
about inheriting the House of Huang's skills.

452
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,430
He even treated our family's top secret skill

453
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,510
carelessly.

454
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,030
He never cared about

455
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:26,950
our family's traditional skills.

456
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,790
He just swaggered around,

457
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,550
and even performed Western magic tricks in public.

458
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,310
I couldn't standby and watch

459
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,390
as he destroyed the reputation of our family.

460
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,230
So I found Wu Lao-xian,

461
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,910
and asked him to put on a show with me.

462
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,870
The older brother dies, and the younger one takes over.

463
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,870
Don't you think that's too much of a coincidence?

464
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,790
How would others think?

465
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,590
Having to settle for second best.

466
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,390
Huang Yi-suo has already

467
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,270
ruined the House of Huang's reputation.

468
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,390
If I want to clear up his mess,

469
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,430
I would need help from the newspaper agency

470
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,710
to put on a show.

471
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,070
Let all of Tianjin know that I,

472
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,830
the second son of the Huang family is a worthy and courageous man.

473
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,750
Then, you will show up to accept the challenge,

474
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,470
and admit that you are the murderer.

475
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,790
I promise to spare your life after you are defeated.

476
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,910
I will treat you well in the future.

477
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,350
This way, everyone's attention

478
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,110
will be focused on me.

479
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,070
I can also turn my mother into a mere figurehead.

480
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,990
Huang Yi-suo accused me of

481
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,510
betraying the House of Huang.

482
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,390
Now that he is dead,

483
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,630
I have gotten my revenge.

484
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,870
I just want to be accepted back into the House of Huang and learn my skills in peace.

485
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,670
You want me to be your scapegoat?

486
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,070
Isn't that drawing fire onto myself?

487
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,310
You want to return to the House of Huang?

488
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,470
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

489
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,430
At this age,

490
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,070
you are still so naive.

491
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,870
For whatever reason,

492
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,190
you were cast out of the House of Huang.

493
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,230
I will never let you come back.

494
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,750
Hey you! Why are you here again?

495
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,350
I didn't expect you guys to be so capable,

496
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,510
and track down Wu Lao-xian.

497
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,550
So I turned your own strategy against you,

498
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,230
and pretended to be kidnapped.

499
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,630
Wu Lao-xian lacked foresight

500
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,030
and couldn't see the revival of the School of Magic.

501
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,470
So I had to stay ahead of the game

502
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,430
and kill him first, putting an end to his hopeless dreams.

503
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,630
Funny that I have been learning to make medicine since I was a child,

504
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,590
but in the end,

505
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,670
I was defeated by this poison.

506
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,070
You better explain this.

507
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,030
This Huang Yu, he colluded with Wu Lao-xian,

508
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,710
deceived his own mother,

509
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,870
and killed his own brother.

510
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,230
He committed treasonous crimes and deserves to die a thousand times.

511
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,710
That's not what I am talking about.

512
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,830
Oh, I know now.

513
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,950
Huang Yu committed so many wicked offenses,

514
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,750
he must have been very nervous.

515
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,710
To his face, I revealed

516
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,710
all of his deepest, darkest secrets one by one.

517
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,470
He must have panicked.

518
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,430
My words were like a knife,

519
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,430
stabbing him in the heart.

520
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,110
The nerves got to him,

521
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,310
so naturally, he passed out.

522
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,390
You're saying that

523
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,510
the needle you pricked him with wasn't poisoned?

524
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,070
It was the placebo effect.

525
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,949
Guo De-you, let me ask you this.

526
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,070
Before you went to find Wu Lao-xian,

527
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,150
did you touch anything

528
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,030
or eat anything special?

529
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,070
I had fried dough twists.

530
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,190
So you broke free from Wu Lao-xian's spell

531
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,949
with sheer willpower?

532
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,310
Of course!

533
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,270
Pay up.

534
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,389
I told you,

535
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,230
Brother Guo-er is the best of the best.

536
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,429
Wu Lao-xian's camel flower

537
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,150
is the final ingredient for the psychedelic medicine.

538
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,670
What do you mean?

539
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,389
The medicinal candy he sold before

540
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,710
can indeed cause hysteria.

541
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,150
So we were all poisoned with the first few ingredients.

542
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,030
But you didn't smell the camel flower,

543
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,830
so you experienced lighter effects.

544
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,270
That's why you could break free with sheer willpower.

545
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,750
That's very possible.

546
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,150
Boring.

547
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,110
When did we get poisoned

548
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,830
with the first few ingredients?

549
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,430
Did we come into contact with anything together?

550
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,030
At the House of Huang.

551
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,510
Light a stick of incense before you leave.

552
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,670
Pay your respect to the dead,

553
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,790
even if it's just a gesture.

554
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,070
I held my breath on purpose while I was in the mourning hall.

555
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,270
I was afraid that my body couldn't stand all the smoke.

556
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,990
So I must have inhaled less than you.

557
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,190
If it was the incense,

558
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,190
the poison would be airborne.

559
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,550
How did Huang Yu stay unaffected?

560
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,830
He made the medicine, so he must have had the antidote.

561
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,150
Then, how did Huang Yu kill Huang Yi-suo?

562
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,470
I only saw Wu Lao-xian at the crime scene.

563
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,870
Didn't you say that

564
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,790
you saw a bald, fat man

565
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,390
carrying a big leather suitcase?

566
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,270
The Art of Soft Bones.

567
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,550
What?

568
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,910
Huang Yu

569
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,510
was hiding inside of the suitcase.

570
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,630
There are many kinds of tricks.

571
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,830
In addition to Western magic,

572
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,430
performers also need to know

573
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,190
qigong, acrobatics, contortion, jiu-jitsu, and many other skills.

574
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,310
These are basic skills for magicians,

575
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,830
learned since childhood.

576
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,670
He must have left himself a way out.

577
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,510
If anything goes wrong,

578
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,310
he could still frame Wu Lao-xian.

579
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,550
This is all just our deduction.

580
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,150
We only have your testimony.

581
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,190
Without evidence,

582
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,870
we can't convict Huang Yu of his crimes.

583
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,470
First his brother, and now Wu Lao-xian,

584
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,830
he has already committed two murders.

585
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,910
People like him should never be reincarnated.

586
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,950
Not two.

587
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,870
It's three murders.

588
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,950
As soon as

589
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,670
I got some information about Lian Hua-qing from the ghost market,

590
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,950
the informant was killed in front of me.

591
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,910
He was killed by the Immortal Rope.

592
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,350
By the looks of it, Huang Yu must have been the killer.

593
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,950
Huang Yu is connected to the Demonic Sect?

594
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,070
Of course.

595
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,830
Why didn't you say so earlier?

596
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,950
What's the rush? We already caught the guy.

597
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,670
We'll know when we interrogate him.

598
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,670
So deceptive!

599
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,750
I will expose his true colours!

600
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,950
I can't get anything out of him.

601
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,030
You see,

602
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,510
he confessed to the crimes,

603
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,630
but he's gone mad.

604
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,390
He hasn't confessed everything, we have to interrogate him again.

605
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,070
Sure, do whatever you want.

606
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,390
Huang Yu is a master of the Art of Soft Bones.

607
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,870
You think these prison cell bars

608
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,070
can keep him imprisoned?

609
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,550
A madman can't perform the Art of Soft Bones.

610
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,670
How long has he been like this?

611
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,070
Ever since he was arrested.

612
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,030
Young Master Huang?

613
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,750
Head of the Huang family?

614
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,630
He has lost his ability to communicate.

615
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,550
By the looks of him now,

616
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,790
he is severely mentally ill.

617
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,390
We only feed him some buns now.

618
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,430
He spills

619
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,790
any other food given to him.

620
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,990
Let me ask you a few questions.

621
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,270
Answer me honestly,

622
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,750
and I will give you this bun.

623
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,950
It's no use, we have tried that.

624
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,710
This won't do. Let's take things up a notch.

625
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,750
Captain Fu?

626
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,430
Do you have any chili water

627
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,510
or torture racks here?

628
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,030
Lynching is illegal.

629
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,070
In order to escape punishment,

630
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,350
he'll pretend to be mad forever.

631
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,830
We have to teach him a lesson.

632
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,590
Prisoners have dignity too.

633
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,390
Do the three victims have dignity?

634
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,310
Of course they do too.

635
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,030
But rules are rules,

636
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,390
and the law is the law.

637
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,150
They can't be changed, just like your street laws.

638
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,590
So you are just going to let him be mad forever?

639
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,150
The police station is no place for madmen.

640
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,590
I'll need to send him to prison as soon as possible.

641
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,870
If he is really mentally ill,

642
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,150
we will have to revise our charges.

643
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,390
He can't be sent to prison just yet.

644
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,630
Detective Ding, this is Tianjin.

645
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,110
Not Germany, where you stayed before.

646
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,430
Don't try to fool me with these restrictions and fetters.

647
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,390
How about this,

648
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,390
I will arrange a psychological evaluation for him immediately.

649
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,790
If he is indeed pretending,

650
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,470
I will definitely not go easy on him.

651
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,990
He will be charged with additional crimes, and punished accordingly.
