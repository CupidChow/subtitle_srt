[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,170
Story goes on

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,290
Previously on Tientsin Mystic

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,290
Guo Deyou, Gu Ying, Ding Mao, Xiao Lanlan

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,310
got together at Ju Hua Grand Hotel

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,480
Guo Deyou lied that there were rats at the hotel

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,330
to sow chaos

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,080
under cover of which Guo got into the

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,500
hidden opium den at backyard of the hotel

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,930
The four guy raised a fuss at the den

11
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,710
Guo Deyou could't stand opium

12
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,740
He drowned into grievances analysis mirage several times

13
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,780
When he was about to escape successfully

14
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,240
he found a secret room

15
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,770
The police seized the opium den

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,760
Guo Deyou induced the people behind

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,680
Manager Wang to show up

18
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,600
Mr. Ding  questioned  Supervisor Hu with ship record

19
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,820
Supervisor Hu told Mr. Ding

20
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,430
not to delve into this matter

21
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,870
Ding Mao arraigned Manager Wang overnight

22
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,310
Wang confessed that it was Ding Yiqiu

23
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,680
from Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation operated the supply channel

24
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,560
Coming next

25
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,390
Ding Mao interrogates Manager Wang finding Wang is dead

26
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,920
Xiao Lanlan reveals the past

27
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,020
Guo Deyou tactfully finds the real murderer

28
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,720
Supervisor Hu,  you are here for

29
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm here for providing some soup for Young Master

30
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,200
You personally come for the trivial things

31
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,220
In the evening

32
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,960
As I get old, I am sleepless

33
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,540
I come here  to exercise myself

34
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,960
Come in,  Come in

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,340
Later come in for some soup, OK?

36
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,250
No, thank you, Supervisor Hu

37
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,660
Uncle Hu

38
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,140
Young Master

39
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,829
It's so late now, you come here for

40
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,940
Looking at your face I know you were not eating properly

41
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,960
Your aunt cooked the silkie soup boiled with Angelica and Astragalus for you

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,190
Recently you are so tired

43
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,990
You shall have something nourishing

44
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,860
How is the case?

45
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,720
Not much progress

46
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,420
You've been back for such a long time

47
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,760
How many days have you stayed at home?

48
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,490
Get to the police office day and day

49
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,310
See what time is it now?

50
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,540
Even though you get weak

51
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,200
you may not get some results

52
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,830
Only when I find out how my father died

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
I can get a good sleep

54
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,310
There are so many things that I can't figure out

55
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm so anxious

56
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,920
We don't know what  means did that beast use

57
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,220
to cheat Yuanyuan to elope with him

58
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,850
Except for being lame

59
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,560
what other characteristics does he have?

60
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,330
At least his voice you shall have heard clearly

61
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,570
I don't know the accent either

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,930
I just heard he used to cough.

63
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,030
Uncle Hu, I have something to say

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,200
but I don't know how to say it

65
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,750
You can get straight to the point with me

66
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,650
During the time I'm away

67
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,780
Did my father think of marrying another wife?

68
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,570
How can you have such an idea?

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,450
or did he

70
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,920
have some lover outside?

71
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,870
That's rubbish

72
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,280
Where did you hear of it?

73
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Nowhere

74
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,290
I'm just, just a little bit confused.

75
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,290
Chairman Ding spent all his time on the

76
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,250
development of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

77
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,090
what's more, he worried about you

78
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,030
He had no thoughts and time

79
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,920
to think of it

80
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,440
The last cigarette

81
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,930
you take it

82
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,500
I

83
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,830
You can

84
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,580
I know you also smoke sometimes when you are fretful

85
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,180
Human's life is as short as trees and grass

86
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,340
I, Hu Haijiang, for the whole life

87
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,530
only admire one person

88
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,000
who is your father

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,590
Now our Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

90
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,120
in Tianjin

91
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,780
ranks the top

92
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,330
Whoever Chairman Ding deals with

93
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,170
he or she will kind of  give him face

94
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,640
that is to say

95
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,120
He  totally doesn't need to work so hard

96
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,990
Chairman Ding's thoughts

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,430
are much deeper

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,270
than us

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,610
What he concerns is

100
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,480
not only our chamber of commerce

101
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,410
He works for the Hai River region

102
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,410
He works for the whole Tianjin

103
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,250
If I must say he has any selfish consideration

104
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,350
it is you

105
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,560
Young Master, it's getting late

106
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,780
You'd better go home for a rest

107
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,250
Young Master, Young Master

108
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,380
it's over 12 p.m. now

109
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,500
Hurry home to rest

110
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,090
It's OK

111
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,020
Inside there is an important prisoner

112
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,090
who I need to question

113
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,160
Is that it?

114
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,490
OK

115
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,180
Do not ruin the reputation of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

116
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,660
You go back first

117
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,150
Then I go home

118
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,360
You stand up

119
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,660
I ask you how could the prisoner die

120
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,100
I also want to ask

121
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,700
A healthy prisoner locked in the prison room

122
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,970
No one question her No one touch her

123
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,990
How could she die

124
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,580
How could she die

125
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,160
There must be someone who silences her to cover up crime

126
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,760
We must thoroughly investigate immediately to eliminate hidden dangers

127
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,350
Thoroughly investigate? Are you OK?

128
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,580
An owl will not come unless something bad will happen.

129
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,180
Now I really want to give myself a punch on the face

130
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,660
What magic potion did I eat at that time?

131
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,900
I let you investigate the case

132
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,680
Is it necessary to talk about this now?

133
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,870
Does it help?

134
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,490
Build a case now

135
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,630
Check out what happened immediately

136
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,490
All right

137
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,990
Build a case.  Check out

138
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
Tho one who causes this case works the case.

139
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,520
Now the prisoner died in our police office

140
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,460
What  will the people outside think of?

141
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,250
What will the newspaper reporters think of?

142
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,090
A clean hand wants no washing

143
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,910
Detective Ding, Ding Mao

144
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,500
I ask you again

145
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,660
How did Manager Wang die?

146
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,720
Drowned

147
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,730
Bullshit

148
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,170
Captain

149
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,020
Have some water. Calm down.

150
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,120
Get out

151
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,490
This is police office

152
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,500
where temperately detains prisoners

153
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
Where does the water come from?

154
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,710
You told me she was drowned in there

155
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,170
Did she pee to make herself drowned?

156
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,290
My lord

157
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
I had carried out the autopsy

158
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,340
She was asphyxy by choking water in lung

159
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,350
She was drowned

160
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,280
Otherwise you go there and check it out

161
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,750
No

162
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,310
They all say that River Demon kills in our police office too

163
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,780
What would you like to eat recently?

164
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,990
Nothing. Just stay at home

165
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,920
That's OK if you don't say it

166
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
I'd like to have something good.

167
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,910
Eat well and drink well

168
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,020
so as to avoid when I'm furious to death

169
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,800
I don't have enough delicious food

170
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,610
It's so hurt

171
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,290
Master Shifu, I really didn't do it on purpose

172
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,920
I was forced by the situation.

173
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,690
As I ran after the target, I got in the opium den

174
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,640
I don't scold at you if you smoke

175
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,600
Now you gain more skills

176
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,530
you directly get into the opium den

177
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,270
It's all Jing Mao's fault

178
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,320
Every time I mean to help him

179
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,730
You shall give him a good lesson if you have any opportunity

180
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,310
So a good excuse now?

181
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,720
You don't discipline yourself

182
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,830
Instead you blame to your junior fellow apprentice

183
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,670
I know I'm wrong

184
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,590
I don't dare to do it again

185
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,290
This time you're back alive

186
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,430
you get some good luck

187
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,530
How dare you think of next time?

188
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't expect my reaction this time is so distinct

189
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,960
What is  opium? Do you have any ideas?

190
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,180
Regular people will get seriously hurt if they addict to it

191
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,350
Your body is so weak

192
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,890
that you  just found a quicker way to Heaven, didn't you?

193
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,320
I know I'm wrong, Master Shifu

194
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,980
Master Shifu, Are you OK?

195
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,390
Stay still  in the bath

196
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,870
I'm old now

197
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,570
I don't have the power to whip you any more

198
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,250
You'd better know

199
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,380
what you're doing

200
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,030
In the future when you can't whip me

201
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,780
and I do something wrong

202
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,880
I whip myself

203
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,290
You You just now say that you'd like something good to eat

204
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,970
what would you like to eat? Please tell me

205
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,420
I go and buy it now

206
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,920
We two have a good dinner tonight

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,790
No eating

208
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,700
You know I add more medicine in the bath

209
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,840
You stay well in it

210
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Young Master Guo

211
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,560
The police office invites you to retrieve corpse

212
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,300
You can go and do it

213
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,570
They ask for Young Master Guo by name

214
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,840
He is so weak that he can't get into the water

215
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,360
He doesn't need to

216
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,060
How could he retrieve corpse if he doesn't get in the water?

217
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,280
That person is indeed drowned

218
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,710
but

219
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,670
she was drowned in the prison of police office

220
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,760
I told you that River Demon was the killer

221
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,110
or else why we invite Junior Tientsin Mystic to come here

222
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,640
Captain Fu said talking sense

223
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,660
When did she die?

224
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,490
Are you sure?

225
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,280
Tell from stiff degree of the corpse

226
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,020
it was probably last night

227
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,150
from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.

228
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,790
What's wrong?

229
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,830
Do you smell anything strange?

230
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,350
No

231
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,230
It's just a musty smell

232
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,390
Except for you

233
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,680
Has anyone else been in here?

234
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,590
Captain Fu gave me full authority over the case

235
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,890
I am the only one who has the key

236
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,830
No one else can get in

237
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,780
Where is the key?

238
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,340
I have kept it on my belt

239
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,480
It has always been there

240
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,800
This lock has such a deep lock cylinder

241
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,030
Most people can't break this lock

242
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,230
And there's only one way

243
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,480
You can't get in anywhere else

244
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,240
No need to check

245
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,400
I know who it is

246
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,360
Who?

247
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,210
You

248
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,670
This is no time

249
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,300
to joke

250
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,050
Can you prove your innocence?

251
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,430
The room is a secret chamber

252
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,780
and you have the only key

253
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,400
It's obvious

254
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,780
You're the most likely suspect

255
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,210
No matter who's gonna look into this case

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,610
You will be the first suspect

257
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,930
I have an alibi

258
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,910
How to prove it?

259
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,070
Uncle Hu can

260
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,410
We have been talking outside

261
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,940
Supervisor Hu?

262
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,020
How does he know?

263
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,900
Uncle Hu came to see me last night with soup

264
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,620
We were chatting in the hall the whole time

265
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,970
The guard on duty at the gate

266
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,930
must have seen his entry and exit.

267
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,700
Do you still remember

268
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,650
when Supervisor Hu left?

269
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,190
Just after twelve o'clock

270
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,400
You remember it so well

271
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,830
When I sent him away

272
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,000
The bell had just rung

273
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,790
I wanted to interrogate her when I came back

274
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,770
Then I found her dead

275
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,170
Is Junior Tientsin Mystic getting rid of demons?

276
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,890
Shut up

277
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,370
What are you look at?

278
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,300
I have sent you a smaller clock already

279
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,770
Do you still want me to investigate the case?

280
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,230
You smoked

281
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,290
Just one cigarette

282
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,850
I didn't think

283
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,090
any medical or scientific person like you

284
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,370
would touch a thing like that

285
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
Sometimes when I'm upset

286
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,540
I smoke a cigarette

287
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,810
Did you pour out the ashes here?

288
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,810
No, it wasn't me

289
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,860
We have regular cleaning

290
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,000
You told me

291
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,270
When did Supervisor Hu leave?

292
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,120
Twelve

293
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,420
I remembered it clearly

294
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,730
The clock rang twelve times

295
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,420
What do you find out?

296
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,640
I know who the killer is

297
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,230
Who?

298
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,810
And also his approximate modus operandi

299
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,110
I all know it

300
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,310
Say it!

301
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,160
It's complex

302
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,500
If you want to know

303
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,140
Maybe I need to wrong you

304
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,460
Me?

305
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,490
We have to bet

306
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,220
However, win or not

307
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,610
the result we achieve

308
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,850
will matters the future of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

309
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,810
You have to think twice

310
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,830
What are we going to do?

311
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,230
To prepare the thing that wrong you

312
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,510
I have investigated

313
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,520
In the past 30 years

314
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,090
there were four severe flood

315
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,850
in Tianjin

316
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,860
The most serious one

317
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,750
occured 21 years ago

318
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,290
At that time, the number of casualties and missing persons

319
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,580
reached hundreds

320
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,980
It's worth noting that

321
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,150
In the western suburbs of the worst-hit area is a village

322
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,810
called Qiming Village

323
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,730
Two years after the disaster

324
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,680
Suddenly an evil organization appeared

325
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,000
it was called Demon Sect

326
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,270
In Tianjin

327
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,490
Demon Sect preyed on children everywhere

328
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,880
The impact was very bad

329
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,040
unfortunately

330
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,080
the related information

331
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,360
was sealed

332
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,450
It can be only found out that

333
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,460
The government led troops to exterminate some of the members

334
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,700
And the Demon Sect disappeared

335
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,650
Demon Sect

336
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,990
Just in time

337
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,030
Mr. Ding comes too

338
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,340
there is a piece of information

339
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,170
I think you two are interested in it

340
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,260
What?

341
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,800
There were three people besieging and suppressing the Demon Sect

342
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,270
These three people

343
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,700
You all know them

344
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,140
Ding Yiqiu, the commander-in-chief

345
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,480
Hu Haijiang, the deputy commander

346
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,480
And Guochun, a believer in brotherhood

347
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,290
My father?

348
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,440
Uncle Hu?

349
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,880
Master?

350
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,840
This is the black tortoise statue that is tied to my father

351
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,710
I'll have to ask my master about it

352
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,770
Junior Tientsin Mystic

353
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,280
Is this the information you're looking for?

354
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,650
In return

355
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,520
I have an exclusive news

356
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,670
that will shock the whole Tianjin

357
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,120
I want to give it to Miss Xiao

358
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,720
The news that will shock the whole Tianjin?

359
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,290
Captain

360
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,860
I am wronged

361
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,520
Close the door

362
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,650
Take a seat

363
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,190
You see the news in the newspaper?

364
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,410
Where is he?

365
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,540
He was taken into custody

366
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,210
It is wronged! Truely!

367
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,850
Make an exception in my favor, Captain Fu

368
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,570
He himself had to be a hero to investigate the case

369
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,080
He promised but failed to find out the truth

370
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,540
Feeling shameful, he abused lynchings

371
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,520
Unexpectedly

372
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,950
The girl couldn't stand it

373
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,380
She died accidentally

374
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,040
Mr. Ding was sober

375
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,230
He didn't hide it

376
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,520
He dared to accept the consequences

377
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,920
He pleaded guilty

378
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,770
He was not wronged

379
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,590
The criminal voluntarily surrendered himself, and we arrested him

380
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,460
There's nothing wrong. It is according to official principles

381
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,620
I can't make an exception in your favor

382
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,960
The news in written in the newspaper

383
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,550
The government has knew it already

384
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,130
Even I want to let him go

385
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,760
My spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak

386
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,480
The smart people did the thing foolishly

387
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,890
No one can stop him

388
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,040
Right?

389
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,280
I come here

390
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,750
to voluntarily surrendered myself

391
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,350
I killed Shopkeeper Wang

392
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,200
I prepared the thing

393
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,080
and brought him the soup

394
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,630
Uncle Hu?

395
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,910
Why are you here? It's so late

396
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,440
Look at your face. I know you did't eat well

397
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,230
Your aunt cooked Guiqi black chicken soup for you

398
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,630
You are so tired recently

399
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,710
He needs feeding up some

400
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,270
Mr.?

401
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,050
Mr.?

402
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,820
Didn't you drink the soup?

403
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,260
I drank it

404
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,240
Only the soup is not enough

405
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,460
It will have effects

406
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,650
with the help of cigarette

407
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,190
And then?

408
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,900
Pig urine can be used like this

409
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,780
Being drugged and out for a long time,

410
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,800
how could it be possible

411
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,720
that he don't remember it after coming around?

412
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,150
Time can be deceptive.

413
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,120
It's close to midnight

414
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,320
when I came to see Young Master.

415
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,240
I kept an eye on the time

416
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,500
while I was talking to him,

417
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,240
so the drug could fully kick in

418
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,300
at exactly 12 o'clock.

419
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,860
Because the chimes can reinforce memories.

420
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,960
That way, he wouldn't have the slightest idea

421
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,240
that he'd passed out.

422
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,550
Young Master,

423
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,510
It's midnight already.

424
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,620
You should go back and sleep.

425
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,860
I need to interrogate an important prisoner first.

426
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,030
Take care not to mar the reputation of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

427
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,950
You go back first.

428
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,370
All right.

429
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,900
Here is the pig bladder.

430
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,790
Now you have witnesses and physical evidence.

431
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,380
Are you going to arrest me or not?

432
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,040
And the motive?

433
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,520
Why did you kill her?

434
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,860
There's a feud between Mr. Wang and me.

435
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,810
How come Supervisor Hu would be in a feud

436
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,860
with an opium peddler?

437
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,250
You don't need to know about that.

438
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
That won't do!

439
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,790
The murder by Young Master Ding is already in the paper.

440
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,080
If I arrested you and overturned the verdict ...

441
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,580
You don't think people out there are stupid, do you?

442
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,570
It's only too obvious!

443
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,560
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation is looking for someone to take the blame.

444
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,130
What would become of the authority of the police?

445
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,000
Captain Fu,

446
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,940
Go and question Ding Mao now.

447
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,420
If he's able to tell everything about the crime

448
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,820
on point,

449
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,150
then I'll back out.

450
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,300
Or...

451
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,580
I'll mobilize every branch of

452
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,130
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation in Tianjing

453
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,660
to make this whole thing a big deal.

454
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,480
Think about it,

455
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,740
Captain Fu.

456
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,970
Master!

457
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,240
Master!

458
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,710
Master！

459
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,500
The Black Tortoise statue in the water,

460
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,280
do you know where it comes from?

461
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,090
No idea.

462
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,270
Never seen it before.

463
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,490
This's the Black Tortoise statue tied to my father.

464
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,860
I have to ask Master about this.

465
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,060
Sometimes Master just doesn't agree to light cigarette to analyze grievances,

466
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,989
no matter how hard the grievant is begging.

467
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,520
Not that he can't.

468
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,600
It's just that the truth from the analysis

469
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,080
may have hurt the grievant even more.

470
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,710
How did you find out?

471
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,030
Did you smell it?

472
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,110
A sour smell.

473
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,239
It's white vinegar.

474
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,090
Why white vinegar?

475
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,710
Surely you know what pig bladders are, right?

476
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,580
That stuff has a pungent smell.

477
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,219
Must be kept in white vinegar for days

478
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,730
to contain the smell.

479
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,090
When we trained in swimming skills as newcomers to the Corpse Retrieval team,

480
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,100
we would use pig bladders to help us breathe in the water.

481
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,389
So I'm only too familiar with the smell.

482
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,830
How can you be sure it's Uncle Hu who did this?

483
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,350
Like I said,

484
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,760
he and I were together the whole time.

485
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,110
Didn't you notice

486
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,940
that the clock had been tampered with?

487
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,820
It's covered in dust,

488
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,630
except here. It's spotless.

489
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,450
And look at the glass.

490
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,890
Pig bladders are really oily.

491
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,770
That oily stuff plus water...

492
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,730
Then if you touch glass with your wet hand,

493
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,750
it's likely that it'll leave a mark on the glass.

494
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,850
This drug is exceptional in that

495
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,050
it only works when you put the two parts together.

496
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,560
Your soup was drugged.

497
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,830
But the trigger was in the smoke.

498
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,910
For this drug, you need four herbs.

499
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,870
Bake them dry, grind them, and light them up.

500
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,000
Inhale some through the nose and take the rest through the mouth. That's how it works.

501
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,880
How do you know all this?

502
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,110
The herbal prescription for my baths

503
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,880
was invented by Master. He decided on it only after

504
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,780
experimenting for more than ten years.

505
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,430
So I know every conceivable drug

506
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,530
in the market.

507
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,870
But...

508
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,010
the knockout drug we're talking about here,

509
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,390
you can't find it in the market.

510
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,530
In the military,

511
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,770
It's often used as an anesthetic.

512
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,550
If you've not been in the military,

513
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,840
there's no way you can know about the formula.

514
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,440
There were three men involved in the siege of Demon Sect.

515
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,900
Commander-in-chief, Ding Yiqiu

516
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,400
Deputy commander-in-chief, Hu Haijiang

517
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,380
Honorable civilian, Guo Chun

518
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,160
Like I've said,

519
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,480
This's only my surmise.

520
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,640
I have no evidence to prove it.

521
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,860
You're the one who've decided to roll the dice.

522
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,720
Master once told me,

523
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,480
the reason Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation has become

524
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,440
so influential in TianJing

525
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,460
in such a short time

526
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,360
is because the people in charge are loyal.

527
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,530
I didn't understand it before.

528
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
But I do now.

529
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,440
Master's gone

530
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,310
without leaving a word.

531
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,980
There must be something fishy going on.

532
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,610
It may has something to do with Demon Sect.

533
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,080
About the two managers from Grain Transportation, one dead, one alive.

534
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,580
You know them, don't you?

535
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,140
Tianjing is not that big.

536
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,030
It's not strange

537
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,230
that two people may have crossed paths in the past.

538
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,690
Oh, Master,

539
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,220
Speaking of tortoises,

540
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,480
do you know where the Black Tortoise statue in the riverbed comes from?

541
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,860
Just do what you're supposed to do.

542
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,280
Investigations and things like that,

543
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,640
they're not your concern!
