1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,110
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,200
Let's pick up from where we've left.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,360
Here are the gists of the last episode.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,100
The Door of Life is competing with
the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,680
for the opportunity of cooperating with British Consul.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,540
The Door of Life has the upper hand
because they have inside information.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,950
Guo Deyou found the codebook

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,970
from the ghost market.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,280
He gave it to Xiao Lanlan to look for clues.

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,460
Accidentally, he found out

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,810
someone had bought ten corpses,

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,230
and carried them away in crates.

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,800
While Gu Ying and Witch Zhang
were casting spells of blessing at the Door of Life,

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,000
they noticed some suspicious crates

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,710
were carried into the Door of Life.

16
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,040
Guo Deyou and Gu Ying followed their trails

17
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,840
and saw those crates had been carried into the British Consulate.

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,040
The two of them sneaked in.

19
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,360
Ding Mao happened to be in the consulate

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
to negotiate a deal with the British Consul.

21
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,460
Meanwhile, Huang Yu was taken to Xiao Xiguan Prison.

22
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,940
Xiao Lanlan solved the puzzle successfully.

23
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,130
The answer is three words, Xiao Xiguan special.

24
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,140
When Guo Deyou and Gu Ying were looking for the crates,

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,250
they saw someone was performing dead-reviving sorcery

26
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,420
at the attic of the British Consulate.

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,390
The mysterious woman turned out to be Supervisor Hu's wife.

28
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,220
In the following episode, she unknowingly made something evil,
both she and her son were dead because of it.

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,019
Soon afterwards, zombies invaded the consulate again.

30
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,230
In order to find the Preacher,

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,280
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao set out for Xiao Xiguan Prison.

32
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,539
I'm going to the Temple of Great Mercy

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,210
to light a candle.

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,759
I told you, you'd better stay at home.

35
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,590
It's not safe out there recently.

36
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,650
You don't even care bout Tianming,

37
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,380
so don't pretend you care about me.

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,470
With everything that’s been going on with the Chamber of Commerce,

39
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,600
Don’t make this any harder than it already is.

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:05,590
Yeah, the Chamber of Commerce is always your priority.

41
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,650
And you never have time

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,810
for your son's funeral.

43
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,290
If you’re going out, let me know.

44
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,590
I'll send more men to protect you.

45
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,830
What…what are you doing?

46
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,710
Dead-reviving sorcery!

47
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,560
What?

48
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,680
She made a formation composed with corpses.

49
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,120
Find nine corpses to form a formation.

50
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,340
And use them to revive a dead man.

51
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,370
It's black magic, and it may incur something evil.

52
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,980
Therefore, it's one of the most forbidden magic.

53
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,420
The witch who performs it will definitely live fewer years.

54
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,400
If Tianming can call me "mom" one more time,

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,890
I'm willing to sacrifice a few of my living years for it.

56
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,250
Thanks for your waiting.

57
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,590
This can bring my son back to life?

58
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,340
At first, I didn't believe it.

59
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,460
Nevertheless, I decided to try it out.

60
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,760
Like Tianming, Sun Laoqi was stabbed to death as well.

61
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,680
The two of them died in the same place and same time.

62
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,080
If it works on him,

63
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,490
it will work on Tianming and bring him back.

64
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,560
Use it on Sun Laoqi first, to test it out.

65
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,420
I need to be sure.

66
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,230
You got it.

67
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,270
Tell me, what do you want me to do?

68
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,550
I asked Feng Erma

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,390
to dig up Sun Laoqi's body

70
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,610
and do what the man said,

71
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,860
keeping the eggs in the water with the body.

72
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,120
Although Sun Laoqi revived just as Demon Sect said,

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,230
he had no consciousness of his own.

74
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,700
He not only escaped from Feng Erma's fish cage

75
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,190
but also killed Feng Erma.

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,050
This caused a lot of trouble.

77
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,890
That's not what I want.

78
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,210
The eggs I gave you earlier can only revive the body.

79
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,820
If you want his soul to go back to his body,

80
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,580
it's gonna take some doing.

81
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm willing to do anything.

82
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,990
The land of the dead.

83
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,130
What?

84
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,090
It's the darkest place where everything ends.

85
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,120
If you use the right way,

86
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,080
you can transform the place
from where everything ends to where everything begins.

87
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,370
What is the right way?

88
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,370
You'll need other nine corpses to assist you

89
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,670
and accumulate the vigor of life for you.

90
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,980
With this and the land of the dead,

91
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,130
your son's soul can stay in him, and his spirit will come back.

92
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,850
And then, he will be brought back to life.

93
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,480
And when that happens,

94
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,940
Tianming will call you "mom" again.

95
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,390
Where is the land of the dead?

96
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,810
Tianjin was a great place.

97
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,440
Originally, it didn't have the land of the dead.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,300
But ever since those rude foreigners

99
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,190
moved in,

100
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,070
they made one from nowhere.

101
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,910
Those foreigners?

102
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,600
Hai is the darkest one of the twelve earthly branches.

103
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,990
The place of Hai corresponds to the water in north.

104
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,200
Look for yourself.

105
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,750
Among places that near water in northwest Tianjin,

106
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,040
where was changed by the foreigners?

107
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,740
The land of the dead is at this British Consulate.

108
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,780
There is no dead-reviving sorcery.

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,890
What actuates the body

110
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,680
is actually a kind of parasite which live in corpse.

111
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,460
Mrs. Hu, apparently, he fooled you.

112
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,240
There is no coming back from the dead.

113
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,370
No matter what means you take.

114
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,630
It must have been troublesome

115
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,390
to get these corpses into the consulate.

116
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,520
Don't you want to bring down
the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation?

117
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,510
Tianming died in the hands of the Door of Life's men.

118
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,950
The sensible God had given me this chance

119
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,640
to carry these ten water coffins into the consulate

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,130
in the name of the Door of Life.

121
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,520
When it's done,

122
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,270
I'm gonna turn my back on the Door of Life,

123
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,910
and accuse them of making zombies in the consulate

124
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,790
in an attempt to threat the British consul and gain power.

125
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,360
Even if I failed this time,

126
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,200
I can make those hooligans

127
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,090
disappear from Tianjin forever,

128
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,900
and revenge my son.

129
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,430
The land bulges with the air of auspiciousness.
If the air shows signs of ending,

130
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,130
it becomes interdependent with the water nearby.
That's how we know the land's fate.

131
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,960
When the time comes, the water of sky and earth

132
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,660
will join as one flow.

133
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,340
And the eight kinds of winds and eight emotions

134
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,670
will combine to break the seal of death.

135
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,700
I've tired of listening to my mom's spells when stay at home,

136
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,750
as well as repeating spells when perform magic during work.

137
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,040
Now I finally got out

138
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,550
and have the time to drink with Deyou.

139
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,640
And you're doing it again at my face.

140
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,040
Please shut up.

141
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,910
Tianming.

142
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,730
Don't waste things like that.

143
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,660
Why did you take a bath like Deyou when you're already dead?

144
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,780
Isn't it too extravagant for a dead man?

145
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,660
Let's get out of here.

146
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,680
Let's go.

147
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,650
My trousers!

148
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,780
Is that the son you want

149
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,060
with complete soul and spirit?

150
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,290
Let's go!

151
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

152
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,260
I have the great pleasure to welcome tonight

153
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,310
the special Chinese actress, Miss Wang Meiren.

154
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,380
And she's well known for her movies

155
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,950
not only in China but also abroad.

156
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,530
And now also in the U.K.

157
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,980
And especially my friends are all big fan of hers.

158
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,370
She has designed

159
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,040
this special evening tonight for us as well.

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,570
And I'd like to give her a warm welcome.

161
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,000
Please join me and welcome Wang Meiren.

162
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,120
Is anyone out there?

163
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,560
Hello?

164
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,570
Please welcome again, Miss Wang Meiren, please.

165
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,630
Everyone, get out of here!

166
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,700
Move, don't let them bite you.

167
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,740
Cheers.

168
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,190
Tianming.

169
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,020
Tianming.

170
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,440
Tianming. I am Ding Mao. Tianming.

171
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,140
Tianming.

172
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,160
Tianming.

173
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,670
Go.

174
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,880
Go.

175
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,750
Tianming.

176
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,200
Go.

177
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,180
No wonder that I can be hurt if I always float in the world.

178
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,320
Float slowly. Float slowly.

179
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,210
Float.

180
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
Are you okay. Go. Hurry up.

181
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,350
Let's go to somewhere to grab a drink.

182
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,260
Miss Wang, what happened?

183
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,290
I don't know.

184
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,980
Go.

185
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,830
Spirit. You are a spirit.

186
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,520
Go. Go.

187
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,440
Spirit. You are a spirit. You are also a spirit.

188
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,440
We have to go. Go.

189
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,590
Why don't you drink, little vixen?

190
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,190
Go.

191
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,290
You are all little vixens.

192
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,270
Auntie Hu.

193
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,220
Tianming, the look which now you have changed into.

194
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,220
It's all my fault.

195
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,610
And I am still not satisfied.

196
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,710
I want to watch you all the time.

197
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,000
I want to stay with you all the time.

198
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,320
Tianming, go with me obediently.

199
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,230
You scare me to death.

200
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,500
It's much easier to control the mosquitoes than people.

201
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,770
They are much more obedient than the dead.

202
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,310
The dead are much more obedient than the alive.

203
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,480
What exactly do you want to do?

204
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,410
This time, I just drew a conclusion

205
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,490
between me and English incidentally.

206
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,830
It has nothing to do with you.

207
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,390
What is it?

208
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,190
For Demonic Cult, opium

209
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,660
is actually good medicine.

210
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,280
I went to negotiate with English appreciatively

211
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,540
and wanted to acquire the stable source of opium.

212
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,080
But do you know

213
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,820
to who they gave the transportation permission?

214
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,980
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

215
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,970
Ding Yiqiu killed

216
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,610
over one hundred people of my Demonic Cult with opium from English.

217
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,470
Because of this,

218
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,670
you messed everything up, right?

219
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,300
Ding Yiqiu stabbed me one time,

220
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,070
and I must let him die.

221
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,510
And what is your opinion for the one who gave him the knife?

222
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,910
Can I leave him alive?

223
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,500
What a pity.

224
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,940
I can't kill the tiresome Junior Tientsin Mystic and Ding Mao.

225
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,470
But everything is not important now.

226
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,500
I've achieved my goal.

227
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,550
Are you all right?

228
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,630
That's too horrible.

229
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,930
They bite everyone they see.

230
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,910
I just sent Huang Yu to Xiao Xiguan Prison.

231
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,940
I was thinking to have a good sleep.

232
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,870
But suddenly I

233
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,800
heard calls from two gods in in bewilderment.

234
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,590
They asked me to be here.

235
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,690
Gods.

236
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,120
Yes. Where there you are,

237
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,580
there must some big issues happen.

238
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,360
You must be jinx.

239
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,940
Sir Fu, have you had your dinner?

240
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,900
Aren't you Gods descend to the Earth?

241
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
Come here to meet the Gods.

242
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,640
Come. Hurry up.

243
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,810
Enough. My life will be shorter.

244
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,610
You must pay attention to someone,

245
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,330
whose name is Lian Huaqing.

246
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,720
Check every guest and staff.

247
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,370
He has short hair, in boots and striped suits.

248
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,810
He also wears hat, scarf and gloves.

249
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,350
Xia Mohai

250
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,130
Sir

251
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,080
If some could encounter the God once during his lifetime,

252
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,190
that's a big thing, right?

253
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,560
Surely.

254
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,700
How can we get the luck

255
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,800
all the time?

256
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,360
And we meet two Gods.

257
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,270
Is this Miss Wang?

258
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,100
Xia Mohai.

259
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,760
Come here.

260
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,060
Hurry up. Drive Miss Wang home safely.

261
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,550
Leave those Gods and the drunk alone.

262
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,160
Hurry up. Hurry up. Okay.

263
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,990
Let's go.

264
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,280
Are you okay?

265
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,040
For the business with English,

266
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,470
I think you don't need to pay much attention.

267
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,510
It's a good thing not to work with that greedy guys.

268
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,810
I was born in a rich family.

269
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,650
I haven't suffered a little since I was young.

270
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,950
But I always think

271
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,120
the days after I came to Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

272
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,430
are good time.

273
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,250
Although there is only me left,

274
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,270
I haven't change my mind.

275
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,920
In the past I always complained your Uncle Hu.

276
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,120
He treated you as his own son.

277
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,840
But didn't I treat you so?

278
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,150
Master, I beg you.

279
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,980
Don't search for me.

280
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,030
No matter where I go,

281
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,190
I always treat Chamber of Commerce as my home in my heart.

282
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,530
I will always bear you in my mind,

283
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,390
just like Tianming.

284
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:15,430
♫Swallow. Swallow. Another year after last goodbye.

285
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:24,230
Come here. Come here. I would like to lend you several rafters.

286
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:31,270
Your last nest is old and incomplete.

287
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,240
Go to fetch some earth and grasses.

288
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,420
Take the advantage of sunny day to amend your home.

289
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,700
Swallow. Swallow. Don't live indoors.

290
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:58,410
Close the windows. Close the windows.Will you come back or not?

291
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:05,270
You had better nest your home at the eaves of a veranda.

292
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,100
Both you and me are convenient.

293
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,220
We will get along with each other well.

294
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:36,800
Swallow. Swallow. Another year after last goodbye.

295
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,810
Come here. Come here. I would like to lend you several rafters.♫

296
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,400
You like listening to music.

297
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,360
What is your name?

298
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,390
Ashuang.

299
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,240
Ashuang.

300
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,530
Your name sounds better than the song.

301
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,930
My father named me.

302
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,430
Your father told you to come here.

303
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,500
How could they let you come to a place like this?

304
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,490
Are you afraid?

305
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,470
A little bit.

306
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,190
Don't be afraid, Ashuang.

307
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,420
You see, everyone here is locked up.

308
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,980
Just like me,

309
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,010
locked up in this room.

310
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,460
I can't go anywhere.

311
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,180
Ashuang,

312
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,130
Where's my meal?

313
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,330
I can't see.

314
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,630
Could you pass it to me closer?

315
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,500
Thanks, Ashuang.

316
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,720
You are a good girl.

317
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,280
Why are you locked up here?

318
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,850
Because people outside are afraid of being hypnotized by me.

319
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,450
Hypnotize?

320
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,460
It's like magic.

321
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,600
It can make disobedient children

322
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,260
very obedient.

323
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,820
So as long as you go to school,

324
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,690
all the students will become very obedient?

325
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,310
Not all people can be hypnotized.

326
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,260
Such as an deaf and blind old man

327
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,290
or an innocent child.

328
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,820
But who knows?

329
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,760
There's always a way.

330
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,430
Mr. Guo.

331
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,610
Have you deciphered it？

332
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,850
You're really awesome.

333
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,890
Just five words?

334
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,540
That's all that can be deciphered.

335
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,010
Too little?

336
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,690
No.

337
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,880
It's just that there are a lot of words in the original file.

338
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,140
I didn't expect it is

339
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,360
such a meaningless sentence.

340
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,120
Xiao Xiguan Special.

341
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,580
Xiao Xiguan?

342
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,280
Xiao Xiguan Prison.

343
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,250
It is the most heavily guarded prison in Tianjin,

344
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,180
where many important prisoners are held.

345
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,630
I think the person you're looking for

346
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,530
should be held there.

347
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,690
Special refers to a prisoner

348
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,270
who is given special treatment.

349
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,280
Thanks.

350
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,020
What's wrong?

351
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,670
Hunag Yu has just been  imprisoned there.

352
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,190
There's something wrong with that place.

353
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,260
I‘ve to go there.

354
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,200
Wait.

355
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,500
Don't you thank me

356
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,340
for helping you so much?

357
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,170
Yes, yes.

358
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,680
I really need to thank you.

359
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,200
Well.

360
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,690
My junior fellow apprentice, Ding Mao.

361
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,090
You two know each other.

362
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,780
He is nice and rich.

363
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,110
And the most important thing is that he isn't an evil-minded people.

364
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,930
He's old enough now.

365
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,740
His father died early and he is the only son.

366
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,100
I can get you two together.

367
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,050
What do you think?

368
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,980
No.

369
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,860
So what do you want?

370
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,750
Actually, I've always wanted to

371
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,850
know something about the Demon Sect.

372
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,710
If you really want to thank me,

373
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,290
take me with you to investigate the case.

374
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,310
Anything else is fine, not this one.

375
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,170
See you.

376
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,770
Is Xiao Xiguan Prison a place

377
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,950
where you can enter if you want,

378
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,550
and a place where you can investigate a case if you want?

379
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,140
I think you know very well that,

380
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,450
in this respect,

381
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,770
my identity has certain advantages.

382
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,010
Yes, yes, yes.

383
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,000
Chief, don't worry.

384
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,940
I understand.

385
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,740
I have a responsibility this time.

386
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,210
It must be handled properly.

387
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,210
I'll deal with it right away.

388
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,010
Immediately.

389
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,420
Chief, you must take care of your health.

390
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,170
You can rest assured about us.

391
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,900
We must...

392
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,200
Hello?

393
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,890
Captain Fu.

394
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,700
Where are the bodies in the consulate?

395
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,210
It must be burned immediately and it's very dangerous.

396
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,740
I'm talking to you.

397
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,100
Burn it, burn it.

398
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,940
Set the fire and burn down the police station as well.

399
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,950
The leader said,

400
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,910
someone must be responsible for

401
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,380
the death of the British consul.

402
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,290
Can I responsible for it?

403
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,040
Can you?

404
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,490
I may be fired

405
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,580
in next few days.

406
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,890
I do know who can help you keep your position.

407
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,950
Who?

408
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,750
You take me to Xiao Xiguan to interrogate Huangyu,

409
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,880
and then I will tell you.

410
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,870
Please.

411
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:45,910
Have a seat.

412
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,070
Miss Xiao, our place is quite special.

413
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,490
Please forgive me

414
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,870
if the hospitality is not good enough.

415
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,570
It is because the guards are conscientious and responsible,

416
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,730
and the warden manages the prison well that

417
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,320
Xiao Xiguan can become

418
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,750
the strictest prison in Tianjin.

419
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,100
Miss Xiao is really silver tongued.

420
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,990
This is all thanks to Secretary General Xiao.

421
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,920
His management is excellent.

422
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,630
We're just his assistants.

423
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,409
Have some black tea, Miss Xiao.

424
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,800
Ok, thanks.

425
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,730
With all due respect, this is?

426
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,980
Mr. Guo, my assistant.

427
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,270
Mr. Guo, what do you want to drink?

428
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,120
Just the same.

429
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,250
Ok, wait a moment please.

430
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,820
Go on.

431
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,889
Don't talk like squeezing the toothpaste.

432
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,090
The chief want to find someone to take charge.

433
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,370
To put it bluntly, he just wants to find someone to be the scapegoat.

434
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,650
Who do you think can

435
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,090
suppress the British Consulate in Tianjin?

436
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,230
Who?

437
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,460
Of cause British themselves.

438
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,300
Can you speak to the point?

439
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,600
We've dealt with

440
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,800
the British Consulate several times.

441
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,320
They are blatantly accepting bribes,

442
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,900
and very venal and corrupt.

443
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,370
They have many enemies in Tianjin as well.

444
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,530
Now the person has died in their own consulate.

445
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,550
How big a security breach is this?

446
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,930
The spread of this story will only make them a laughingstock.

447
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,840
So they must be afraid to make it public.

448
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,150
That makes sense.

449
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,850
But there has to be an explanation.

450
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,650
Insist that the dead body of the British Consulate

451
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,920
was caused by an infection

452
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,150
caused by a kind of parasite

453
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,030
when the British ship opium to us.

454
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,480
Say it again.

455
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,810
Insist that the dead body of the British Consulate

456
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,350
was caused by an infection

457
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,680
caused by a kind of parasite

458
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,790
when the British

459
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,090
ship opium to us.

460
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,740
Where are the parasites?

461
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,120
You're asking me to lie.

462
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,260
My German mentor, Dr. Schroeder.

463
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,720
He has a good personal relationship with the German consul.

464
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,950
I can ask him to prove that

465
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,890
it's the British that brought parasites to Tianjin.

466
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,200
German,

467
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:08,810
British.

468
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,490
People who have studied abroad

469
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,180
really have methods.

470
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm just talking about the facts.

471
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,160
Don't worry, Captain Fu.

472
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,730
I'm sure you can keep your position.

473
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,840
But what I'm worried about now is Huang Yu.

474
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm afraid he will make trouble in there.

475
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,150
Why are you always

476
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,250
wrestling with a madman?

477
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,450
It is not certain whether he is really mad or not.

478
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,060
I saw a newly published medical paper

479
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,520
about psychiatric testing in Germany.

480
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,470
We can use it to test Huang Yu.
