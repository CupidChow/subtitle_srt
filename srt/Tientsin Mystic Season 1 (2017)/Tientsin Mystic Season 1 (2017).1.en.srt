1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,590
Nine rivers flow down to meet in Tianjin.

3
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,030
There are three bridges and two passes.

4
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,310
Many people live on water,

5
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,670
and many die from it.

6
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,310
People who live near water use water

7
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,790
and respect it.

8
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,110
For those who live in Tianjin,

9
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,829
the most important thing

10
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,750
must be the River Worship Ceremony.

11
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:35,350
The spirits in the mountains want my life.

12
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:49,710
The ghosts in the water want my soul.

13
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:00,830
I take my heart to feed the god.

14
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,870
Once it's done.

15
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,830
Yes.

16
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,590
All is gone.

17
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,070
Yes.

18
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,030
Yes.

19
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,950
May the Black Tortoise conquer the river monsters and keep us safe and sound.

20
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,350
Bring the black tortoise.

21
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,630
Summon the Tientsin Mystic.

22
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,070
Tientsin Mystic. Tientsin Mystic. Tientsin Mystic.

23
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,590
Good.

24
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,710
Swim fast. Don't let them catch you.

25
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,550
What should we write in the report?

26
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,350
All good swimmers in the city come today.

27
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,950
As long as they can catch the tortoise,

28
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,790
they could get apprenticed to the Senior Tientsin Mystic.

29
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,510
Isn't it his apprentice

30
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,390
Guo Deyou wins every year?

31
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,470
What's the meaning of the competition?

32
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,790
That's why he was not allowed to take part in this year.

33
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,830
The leader is not in.

34
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,750
Other members in the Five Rivers Corpse Retrieval Team

35
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,270
might have a chance.

36
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,950
Ms. Lan,

37
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,350
Secretary General Xiao specifically

38
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,150
told our people

39
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,510
to keep you away from the wharf.

40
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,070
It's all in chaos here.

41
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,190
Shall we leave now?

42
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,270
Leave if you want.

43
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,670
I'll be in charge of the report.

44
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,710
Why are they all getting out?

45
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,630
They're getting out of the water!

46
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,590
Why are they running? What's wrong?

47
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,270
Tieniu, did you get it?

48
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,990
Tell me!

49
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,590
Did you get it?

50
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,350
Where is it?

51
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,510
Where is it?

52
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,150
Tell people to leave here.

53
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,830
Why?

54
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,590
Go.

55
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,710
Go. Go. Go.

56
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,990
Go. Go back.

57
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,030
What's going on?

58
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,790
I found a dead body.

59
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,710
Run! Run!

60
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,669
Water... Water Monkey!

61
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,350
Just a dead kid.

62
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,950
It's a dangerous world out there.

63
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,270
To live is to suffer.

64
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,750
To die is to relieve.

65
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,830
Tieniu,

66
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,270
go find someone

67
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,390
to help take the kid back.

68
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,080
Don't let him destroy this big day.

69
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,710
The tortoise is killing people!

70
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,550
Shut up!

71
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,030
The Black Tortoise is supposed to guard our safety.

72
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,590
He won't kill this kid!

73
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,110
I'm not talking about this kid.

74
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,710
There's an adult underwater.

75
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,270
Mr. Guo.

76
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,070
Mr. Guo.

77
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,270
Mr. Guo.

78
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,350
Something wrong with  the River Worship Ceremony.

79
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,830
Mr. Guo.

80
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,310
Mr. Guo.

81
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,430
Tieniu and other people were chasing the tortoise,

82
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,430
yet he dredged a dead kid

83
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,270
and said there were an adult underwater as well.

84
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,350
Mr. Guo.

85
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,030
Mr. Guo.

86
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,150
Everybody's wating for you at the wharf.

87
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,670
The police has already been there.

88
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,630
Mr. Guo.

89
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,830
Mr. Guo.

90
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,550
Deyou!

91
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,990
Guo Deyou!

92
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,910
Behave yourself.

93
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,870
Where did you go yesterday?

94
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,870
Don't you see I was holding my breath?

95
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,310
When I do the practice, will you please...

96
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,990
Where did you go yesterday?

97
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,590
I'm warning you.

98
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,870
This barrel is what Master Guo passed on to me.

99
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,070
If you break it,

100
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,390
what else can I use for herb brewing

101
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,390
and breath-holding training?

102
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,870
You've got four different scents on your clothes,

103
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,870
and they all smell expensive.

104
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,870
What a playboy you are!

105
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,430
Tell me about it.

106
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,070
Who are those girls?

107
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,430
Who do you think you are?

108
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,030
I can do whatever I want.

109
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,070
None of your business.

110
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,550
Cool. Then I'll burn these clothes.

111
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,710
Master Ding!

112
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,830
Who?

113
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,310
Ding Mao.

114
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,990
The only child of Ding Yiqiu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

115
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,830
Young Master,

116
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,390
it's only been a few days since you left.

117
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,750
The Chamber of Commerce got into a mess.

118
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,710
You must come back with me.

119
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,950
Young Master. Young Master.

120
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,030
Almost all the people in the city have been searching him.

121
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,550
People in the Chamber of Commerce almost got crazy.

122
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,150
How come you found it?

123
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,230
I dredged him up from the river.

124
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,110
To show appreciation,

125
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,630
he treated me to a good restaurant.

126
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,510
What kind of restaurant got that strong scent of women?

127
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,230
It's got good ambience there.

128
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,150
Where?

129
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,430
Where?

130
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,310
-Just...
-Where!

131
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:49,990
Cang Cui Tower.

132
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,150
Is it a restaurant?

133
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,190
You could dine there.

134
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,430
Guo Deyou!

135
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,430
You have exactly the same bad tamper

136
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,430
as your crazy mom.

137
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,190
Aren't you supposed to be at the river

138
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,590
to deal with that tortoise?

139
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,470
There're dead bodies in the river.

140
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,830
What a big deal.

141
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,790
Haven't they ever saw dead bodies?

142
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,590
We've got our team members there, right?

143
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,390
Have they got the bodies?

144
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,790
We couldn't dredge it.

145
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,670
That's why I came to ask you.

146
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,510
Couldn't be dredged...

147
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,710
Good morning, Master.

148
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,230
Morning. Morning.

149
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,070
Take care.

150
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,470
Baby. Come on. One more kiss.

151
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,630
One more kiss.

152
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,270
Stop it.

153
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,630
Come on. Just one more kiss.

154
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,230
Master.

155
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,030
Did you have a good sleep?

156
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,990
If you still feel tired,

157
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,190
go back to the room and get some rest.

158
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,110
If you do have a good sleep,

159
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,750
please get the bill paied.

160
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,590
What's the bill?

161
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,910
Your friend's feast at Fu Xiang Room

162
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,870
was paid by us.

163
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,270
My friend?

164
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,310
Do you know him?

165
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,270
Everyone knows the Junior Tientsin Mystic,

166
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,270
Guo Deyou.

167
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,030
Where can I find him?

168
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,550
All right. Stop searching the pocket.

169
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,350
Sign your name here.

170
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,470
Later

171
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,870
we'll have someone go to your home

172
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,110
to collect the bill.

173
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,630
Do you know where I live?

174
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,550
How do I run a whorehouse

175
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,230
if I know nothing about the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation？

176
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,670
What do you run?

177
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,710
A whorehouse!

178
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,870
The River Worship Ceremony is just holding right now.

179
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,750
The Junior Tientsin Mystic is definitely busy with it.

180
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,750
Small. Small. Small.

181
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,190
Four, four, and six. Big!

182
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,990
Eating, drinking and going whoring lose money,

183
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,350
but gambling brings me some incomes.

184
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,310
That is exactly because you let me win.

185
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,990
Fine.

186
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,550
Go. Go. Go.

187
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,630
It is said that Master Guo has the gambling luck.

188
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,150
No one can win all the time. It is just for pleasure.

189
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,830
All right! Let's play a game.

190
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,510
If I win,

191
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,270
you need to find a person for me. Sorry to trouble you.

192
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,550
Supervisor Hu,

193
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,390
who will believe the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation needs help?

194
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,230
The Young Master of the chamber vanished.

195
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,030
I would definitely worry.

196
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,030
If it happens on the ground,

197
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,630
the chamber will have various ways to deal with it.

198
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,270
However,  it does in the water,

199
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,670
we can only rely on you.

200
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,870
I am too weak to go into the river.

201
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,830
How about your apprentice?

202
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,430
The Junior Tientsin Mystic Guo Deyou.

203
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,430
Yu Si.

204
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,950
The payment must be enough.

205
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,590
You must know the job of the corpse retrieval team.

206
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,310
It is only for dead bodies.

207
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,950
If it is alive,

208
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,070
the payment should be more.

209
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,230
You mean

210
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,910
you know he is alive?

211
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,710
Smoke less! It is harmful.

212
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,550
Go. Go.

213
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,230
Move. Move.

214
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,070
Move. Don't see it.

215
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,990
Hurry up! Hurry up!

216
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,230
Leave here quickly, and keep an eye on children and woman.

217
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,550
Go home to cook.

218
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:54,870
Be quick.

219
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,030
It might be a stillbirth when it was born.

220
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,910
If it was alive, they couldn't afford to raise it.

221
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,109
Or it might be a shameful bastard.

222
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,790
Miss Xiao, why not just let it go?

223
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,230
River Worship Ceremony is such a vital day,

224
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,430
and we cannot let people sorrow.

225
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,390
OK?

226
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,910
Our agency is doing nothing but supervising.

227
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,710
It is your Police Station that will give an explanation to the public.

228
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,950
It makes me guilty to

229
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,790
only report good news, Vice Captain.

230
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,190
Besides, I am also the one of ordinary people.

231
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:27,990
Oh! My lady.

232
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,190
How can you said you were the same as those people?

233
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,830
San Ye comes here.

234
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,790
Lady, the Secretary General invites you to go back.

235
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,590
The wharf is not safe.

236
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,790
You should go back and tell my dad.

237
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,990
If the turtle cannot be caught,

238
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,670
my work won't be done.

239
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,150
The Secretary General said you must go back before lunch.

240
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,710
The Junior Tientsin Mystic is coming.

241
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,790
The Junior Tientsin Mystic is coming.

242
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,190
The Junior Tientsin Mystic is coming.

243
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,430
Thanks for your praise.

244
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,110
Thanks.

245
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,910
Where do we go for lunch?

246
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,790
Zhu Laosan,

247
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,830
you have time to join in the fun,

248
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,310
while you don't have time to escort your mother to see a doctor, do you?

249
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,470
No. No. No.

250
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,350
That's fine.

251
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,470
Nice hat!

252
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,990
Do you want me to lower my head?

253
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,390
Junior Tientsin Mystic, come here.

254
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,070
Master Guo.

255
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,630
Mom.

256
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,590
You cannot go into the river.

257
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,430
The turtle we invited is supposed to suppress river monsters,

258
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,830
while it changed into the river monster,

259
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,750
and killed someone.

260
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,510
Coward!

261
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,430
You literally can't do this.

262
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,990
We can make a living as long as there are dead bodies in the river.

263
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,110
Check out by the number.

264
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,230
Don't stop me from earning money.

265
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,830
Excuse me!

266
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,510
Who is he?

267
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,550
Don't you see the warning line?

268
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,030
I am a friend of Junior Tientsin Mystic.

269
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,070
Why don't you say you are the father of Senior Tientsin Mystic.

270
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,830
Go back.

271
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,310
Stop!

272
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,070
Stop!

273
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,350
You are not allowed to enter! Keep your hands off me!

274
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,230
I know him.

275
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,430
Get out! You are not allowed to enter.

276
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,110
Behave well.

277
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,630
Have you ever seen I used it?

278
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,590
It is a different occasion.

279
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,270
You have to get into the river with it.

280
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,710
Untie it for me! I am in a hindrance!

281
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,790
You are not allowed to get into the water if you don't use it.

282
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,030
Hurry up!

283
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,310
It is informed that you are not allowed to enter.

284
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,590
Can you guys handle it?

285
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,990
If he is irrelevant personnel, drive him away!

286
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,710
Such an annoying man!

287
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,350
I am Ding Mao.

288
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,990
Who?

289
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,230
Ding Mao.

290
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,230
The son of Ding Yiqiu

291
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,470
of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation?

292
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,630
Young Master.

293
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh my dear lord!

294
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,510
How can you be here?

295
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,550
I've been looking for you everywhere.

296
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,190
Guo Deyou!

297
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,430
Come here!

298
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,430
Guo Deyou!

299
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,190
Who is he?

300
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,230
A fair weather friend.

301
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,870
Look at you.

302
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,790
How thin you are!

303
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,590
But it is fine

304
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,990
that you are safe.

305
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,310
Send a message to the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation right now!

306
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,750
It is our police station

307
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,230
that finds the young master for them.

308
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:46,990
Okay?

309
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,230
I'm going to ask Guo Deyou something.

310
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,790
Be careful!

311
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,670
You must make it clear!

312
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,910
Stop!

313
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,270
What a troublemaker!

314
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,010
We police squad

315
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,930
made all efforts

316
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,050
to find the Young Master finally.

317
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,370
How senseless you are!

318
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,130
Go away!

319
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,610
Master Guo!

320
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,290
Why are you here?

321
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,480
It's good to see you.

322
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,020
Deyou!

323
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,350
OK. OK. OK.

324
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,580
What are you doing?

325
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:21,940
Okay.

326
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,460
Why did you take me to that place?

327
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,950
Tie Niu,

328
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,290
drag the body out of the water.

329
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,500
You must remember,

330
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,140
if you tell others, I'll...

331
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,620
I'm sorry for your father's death.

332
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,540
Chairman. Chairman. Chairman.

333
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,450
Chairman. Chairman. Chairman.

334
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,280
Yu Si.

335
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,260
Clear up this place quickly.

336
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,020
Quickly! Clear up!

337
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,270
Excuse me!

338
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,600
My girl, let's go quickly!

339
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
Please hurry up!

340
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,800
I'll leave with my apprentice.

341
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,670
Go. Go. Go.

342
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,070
Thanks for your hard work.

343
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,380
Stop looking at that!

344
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,730
Go!

345
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,430
Let's go! Go!

346
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,670
Put on your clothes firstly. Go!

347
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,500
Miss Xiao,

348
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,350
please don't make me trap in a dilemma.

349
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,860
San Ye. Go please!

350
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,180
Let's go! Lady.

351
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,790
Make sure all people leave!

352
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,600
Yes, sir!

353
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,310
What's wrong?

354
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,830
There is a black tortoise statue

355
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,840
that I've never seen before.

356
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,210
I don't know when it sank in the deep water.

357
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,170
The body was tied on it

358
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,700
tightly

359
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,190
in the deep water.

360
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,710
That's why Tie Niu and others couldn't drag it out.

361
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,870
How could you do it?

362
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,990
If what you said is true, why could you do this?

363
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,440
The water in which my father was tied  is so deep.

364
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,480
But you've stayed in the deep water for five minutes.

365
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,910
It took much oxygen consumption

366
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,350
for you to dive and untie him.

367
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,590
You were also influenced by the water pressure.

368
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,380
An average man couldn't do it!

369
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,820
It isn't scientific!

370
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,830
What do you mean? Young Master.

371
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,360
How did my father die?

372
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,030
It is through body retrieval that

373
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,460
we earn a living.

374
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,830
I've practiced it since I was a child.

375
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,910
I'm not an average people

376
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,990
but an honest man!

377
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,130
You saved me yesterday,

378
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,250
and saved my father today.

379
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,120
What a coincidence!

380
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,920
What's your purpose?

381
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,250
What do you intend to do to the Chamber of Commerce?

382
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,810
No wonder my master teaches me to search dead body only.

383
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,630
Because in this world,

384
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,030
it is better to save a dog

385
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,360
than a living man.

386
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,420
Young Master,

387
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,410
what do you want to do?

388
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,680
Guo Deyou must be a suspect.

389
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,810
I will identify the corpse.

390
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:56,480
Young Master.

391
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,200
Master, stop!

392
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,000
Please stop!

393
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,710
Your dad wanted you to manage the Chamber of Commerce.

394
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,970
You didn't want to do that,

395
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,500
and wanted to learn autopsy in the western world.

396
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,570
He supported you.

397
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,150
Can you behave yourself?

398
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,780
If you must cut your dad's body,

399
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,720
you cut me firstly!

400
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,890
Now,

401
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,520
you two should first think about

402
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,920
how to arrange Chairman Ding's funeral

403
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,980
instead of quarreling with each other.

404
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,190
Young Master,

405
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,630
as a son,

406
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,950
you cut your dad's body

407
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,610
in public.

408
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,870
It seems a little monstrous.

409
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,290
If I don't cut the body,

410
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,970
how can I know the cause of my father's death?

411
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,180
You tell me.

412
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,720
Since you returned home lately, you don't know that.

413
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,300
Water of nine rivers in the downstream city Tientsin,

414
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,810
can flows into the sea after passing through three pontoon bridges and two checkpoints.

415
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,690
Everything related to water in the place

416
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,520
can be known by our Senior Tientsin Mystic.

417
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,700
In particular, his analysis by lighting cigarette

418
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,850
is well-known,

419
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,620
but few people have seen it.

420
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,360
I have seen it.

421
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,860
Since you guys are busy with it,

422
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:11,990
I will go.

423
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,580
Master Guo,

424
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,280
please don't put me off.

425
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,740
If you leave,

426
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,440
we cannot deal with it.

427
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,930
Let me speak frankly.

428
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,450
What I analyze

429
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,060
may not be what you guys want to know.

430
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,920
I will go first.

431
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,100
You can call me when you get the result.

432
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,360
Stay here. Just keep a good distance.

433
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,680
My apprentice is weak,

434
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,460
so he cannot stand the smell of smoke.

435
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,300
Filled with grievances,

436
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,090
thy soul could revive through the smoke.

437
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,550
Leave the deep water.

438
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,190
Enter the pure land later.

439
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,640
Master Guo, have you got the result?

440
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,940
It's about deities and evil spirits.

441
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,670
What is his grievance?

442
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,760
After what you said,

443
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,140
I feel more confused.

444
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,160
It's not the right time to reveal it.

445
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,830
Master Guo.

446
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,630
Master Guo.

447
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,340
Master Guo, don't rush to go!

448
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,310
Give me an answer.

449
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,010
What's the cause of the chairman's death?

450
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,600
The two Tientsin Mystics,

451
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,200
have you got the result

452
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,700
after you lighted the cigarette?

453
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,780
Don't call me Tientsin Mystic.

454
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,140
It's too much for me.

455
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,530
What's up with you, Master?

456
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,500
The two dead bodies must have problems.

457
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,090
I know you have got the result.

458
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,440
Why can't you tell them?

459
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,820
Today, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is dead and his son is alive.

460
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,320
Do you know them?

461
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,350
We all live in Tientsin.

462
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,310
It is not strange to know them.

463
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,700
What happened to these two dead bodies?

464
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,150
Anyway, you have to give an answer.

465
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,580
It is easy to explain rationality,

466
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,520
but difficult to explain sensibility.

467
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,970
It's okay for you to keep people guessing,

468
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,590
but they will grumble finally.

469
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,220
They'll think the Senior Tientsin Mystic isn't legendarily powerful anymore.

470
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,370
You should't think of yourself as a Tientsin Mystic,

471
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,740
even though others think so.

472
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,870
The title of Tientsin Mystic represents people's respect for us.

473
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,280
The sage Confucius who is adept at the pen and the sage Guan Yu who is adept at the sword

474
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,920
are both mortal.

475
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,790
They are ordinary people rather than deities.

476
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,920
We just want to make a living through hard work.

477
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,180
It will shorten our normal span of life to be called Tientsin Mystic.

478
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,700
Master, are you okay?

479
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,990
Your behavior has been abnormal since you came back from the wharf.

480
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,190
It is late.

481
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,740
Time for bed.

482
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
Simmer with grievances.

483
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,200
Revive thy soul through the smoke.

484
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,870
Leave the deep water.

485
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,130
Enter the pure land later.

486
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,070
Young Master. Young Master. Young Master.

487
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,710
Let's put it here.

488
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,500
OK.

489
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,530
Please go out.

490
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,580
I want to stay alone with my father.

491
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,710
Yes.

492
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,430
I am your father!

493
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,560
You are the farther of the one hundred

494
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,990
and even one thousand people who serve you.

495
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,980
I am what I am!

496
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,840
I am not one of the thousand of yours!

497
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm not asking your opinion here!

498
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,070
You have to sign your name

499
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,740
and show up at the Take-over Ceremony.

500
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,780
Other matters

501
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,420
will be arranged by Supervisor Hu.

502
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,160
It will be comfortable for you to be the chairman.

503
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,290
You have so many competent candidates.

504
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,170
Why do I have to be the chairman?

505
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,390
You are my only son!

506
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,490
You arranged for me to study trade in Germany,

507
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,110
but what I learned was  forensics.

508
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,360
I！

509
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,370
Don't have any confidence

510
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,900
or interest in the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation!

511
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:03,250
There will be no room for you in the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

512
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,360
Okay.

513
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,390
Go out!

514
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,430
Hello! Supervisor Hu!

515
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,960
Supervisor Hu!

516
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,330
Supervisor Hu!

517
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,840
What was my father's last words

518
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,380
before he died?

519
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,070
When you come back, he'll tie you

520
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,340
and whip you fiercely.

521
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,350
Since the railway was built,

522
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,980
it has been difficult to embark on grain transportation

523
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,960
because of official taxes and foreign interference.

524
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,270
I suggested that

525
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,320
he should have a rest after the lifelong work.

526
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,520
He said,

527
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,090
if he had a rest, what would workers in the wharf do to make a living?

528
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,929
And what would the ordinary people along the Haihe River do?

529
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,110
But now,

530
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,020
he is having a real rest,

531
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,150
not getting up any more.

532
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,030
He isn't willing to have a rest.

533
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,150
His death isn't decent.

534
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,080
He has soaked in the river for a long time.

535
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,120
How painful it was!

536
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,990
Have you learned nothing from Master Guo?

537
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,400
It was extremely strange in the river.

538
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,980
What did Master Guo analyze on earth?

539
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,220
You didn't say that on purpose?

540
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,330
It is said that lighting cigarette will help analyze the grievance,

541
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,260
but everyone thinks it will settle a lawsuit.

542
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,630
Is it useful?

543
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,510
You are good at Zhangtianshi's Operator,

544
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,850
and you know whether it is useful or not.

545
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,190
It depends on you.

546
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,310
I don't agree if you said that.

547
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,310
It was

548
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,970
the River Worship Ceremony yesterday

549
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,110
that brought happiness, health, peace

550
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,310
and stability to us.

551
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,850
How dare you doubt it?

552
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,180
Do you have the veneration in your heart?

553
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,240
I don't know whether it can bring peace and stability to us.

554
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,830
I do know it is our corpse retrieval team that

555
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,410
helps search bodies in the river.

556
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,890
Without our River Worship Ceremony,

557
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,010
who can invite a Tientsin Mystic to catch river monsters?

558
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,060
And how can you select people for your corpse retrieval team?

559
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,070
The Tientsin Mystic you invited was a crazy turtle

560
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,940
that ran fast.

561
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,730
You stopped others from finding it on purpose.

562
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,850
That was the Tientsin Mystic I invited,

563
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,210
so it swam fast.

564
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,460
Without your stimulating injection,

565
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,430
could it swim fast?

566
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,740
Why did they ban you from the River Worship Ceremony?

567
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,960
Is it because you are the annually consecutive winner?

568
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,050
It has been proved that they are incompetent.

569
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,370
It is a daydream to catch the Tientsin Mystic I invited.

570
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,980
And,

571
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,100
you are the only apprentice of Master Guo.

572
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,370
If they did catch the Tientsin Mystic (the turtle),

573
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,560
would they really become the apprentices of Master Guo

574
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,800
and  the junior fellow apprentices of you?

575
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,960
What are you going to do?

576
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,800
The servant girl sent breakfast and found he wasn't there.

577
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,450
We dispatched two people to search,

578
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,270
but there wasn't any news all day.

579
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,420
We were so anxious

580
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,570
that we called the police to scout.

581
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,560
And then,

582
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,950
it was what happened in the River Worship Ceremony.

583
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,670
Supervisor Hu.

584
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,930
Come! Come here!

585
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,000
Put it here!

586
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,360
OK. OK. OK.

587
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,030
Please hurry!

588
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,080
Okay. Go!

589
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,990
OK.

590
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,060
Here is your spirit amid the misty rain.

591
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,850
There are people wearing hemp mourning garment.

592
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,230
We are extremely heartbroken when hearing your death.

593
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,770
Do you know him?

594
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,650
My family of three went fishing that year.

595
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,270
We had a narrow escape from the stormy waves

596
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,340
thanks to the help from the Chamber of Commerce.

597
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,660
Chairman Ding ordered his people

598
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,080
to save us.

599
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,350
Chairman Ding.

600
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,100
What a good man you are!

601
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,560
This bro,

602
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,350
can you allow me to

603
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,170
stay alone with Chairman Ding for a while?

604
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,250
I want to express my sincere gratitude to him

605
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,020
for saving my family and me.

606
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,200
Well,

607
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,510
you'd better make it short, please!

608
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,380
Thank you!

609
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,430
You're welcome.

610
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,510
Thank you!

611
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,020
Please close the door!

612
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,210
Thanks.

613
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,820
Come! You two! Close the door!

614
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,960
Thank you!

615
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,500
Deyou, you are too weak.

616
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,680
Uncle Guo won't let you light the cigarette.

617
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,930
Believe it or not.

618
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,220
I have learned to light cigarette to analyze grievances.

619
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,300
Deyou, what's wrong with you?

620
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,310
Deyou!

621
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,720
Guo Deyou!
