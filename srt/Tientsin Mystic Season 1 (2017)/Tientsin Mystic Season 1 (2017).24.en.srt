1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,270
Continuing from where we left off.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,380
Last time we talked about,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,410
the unknown fate of Guo and Gu in the water prison.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,500
Guo De-you fell into a deep trance,

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,080
and hallucinated all kinds of people.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,900
In the face of danger, Guo Chun awakened the Junior Tientsin Mystic.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,800
Guo De-you woke up

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,920
and dragged the Little Immortal into the water, drowning him.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,660
The two successfully extricated themselves.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,340
Xiao San stopped Xiao Lan-lan

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,960
to tell her that Lian Hua-qing was up to something big，

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,010
and that Guo De-you had fallen for the Demonic Cult and could no longer be trusted.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,800
Guo De-you found out that he is the Holy Child

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,340
and decided to part ways with Gu Ying.

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,370
Heartbroken and dispirited, Gu Ying drank poison.

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,570
Lian Hua-qing brought the Junior Tientsin Mystic to the abandoned factory again.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,070
They reached the underground cave via a hidden passageway.

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,430
The Tianjin Guard searched the whole city to arrest Guo De-you.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,150
Ding Mao and Father Xiao's relationship broke down.

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,170
Xiao Lan-lan left along with Ding Mao.

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,340
Ding Mao worshipped the deceased sages at the Chamber of Commerce，

23
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,640
then led the gang to the factory

24
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,440
to fight with members of the Demonic Cult.

25
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,790
In the middle of the fight, the factory chimney blew up with a great bang.

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,360
Grievances precede the plan's execution.

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,950
Carnal punishment precedes the scheme's success.

28
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,280
The hero beats his chest and the beauty weeps tears of blood.

29
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,280
From that moment on, the Tientsin Mystic exists no more.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,320
Do you still dare to beat others up?

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,550
They deserved it for saying that I don't have a father.

32
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,690
Master, why can't I call you father?

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,470
The one who births and raises you is your father.

34
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,450
I only raised you.

35
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,110
I cannot have you call me father.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,370
A teacher for a day is a father for a lifetime.

37
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,000
It's only an appellation.

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,700
We shouldn't concern ourselves over it.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,820
How many are left?

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,630
Two.

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,810
How many?

42
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,840
Three.

43
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,680
Someone once told me,

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,720
and I have always remembered it,

45
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,880
that one cannot stop a river from flowing into the sea.

46
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,730
It's now time for this river to flow into the sea.

47
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,339
Even if it doesn't make a big splash,

48
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,320
at least I have rushed through this journey

49
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,390
without looking back.

50
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,839
At least it will be more meaningful

51
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,300
than flowing over stones and leaves

52
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,040
in the woods.

53
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,070
Haven't you always wanted to

54
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,260
eradicate the Demonic Cult?

55
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,090
The Demonic Cult can be eradicated,

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,300
but the human heart can't be cleansed.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Xue Yuan-yuan

58
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,270
was killed by her own father Xue Qing-yang.

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,640
Her child

60
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,770
was thrown into the river by Ding Yi-qiu.

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,740
Ding Yi-qiu and Shopkeeper Wang

62
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,710
were killed by Supervisor Hu.

63
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,640
Feng Er-ma was killed by one of his own, Sun Lao-qi.

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,820
Those who stormed the British Consulate

65
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,350
and killed the British counsul

66
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,200
were zombies created by Mrs. Hu.

67
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,720
Her own son

68
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,510
Hu Tian-ming was one of them.

69
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,570
As for Huang Yi-suo,

70
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,100
he was killed by his younger brother Huang Yu.

71
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,570
Miss Xiao's fiancé, Mr. Qian,

72
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,530
and over 100 bodies in the Hai River,

73
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,540
were all killed by Ding Mao's father Ding Yi-qiu

74
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,240
with opium.

75
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,430
The Demonic Cult are the true victims.

76
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,420
They are just a group of patients

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,250
who want to alleviate their own pain.

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,250
What's wrong about that?

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,800
The root of this pain,

80
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,930
and the origin of the Demonic Cult

81
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,150
are here.

82
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,760
Lan-lan! Lan-lan!

83
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,690
Lan-lan!

84
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,070
I'm dying.

85
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,780
I'm dying, Young Master.

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm dying.

87
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,710
Stay still.

88
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,100
I am going to get help.

89
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,400
Wake up, Lan-lan!

90
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,430
Our brothers are all dead.

91
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,670
I am worried.

92
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,120
I can't leave in peace!

93
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,770
Yu Si!

94
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,730
Young Master, you are my family.

95
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,620
Without you and Old Master, I would be long dead.

96
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,300
Go!

97
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,340
Don't waste time on me.

98
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,940
Let's go!

99
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,930
Yu Si!

100
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,910
Even if the Demonic Cult were not eradicated completely

101
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,120
twenty years ago,

102
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,430
they became homeless outcasts.

103
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,550
How did you regain the faith of the followers

104
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,180
and make them believe

105
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,280
that you could end their pain?

106
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,800
How will they evolve if they end their pain?

107
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,070
They value of the Demonic Cult lies in

108
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,910
knowing and using pain.

109
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,880
How?

110
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,520
Obedient creatures.

111
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,820
You mean

112
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,100
the insects that can control dead bodies?

113
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,590
I merely gave them a choice

114
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,220
between decaying in the mud like fallen leaves

115
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,230
or offering their bodies to the Demonic Cult

116
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,260
for a second chance at life.

117
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,170
Unconscious bodies.. Do you consider that a new life?

118
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,800
Of course they are conscious.

119
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,860
Their consciousness is here.

120
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,930
The consciousness of the Demonic Cult.

121
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,590
It looks like

122
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,400
someone has been here before.

123
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,090
They all came for the Origin of Evil Water

124
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,680
and died for it in the end.

125
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,940
Knowing the fate of your predecessors,

126
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,690
why are you repeating history?

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,670
Predecessors?

128
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,790
They are fools.

129
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,170
No one knows evolution better than me.

130
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,190
You will see soon,

131
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,060
how much I have contributed towards evolution.

132
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,970
Do you have a light?

133
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,630
A part of the rock wall is hollow,

134
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,350
and there is the smell of kerosene.

135
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,700
There must be a hidden mechanism.

136
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,060
From infection to death,

137
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,950
it take a while for the disease to kill.

138
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,670
It's impossible to find

139
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,880
100 bodies in the Hai River everyday

140
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,310
to breed the corpse insects.

141
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,700
The zombies are just an experiment.

142
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,860
Perfectly combining the corpse insects and the Demonic Cult

143
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,250
is the next step towards evolution.

144
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,530
Guard this place.

145
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,590
Hold onto my hand!

146
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,280
Come on!

147
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,510
Are you alright?

148
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,010
I have been walking for so long

149
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,850
to find this place.

150
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,700
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

151
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,030
You even beat me to it.

152
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,310
The Origin of Evil Water.

153
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,240
It takes hundreds of thousands of years

154
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,240
for caves to form.

155
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,850
The Origin of Evil Water might have been here

156
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,210
long before humans existed.

157
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,830
I brought you here

158
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,120
so that you can witness

159
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,500
the evolution of mankind with me.

160
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,760
What do you mean exactly when you speak of evolution?

161
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,580
Why do you say that the Demonic Cult originated here?

162
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,580
Cut to the chase.

163
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,740
You have to show me

164
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,480
just how strong the Demonic Cult can become.

165
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,860
The flood in Tianjin more than twenty years ago

166
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,990
was caused by an earthquake

167
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,600
that caused the level of groundwater to change.

168
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,980
Water from the Origin of Evil Water,

169
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,310
flowed along the underground river,

170
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,830
and into a tributary of the Hai River,

171
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,160
infecting all of Qiming Village.

172
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,990
Are you saying that

173
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,270
the water here

174
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,080
can infect people with the disease of the Demonic Cult?

175
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,570
The Origin of Evil Water is not connected to any water system.

176
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,790
It exists independently underground.

177
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,680
The vibrations you felt before

178
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,520
were a simple test I did for the bombs.

179
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,700
Bombs?

180
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,740
A slight change in the water level

181
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,360
can infect all of Qiming Village.

182
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,020
If you blow up the pool of water,

183
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,370
the Origin of Evil Water will flow into the Hai River

184
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,230
and infect all of Tianjin, strengthening the Demonic Cult.

185
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,470
There are insects inside of me.

186
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,220
The Demonic Cult.

187
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,329
Blood.

188
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,780
Xiao San?

189
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,570
Control.

190
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,730
I... I can't control it.

191
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,210
Go!

192
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,330
Go!

193
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,620
The linked mechanism between these two statues

194
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,830
is used to transport supplies and building materials.

195
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,610
The speed can be adjusted by controlling the water flow.

196
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,080
This is the wisdom of predecessors.

197
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,380
How are they fools?

198
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,920
Of course they are fools.

199
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,200
Such exquisite construction is useless.

200
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,200
The beauty of the Origin of Evil Water lies not in construction

201
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,830
but in destruction.

202
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,340
When the water in the statue runs out,

203
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,230
the bomb will fall into the Origin of Evil Water.

204
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,550
You are not testing the bombs.

205
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,940
You are testing me.

206
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,320
You still have a little more time left

207
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
to think about it.

208
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,910
When the water runs out,

209
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,680
we will have succeeded.

210
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,130
Xiao San!

211
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,990
If all of Tianjin

212
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,000
is infected with the disease of the Demonic Cult,

213
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,770
and the only cure

214
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,360
is the blood of the the holy child,

215
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,990
this horrifying and deadly disease

216
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,760
will spread across Tianjin rapidly.

217
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,100
Only the two of us

218
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,330
know of its cure.

219
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,460
Guess what people will call us.

220
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,300
The disease comes from the river,

221
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,890
it must be the river demon's doing.

222
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,100
Those who defeat the river demon and save the world

223
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,540
are Tientsin Mystics.

224
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,270
Let us become

225
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,970
Tientsin Mystics together.

226
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,290
People revere me

227
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,060
and call me Junior Tientsin Mystic.

228
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,620
It provides me with neither food nor drink.

229
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,610
It is just a pretense.

230
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,400
I was fine with that.

231
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,620
My Master would not allow me to

232
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,400
accept the title of Tientsin Mystic.

233
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,300
He is the only family I have got.

234
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,380
How can I not listen to him?

235
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,900
But now I have lost my only family.

236
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,940
No one can tell me what to do now.

237
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,360
You're telling me now that I can be the Tientsin Mystic?

238
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,020
the real Tientsin Mystic?

239
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,690
Tientsin Mystic.

240
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,320
Tientsin Mystic.

241
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,240
I don't deserve the title.

242
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,220
More importantly,

243
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,380
how dare anyone other than my Master and I

244
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,040
call themselves Tientsin Mystic?

245
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,760
This,

246
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,710
I cannot allow.

247
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,070
Uncle Guo,

248
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,990
how can you be sure that

249
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,990
Brother Guo-er is not the holy child?

250
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,290
I brought a boy back

251
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,060
when we eradicated the Demonic Cult.

252
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,670
Pitying that he had no parents,

253
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,950
I took him in.

254
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,200
Later I found out that he had already been infected.

255
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,910
I did all I could to cure him.

256
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,120
To my surprise,

257
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,730
I really discovered a medicine for bathing

258
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,320
that could suppress his infection temporarily.

259
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,200
Now you see why his body is more sensitive

260
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,410
than most people.

261
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,590
He has been watching me prepare medicine since he was a child.

262
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,370
He knows pharmacology from watching and learning.

263
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,080
Otherwise, how could he stand by and watch

264
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,090
while you drank the poison?

265
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,410
Don't worry.

266
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,770
Soon you will get your sight back.

267
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,520
Xiao San...

268
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,000
The water in the pool is poisonous.

269
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,880
It can infect people with the disease of the Demonic Cult.

270
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,830
You guys go block the water flow.

271
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,090
When the water runs out,

272
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,520
a bomb will fall into the pool and explode.

273
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,440
The poisonous water will flow into the Hai River.

274
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,620
Leave this person to me.

275
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,580
Okay.

276
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,990
You owe me an explanation.

277
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,510
What are you doing here?

278
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,010
Brother Guo-er!

279
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,580
Brother Guo-er, where are you?

280
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,660
Brother Guo-er.

281
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,190
Little Ying, I am sorry to have wronged  you.

282
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,930
I will do anything in order

283
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,190
to save Brother Guo-er

284
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,370
Back then,

285
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,380
I did not only save Guo De-you.

286
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,750
I also saved a girl.

287
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,980
It was not convenient for an old man like me

288
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,430
to raise a little girl,

289
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,300
so I gave her to Witch Zhang.

290
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,560
I did not bring you here in order to save Guo De-you.

291
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,700
I brought you here to save all of Tianjin.

292
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,850
How can my witchery be absent

293
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,060
when the Tientsin Mystic defeats the River Demon?

294
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,240
Brother Guo-er.

295
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,780
Don't let the River Demon

296
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,710
become the Tientsin Mystic.

297
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,090
It's done.

298
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,850
It's done. I did it.

299
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,970
When the bomb explodes, and the poisonous water flows into the Hai River,

300
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,170
the Demonic Cult will rise.

301
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,090
You must have left yourself a way out,

302
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,010
a way to deactivate the bomb.

303
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,180
Tell me! Where did you hide it?

304
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,020
Tell me, or I will kill you!

305
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
It doesn't matter if I die.

306
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,659
The Demonic Cult will live.

307
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,670
Don't bother.

308
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,520
The girl is still lying on the ground.

309
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,480
What is the point of us acting macho here?

310
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,150
I think Xiao Lan-lan is quite nice.

311
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,190
Why don't you just be with her?

312
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,360
If it's not too much trouble,

313
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,960
take care of this crazy girl for me.

314
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,170
Don't let her run around crazily all day.

315
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,630
And you, stop crying.

316
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,600
Your eyesight could have recovered in two days.

317
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,880
Don't blame me

318
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,570
if you really become blind from crying.

319
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,390
Dear friends,

320
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,370
see you around.
