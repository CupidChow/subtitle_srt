00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,230
Continued from above

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,460
As mentioned last time

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,230
Gu Ying, Ding Mao went to arrest Wu Laoxian

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,090
Guo Deyou followed closely behind

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,460
Wu Laoxian grows exotic flowers in his room

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,520
Each of the three people were caught in the illusion

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,880
Gu Ying and Ding Mao narrowly escaped death

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,400
Guo Deyou is trapped in the illusion of identifying injustice

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,180
Guo Chun appeared in the illusion world

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,660
to wake Guo Deyou up

12
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,080
Junior Tientsin mystic rushed to Wu Lao Xian's hut

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,520
and saw Gu Ying unconscious and lost his breath

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,620
He lost his soul and showed his heart to Gu Ying

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,570
In fact, he was tricked by Gu Ying

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,050
The trio broke the illusion

17
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,090
and found Huang Yu and Wu Laoxian, who was already dead

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,710
Huang Yu claims to have been kidnapped by Wu Laoxian,

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,730
and in self-defense,

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,190
he strangled Wu Laoxian to death

21
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,500
Huang Yu's ruse was discovered by Guo Deyou

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,400
He revealed his crime of killing Huang Yisuo

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,000
and Wu Laoxian

24
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,460
Huang Yu confessed to the crime

25
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,890
and wanted to kill Guo Deyou

26
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,510
He didn't expect that Junior Tientsin Mysticn had already been prepared

27
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,400
Huang Ershao was arrested after he fell into a coma

28
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,580
After being locked up in the police station, Huang Yu was found to be in a trance

29
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,340
and was judged to be mentally ill

30
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,850
Lead out: Xiao Lanlan wisely recognized the scheme of madman Cui

31
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,870
The mystery man offered advice to Yisheng Gang

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,950
Huang Yu killed someone by committing murder

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,690
Guo Deyou infiltrated the police station to explore the Preacher for the first time.

34
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,870
I don't know if there will be much rain this year

35
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,200
After the rains, the osmanthus should be in bloom

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,440
Osmanthus

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,070
I've forgotten the smell of you

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,770
Almond porridge fragrant maltose white and apricot blossoms everywhere

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,400
I can only save not to eat on the Cold Food Festival, watching the flowing yellow warbler also lost sitting in a gorgeous banquet

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,750
Now spring is deep,

41
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,120
but let me recall the capital of the building invites far we had swings together.

42
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,930
Old man, your left heel of the shoe is broken

43
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,810
You have been wearing cloth shoes for four years,

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,420
and the prison does not know to give you a new pair?

45
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,070
Not fun

46
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,890
It's not fun at all

47
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,160
When will the psychiatric test

48
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,860
come out?

49
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,880
Maybe two days, maybe half a month

50
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,900
What if it's really a mental illness?

51
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,890
Just let it go?

52
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,540
What kind of information did you poke around in the ghost market?

53
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,290
It's so expensive

54
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,210
The Preacher

55
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,090
The Preacher

56
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,290
There was an old man

57
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,980
who used to deal with Lian Huaqing,

58
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,240
so he knew a lot of things about Demon Sect

59
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,760
He told me that there is a secret of the Demon Sect

60
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,760
that is not known to the general public,

61
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,730
and the person who holds this secret

62
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,230
is the Preacher

63
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,210
So this Preacher should not have a low status

64
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,190
in Demon Sect

65
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,290
And then what?

66
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,000
You did not continue to ask?

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,560
Didn't I tell you,

68
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,740
that person was killed

69
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,040
by Immortal Rope in front of me

70
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,390
Go back around again

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,820
Wait

72
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,060
I read the previous files related to the Demon Sect

73
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,920
in the hospital,

74
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,310
and there was a prisoner who was so suspicious

75
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,850
that his file was marked as confidential,

76
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,650
and the related files were encrypted

77
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,510
One of them is a person with psychic abilities

78
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,280
and extremely powerful methods

79
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,120
He made several hundred of our soldiers

80
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,330
look like they were suffering from hysteria

81
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,360
Our losses were heavy

82
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,760
Are you saying that

83
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,340
this person might be the Preacher?

84
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,500
It is very likely

85
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,720
If we can get this prisoner's dossier,

86
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,230
this will be a good thing to do

87
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,850
You said it is encrypted,

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,980
how to get?

89
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,500
The original documents of such encrypted files

90
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,300
are inside the police department's archives

91
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,940
We should be able to get it

92
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,840
if we have the approval of Captain Fu

93
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,920
Do you think that muckraker

94
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,870
will cooperate with us?

95
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,780
Of course not

96
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,790
If we ask him for help, we might as well just steal it

97
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,050
Right, why not just steal it?

98
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,420
The risk factor is too high

99
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,350
They won't be indifferent

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,290
if this level of encrypted file is lost

101
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,460
in the police station

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,000
This does not work and that does not work,

103
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,400
so what to do?

104
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,510
I do have a way

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,230
Find a quiet restaurant

106
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,990
Good places to eat are not quiet

107
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,510
Mr. Guo

108
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,210
No one is more familiar with finding food in Tianjin

109
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,430
than I am

110
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,800
Where's the driver?

111
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,280
He wanted to go to the toilet. I showed him the way

112
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,570
I'm afraid he won't be back for a while

113
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,290
Then please, Mr. Guo,

114
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,880
take me to a quiet and delicious place

115
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,790
No problem

116
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,340
Then let's eat our Tianjin specialty,

117
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,790
paste cornmeal cakes and boiled fish

118
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,400
Paste cornmeal cakes

119
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,220
Let the loach rock the boat, go upstream to the Liulichang

120
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,280
There is a large shaded area,

121
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,410
pick up a stone to build a clay stove,

122
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,770
set up an iron pot,

123
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,820
and then let Tie Niu go to the river

124
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,840
to get a basket of small carp

125
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,410
Then we boil the fish with well water

126
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,480
Be sure to have more soup

127
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,900
Stick a circle of cornmeal cakes

128
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,330
on the side of the pan

129
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,670
and cover it with a lid

130
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,800
When the pot is hot,

131
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,870
the cakes will be cooked

132
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,390
The inside is soft and sticky,

133
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,750
and the outside has a crispy crunch

134
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,860
The best thing is that

135
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,650
the part of the cake near the soup

136
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,900
has been soaked through

137
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,890
Take a sip of fish soup and eat a cake

138
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,610
The fish bones it is all crispy

139
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,690
I have to leave a proof

140
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,100
in case Mr. Guo regrets to deny

141
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,930
How could a superb human being like me

142
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,290
go back on his word

143
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,410
On the contrary, Miss Wang,

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,970
you once promised me something,

145
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,340
you will not deny it, right?

146
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,400
What is it?

147
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,040
Help me to give a pat on the back

148
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,870
Be quick!

149
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,390
Hurry up!

150
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,180
Sun Laoqi fraudulent corpse also bites people

151
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,230
The people underneath are panicked

152
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,760
some of them are afraid to stay

153
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,570
All hold me down

154
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,660
No one is allowed to leave

155
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,540
This, isn't this madman Cui?

156
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,580
How dare he come here?

157
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,820
Literary contest lost, not convinced

158
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,030
We use the living corpse to fight with others,

159
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,730
what kind of skill!

160
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,630
Madman Cui

161
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,320
Boss Cui

162
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,580
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

163
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,540
is not a place for you to wander around

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,080
Relax, I came alone today,

165
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,450
not to cause trouble

166
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,250
I'm here to talk to the guys

167
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,120
Come on over

168
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,410
Boss

169
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,320
go talk to your superiors

170
00:09:59,470 --> 00:09:59,980
Okay

171
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,190
Friends of The Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

172
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,820
you have some small misunderstandings

173
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,210
with our Yisheng Gang

174
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,940
I'm here today

175
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,690
to say a few words to you all

176
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,620
from the bottom of my heart

177
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,410
Since your Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

178
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,920
lost Chairman Ding,

179
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,270
you are very different from before

180
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,190
That the living corpse,

181
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,130
which is inhuman and ghostly,

182
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,020
is not made by your second Chairman Ding?

183
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,790
I advise everyone a word of advice,

184
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,970
all the fate of life and death are determined by the fate of God

185
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,170
People lie there,

186
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,740
face to the sky when alive, back to the ground after death,

187
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,450
that is a man

188
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,850
to stand up to the ancestors passed down the incense

189
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,540
He was demonized

190
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,250
and died without a whole body

191
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,040
If you can't enter the ancestral tomb,

192
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,940
you will be sorry to the ancestors

193
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,190
What is this called?

194
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,080
This is called treason!

195
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,250
Anyone willing to give up the darkness to the light,

196
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,080
just come to me

197
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,180
I, madman Cui in Tianjin

198
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,170
other reputation is poor,

199
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,000
but I am the most righteous people

200
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,540
I knew

201
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,050
he did not hold back a good fart

202
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,430
Chairman

203
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,230
Let me throw him into the river to feed the snapper

204
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,710
Don't be reckless

205
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,310
This Feng Erma thing

206
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,310
has been so long ago

207
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,830
Today he came here to play on the issue

208
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,840
must have problems

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,690
Then we can't just let him do this and ignore it

210
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,080
Madman Cui

211
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,020
You are so blatantly digging up people

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,230
at the docks of our Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation,

213
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,630
showing off your wealth and power?

214
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,590
Chairman Ding, you cannot say that

215
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,110
No matter what the reason,

216
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,860
they are looking for money

217
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,230
I was just showing them a clear way

218
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,430
to seek money

219
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,340
Then I'd like to thank Boss Cui for them

220
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,750
Our Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation has just such an intention

221
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,990
I would like to ask you to spread the word for us

222
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,030
Friends

223
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,320
Our Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,710
has had a lot of trouble this year,

225
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,980
and you have suffered a lot with us

226
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,750
Starting this year,

227
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,160
the wages of workers on the docks will be doubled!

228
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,980
Good!

229
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,200
Good! Good! Good!

230
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,420
Our Yisheng Gang has nothing else,

231
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,120
just a few properties

232
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,200
If you want to seek money, come to me

233
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,060
I'll pay you three times as much

234
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,680
Chairman Ding, Miss Xiao is here to see you

235
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,530
It's over there. It's urgent

236
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,220
Chairman Ding is quite generous

237
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,600
I even want to work for the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

238
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,710
I don't need to be a journalist

239
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,840
You called me here

240
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,160
just to be sarcastic?

241
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,440
Just simply in the position of a friend

242
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,270
and want to remind you

243
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,570
Do you think what Madman Cui did today was really just to poach people

244
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,460
from the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation?

245
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,530
Was it not?

246
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,110
Chairman Ding

247
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,610
How are your relations with the British Embassy?

248
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,540
We've always had dealings

249
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
with the British embassy

250
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,290
It's just that I've just returned

251
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,340
and haven't had any contact yet

252
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,370
Every three years,

253
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,350
the British embassy re-sources a new shipping partner

254
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,860
in Tianjin

255
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,080
What are you trying to say?

256
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,450
Yisheng Gang is also an important consideration for them

257
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,050
I guess this time

258
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,920
Madman Cui should be aiming for the right moment

259
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,290
and want to shake up the strength of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

260
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,280
Although it is true that the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation has had good relations

261
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,310
with the British all these years

262
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,820
But in the eyes of the British

263
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,850
Chairman Ding, you are a stranger to them.

264
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,480
So, Miss Xiao,

265
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,260
what is your suggestion?

266
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,190
My suggestion is

267
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,710
to reduce salaries instead of increasing salaries.

268
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,830
Yang, hurry. Wang Meiren is here.

269
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,070
Really?

270
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,790
Really, hurry.

271
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,560
OK, in a minute.

272
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,290
Hurry up.

273
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,980
Let's go.

274
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,830
Shut the door.

275
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,370
Miss Wang, please give me your autograph, thank you.

276
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,900
I'm odored.

277
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,850
The captain is here.

278
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,710
I'm odored.

279
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,090
It's honored.

280
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,780
H-O-

281
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:06,880
N-O-

282
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,340
R-E-D.

283
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,780
I'm flattered, Captain Fu.

284
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,290
The police solved the case of Huang Yisuo's death.

285
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,960
I need to be here to thank you.

286
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,370
Miss Wang, you can just send someone.

287
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,850
You are a super star and it's not worth bothering with being here personally.

288
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,560
Master Huang was the counselor of our crew,

289
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,940
and was murdered to my face.

290
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,690
I couldn't eat or sleep recently.

291
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,420
Fortunately, Tianjin's police system

292
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,260
is highly efficient

293
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,910
and solved the case quickly.

294
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,490
It's really a big relief to me.

295
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,100
So, of course I should be here.

296
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,420
Miss Wang, it's really nice of you.

297
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,870
We did what's within our duties,

298
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,340
but the efforts and pains behind it

299
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,140
are little-known.

300
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,260
I didn't expect that

301
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
my small contributions

302
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,530
can be remembered by a super star.

303
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,280
I feel honored and grateful.

304
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,700
People like Miss Wang who are high-minded and

305
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,180
righteous

306
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,870
and truly understand the police

307
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,890
are as rare as the hair of a phoenix and edges.

308
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,040
Captain, it's the hair of a phoenix and the horns of a unicorn.

309
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,510
I have a request

310
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,510
and wonders whether Captain Fu will agree to it or not.

311
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't say that.

312
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,120
As long as you ask, I will do anything.

313
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,500
Anything for you.

314
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,819
I won't stay long in Tianjin,

315
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,740
so I want to take a photo with you heroes as a memento.

316
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,440
I don't know if it suits you.

317
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,910
Of course, it suits us fine.

318
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,339
Let's just line up then.

319
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,510
We finally see Miss Wang face to face today,

320
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,569
and we'll take a photo together.

321
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,750
Take it easy.

322
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,790
How embarrassing.

323
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,670
OK. Look at the camera.

324
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,790
Ready.

325
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,170
One. Two. Three.

326
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,120
The Door of Life is no longer capable of paying three times of salaries.

327
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,450
After madman Cui knew that

328
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,930
we were recruiting new workers at a low price,

329
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,570
he has begun to lay off workers.

330
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,650
Young Master, you are far-sighted,

331
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,700
making that son of a bitch suffer from his own doings.

332
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,720
It feels so good.

333
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,670
Thanks to Xiao Lanlan.

334
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,290
Young Master, you and Miss Xiao are quite close.

335
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,560
What about it?

336
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,660
Is it inappropriate?

337
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,980
It's surely a good thing to

338
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,230
make a friend like her.

339
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,100
But I'm worried that Xiao's family has other purposes.

340
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,970
I don't think Xiao Lanlan does.

341
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,680
The Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

342
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,350
has kept our distance from Xiao's family.

343
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,620
Whether barriers or misunderstandings,

344
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,210
it's a good thing if we can figure them out

345
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,660
through this opportunity.

346
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,030
You asked me to send money to Ms. Hu,

347
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,750
but her family said that

348
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,150
she never went home.

349
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,410
No one in the chamber of commerce has ever seen her, either.

350
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,090
I don't know where she is.

351
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,160
You can dispatch someone to look for her.

352
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,880
OK. I'm on it.

353
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,960
Thanks a lot.

354
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,910
What's with your brain?

355
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,710
I'm speechless.

356
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,830
This is the bad idea you gave me!

357
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,100
I'd like to see

358
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,090
after the backbone of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation is dead,

359
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,490
how long it can survive.

360
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,840
How long. How long. How long.

361
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,850
Get out!

362
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,970
Losing both men and money

363
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,550
and having a bad reputation of going back on his words,

364
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,660
madman Cui may truly

365
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,910
get crazy this time.

366
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,710
Therefore, thank you, Miss Xiao.

367
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,570
You are welcome.

368
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,770
The current situation is full of turmoils, and goods and materials are in shortage,

369
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,800
making it hard to survive.

370
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,140
Those workers can be easily attracted

371
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,440
even if you offer a small amount of money.

372
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,920
This is exactly what madman Cui knows.

373
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,710
If you really raise salaries

374
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,830
by several times,

375
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,910
you will walk right into his trap.

376
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,870
Look at the bigger picture.

377
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,670
There is drought in Henan, famine in Hebei, and troops in Shandong.

378
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Many refugees are going north for survival.

379
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,400
What is the least needed now is labor force.

380
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,560
That makes sense.

381
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,270
But you shouldn't hire those old employees

382
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,570
who have left.

383
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
Well, if they

384
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,280
really came back,

385
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,800
I couldn't shut the door on them.

386
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,570
This will make the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

387
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,750
heartless and unrighteous.

388
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,720
It's even worse.

389
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,940
If there is a first, there will be a second.

390
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,750
When there is someone like madman Zhang

391
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,610
randomly raising salaries,

392
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,490
they will leave anytime.

393
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,300
What's more,

394
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,930
even if they can't make a living,

395
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,340
the warm-hearted and righteous

396
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,880
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation will be their last hope.

397
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,610
Anyway, you can use this incident

398
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,480
to test workers' loyalty.

399
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,550
Moreover,

400
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,060
if you hire old employees,

401
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,570
how will your new workers

402
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,810
feel about it?

403
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,270
I didn't know

404
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,190
you are clear-minded about business.

405
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,920
My father is a government official.

406
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,530
Being a government official is the same as running business.

407
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,440
It's all about people and money.

408
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,470
I've known this since I was a kid,

409
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,870
so I'm kind of clear-minded.

410
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,130
I took over at the chamber of commerce not long ago,

411
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,680
and I appreciate your help.

412
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,810
It's not a big deal. I'm flattered.

413
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,910
Why is Secretary General Xiao willing to

414
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,800
allow his precious daughter

415
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,450
to be a journalist? It's not an easy job.

416
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,230
Please enjoy your meal.

417
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,840
I was surprised

418
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,650
when I first knew your identity.

419
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,260
Chairman Ding,

420
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,930
if you really want to treat me,

421
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,050
you don't have to take the trouble to bring me here.

422
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,190
We journalists are used to hardships,

423
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,600
and I can't eat raw or cold food

424
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,300
because of a recent stomach problem.

425
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,830
If you don't mind,

426
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,600
let me take you to eat something hot.

427
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,380
hot?

428
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,270
Is everything alright?

429
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,400
Yes.

430
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,770
By the way,

431
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,910
I need Miss Wang to develop the photos for me.

432
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,810
Then we are even.

433
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,060
Of course not.

434
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,090
I need to treat you with little fishes.

435
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,120
And steamed cakes.

436
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,140
Hot wonton for sale.

437
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,590
Come and enjoy it.

438
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,370
Stop staring and eat.

439
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,300
This is the hot food you mentioned?

440
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,420
Not hot enough?

441
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,790
It's not what I mean. Is it clean?

442
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,550
Don't look down on it.

443
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,570
This restaurant has the best flavor of wonton in Tianjin.

444
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,660
Have a try.

445
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,650
Am I right?

446
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,990
Let me tell you.

447
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,720
Every time I quarreled with my father,

448
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,220
I would run out and come here to eat wonton.

449
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,950
Don't laugh at me.

450
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,680
In order to eat wonton,

451
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,160
I intentionally had a quarrel with my father.

452
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,730
Slow down.

453
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,680
You can help me defeat the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation?

454
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,070
We never met,

455
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,490
so why should I trust you?

456
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,940
I have a few words

457
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,310
that should help you with the negotiations with the British people.

458
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,490
Brother.

459
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,520
Why are you here?

460
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,900
I'm here to investigate the case with you.

461
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,790
I thought we planned to borrow

462
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,740
that secret file.

463
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,150
I'm ready.

464
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,790
No need to bother you.

465
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,500
I have got the file.

466
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,770
You got the file?

467
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,700
How?

468
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,560
I asked a star to distract Captain Fu.

469
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,700
It's quite easy actually.

470
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,740
You can just steal it.

471
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,630
Why did you bother to find a star?

472
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,400
You went to see Wang Meiren that bitch again?

473
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,490
Don't call her that.

474
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,240
She was very helpful.

475
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,200
I'm telling you,

476
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,650
you will lose your soul to that bitch sooner or later.

477
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,850
The Door of Life has deep hatred and resentment

478
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,480
towards the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

479
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,660
Everyone in the Jianghu

480
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,890
knows it.

481
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,540
Considering you know so many secrets of the chamber of commerce,

482
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,090
you must have close ties with it.

483
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,650
But now you are here to help me compete with it.

484
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,510
I'm confused.

485
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,880
My family was broken up because of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

486
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,120
I'm still alive

487
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,510
because I want to take my revenge on them.

488
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,420
Idiot, come here.

489
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,880
Call me grandpa.

490
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,860
Idiot, come here. Come.

491
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,490
Hurry.

492
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,660
Do you want to eat it?

493
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,020
I'm the grandpa here.

494
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,910
You won't have food if you don't call me grandpa.

495
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,610
The Second Young Master's talent is wasted.

496
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,500
Who are you?

497
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,780
The Immortal Rope and Art of Soft Bones

498
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,370
are leading skills of The Colored Door.

499
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,240
However, the leadership

500
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,520
was given to Huang Yisuo,

501
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,330
who only indulged in sensual pleasures.

502
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,460
What do you want?

503
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,440
You, the second young master Huang Yu, should seriously consider

504
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,410
what you want to do.

505
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,810
With your abilities,

506
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,660
you're wasted as the head of the Huang Family.

507
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,850
Do you have any interest in

508
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,300
leading the Outer Eight Gangs?

509
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,230
Let the whole swordsmen’s world of Tianjin

510
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,880
can be decided by you.

511
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,480
What should I do?

512
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,310
Who can tell me what to do next?

513
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,260
A fool.

514
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,930
A fool who has been locked up

515
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,130
killed a policeman in the police office.

516
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,960
Tomorrow,

517
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,140
all Tianjin newspapers will publish the news.

518
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,130
Then, all Tianjin people

519
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,450
will regard our police officers

520
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,740
as fools.

521
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,910
You two tell me

522
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,980
what I should do.

523
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,860
Young Master Ding.

524
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,990
Chairman Ding.

525
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,750
You behave not like a young master.

526
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,610
You only like investigating the cases.

527
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,410
You are always reasonable while investigating the cases.

528
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,380
You have insisted on waiting for

529
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,580
the test result of the mental disorder.

530
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,010
Well, what have you got?

531
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,060
Why did I trust you?

532
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,290
Why should I listen to you?

533
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,810
Why did I feel unworried?

534
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,120
Captain Fu.

535
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,930
I'm also responsible for this matter.

536
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,910
Stop. Stop.

537
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,980
Now, I announce that

538
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,500
from now on

539
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,590
Ding Mao is stripped of the special detective.

540
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,900
Don't blame me for not warning you.

541
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,830
If you let me know that

542
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,300
you are handling affairs as a policeman,

543
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,580
I can catch you at any time.

544
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,450
No, Captain Fu.

545
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,330
Hand it in.

546
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,530
Whom are you laughing at?

547
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,020
My master has told me that

548
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,790
I should not create trouble and fear trouble.

549
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,090
I always remember his words.

550
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,280
I have never been afraid of anything since I have grown up.

551
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,910
But in recent months,

552
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,880
I have not been so bold as before.

553
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,040
I'm not afraid of what will happen to me.

554
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,880
But I'm worried that people around me will get into trouble.

555
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,770
Brother, you say.

556
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,450
What should I do about it?

557
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,560
I'm sorry, brother.

558
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,770
I haven't had a good meal with you recently.

559
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,950
Deyou, what are you doing?

560
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,400
Nothing. I'm chatting with my brother.

561
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,090
Ask him what he wants to eat these days.

562
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,040
So what does he want to eat?

563
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,910
He says he wants to eat noodles.

564
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,080
Okay. I will cook noodles for you.

565
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,920
It's enough.

566
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,590
I'm not hungry. I'm going out.

567
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,280
You dislike me, right?

568
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,710
I really have something to do.

569
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,410
Are you going to meet the female demon?

570
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,970
The female demon? What are you referring to?

571
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,620
You're still protecting her.

572
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,300
If you have the abilities, you can get that demon home.

573
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,760
See whether she will cook noodles for you or not.

574
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,950
Mr. Guo? Is the Junior Tientsin Mystic Guo here?

575
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,510
It's not true, Gu Ying.

576
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,290
Miss Gu.

577
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,340
You're coming.

578
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,720
What's wrong with her?

579
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,480
She is hot-tempered at home.

580
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,050
What temper?

581
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,560
She...is hungry and going to have noodles.

582
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,110
Does Miss Gu also live here?

583
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,280
Of course not.

584
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,030
She just likes to come here and play.

585
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,210
Simple and cute girls like Miss Gu

586
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,790
are rare.

587
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,469
She is not simple.

588
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,770
She is foolish.

589
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,730
Mr. Guo and Miss Gu have known each other for a long time, right?

590
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,250
We have grown up together.

591
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,989
I suffered a lot during my childhood.

592
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,010
Mostly, people who are too familiar with each other

593
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,440
tend to ignore the other one's feelings.

594
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,000
I can see that Miss Gu

595
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,889
loves Mr. Guo wholeheartedly.

596
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,580
Don't live up to the affection, Mr. Guo.

597
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,940
Does Miss Wang come here

598
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,590
to preach at me?

599
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,080
Have the photos been developed?

600
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,940
I think the temple is great.

601
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,139
Could Mr. Guo show me around it?

602
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,270
A temple must have burning joss sticks.

603
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,950
This place is more like a charitable estate.

604
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,510
Many dead people have been put here.

605
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,770
I'm afraid that Miss Wang will be tainted with some ill-fortune.

606
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,350
There is no one else here.

607
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,200
If I take Miss Wang to my room,

608
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,430
it might be improper.

609
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,580
So please forgive me for not treating you well.

610
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,170
Let's be brief.

611
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,230
Stand here and talk about everything that needs to be said.

612
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,970
If Mr. Guo is not interested in my proposal, please forget.

613
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,910
I don't know why

614
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,850
there is something in the photo.

615
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,080
It's a face.

616
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,570
Does it have any evil things?

617
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,720
It indeed has some dirty things.

618
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,880
Maybe there were some dirty things

619
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,870
on the camera lens.

620
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,010
Or some blood was on the document.

621
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,060
When the photo was being exposed,

622
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,800
the bloodstain might be enlarged.

623
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,830
So it happened to form the shape of a human face.

624
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,360
Mr. Guo is quite experienced.

625
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,470
I don't deserve it.

626
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,560
Thanks.

627
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,040
What are you doing?

628
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,750
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

629
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,980
There is no way to repay the kindness of saving my life.

630
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,650
You have developed the photo for me.

631
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,380
We don't owe each other now.

632
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,860
The situation is still unsettled.

633
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,420
No one can make sure what will happen in the future.

634
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,460
What if you still have things to ask me for help?

635
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,400
That would be great.

636
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,910
I'm sorry to bother you.

637
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,520
Thank the great immortal for giving the fortune.

638
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,220
With your care,

639
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,720
we can have endless fortune.

640
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,080
Your first disciple is toasting you.

641
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,400
Where have you been?

642
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,560
Some fermented glutinous rice has been left in the pot.

643
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,440
You can help yourself.

644
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,070
I don't want to eat.

645
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,560
It must be cold.

646
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,040
Listen. Listen.

647
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,910
Listen to your half-dead condition.

648
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,390
Once I hear it, I know you are angry with Guo Deyou.

649
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,030
I can only be angry with him, right?

650
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,170
Is that all that I can do?

651
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,760
We haven't had any business for a long time.

652
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,440
I...I feel anxious about it.

653
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,250
You're too young and have no patience.

654
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,080
With my great abilities,

655
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,810
how can we have no business?

656
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,710
Do we have any business?

657
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,990
Big business.

658
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,080
How big is it?

659
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,200
You will be scared to death if I say it.

660
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,820
A great event will happen in the Yisheng Gang.

661
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,790
The gang let us do some Dharma events.

662
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,670
The Yisheng Gang?

663
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,030
What is the event they will have?

664
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,470
Lanlan, someone outside is looking for you.

665
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,640
Here. Here are the fried dough twists made just now.

666
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,470
They're still hot.

667
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,270
Tell me the matter.

668
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,500
Journalists indeed value efficiency.

669
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,830
You are well educated. Please help me to have a look at it.

670
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,220
I don't know any of the characters on it.

671
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,470
Where did you get it?

672
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,220
I borrowed it from the police office.

673
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,200
It is apparently an encrypted document.

674
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,390
Why do you investigate this?

675
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,060
Encrypted.

676
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,520
How to decode it?

677
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,560
The characters themselves have no meaning absolutely.

678
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,630
They are written by codes.

679
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,850
They can't be decoded unless we have the original version.

680
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,440
What is the original version?

681
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,180
If we regard the encrypted characters

682
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,320
as a lock,

683
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,180
the original version would be the map that leads us to find the key.

684
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,900
It can be anything.

685
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,180
It is most likely to be a book.
