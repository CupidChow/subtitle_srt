00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,050
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,400
Previously on the preceding text.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,820
In the preceding text,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,420
Lian Huaqing of the Charity Hospital appeared.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,460
He played the toxic wind-instrument and brought floating corpses back to life.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,830
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,250
fought against hundreds of floating corpses.

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,760
In the meantime, Feng Erma came back to life in the Dragon King Temple

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,870
and  fought against Gu Ying and Xiao Lanlan.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,960
After some fights,

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,460
Guo and Ding managed to escape and blew up the hospital.

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,250
Feng Erma was pushed into the fire and burned to death.

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,040
Lian Huaqing showed himself

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,210
trying to get in the way of Guo and Ding.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,110
Ding Mao was badly hurt by Lian Huaqing

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,430
and was hanging by a thread.

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,910
In the heat of the moment,

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,160
Guo Deyou lit up a cigarette and sewed up the wound

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,140
so that he could get out of the jaws of danger.

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,030
Then Ding Mao woke up in the hospital.

21
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,240
German virus experts paid their visits

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,030
and explained how the corpses came back to life.

23
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,200
And it all leads to the following part that

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,810
storms are settled at the wharf while grievances appear at the ghost fair

25
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,460
and tragedy happens at the promotion party which badly scares Wang Meiren.

26
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,330
Why didn't we go find this person?

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,380
If he really knows who the holy child is,

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,039
why would we go through all that effort

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,520
to create a new holy child

30
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,310
and all that trouble?

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,730
Don't be afraid of trouble.

32
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,090
Comparing to him,

33
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,320
they are not even close to be called trouble.

34
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,700
If we invite him out this time,

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,440
it may be the biggest trouble.

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,510
Maybe it was because of my optimism

37
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,710
or my prudence.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,820
I thought we didn't need him.

39
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,550
But since the chaos is out there now,

40
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,700
we might as well just invite him out

41
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,130
and create more chaos.

42
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,289
I surely am curious about the person

43
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:43,170
whom you see as trouble.

44
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,729
Don't just be curious.

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,509
Be fearful.

46
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,729
He is worth to be fearful of.

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,830
Like I said, evolution comes from fear.

48
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,539
He creates fear,

49
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,360
which helps bring about evolution.

50
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,420
It's not that if you want him out,

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
he then will come out.

52
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,300
Didn't I say that I know where he is?

53
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,720
Just go and invite him.

54
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,360
That place is completely secretive.

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
Don't show me that face.

56
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,419
I'm not counting on you.

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,590
I have already asked a new friend of mine

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,400
who can come to my aid.

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,030
Welcome young master home!

60
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,030
Welcome home!

61
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,410
OK. All may withdrawal.

62
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,530
Go. Go.

63
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,700
Here.

64
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,750
How is it?

65
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,810
How is the new hole in your body?

66
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,170
All sewed up.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Luckily my organs were hurt.

68
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,470
Otherwise I would've been placed next to dad.

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,180
President Ding, welcome back from the hospital.

70
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,350
Thank you.

71
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,080
I didn't prepare anything.

72
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,420
Let me sing you a hemostasia song!

73
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,170
Sit.

74
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,610
Redden the east with sunrise.

75
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,010
Ride a white bull with a gold in the right hand.

76
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,110
Cut off the river to east with one shout.

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,220
Shut the floodgate and let no rivers flow.

78
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,230
Here comes snow mountain boy.

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,140
That's enough. Sit down.

80
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you for your kindness.

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,460
But my bleeding had been stopped already.

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,600
If you two are not busy,

83
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,420
how about staying for dinner?

84
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,450
I'm not busy. I think I'll pass.

85
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,530
I still have some things to do later.

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,800
Then let's not get in your way.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,800
We can have dinner ourselves!

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,170
When it comes to dinner,

89
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,030
how can we forget about this one person?

90
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,060
Where's Guo Deyou?

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,450
No more practice.

92
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,480
No more practice.

93
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,080
What's wrong?

94
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,200
You only practiced for a little while.

95
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,010
Are you feeling sick?

96
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,790
Just leave me alone.

97
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,900
You think I would not know even if you don't tell me?

98
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,530
You don't feel good here, do you?

99
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,870
OK. Would you stop?

100
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,890
I am alright.

101
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,100
I know you're not.

102
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,010
It's all because of Guo Deyou,

103
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,250
that jerk, isn't it?

104
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,240
Did Guo Deyou do something to you?

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,770
Nonsense!

106
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,600
Tell me the truth!

107
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,070
What did he do to you?

108
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,190
It's just that...

109
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,270
I have not seen his face for a long long time.

110
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,190
Oh my god!

111
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,850
I thought he did some bad things to you.

112
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,810
I am just worried about him.

113
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,560
Junior fellow apprentice.

114
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,830
How did you get in?

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,340
I got in open and aboveboard.

116
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,130
You call this open and aboveboard?

117
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,860
A big welcome is needless

118
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,130
for me to pay you a visit.

119
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,470
Pay me a visit?

120
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,950
Why didn't you come when I was recharged from the hospital?

121
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,080
I'm here now, aren't I?

122
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,370
Are you alright now?

123
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,400
Of course.

124
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,700
All thanks to my precise suture.

125
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,520
What are you doing recently?

126
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,450
Gu Ying has been looking for you.

127
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,350
For the situation now,

128
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,350
I suppose you are not going to go back to Dragon King Temple, aren't you?

129
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,280
Maybe.

130
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,780
The Chamber of Commerce is now completely under my control.

131
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,420
No way!

132
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,180
The president of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation is my junior fellow apprentice!

133
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,260
What about you?

134
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,120
You living alone in the temple?

135
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,420
How about moving in here?

136
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,640
Nah.

137
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,820
I don't feel comfortable living in such a mansion.

138
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,950
I think I'll keep guarding the temple

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,169
for our master.

140
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,620
Maybe someday he'll come back.

141
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,809
Still no words from master?

142
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,690
Nope.

143
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,280
What about the Demon Sect?

144
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,460
No progress.

145
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,110
But anyway,

146
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,390
we finally managed to force

147
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,540
Demon Sect and Lian Huaqing

148
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,540
to take some major action.

149
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,660
So we gotta keep figuring it out.

150
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,000
But before that,

151
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,880
there's something far more important.

152
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,740
What is it?

153
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,120
Lend me some money.

154
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,820
Money?

155
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,580
If one returns what he borrows on time, it won't be difficult to borrow again.

156
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,660
And it goes on and on and on.

157
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,390
What for?

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,080
For spending.

159
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,860
How much?

160
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,750
How much do you have?

161
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,210
I'll have as much as you want.

162
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,190
Nice. That's the words I've been expecting.

163
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,040
Three hundred. I've even had the IOU written.

164
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,900
Help!

165
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,190
Here.

166
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,270
Here.

167
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,940
Stop!

168
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,680
Put some clothes on Miss Wang.

169
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,370
OK.

170
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,950
Meiren.

171
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,910
Director.

172
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,300
When you were in the water,

173
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,280
how did you feel?

174
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,010
Before he saved you.

175
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,040
Helpless.

176
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,250
Frightened.

177
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,610
All hopes are dashed to pieces.

178
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,610
I don't feel it.

179
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,180
If I don't feel it,

180
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,070
the audience won't feel it, either.

181
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,760
One more.

182
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,770
Here. Warm yourself.

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,460
Thank you.

184
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,310
You are so good at it.

185
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,470
Thank you, Boss Chang.

186
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,270
The director is not satisfied yet.

187
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,820
He is looking for a bone in an egg.

188
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,280
Listen to me. There's only one scene of falling into water.

189
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,310
Trust me. I won't let him film this scene again.

190
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,900
It's my job for being an actor.

191
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,970
What are you waiting for?

192
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,240
Ready?

193
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,790
Cue.

194
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,380
Master Guo?

195
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,390
How did you get in?

196
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,120
I came in open and aboveboard.

197
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,750
What? What's wrong?

198
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,600
Some things happened at the wharf.

199
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,230
I'm going to take a look with brothers.

200
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,940
If you want anything, you can go to Monkey.

201
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,500
He's in the gate house.

202
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,820
What? What happened?

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,690
It's nothing. Just some disputes.

204
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,750
I'll go with you.

205
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,710
You don't have to.

206
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,140
You have just recovered.

207
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,170
You may catch a cold there.

208
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,550
Have some rest, my master.

209
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,530
It's fine.

210
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,840
I also want to pay a visit to my brothers at the wharf.

211
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,660
Why are you still here?

212
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,550
What on earth do you do?

213
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,730
Didn't I just tell you?

214
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,600
Get out!

215
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,450
What's happening?

216
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,690
What are you all doing?

217
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,120
I can hear your noise in the distance.

218
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,330
Is it something serious?

219
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,750
Isn't that...

220
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,930
Captain Fu, you're finally here.

221
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
We are filming here at the wharf

222
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,540
under the instructions of Secretary General Xiao.

223
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,520
If they keep causing us trouble,

224
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,500
how do I continue?

225
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,060
I don't give a damn about city government or Secretary Xiao.

226
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,000
If you don't ask President Ding for instructions,

227
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,680
you can't do anything.

228
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,900
Boss Yang.

229
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,860
Chang.

230
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,190
Boss Chang.

231
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,720
How about calling it a day now?

232
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,730
I'll ask President Ding to apologize to you himself.

233
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,830
No way.

234
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,070
I'm half way now.

235
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,990
How do I continue?

236
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,170
Who is going to compensate for my loss?

237
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,280
What? You're not going?

238
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,740
If you don't go,

239
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,610
then don't blame us for being violent.

240
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,420
Go! Go!

241
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,260
What are you doing?

242
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Go!

243
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,500
Are you running riot in front of the police?

244
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,710
Listen to me first.

245
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,520
President Ding.

246
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,430
President Ding.President Ding.

247
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
President Ding. You're just in time.

248
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,740
Come.

249
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,840
What's wrong?

250
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,880
Let me introduce you.

251
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,690
This is Boss Yang from Shanghai.

252
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,630
Chang.

253
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,050
Boss Chang.

254
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,190
They want to borrow the wharf

255
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,270
to make a film.

256
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,030
Please do me a favor.

257
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,850
Would you kindly make an exception?

258
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,470
You guys can discuss in detail, ok?

259
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,360
President Ding.

260
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,020
I'm new here and unaware of the rules here.

261
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,930
We only talked to the higher authorities。

262
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
We didn't know that we also needed to talk to you.

263
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,710
That's our mistake.

264
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,720
But we're half way here.

265
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,180
I hope you could make an exception, President Ding.

266
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,570
I'll thank you later.

267
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,570
The workers have stopped their work.

268
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,910
As you can see,

269
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,260
because of the shooting,

270
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,370
our workers have all stopped their work.

271
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,420
If their work is further delayed

272
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,070
They may not be able to get paid today

273
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,670
But we are in the middle of shooting

274
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,580
We'll make up to their wage losses

275
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,800
Chairman Ding, please make an exception for us

276
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,190
This is not about the money

277
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,610
It's about our system and rules

278
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,890
You can't ask us to go now

279
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,900
Captain Fu, this dock is so large

280
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,440
Does it solely belong to Caoyun Chamber of Commerce?

281
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,560
If so, I can say the Hai River belongs to me

282
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,960
You can negotiate by yourselves

283
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,270
It's Mr. Chang, right?

284
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,920
I don't know whether the Hai River belongs to you or not

285
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,520
But this dock,

286
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,810
does actually belong to Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

287
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,930
Did you hear me?

288
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,880
The Hai River neither belongs to Mr. Chang,

289
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,750
nor Chairman Ding

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
But it's quite close to me, Guo Deyou

291
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,920
Who's this?

292
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,840
Junior Tientsin Mystic

293
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,870
Flattered

294
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,780
Mr. Chang, given the situation now

295
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,900
You all standing still

296
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,870
Do you think you can continue your shooting?

297
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,410
Chairman Ding

298
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,960
Even if the crew leaves now with their equipment

299
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,560
You've already lost half of the day

300
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,650
When your workers arrive at the dock,

301
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,030
their work would already be delayed

302
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,830
What idea do you have?

303
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,180
The moralities of our society

304
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,190
is to be tolerant of each others' needs

305
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,920
This is not a big deal

306
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,620
We don't need to turn it into a conflict

307
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,140
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce does a great scale of business

308
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,830
You wouldn't care about losing a few minutes

309
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,320
Since they've already shot half of the movie

310
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,020
Chairman Ding, you may as well let them

311
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,950
finish their shooting

312
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,890
After they are done,

313
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,780
they can add to their poster

314
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,870
Something like credits to Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

315
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,800
This would be a generous way to do it

316
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,210
Ok, let them finish their shooting

317
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,500
See, the problem is solved

318
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,220
Thanks a lot

319
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,410
This is not the rule

320
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:58,980
Only for this one time

321
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,750
Thanks a lot, Chairman Ding

322
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,590
Brothers can leave now

323
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,010
That's all for today

324
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,090
This will work, right?

325
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,230
Don't interrupt their shooting

326
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:08,960
Let's go now

327
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Brothers, let's go

328
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,150
Let's go

329
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,820
Mr. Chang

330
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,760
If you have some character in your movie

331
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,840
Something like a just policeman

332
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,560
I will be on call

333
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,540
No problem

334
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,960
We didn't know we need to inform them

335
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,100
Sorry to bother you

336
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,770
I apologize to you, Chairman Ding, on behalf of the crew

337
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,290
No problem

338
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,340
Thank you

339
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,450
For solving such a tough problem for us

340
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,180
Thank you, Junior Tientsin Mystic

341
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,170
You're welcome, just call me Deyou

342
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,820
It is our fate to meet

343
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,790
After this, we are friends now

344
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,170
There will be a publicity banquet in a few days

345
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,690
At Ju Hua Grand Hotel

346
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,790
I wonder if Chairman Ding and Junior Tientsin Mystic

347
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,830
will accept our invitation and come?

348
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,720
Um

349
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,840
Of course, I'll be there

350
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,010
Where

351
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,680
Can we start shooting already?

352
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,089
It's been a long long long time

353
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,579
Since I last met him

354
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,589
Why didn't you go find him?

355
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,800
But he's been hiding from me

356
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,770
Did he also borrow money from you?

357
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,890
What money?

358
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,760
He came to borrow some money from me today

359
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,600
You're kidding me

360
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,690
He borrowed money from you?

361
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,520
Yes, today

362
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,590
This is why I said there must be something wrong

363
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,740
Something must be wrong

364
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,980
Why

365
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,980
Given the relationship between you two,

366
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,860
if Deyou wants some money,

367
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,620
he would cheat you into giving him money

368
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,750
with every excuse

369
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,940
And you would be deceived

370
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,660
You'll even thank him for giving him money

371
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,740
Are you mocking me?

372
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,300
But he came to borrow money from you

373
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,260
There must be something wrong

374
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
It's not Deyou's habit

375
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,950
not to take advantage of you

376
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,420
That makes sense

377
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,650
Huge movie star Wang Meiren

378
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,400
invited him to the banquet today

379
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,870
He consented readily

380
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,060
Huge star?

381
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,020
And he acted like a fanboy

382
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Young Master Guo, you are here

383
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,900
Young Master Guo

384
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,460
Let me see what's the news that worth all these

385
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,580
Come and light the lamp for Young Master Guo

386
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,560
This way, Young Master Guo

387
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,110
So you are the youngster with no fear of death

388
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,040
I'll go straight to the point

389
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,650
and not waste my words

390
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
You know exactly what I want to know

391
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,960
Lian Huaqing

392
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,160
I remember him pretending back then

393
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,550
He really tricked me badly

394
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,570
I thought he was one of our beggar gangsters

395
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,130
He used to beg?

396
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,060
There was no one in his family

397
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,660
He was also sick

398
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,180
How could he make a living if not for begging?

399
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,450
I remember

400
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,220
The first time I saw this kid,

401
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,590
I found him quite strange

402
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,890
Later, one day,

403
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,550
I saw a snake in the mountains

404
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,370
And I remembered

405
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,540
The way his eyes staring straight into you was just like a snake

406
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,650
Some people are born killers

407
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,050
It's said his father lost his mind

408
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,040
And he killed his father himself

409
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,180
When was the last time you saw him?

410
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,510
I can't remember

411
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,260
Too many years

412
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,690
Then tell me more about Demon Sect

413
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,070
There's a secret in the Demon Sect

414
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,020
Most disciples don't know about it

415
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,050
What's that?

416
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,780
The Preacher

417
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,540
The Preacher?

418
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,710
Guo Deyou

419
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,950
Make it clear to me

420
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,050
What's going on with you lately?

421
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,830
You've been so carefree

422
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,030
But do you know I'm concerned?

423
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,190
Did you hear me?

424
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,560
I'm not sure how much he revealed to the Junior Tientsin Mystic

425
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,520
Whatever, this was the last time he could speak

426
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,900
We were late after all

427
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,110
You've worked hard

428
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,260
You can go mind your own business now

429
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,050
Mom, I'll go out for a while

430
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,450
Stay here

431
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,000
We'll go host a ritual together later

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,250
You can go by yourself

433
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,100
I need to go to Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

434
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,300
Ying

435
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,800
You've been to Caoyun Chamber of Commerce a lot these days

436
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,050
I didn't see you go to the Dragon King Temple lately

437
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,540
Makes sense

438
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,760
Guo Deyou

439
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,890
He knows nothing but catch tortoise in the waters

440
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,790
Poor as hell

441
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,920
Chairman Ding, on the other hand,

442
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,760
is not only good-looking,

443
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,640
but also reliable

444
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,430
Ying

445
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,500
Don't you have a crush on him?

446
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,640
You can't put a price tag on what I like

447
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,860
I like him

448
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,340
Guo Deyou, Guo Deyou

449
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,980
Look what you've done to my daughter

450
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,890
Senior Immortal

451
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,290
You've been harsh on me

452
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,280
You know well how you treated my daughter

453
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,870
Scolding is far from enough

454
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,030
I deserve it

455
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,820
As long as you are happy

456
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,780
You can also take it out on me by hitting me

457
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,640
Anything else you want to say?

458
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,700
If not, leave

459
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,820
I just wanted to find out what happened to my Master

460
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,730
I went to the ghost market yesterday

461
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,110
And found someone related to this

462
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,130
I only got one clue from him

463
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,070
before he died

464
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,290
He died?

465
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,890
Just in front of me

466
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,900
How did that happen?

467
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,990
There was a rope like this,

468
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,350
weight hanging at the front

469
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,390
He was beaten by it and died

470
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,630
Immortal Rope?

471
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,080
Ding Mao, Ding Mao, Ding Mao

472
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,960
Why are you here again?

473
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,950
What happened?

474
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,830
Wang Meiren's banquet

475
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,010
Deyou will be there, right?

476
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,160
You said yourself,

477
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,370
Guo Deyou is sure to take advantage

478
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,320
Take me with you then

479
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,180
Well, I can do this

480
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,900
Do you mean yes or no?

481
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,850
Yes

482
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,840
Really?

483
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,280
Yes, no problem

484
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,460
You are the best

485
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,250
Young Master

486
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,850
Miss Xiao is here

487
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,980
Young Master Ding

488
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,870
Miss Gu, you are here too

489
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,170
Yes, I came to take advantage of him

490
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,050
Miss Xiao

491
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,130
Please, Miss Xiao

492
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,190
What do you come for?

493
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,560
I heard that

494
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,360
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce will sponsor Wang Meiren's new movie

495
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,600
I think this can make to the news

496
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,010
So I want to know the details from you

497
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,080
Chairman Ding

498
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,400
Sponsor?

499
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,100
There must be misunderstandings there

500
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,030
Misunderstanding?

501
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,080
I just agreed that

502
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,970
they can shoot movie on our dock

503
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,320
That's all, no big news

504
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,920
Just do them a favor

505
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,340
But since you are here, Miss Xiao,

506
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,770
I need a favor from you

507
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,790
About the tricks of ropes,

508
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,750
you know better than me, Senior Immortal

509
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,000
How about telling me something about it

510
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,580
This is the internal sample of Zhuang Yuan Hong

511
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,400
I brought it all the way from the wine cellar to you

512
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,940
It's not sold on the market

513
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,320
How thick was the rope?

514
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,550
Where did it come from?

515
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,630
From above

516
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,310
I didn't see anybody up there

517
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,300
It's almost this thick

518
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,040
Something like a metal ball hung at the front

519
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,190
It must be the Immortal Rope from the Huangs

520
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,150
But normal disciples can't handle it

521
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,630
The Huangs' successor is a youngster now

522
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,870
His name is Huang Yisuo

523
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,430
How does it feel?

524
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,280
A little bit weird

525
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,070
This is the most fashionable style, jumpsuit

526
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,220
How can I use the bathroom in this?

527
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,160
To attend a banquet like this,

528
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,730
you have to wear this kind of clothes

529
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,380
Or the guards won't let you in

530
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,400
Are you kidding me?

531
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,870
My skin is exposed here, here, and here

532
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,430
Try this coat then

533
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,610
I'm too tired

534
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,130
I don't want to try anymore

535
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm so tired

536
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,910
Wear this hat to match your outfit

537
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,470
It must be a good match

538
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,370
Trust me

539
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,660
What's the fishnet for?

540
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,090
The meshes are so dense

541
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,760
Even baby fishes cannot pass

542
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,510
People will think that

543
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,430
I went out wearing a fixed net

544
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,580
You know,

545
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,100
back when we were little,

546
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,190
Deyou and I would hide under the bridge

547
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,130
Setting the fixed net

548
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,560
We caught lots of little shrimps and river crabs

549
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,190
Childhood sweethearts, how nice

550
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,870
Growing up together,

551
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,600
but no loyalty to friends now

552
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,010
What's wrong with you two?

553
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,300
He refused to see you?

554
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,320
He's been hiding from me for a long time

555
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,290
I think you must have encountered

556
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,380
cases like this

557
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,780
When you were little,

558
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,380
your mom found you missing one day

559
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,610
She was so worried

560
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,570
Afraid that you maybe abducted by someone

561
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,790
or you may fell into the river

562
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,490
And she searched the whole city for you

563
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,510
But actually,

564
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,030
you just fell asleep somewhere.

565
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,010
How did you know that?

566
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,820
You just care too much about him,

567
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,770
so you think he did it on purpose.

568
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,430
That is man. The more you care about him,

569
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,880
the more he will feel proud of himself,

570
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,600
He will think he's indispensable to you.

571
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,060
So, a woman should be like water.

572
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,330
Move on step by step and take control.

573
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,010
And remember.

574
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,750
Don't rush.

575
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,760
If you rush it,

576
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,570
everything will be in a mess.

577
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,170
I'll buy you a drink next time.

578
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,060
I don't have wine right now, really.

579
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,560
I didn't mean to drink your wine.

580
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,210
Tell me the truth.

581
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,330
Why do you always avoid our Gu Ying?

582
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,230
I thought you knew the reason.

583
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,270
How could I know if you didn't say?

584
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,030
The Demon Sect is so dangerous,

585
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,820
and it's uncertain if my master is alive.

586
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,920
I don't want anyone else to venture

587
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,640
into this tough task,

588
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,560
especially Gu Ying.

589
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
A western drama?

590
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,510
A film, as is known.

591
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,030
I heard the drama is really a big one,

592
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,170
which is well-  all over the country

593
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,390
and has a celebrity starring in it.

594
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,380
She's called Wang Meiren.

595
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,760
This drama tells

596
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,170
a story of a magic master in Tianjin,

597
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,840
so they specially invited our head

598
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,130
to be a so-called technical adviser.

599
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,980
In the whole Tianjin city,

600
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,130
only our Huang family was invited.

601
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,400
This dinner party

602
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,000
is for promoting that drama.

603
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,840
And our head will also perform at it.

604
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,640
So he went out early this morning.

605
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,840
Let's take a look over there.

606
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,680
Have some.

607
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Just have it.

608
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,540
No, I won't.

609
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,490
I came here before.

610
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,640
Expensive.

611
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,710
This is a party. Guests don't have to pay.

612
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,550
Why not grab free foods if there are some?

613
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,840
Better to be a freeloader than be hungry.

614
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,100
Why did you bring her here?

615
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,540
I...

616
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,780
I was willing to come, okay?

617
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,490
Is this the place where you should come?

618
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,600
Look at what you are wearing.

619
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,730
How about you?

620
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,390
Wearing a turtle-colored suit,

621
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,260
hang around here.

622
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,910
How dare you judge my look?

623
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,090
Why does your suit look so familiar?

624
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,270
It's yours!

625
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,580
Why didn't you let me know in advance?

626
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,980
Lend?

627
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,460
You lend me your suit and want me to pay?

628
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,190
You are a real businessman, aren't you?

629
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,550
Okay, you are talking about money, right?

630
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,330
What did you do with the money I lent you?

631
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,000
Deyou,

632
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,820
what on earth are you doing recently?

633
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,840
None of your business!

634
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,430
The Demon Sect is so rampant now.

635
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,470
The wound on Ding Mao's belly hasn't been healed up.

636
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,590
Uncle Guo has disappeared for so long.

637
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,070
Does anyone else care about you except me?

638
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,530
Is there any safe place

639
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,700
all around Tianjin?

640
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,420
Alright, I won't care about you anymore,

641
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,190
even if you die somewhere!

642
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,610
Gu Ying.

643
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,620
You get back so late. Will your mom leave food for you?

644
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,100
Stay hungry for a whole night?

645
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,940
Will you be able to fall asleep?

646
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,830
If you don't sleep well, you'll look green

647
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,850
with dry lips and tongue.

648
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,860
Your mom would say your spirits are drooping.

649
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,830
Your friends won't meet you when you visit them.

650
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,710
Everything is going wrong and misfortune would come.

651
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,700
She will not feed you or let you out.

652
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,390
If you shout at me and leave right away,

653
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,720
your face will be saved but your spirit drooped.

654
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,430
And later on,

655
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,760
you will definitely suffer for many days.

656
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,440
Do you think it's worth it?

657
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,980
I came here today

658
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,250
to ask Huang Yisuo, the head of the Huang family, a few things.

659
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,840
It won't take long.

660
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,930
After that, I will send you back in person.

661
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,060
Then, let's have some lamb soup at Chen's.

662
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,360
Lamb soup should be had in the morning.

663
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,370
At night,

664
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,730
let's go to Shiban Po to eat stinky tofu.

665
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,630
No problem.

666
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,160
I have some acquaintances over there.

667
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,680
Mr. Guo. Chairman Ding.

668
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,670
It's beyond my expectation

669
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,110
to have both of you support us here.

670
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,980
Since Miss Wang invited us in person,

671
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,140
we should certainly come to support...

672
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,220
You must be Mr. Xiao's daughter, right?

673
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,300
Glad to meet you, Miss Wang.

674
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,950
I'm Xiao Lanlan, a journalist of Tianjin News.

675
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,520
This lady is...

676
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,600
Gu Ying, a Taoism research specialist.

677
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,929
There is Shanghai in the south,

678
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,840
and we have Tianjin in the north.

679
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,449
Nine rivers stream down to Tianjin.

680
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,330
Three pontoon bridges and two customs.

681
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,179
Outside the South Gate is the Haiguang Temple.

682
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,400
Outside the North Gate is the Beida Custom.

683
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,080
Inside the South Gate is the military training ground.

684
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,460
The drum tower and battery are located in the center.

685
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,630
Three buttresses and four cannons.

686
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,770
The yellow-plate tram travels all the way to the custom.

687
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,440
Didn't expect I could recite it.

688
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,050
But actually, I've got a copy here.

689
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,940
Thank you so much for participating

690
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,750
in the release party of our film, A Love Song of the Great River.

691
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,260
Your presence

692
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,920
is the greatest support for the film.

693
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,590
You must have seen magic shows before.

694
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,390
They were brought in from the West,

695
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,800
originate from ancient Egypt,

696
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,470
and become popular all over the world.

697
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,290
But we also have nice traditional art,

698
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,630
ancient Chinese magic circus,

699
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,500
which includes all kinds of shows.

700
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,820
Besides western magic skills,

701
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,890
performers should know superb techniques

702
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,340
like qigong, acrobatics and contortions.

703
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,820
Let's invite the real master of the magic,

704
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,420
who is also the No. 1 of the Tianjin Magic School.

705
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,950
Huang Yisuo, master Huang!

706
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,740
Our film, A Love Song of the Great River,

707
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,740
tells a story

708
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,170
of how a simple boy born by the Hai River

709
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,060
becomes a Tianjin magic master

710
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,890
through diligent learning and practicing

711
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,870
and the support of a benefactor.

712
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,640
Luckily, we have invited master Huang

713
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,780
to be our technical adviser.

714
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,510
Without his help,

715
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,400
the film will possibly be full of loopholes

716
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,630
and an object of ridicule.

717
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,990
Then, let's welcome master Huang

718
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,120
to bring us a fabulous magic show!

719
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,770
Sir, can you check this for me, please?

720
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,020
And tighten it up a bit.

721
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,110
Right. It is the Immortal Rope of Huang family.

722
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,680
All good.

723
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,220
Thank you.

724
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,080
Bravo!
