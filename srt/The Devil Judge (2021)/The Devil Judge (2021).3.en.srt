00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,060
Ji Sung

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,400
Kim Min Jung

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,350
Jin Young

4
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,560
Park Gyu Young

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,150
No Justice

6
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,450
The Devil Judge

7
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,910
This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea. All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,940
Episode 3

9
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,960
Were you looking for this?

10
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,100
You knew about this.

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,890
Why do you do things like this, anyway?

12
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,180
Why do I do things like this?

13
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,550
Yes.

14
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,840
Because I can.

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,650
Possibility is like a drug.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,720
Out of the way!

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,820
Did he die?

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,480
No.

20
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,550
Did you kill him?

21
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,580
I told you I didn't!

22
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,230
What's this? He's still alive.

23
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,480
How boring.

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,330
What's so boring about this?

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,950
Where is this place?

26
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,820
It's not heaven.

27
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,600
I wouldn't push myself if I were you.

28
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,720
Do Not Enter - Police Line - Under Investigation

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,690
Chief Judge Kang Yo Han

30
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,800
Do Not Enter - Police Line - Under Investigation

31
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,430
The terrorist explosion at the judge's chambers has shocked the nation.

32
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,760
Everyone is focused on Judge Kang Yo Han's personal safety.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,140
The case has been handed over to the police and the investigation is in full swing.

34
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,350
They secured the CCTV footage from inside the supreme court and the entry and exit list.

35
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,120
- It's Kang Yo Han!
- I-it's Kang Yo Han.

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,190
He is coming out.

37
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,480
It's Kang Yo Han!

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,220
Is he there? He is over there!

39
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,190
He's coming out. He's coming out.

40
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,540
Judge Kang, are your injuries severe?

41
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,860
- What is your current condition?
- Is your body all right?

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,110
Is Judge Kang all right?

43
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,410
I'm fine, thanks to the concern of the people.

44
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,780
And your injuries aren't severe?

45
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,210
It's tolerable.

46
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,500
Whose doing is this?

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,950
We are not sure yet.

48
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,600
Do you think this terrorist act was done by people in power who are displeased with the live court show?

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
That's possible.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Will you suspend the trial for now?

51
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,360
I have something to tell the people.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,110
It seems I terrified someone.

53
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,830
The nation's judge cannot stop due to cowardly terrorist acts such as this one.

54
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,530
The trial will proceed as originally planned.

55
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,180
Then what kind of case will the next trial tackle?

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,470
It's about a son of the privileged class, who repeatedly abuses power and is violent against the weak.

57
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,970
The defendant is Lee Yeong Min, vice president of Jungwon F&B.

58
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,270
Lee Yeong Min?

59
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,730
If it is Vice-President Lee Yeong Min, could he be the son of Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui?

60
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,620
- What the hell is he saying?
- Yes, that is correct.

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,570
If you bring the current minister's son to court, will the prosecution do nothing?

62
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,680
All citizens are equal under the law.

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,450
This man is no different from any other defendant to me.

64
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,190
Kang Yo Han, you bastard.

65
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,430
♫ There's a drought in my mind
My thoughts are drowning me all right ♫

66
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,840
♫ Completely blind (Completely blind) ♫

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,980
♫ Does that change my mind? ♫

68
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,370
Still, you must have faced various kinds of opposition to this.

69
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,190
The mutt can bark all it wants. The train will continue.

70
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,140
Mutt?

71
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,720
Judge, you're so cool!

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
You're amazing!

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,650
Wow!♫ And drink the rest ♫

74
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,250
♫ From drought to flood,
so obscene ♫

75
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,100
♫  that's my very own inner over greed ♫

76
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,790
Yeong Min...

77
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,280
Minister. Minister!

78
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Let's have a look.

79
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,810
I'm from the police.

80
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,370
Sir Judge!

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,660
Is Judge Kim Ga On safe?

82
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,960
Who are you?

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,260
I'm the inspector who's been assigned to this case. My name is Yun Su Hyeon.

84
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,470
I see. I wish you luck.

85
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,000
Is Judge Kim safe?

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
Yes, he's safe.

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,930
Are you personally acquainted with Judge Kim? Maybe... his girlfriend?

88
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,570
No. I'm his friend.

89
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,120
I did not expect Judge Kim to have a detective friend.

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,680
Where is Ga On right now?

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,870
I'm sorry, but I cannot tell you that.

92
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,330
- I'm sorry?
- Right now his safety comes first.

93
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,510
There may be a followup attack, so it's best he completes his treatment at a safe location.

94
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,920
So where is that? Let me see him.

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,130
Policewoman Yun Su Hyeon.

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,890
Forgive me, Judge.

97
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,150
Just find the criminal. Leave Judge Kim to me.

98
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,170
Who are you?

99
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,150
Why are you so startled?

101
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,830
Did Young Master Yo Han not tell you anything?

102
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,460
Tell me what?

103
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,280
Then I have nothing further to say to you.

104
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,480
I will bring you another tray of food.

105
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,900
"Young Master"...

106
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,400
All rich folks are alike.

107
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,210
This looks ancient. I wonder how much it costs?

108
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,110
- That's a national treasure.
- What?

109
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm kidding. What an idiot.

110
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,430
Stop poking your nose where it doesn't belong and stay in your bed like a good little boy.

111
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,180
Well, who are you, and why are you speaking casually to me?

112
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,610
Elijah.

113
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,820
Eli? Is that your name?

114
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,390
It's Elijah., you dolt. Have you never read the Bible before?
(Elijah was an Old Testament prophet)

115
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,310
Fine Elijah. Elijah..

116
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,980
But have I done anything wrong to you?

117
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,910
- Your face.
- Say what?

118
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,500
Your face annoys me.

119
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,930
How dare...

120
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,940
"How dare"? What's wrong with my face—?

121
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,190
Why did Yo Han pick up trash like this? A total knockoff.

122
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,950
Wait. Wait!

123
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,260
What's going on with this house?

124
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,610
Ah, Dad, what am I supposed to do?

125
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,780
What did I do wrong to be sent to the people's court? That crazy bastard!

126
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,100
I know. He's a crazy fool. What kind of judge is he anyway?

127
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't worry, Yeong Min. Your mother will make sure nothing bad happens to you.

128
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,700
How dare anyone touch our boy.

129
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,240
- Dad, there is something I haven't told you yet.
- Yeah?

130
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,030
That bastard Kang Yo Han... I think he's deliberately targeting me.

131
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,420
What are you talking about?

132
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,380
Ah... so what I'm trying to say is...

133
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,100
Hey, Yeong Min.

134
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,850
Yeong Min.

135
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,010
Oh, honey.

136
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,250
Mom.

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,840
Are you going to disappoint me like this? Huh?!

138
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm sorry, Mother.

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,900
Look me square in the eyes. Right now, huh?

140
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Look at me. Right now. Look at me!

141
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,130
Don't worry. Nothing is going to happen. Nothing at all.

142
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,080
Do you understand?!

143
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Hey, Honey. Are you sure everything will be all right?

144
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,690
And what have you been doing all this time, letting our kid get to this state?

145
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,440
I mean, I did try to resolve everything without any issues,

146
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,100
but it's just this one thing... that complicated my efforts.

147
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,850
That won't be a problem, right?

148
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,690
Don't worry.

149
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,970
That trial will never proceed.

150
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,610
Are you going to leave him alone?

151
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,730
Oh, you're here.

152
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,730
You're here, Minister.

153
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,320
By the way, what do you mean by if I'm going to leave him alone? Who is "him"?

154
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,140
- I'm going to take my leave.
- Already?

155
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,400
I don't think it is appropriate for my position

156
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,110
to be meeting with a family member of a defendant.

157
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,350
I don't have any personal feelings on the matter, Minister.

158
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,510
Public affairs are public, private affairs are private.

159
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,400
I won't have any personal feelings either,

160
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,450
no matter what I may do in the future.

161
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,690
Judge Kang?

162
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,220
Director Jeong. Are you here to convey some message from the foundation?

163
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,420
When it comes to conveying messages, there are many, all over the place.

164
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,760
By the way, are you all right? Weren't you injured?

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,100
- This terrorist attack was strange.
- What?

166
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,510
It wasn't enough to go off and kill someone,

167
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,000
but blew up subtly, just enough so that you wouldn't ignore it.

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,120
As a warning to someone.

169
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,530
Oh my. That's really odd.

170
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,140
Perhaps my imagination is excessive.

171
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,640
In any case, there are people in the world who understand a warning easily,

172
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,750
and there are those who don't understand, only to regret it later.

173
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,050
- That's what I think, Judge.
- I agree.

174
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,530
There are indeed people who don't understand warnings, in this world.

175
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,960
The foundation sponsors are very worried.

176
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,930
When we're just about to announce the building of the Dream Village project, his pointless behavior might irritate the working class.

177
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,640
I'm sorry, Minister.

178
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,120
People are very sensitive to so-called power-tripping. Public opinion, you know.

179
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,640
That's why you should have clamped down on him, at such a sensitive time.

180
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,750
Is the young man always unable to control his emotions? Does his mood usually swing so wildly?

181
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,270
Is it because his mother is too powerful? So that when he is under too much stress, he over—

182
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,420
I was going to talk to you about this, Minister Cha,

183
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,080
but your gaze is too intense. Too intense.

184
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,710
Honestly, it's not good for a woman to have a too intense gaze.

185
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,700
You are really going too far with your words.

186
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,570
First of all, how about switching this live court to a different case—

187
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,600
There was over a million people.

188
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:34,300
They signed a national petition asking we find out who attacked "our" Judge Kang Yo Han.

189
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,260
Isn't that frightening? In just one day, just one day, a million people signed.

190
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,570
The atmosphere is such

191
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,840
that you could cause a real riot if you rub Kang Yo Han the wrong way.

192
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,490
I understand.

193
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,610
If it's a burden on the administration level, I will take care of it.

194
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,090
What do you think you're doing?

195
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,390
What do you think I'm doing?

196
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,030
I will do it.

197
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm not doing it because I want to. Be still.

198
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,500
- I can do it.
- I said stay still.

199
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,990
Can you sit up?

200
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,030
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

201
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,860
Who was that lady earlier?

202
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,720
Who? Nanny?

203
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,050
- She got off from work.
- Nanny?

204
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,930
What is this?

205
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,610
It happened when I was young and childish.

206
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,870
That's unexpected.

207
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,510
- Are you an old fogey?
- What?

208
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,960
It's typical of old fogeys to judge others as they please.

209
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,010
That really hurt!

210
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,800
It's typical of the younger generation to be crybabies.

211
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,830
What? Crybaby?

212
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,530
Hello, my fellow citizens.

213
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,750
This is Judge Oh Jin Ju of the People's Court.

214
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm sure the people of this country are very worried

215
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,150
because of the recent terrorist attack at the Supreme Courthouse.

216
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,000
However our Judge Kang Yo Han will never yield to such intimidation.

217
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,400
As you all are aware, our Judge Kang is a very strong person.

218
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,880
So I hope everyone will show lots of support

219
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,100
to Judge Kang and Judge Kim Ga On —

220
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,190
What is this woman?

221
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,110
- Judge Oh. She's a judge I work with.
- Are you dating her?

222
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,910
- What are you talking about? They're my associate judges, so —

223
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,930
- Are you dating her?
- I said no. Huh?

224
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,020
She's just over-reacting, to the point of tears.

225
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,370
- Aren't you dating?
- No.

226
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,450
- Are you really not dating?
- No.

227
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,790
So boring.

228
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,730
Why did you bring that thing in the bedroom?

229
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,070
Who? Ga On?

230
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,390
Even his name sounds terrible.

231
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,020
Get rid of him soon.

232
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,360
Why? Does he bother you?

233
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,650
If you don't get rid of him soon, I'll kill him.

234
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,600
With those legs? You said that once you could walk, you'd kill me first.

235
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,390
Do one thing at a time, step by step, hmm?

236
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,000
Aren't you going to follow her? Hmm?

237
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,860
Stay still. Don't roam around.

238
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,590
Is there something a stranger shouldn't see?

239
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,150
It's not good to be too nosey.

240
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,650
Well, I'm fine now, so I should go home.

241
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,570
You're safe here. We haven't caught the terrorist yet.

242
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,380
What are you planning to do about the trial?

243
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm bringing a sub-judge to replace you. Don't worry.

244
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,690
"Sub-Judge"?

245
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,570
Judge Jeong In Seok will be a substitute for Judge Kim until he recovers.

246
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,430
Nice to meet you, respected Judge Oh.

247
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,820
Wow, he is the very image of a judge.

248
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,600
- Pardon?
- It's nothing.

249
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,030
- Nice to meet you.
- Ah, yes.

250
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,990
Thank you for being brave enough to help out in this critical situation.

251
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,760
Not at all. It's an honor to become a part of the live court.

252
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,320
I will do my best.

253
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,790
I'm sure you will. Then.

254
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,150
- Let's work hard.
- Pardon?

255
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,020
- Work hard.
- Oh.

256
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, hold on. That's Judge Kim's desk.

257
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,620
Then where should I go?

258
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,880
You can sit there.

259
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,820
Oh, yes.

260
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,310
It won't be long until the live broadcast. Let's get to work.

261
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,030
Yes.

262
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,470
Young Master Yo Han told you to stay in your sickbed.

263
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,560
I was so bored I couldn't stand it anymore.

264
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm not Sleeping Beauty.

265
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,690
I can put you to sleep continuously if you want,

266
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,850
like Sleeping Beauty.

267
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,560
- What did you say?
- Just kidding.

268
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,130
What kind of joke is this brutal?

269
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,460
No one in this house listens to people.

270
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,260
Supreme Court Control Center

271
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,200
We looked everywhere but there were no outsiders.

272
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,190
Ah you're persistent, Detective.

273
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,260
I don't see any outsiders, no matter how much I look.

274
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,570
Could the culprit be from the inside?

275
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,440
From the inside?

276
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,090
Could be.

277
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,020
Right? Judge Kang Yo Han must be having too much success.

278
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,340
There might be a judge hiding a grudge.

279
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,350
The bomb went off from the wall with the painting.

280
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,250
That's right.

281
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,720
What if it weren't that someone came and installed the bomb,

282
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,290
but it had been installed inside the painting from the beginning.

283
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,490
From the beginning?

284
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,510
What's the phone number of the company in charge of interior design for the Live Court Show?

285
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,520
Detective Yun Su Hyeon seems to have found a lead.

286
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,810
Don't lose her. You know that, right?

287
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,470
We have to find them before the police do.

288
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,650
Can you give us a moment to talk?

289
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,750
Excuse me.

290
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,960
Oh my god...!

291
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,250
Remove your hand.

292
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,480
Where are you from?

293
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,880
From the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

294
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,510
Is it true you delivered all

295
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,950
the internal furnishings of the Live Court Show?

296
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,720
Who knows...

297
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,980
Let's start with the transaction books. Is the office over there?

298
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,690
Show me the warrant first.

299
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,890
Aigoo... you must have been very busy.

300
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,140
Take care of the things you need first and come back.

301
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,490
I will be waiting.

302
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,390
You must be in a good mood?

303
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,970
What is this, shit.

304
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,720
This is a fun place.

305
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,410
Do furniture factories handle small bombs like this these days?

306
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,510
This shit.

307
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,910
I almost really died.

308
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,770
You bastard, want to die?

309
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,640
Spare me, I'll tell you everything.

310
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,760
What can I do? I don't have any questions for you.

311
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,550
I'll talk, I'll tell you everything.

312
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,620
Ah.. You talk too much.

313
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,940
Spare me, I'll tell you everything.

314
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,560
The Foundation... someone from the Foundation ordered me to.

315
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,760
They said to just scare you a little.

316
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,100
Dog.

317
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,180
You should stop now.

318
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,510
Judge.

319
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,770
Go tell your owner

320
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,700
that he should come talk to me directly.

321
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,330
Is this because of Judge Kim Ga On?

322
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,870
It seems you behaved.

323
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,300
A present, for behaving.

324
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,840
You're hurt.

325
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,720
It's nothing.

326
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,570
Are the preparations for the Lee Yeong Min trial going well?

327
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,150
Prepare for what? It's a simple case.

328
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,050
I understand that you're the kind of person who prepares thoroughly for the cases, in various ways.

329
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,700
Really?

330
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,360
I have no idea what you're talking about.

331
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,760
You said there's no such thing as justice in reality, right?

332
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,090
It's all just a horribly unfair game.

333
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,790
So what?

334
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,120
What's the reason ...

335
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,770
you decided to join this horribly unfair game?

336
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,710
The reason?

337
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,920
Do I need to have a reason?

338
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,630
Is there something you want to set right? Or is there something you regret?

339
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,360
- Are you an old fogey?
- Pardon?

340
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,770
You said it's typical of old fogeys to judge others as they please.

341
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,020
- That's not what I meant—
- Just focus on recovering.

342
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,720
And enough with your annoying complaints.

Do you think that's important—?

You must have had a blow to your head. Is your face all right?

350

- Hey, Su Hyeon.
- Yeah?

I'm fine. I bet you were very worried.

353
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,100
Su Hyeon, are you okay?

354
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,370
Where are you right now?

- Kang Yo Han's house.
- What?!

356
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,430
What convinced you to trust that bastard and be there?

357
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,440
Well, at least it looks safe here. He has all manner of security systems in place.

358
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,260
Hey, the home owner is the most dangerous of them all. What dog crap are you spouting?

359
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,620
The explosion could be his doing as well.

360
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,430
That's true.

361
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,090
He did try to scare me to not wander around without permission.

362
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,420
Get out of there right now.

363
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,550
I'm already in the tiger's den. I might as well try to dig up some dirt.

364
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,590
There's too little that we know about him.

365
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,650
His family history, background, personal upbringing, and the like.

366
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,000
Listen, Ga On. I'll look into all of that. Leave that to me.

367
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,300
- So don't you do anything else, all right?
- There you go again, mothering me, Yun Su Hyeon.

368
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,550
That's not what I meant—

369
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,820
Anyway, it must be due to the shock, I've been sleepy all day.

370
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,020
But I can't sleep all day, can I?

371
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,520
I'll be careful, so don't worry.

Master Seo, I was moved.

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,140
You really did a great job this time.

394
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,380
Shouldn't we get some good news from Sweden?

Of course.

Forgive us, please.

Chairman Park was being frivolous.

That's right. It's for the country.

402

With that in mind,

403
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,100
shouldn't we start moving those having a hard time to the Dream Village?

404
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,590
Yes, that's right. At the Myeongdong or Gangnam station,

405
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,070
why are there so many homeless people and beggars who are struggling?

406
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,240
That's why, Chairman Park, your hotels are losing money, isn't?

407
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,750
All foreign tourists have stopped staying there, right?

408
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,620
Talking of serious problems, are mine as serious as Chairman Min or Minister Cha Gyeong Hui?

409
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,020
Chairman Min's duty-free shop is in deficit and Minister Cha Gyeong Hui's son is about to be on trial.

Why wouldn't it?

In that way, both your fortunes will be restored, right?

Your approval rating will return, too, Mr. President.

415
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,930
Nevertheless, Mr. President,

416
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,570
it seems that cooperation of the relevant ministries for the Dream Village are being delayed forever.

417
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,120
I guess they don't listen to the president?

418
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,680
I've only finished the first phase of housing complex.

Should the administration be holding us back?

421
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,860
It's because there are a lot of things you want done.

422
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,090
The greenbelt issue must be resolved. Evicting the residents at the shantytown on the premises

423
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,300
and then those houses need to be demolished.

424
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:20,920
- Right?
- But wasn't that all agreed upon?

It's a business to save the country.

426

Don't play with words. How is it a business to save the country?

427
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,910
Why are you raising your voice?

428
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,830
I am someone who became president with the support of the common people.

429
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,430
The shantytown people are all precious citizens to me.

- Honey, stop it.
- Seriously! Hey!

Why would you meddle?

Where... what the hell?

433
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,600
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

434
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,240
I shouldn't have made that mistake...

435
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,120
Director Jeong, are you crazy?

436
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,470
It's wet. What's this? Damn.

437
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,450
I am sorry.

438
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:57,170
Damn. I think it's wet down to my underwear. Honey.

439
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,670
Where did the napkins go?

440
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,810

Why are they acting up?

443
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,780
I am not that old Heo Jeong Se! I'm the commander-in-chief!

444
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,020
Is the commander-in-chief a pushover?

445
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,960
Those businessmen are bastards.

446
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,380
- Are you okay, Honey?
- I'm not okay.

447
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,990
You seem too worked up right now, so get a massage and rest.

448
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,610
- Should I?
- Yes.

449
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,760
Seriously, what the hell!

450
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,970
Oh my. Your neck has a lot of knots.

451
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,180
Director Jeong?

452
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,070
Just a minute. I'll loosen the knots first and then tell you something.

453
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,800
Director Jeong, how come you're here?

454
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,810
But ... do you know anything about massage therapy or hand acupuncture?

455
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,260
I come from a dirt-poor background, you see.

456
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,390
There's nothing I hadn't done until I met Master Seo.

457
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,370
I lived doing massage therapy for a while.

458
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,270
I wouldn't have known.

459
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,660
I was touched earlier.

460
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,830
The heart that's considerate of the powerless and displaced people.

461
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,060
That's a given.

462
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,490
Will 10% of the Dream Village business profits

463
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,260
help change that heart?

464
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,040
Director Jeong speaks cleverly.

465
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,160
I am just an errand runner,

466
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,440
Master Seo arranged everything.

467
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,770
Who else can run errands so cleverly?

468
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,430
I think you are amazing, Director Jeong. Every time I see you ...

469
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,750
Do you like it?

470
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,980
What did you just say to me?

471
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,440
I need to relieve your facial stress with massage too.

472
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,240
Ah, facial massage.

473
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,320
Shall we?

474
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,200
Oh, but, I mean, how did you get in here, Director Jeong?

475
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,410
It's not...

476
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,300
Not anyone

477
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,570
can get in here...

479
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,020
Poor Young Master.

480
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,340
Young Master?

481
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,290
Kang Yo Han isn't home right now.

482
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,000
This house belongs to you, Young Master,

483
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,390
not to that child.

484
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,300
Request for Summary Order

485
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,600
The suspect Lee Yeong Min hit the cheek and punched the abdomen

486
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,600
of the victim, Lee Ji Hun, when he asked him about his parked car.

487
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,480
Is Lee Yeong Miin someone with anger control disorder?

488
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,090
Why would he do this at a restaurant?

489
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,110
He probably lived without needing any control.

490
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,760
Why bother to control it?

491
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,420
Kim Yeon Hui!

492
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,940
Okay, Thank you.

493
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,010
Why did we come to this messy place?

494
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,400
Oppa.

495
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,150
This is a famous alleyway restaurant because it was on a TV-show.

496
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,520
It's a hot place.

497
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,900
Okay

498
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,230
You should eat a lot.

499
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,430
You are not allowed to park here.

500
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,270
Is the owner of car 0615 here?

501
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,400
Is the owner of car 0615 here?

502
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,900
Is the owner of car 0615 here? I'm sorry.

503
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,460
- Is the owner of car 0615 here?
- That's our car.

504
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,060
It's our car, Oppa.

505
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,240
Are you the owner of the car in front of the restaurant?

506
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
- So...
- I'm sorry but can you move the car?

507
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,700
Why?

508
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,590
If it's parked there, it obstructs traffic. People are complaining

509
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,250
- I'm sorry.
- Here.

510
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,980
- You move it.
- Excuse me?

511
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,390
I gave you the car key for you to move it.

512
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,260
I can't carelessly drive a customer's car...

513
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,400
Hey. Don't you see I'm drinking?

514
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,890
Will you take responsibility if I get caught drinking and driving?

515
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,900
- Then the lady...
- Ah damnit!

516
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,000
Hey, are you kidding me right now?

517
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,110
Is there a place with no valet parking these days?

518
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,480
Where are they, huh?

519
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,870
You put me in a bad mood because of you doing business in a crap place like this.

520
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,510
- I said stop it!
- Let go!

521
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,530
You shouldn't be like this.

522
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,690
How could you hit someone, sir?

523
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,360
- Ah, I can't do that, huh?

524
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,460
You can't do this!

525
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,600
Can you hit me, huh? Hit me, you bastard!

526
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,960
Among the victims, did the cook have a record for assault?

527
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,880
That's why he tried hard to bear it as much as he could.

528
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,170
Please don't do this. Don't do this.

529
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,650
What? You need money too, don't you?

530
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,680
Then you should get hit.

531
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,640
- I'm begging you to stop.
- Why? Why should I?

532
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,910
Why should I stop?

533
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,300
Why do you keep telling me to stop?

534
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,010
It's fun right now, no? Isn't it?

535
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,540
Is it not fun? It's fun.

536
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,530
You really!

537
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,510
Even though his side tried to get them to do a settlement multiple times, because they were so furious,

538
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,970
they all refused. They said they'd never do it.

539
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,430
The three victims were of a same mind on this.

540
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,330
Yes, Minister.

541
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,820
Yes, Chief Justice.

542
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,340
- Hello?
- Is this Mr. Kim Seong Hun?

543
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Yes, speaking.

544
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,690
This is the Prosecutors' Office.

545
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,930
- You will have to come see us. 
- For what reason?

546
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,980
You have previously been investigated on charges of assault, haven't you?

547
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,880
I was punished for it and the case is over.

548
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,690
- Not necessarily. We are the ones deciding whether it's over. 
- Sorry?

549
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,810
We've had information that the investigation back then was insufficient.

550
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,260
So you should come.

551
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,900
You understand me, don't you?

552
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,310
Kang Yo Han's family certificate?

553
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,090
Yes. I'm sure there is something in there.

554
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,060
Can you look it up for me?

555
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,420
Well, I'm not sure.

556
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,800
There's no criminal charges against him right now, so I don't know if I can.

557
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,110
Right.

558
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,530
Still, I'll try to find out.

559
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,540
- Thanks, Su Hyeon.
- No worries, bye.

560
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,530
There's a document for you.

561
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,380
Thank you.

562
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,440
What's this? Another one?

563
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,330
Did you receive another settlement agreement?

564
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,240
Yesterday it was the young male employee's, and today we get the female part-timer's.

565
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,240
"It was resolved amicably and the victim does not wish for a criminal punishment", it says.

566
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,130
Oh? This woman even filed a petition asking Lee Yeong Min be severely punished.

567
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,950
And such person submitted a settlement agreement right on the day before the trial.

568
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,650
Ah, the defendant must really have expressed a lot of remorse this time.

569
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,930
I can't imagine how sincere his apology must have felt, for her to change her mind.

570
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,690
- Listen, Young Master.
- Yes?

571
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,590
Does the world seem all sweet and pretty as flowers to you?

572
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,490
What do you mean?

573
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,490
Powerful people don't show remorse.

574
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,880
Showing remorse is what the powerless do.

575
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,400
Do you get it?

576
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,250
Yes.

577
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,060
I'm sorry.

578
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,800
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Why would you be?

579
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
I'll take care of it myself.

580
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,680
Will you go to the trial tomorrow?

581
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,250
I should.

582
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:52,530
Honestly, I wouldn't feel as wronged now if I had given him a good punch then.

583
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,300
If I had done that, I would have put it behind me.

584
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,770
But I can't live on like this. I might die from anger.

585
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,240
Chef.

586
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,760
Forget it. You two haven't done anything wrong.

587
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,600
Chef!

588
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,400
I'm saying this out of concern for you, Judge Kang.

589
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,930
In situations like this, confronting the prosecution head-to-head is—

590
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,060
Chief Justice, sir.

591
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,080
Do you believe that every citizen is equal before the law?

592
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,900
I don't know. But why do you ask?

593
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,250
I don't believe that.

594
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,570
I think it's a very naive idea, like believing that Santa Claus comes on Christmas.

595
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:37,390
But aren't there times when you would like to believe in such naive ideas?

596
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,780
Listen, Judge Kang—

597
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,790
Please think of this trial as a 'Christmas special' movie.

598
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,450
Oh, and also...

599
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,420
Please tell them they do not need to worry about me.

600
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,590
How come you woke up early?

601
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,820
You seemed to sleep until noon every day.

602
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,920
Lee Yeong Min's trial is today, isn't it?

603
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,800
Are you going to cheer me on?

604
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,320
I know this case is lacking evidence.

605
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,270
If you ever need someone to testify...

606
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,660
Why, did you see something?

607
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,570
I saw him driving in a threatening way.

608
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,030
Did you?

609
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,770
And you didn't see anything else?

610
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,360
Hey. Hey, hey!

611
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,670
Don't worry about the trial. Be good and focus on recuperating.

612
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,170
Dear citizens, you have waited a long time.

613
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,740
The live court that was postponed due to an unexpected accident is now resuming.

614
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,980
We cannot wait to see what kind of satisfying trial will be shown before us today.

615
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,720
It's now time for the second Live Court Show to start.

616
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,700
Give a big round of applause!
[You are the judge]

617
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,210
Before we begin the trial,

618
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:11,540
dear citizens, there is something I must tell you.

619
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:17,400
Unfortunately, Judge Kim Ga On cannot be present with us on this trial.

620
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,930
- What the heck is that?
- Let us pray that Judge Kim can come back to us in good health.

621
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,620
We need your prayers, dear citizens.

622
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,310
Why is he making such a big deal out of it?

623
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:31,180
There could be some people who do not want this trial to proceed.

624
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,140
And among them, there must be many powerful people.

625
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,760
The only ones who can protect us is you, the citizens of this country.

626
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,910
We respect you! Be strong!

627
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,960
Be strong!

628
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,500
Defendant

629
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,890
Let us start with the trial.
[Defendant Lee Yeong Min. Occupation / Vice President of Jongwon F&B]

630
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,380
The defendant has been indicted

631
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,760
with charges of assault for verbal abuse and infliction of injury

632
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,450
against the head cook, an employee and a part-timer in a restaurant.

633
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,030
Defendant Lee Yeong Min, please step forward.

634
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,760
Defendant Lee Yeong Min.

635
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,100
Please step forward.

636
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,120
Why?

637
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,650
Prosecutor

638
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,440
Your Honor.

639
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,470
Yes, Prosecutor.

640
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,820
I think there is something to clarify before we begin with the trial.

641
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,200
Is that so? Please tell us.

642
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,390
As you already know, this is a simple assault case.

643
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:02,820
For this kind of crime, if the victim doesn't wish the defendant to be punished, he cannot be punished.

644
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,910
In the case that all the victims submit a settlement agreement,

645
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:08,790
the prosecution has no choice but to cancel the indictment.

646
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,800
Isn't there one victim who hasn't agreed to settle yet?

647
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,920
Are you referring to this person?

648
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,000
Please go to the witness stand.

649
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,950
Please take a seat.

650
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,230
Witness

651
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:34,270
Do you wish to say something?

652
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,530
I wish that the defendant

653
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,920
is not punished.

654
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,880
Content

655
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,280
- Mr. Kim Seong Hun?
- Yes.

656
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,440
- You filed several petitions asking for the defendant to receive severe punishment, is that right?
- Yes.

657
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,710
May I ask the reason why you have changed your mind?

658
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,180
I just...

659
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,600
- I wanted to stop.
- Why is that?

660
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:18,090
Is there anything you can't tell me, boss?

661
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,850
Tell me. What's the reason?

662
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,910
- The building's been sold.
- What?

663
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:28,200
This whole building was sold. To some company.

664
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,300
Why this old building in the outskirts. Why all of the sudden?

665
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,190
- They're demolishing it.
- What? Are they going to put up a new building?

666
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:39,440
They're just demolishing it. They're just going to leave it as bare land.

667
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,530
They want to keep the restaurant vacant until the contract expires.

668
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:47,610
I mean, then you'll be kicked out without even getting compensation. Perhaps it's —

669
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:51,010
Stop whining, it was probably a coincidence.

670
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:57,680
Things like that may happen in life, right?

671
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,930
Since no one got hurt, why not pretend as if nothing happened?

672
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,050
Is that so?

673
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,000
Since all the victims don't want the defendant to be punished,

674
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,730
the prosecution has no choice but to drop the charges, Your Honor.

675
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,840
Oh, uh, Your Honor?

676
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:25,330
Give me a bit of time... Ah, that ...

677
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,430
I'm sorry.

678
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,600
I'm sorry.

679
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:56,620
What do I do about this? I'm sorry.

680
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,910
Then I'll end the trial with this.

681
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,620
- Prosecutor?
- Yes.

682
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:09,670
What do you call a person repeating the same thing?

683
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,080
What do you mean by that all of a sudden?

684
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,740
Cases where the same crime is repeated habitually.

685
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,490
Did they not teach you about that in law school?

686
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:22,360
Are you talking about habitual offenders?

687
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,710
Simple assault cannot be punished if there is a settlement.

688
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,070
But is that the case with habitual assault as well?

689
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:32,930
It's not. However, there is no evidence to label the accused Lee Yeong Min as a habitual offender.

690
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,690
How many times has he hit someone but since there was a settlement, you didn't prosecute and dropped the charges?

691
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,190
A total of 12 times.

692
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,260
- But are those alone enough proof?
- Is it not enough?

693
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,880
Prosecutors these days are very attentive to the guarantee of human rights.

694
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,790
It's very commendable. Please go back.

695
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,500
Defendant

696
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,490
- Then let's ask the all the citizens.
- Excuse me?

697
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,860
All the citizens who are participating in this trial right now.

698
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,540
By chance, is the defendant's face familiar?

699
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,520
Close up on Lee Yeong Min. Go! More, more!

700
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,770
Judge, what on earth are you doing?

701
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:17,550
If you look at the DIKE app you downloaded, there is a button for video transmission.

702
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,940
Please tell me if you are familiar with the defendant's face.

703
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:30,290
I'll pay you 10,000 won! 10,000 won!

704
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,880
- I'm paying you generously.
- You did a good job.

705
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,480
- You're here?
- Yes, yes.

706
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,170
- Be careful. I'm going to weigh this.
- Okay, okay.

707
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,030
- You're here.
- Hi. Thanks, thanks.

708
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,950
- You should rest a bit.
- Yes, right.

709
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,130
That...

710
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,920
Hey, what is this?

711
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,580
I’ll take care of it.

712
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,010
Producer, we got a tip-off video coming in. Shall we connect?

713
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,060
Okay, do it.

714
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,230
It connected. What is this? Is this really going out nationwide?

715
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,250
Yes, it's showing you very well. Go ahead.

716
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,000
Hello, Judge!

717
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,410
I'm a big fan. You're so cool.

718
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,560
All my friends are going crazy too.

719
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,890
Thank you. So, do you recognize the defendant's face?

720
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:27,190
I know it! That crazy bast... Right, this is a broadcast...

721
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,220
That man is a complete psycho.

722
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,730
I worked part-time at a department store parking lot.

723
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,160
I did this..

724
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,460
- Yes. So?
- But well, that man,

725
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,530
he came out of the car, screaming that there was a traffic jam in the parking lot.

726
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,390
Then he started kicking the parking attendant.

727
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:48,060
I was so startled that I went there. Asking me who I was, he slapped my face.

728
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,290
But the company told me to endure it because he was a VVIP guest.

729
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:57,550
I was very angry and resentful.

730
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,990
Hey! You f**king cra...

731
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,620
Is it all right for you to say that now?

732
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,890
Yes, no problem. I was fired anyway.

733
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,850
Objection! This has not even been officially investigated...

734
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:18,080
Are you willing to make an official statement to the investigative agency about all that happened at that time?

735
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,340
Of course! I'm already pissed off. This works out.

736
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,500
Please make sure to punish him! I beg you.

737
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,670
He's a regular at my place, and he hits people every time he comes.

738
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:36,350
Waiter, bartender, valet guy. Anyone who he thought was an easy target he would hit! That's not right!

739
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:40,280
In addition, there was this new female employee.

740
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,660
I was trying to calm her down when she was crying.

741
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,540
Wow. Do I really need to do all of this as part of my work?

742
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,170
And whenever things don't go according to his liking, he just uses violence!

743
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,080
He doesn't provide hospital fees, or insurance.

744
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,320
I'm okay if I'm fired.

745
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,400
I'll tell everything!

746
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,680
There's so much I can say.

747
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,050
- The valet guy. 
- That jerk.

748
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,850
Do you know how old he is? He probably has a son his age!

749
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,860
He just kicked him in the shin, saying he didn't park his car well.

750
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,860
No, I wouldn't have told you if he only had dragged him out.

751
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:23,210
He came into our store last month and insisted on changing his phone screen.

752
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:27,360
I told him we couldn't do that, and he started pushing me abruptly and tried to step all over me.

753
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,740
When I told him to stop, he suddenly started to break all of the displays at our store.

754
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:35,880
- "Who are you to block me?" ...
- I am...

755
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,540
It's a high-paying part-time job ...
- With the yellow sport car ...

756
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,270
It was because of this.

757
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:56,130
That's why he put him on a public trial.

758
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,580
What kind of bullshit is this?

759
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,670
It looks like a Christmas tree.

760
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:55,450
Dear citizens, how do you want to punish a man like this?

761
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:01,060
A trial is a game. A game where if you can't prove it, you lose.

762
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,260
Severe punishment - Against 11%

763
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,360
In favor 89%.

764
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,450
Cut! Cut! Yes!!

765
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:17,090
3 million! We broke through! It's done! It's done!

766
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,810
Is it still not enough? Proof of habituality.

767
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:27,700
This court requires the prosecution to change the indictment.

768
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,520
This case is not just simple assault but habitual assault.

769
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,830
Change the arraignment and proceed to trial.

770
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:41,630
It's best to rush. This anger may be directed at the prosecution if it's too slow.

771
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,040
- Mr. Kim Seong Hun.
- Yes?

772
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,180
Habitual assault can be punished even if an assailant agrees to settle with a victim.

773
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,990
The incident against Kim Seong Hun will also be judged.

774
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,960
Thank you, thank you.

775
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,360
I'm not going to allow any of the cases get buried.

776
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,380
Justice cannot be bought with money.

777
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,090
A little more, a little more! Audience! Reaction! Reaction!

778
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,920
What's the reason you decided to join that horribly unfair game?

779
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,660
A reason. Must there always be a reason?

780
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,040
Is there something you want to fix? Or something you regret?

781
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,690
Eichmann in Jerusalem

782
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,980
What a curious princess you are.

783
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,440
Who is this man?

784
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,060
Who is it?

785
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,480
- Young Master Isaac.
- Isaac?

786
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,930
Yes, Young Master Isaac, older brother of Young Master Yo Han.

787
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,760
The rightful heir of this mansion.

788
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,550
Kang Yo Han's older brother?

789
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,600
Then, did this man live in this basement?

790
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,250
- No.
- Then?

791
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,890
This place is...

792
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:31,790
This is Young Master Yo Han's room.

793
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,340
What?

794
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:40,000
Yo Han was an abandoned child.

795
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:43,770
Nobody wanted him.

796
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,030
Kang Yo Han had been abandoned?

797
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,400
Then was he not blood-related to this household? Can you tell me the details? Please?

798
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,280
What I'm suspicious about is Kang Yo Han.

799
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,850
I already know that he is someone capable of anything.

800
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,490
He already did astonishing things even as an elementary school student.

801
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:04,240
So yours was not just simple curiosity, after all.

802
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,580
Then you should look into it yourself.

803
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:16,060
This house belongs to you, Young Master, not to that child.

804
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,890
Isaac must have been lacking in some way?

805
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,210
What?

806
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:28,560
There is no way that the owner of house would have given his entire estate to someone who is not related by blood.

807
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,450
So maybe Kang Yo Han deserved it more?

808
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,860
What do you know?

809
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,960
I'm sorry.

810
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:51,260
If it's difficult to talk about, you don't have to.

811
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,960
You resemble him a lot.

812
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,570
Especially your eyes.

813
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:02,930
Young Master Isaac lost his mother early.

814
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:07,940
Chairman Kang stayed holed up at home all the time after he lost his wife.

815
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:12,260
The source of trouble began when Chairman Kang's friends took him to bars.

816
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:16,530
A barmaid who spent one night with the chairman when he was drunk and half-unconscious

817
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:21,780
came to this mansion demanding money because she was pregnant.

818
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,120
After being refused, that woman...

819
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,240
Dad.

820
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,580
Dad.

821
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:52,180
Eichmann in Jerusalem
Crime and Punishment
The Moon and Sixpence

822
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:06,050
Father!

823
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,030
Chairman, why do you hate Young Master Yo Han so much?

824
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,820
It's fine if you fire me. What did a child do so wrong?

825
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:50,220
Because he resembles me. That boy resembles me so much.

826
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:58,940
But Isaac...

827
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,550
Isaac is different.

828
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:11,370
Yo Han will someday devour his older brother.

829
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,600
Then why do you suspect Yo Han, too?

830
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:18,360
What do you mean?

831
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,620
You said that Young Master Isaac was the rightful heir to this mansion.

832
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,960
Doesn't that mean that Kang Yo Han stole his place in some wrongful way?

833
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,550
Do you have evidence to suspect Kang Yo Han?

834
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,800
No, nothing like that.

835
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,130
But according to what you said, Kang Yo Han is a victim of his father's abuse.

836
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,030
And I also breastfed him and raised him.

837
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:43,620
But before all that, Young Master Yo Han was already someone who was capable of anything,

838
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,580
just as you said before.

839
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,110
So why exactly ...

840
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:51,320
He made the maid who liked him jump off the second floor

841
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,340
and fed weed killer to the hunting dog that the chairman cherished.

842
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:38,790
Was there perhaps some reason for those actions?

843
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:44,900
Perhaps they bothered him in some way. But they could also be just simple pranks.

844
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:51,780
But what child would do such things without any hesitation?

845
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,640
Who are you?

846
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,750
It's been a long time.

847
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,290
Don't you remember me?

848
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,150
You... you...

849
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,540
That... Catholic church.

850
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,220
Fire.

851
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:45,650
Oh no. He's going to catch me!

852
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:48,610
What should I do?

853
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,130
But Isaac was good to Kang Yo Han, you said.

854
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,030
And they had a good relationship, didn't they?

855
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,730
Young Master Yo Han was a survivor of a fire...

856
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,690
Don't come closer!

857
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:14,950
Have you heard about that?

858
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,260
Yes.

859
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,850
It happened only one month after the chairman passed away.

860
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:24,940
And Young Master Isaac died in that fire.

861
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,890
You didn't sell this?

862
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,640
Perhaps you liked it?

863
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:28,030
Spare me... spare me...

864
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,840
The Devil Judge
We thank actor Joo Seok Tae for his special appearence.

865
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:07,100
♫ I stay up all night ♫

866
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,500
♫ I think about your eyes ♫

867
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,510
Does it have to be Cha Gyeong Hui?

868
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,040
Equality Before the Law

869
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,700
The next term of the presidency, I mean.

870
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,500
What are you saying right now?

871
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,190
Tell me. What happened in this house?

872
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:22,560
How do you think Yo Han became the owner of this house?

873
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,730
You know about the fire at the Catholic church ten years ago, don't you?

874
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,900
What did you find out, Kim Ga On?

875
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,760
What is it that you want from me? Power? Dominance?

876
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,230
- What sort of cruelty is this?
- It's fun, isn't it?

877
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:35,560
Is this also why you killed your older brother?

878
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,940
I dare you to say it again! Say it again!

879
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:44,710
♫ You said I'll live in the sunlight ♫
