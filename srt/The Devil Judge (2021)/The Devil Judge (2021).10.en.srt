This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea. All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional.

00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,550
Episode 10

9
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,900
My money!

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,120
Chief!

11
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,700
Chief!

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,880
There are people in there!

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,100
- Don't do it!
- Spare us!

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,440
Chief! Kang Yo Han!

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,840
Stop! Stop!

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,110
I'm just giving him an opportunity.

17
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
- Spare them, please.
- Don't do it!

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,820
- Don't do it!
- Don't do it! No!

19
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,580
Honey! Honey, save us!

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,070
Help!

21
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,940
Let go! Let go!

22
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,560
Calm down and watch him!

23
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,830
My money!

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,690
- My money!
- Honey, save us!

25
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,930
What is this? It's all fake!

26
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,310
It's not my money.

27
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,790
It isn't my money!

28
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,840
- We have to save them!
- Calm down.

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,040
Look at who he really is.

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,690
I mean, this is...

31
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,690
He even lied to his family.

32
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,510
He told them he didn't have any money left.

33
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,760
Seo Jin. Dad had no other choice. Seo Jin, I... Seo Jin...

34
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,880
Honey... Honey, I'll explain...

35
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,350
Damn!

36
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,010
Don't go, damn it! Don't go!

37
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,800
Now, if you want revenge, do it. Don't hesitate.

38
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,110
Please spare me.

39
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,250
I was wrong. Please spare me.

40
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,950
Spare me.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,990
Please spare me. Please. Please.

42
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,930
My money... my money...my money!

43
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,150
He's the only bait if we want to catch Cha Gyeong Hui, isn't he?

44
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,940
Let's not waste it.

45
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,370
Are you having fun?

46
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm not sure... I don't know how to do anything else with cards.

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
- You don't know?
- No.

48
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,950
You haven't played card games before?

49
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,880
Whom would I play with?

50
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,990
Well, of course, your family—

51
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,550
Or your friends...

52
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,650
I'm sorry, I'm saying useless things again.

53
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,760
Are you being nosey again?

54
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,450
Don't jump to conclusions. I just don't like getting along with people.

55
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,150
Besides that,

56
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,680
I was grateful that you let me catch Do Yeong Chun.

57
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,180
You shouldn't be. We've only built the second floor.

58
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,320
The second floor?

59
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,670
We passed Cha Gyeong Hui's secretary and caught Do Yeong Chun.

60
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,930
Now, we have to move onto the next step.

61
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,350
If we pass Cha Gyeong Hui, is Heo Jung Se next? Where is the end?

62
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,470
I'm not sure, it depends on how many floors the house is being built to.

63
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,650
I think it's more fun to destroy the whole thing.

64
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,330
You really thought I'd topple it, didn't you?

65
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,400
Did you find out who was behind the Bamboo Spear? It looks like you were digging really hard.

66
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes. The start of the Bamboo Spears' assaults coincided with when

67
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,820
Heo Jung Se instigated his followers to take to the streets.

68
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,940
You can't just trust the police.

69
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,880
We are the owners, so we will have to make Korea safe.

70
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,700
Tonight, we're going to become the real masters.

71
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,780
And anything else?

72
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,340
- Butler?
- Yes.

73
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,800
Can you turn on episode 86 of Heo Jung Se's personal broadcast?

74
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,350
The second week of September four years ago.

75
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,150
Yes.

76
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,410
The two of you have become friends.

77
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,000
Korea's Total Change! Heo Jung Se's 'So Refreshing!'

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,050
Hello, I'm Do Yeon Jeong.

79
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,500
Hey, It's Heo Jung Se. My beloved and respected viewers.

80
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,640
The reason why you're all unemployed, losers,

81
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,260
just why you can't even once date a pretty girl as I do,

82
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,330
the reason why you're all living so pathetically ...

83
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,050
I will tell you the real reason.

84
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,290
Those at the top, the ones with vested interest.

85
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,480
They're abandoning you.

86
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,240
It's because they're replacing all of you with

87
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,270
cheap, obedient, low-quality foreigners!

88
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,270
Do you understand? Understand? Understand?

89
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,540
We understand.

90
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,060
I've talked about Master Seo Jeong Hak many times.

91
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,140
19000 won, 19000 won.
The Crisis of The Korean People

92
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,280
Make sure to read it. The pure ethnicity of the Korean people will disappear

93
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,060
from the earth and ours will become a country with no roots or genealogy,

94
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,390
swarming with all kinds of mongrels.

95
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,070
You have to wake up!

96
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:07,430
You have to get up with a bamboo spear and protect your country.

97
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,750
Patriotic Boys or Patriotic Youth Corps, we'll make something like this,

98
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,580
all over the country, and we'll build an army–

99
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,540
Honey, that's enough, that's enough.

100
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,510
Dear viewers, you always have to listen to pretty girls. Got it?

101
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,610
Look at you laughing because you know my wife is pretty.

102
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,190
So obsessed with women, you loser.

103
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,350
Show him to the camera. This loser's mugshot.

104
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,940
Stop.

105
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,290
He was a part of the video editing staff.

106
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,780
It seems he was the president of Heo Jung Se's fan club, then was selected as a staff member.

107
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,790
He even worked as an election campaigner during the presidential election.

108
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,250
Interesting. He's going to organize a patriotic youth corp nationwide.

109
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,550
That guy Heo Jung Se had a crazy dream since early on.

110
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,370
Should we put him in court? This guy?

111
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,240
Of course, I agree. If we leave it like this, we don't know what else he'll do.

112
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,760
They act as if they're some kind of militia.

113
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,810
Cheers.

114
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm very amused by you making Kang Yo Han a campaign model.

115
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,860
To prevent him from screwing around our business, our Director Jeong – I mean, I should call you Chairwoman Jeong now ...

116
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,110
Don't worry. I will keep a tight hold on him.

117
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,800
We've wasted so much time because that hotshot model got into our Dream Village business.

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,960
That's all money wasted.

119
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,070
So now, let's not be self-conscious and just push forward, all right?

120
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,590
We'll gather up all the poor and the ones protesting in Seoul, put them in the camp,

121
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,570
and make it a real entertainment show.

122
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,150
The title will be "Clean Korea."

123
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,880
We need to get rid of all the illegal immigrants.

124
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,540
That's the best way to boost your approval rating.

125
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,010
Just wait a little longer. I can't do anything

126
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,380
just by trusting the police and prosecutors, who only think of stabbing me in the back.

127
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,630
I'll build a much more loyal organization and make sure it gets done.

128
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,390
We're almost ready now.

129
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,960
Ministry of Justice Unit 2
Juvenile Education Center TF

130
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,130
HMBN Chairman Park Du Man

131
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,980
Recording Log Report

132
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,210
How far did you get on verifying the contents of Jeong Seon Ah's file?

133
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,150
It's not easy because it's from a long time ago, Minister.

134
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,620
Stop everything else and put all the teams together on this.

135
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,550
What are you doing? Work faster.

136
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,990
Yes, Minister. But there is one thing the team leader is worried about.

137
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,230
What is it?

138
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,960
Recently, there has been a growing number of random unprovoked attacks.

139
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,630
The main targets are foreign workers and women.

140
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,620
So what?

141
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, there's a lot of public criticism, asking what the Ministry of Justice is doing about it.

142
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,790
Did people die at least?

143
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,140
No. But because they happen in the middle of the street in broad daylight.

144
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,020
It is causing a head-on collision with the "Safe Korea" slogan.

145
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,450
That's Heo Jung Se's slogan. Heo Jung Se's presidential campaign pledge.

146
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,630
Why would I care about that?

147
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,910
I'm sorry, Minister.

148
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,530
Heo Jung Se ... That man seems to think he will gain power from instigating overgrown kids

149
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:27,610
to create fear. He's delusional.

150
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,510
If we leave it alone, there will definitely be some who will go overboard.

151
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,100
When someone dies and the anger of the people is at its peak,

152
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,500
then that's when we'll go out to fight it.

153
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,790
I, Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui,

154
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,600
as the next presidential candidate,

155
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,500
will aim for a unified Republic of Korea and embrace it.

156
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,460
That's right, Minister.

157
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,800
Focus on Jeong Seon Ah.

158
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,430
We have to step on it before it gets any bigger.

159
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,650
Seo Jeong Hak's sudden death is strange.

160
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,010
There must be a bigger picture here. One that bitch Jeong Seon Ah drew.

161
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,770
Yes, I understand.

162
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,630
- And, by the way ...
- Yes?

163
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,790
Are you frequently checking in on that guy?

164
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,870
Whom are you talking about?

165
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,760
Do Yeong Chun.

166
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,120
Ah, yes, I'm checking on him regularly.

167
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,570
I'm sure he has money hidden somewhere.

168
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,460
That sly bastard. He'd do anything for money.

169
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,370
What are you doing? Get out of here.

170
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,510
Ah, yes. Sorry.

171
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,310
To discuss a recent hot topic, I am here with Judge Oh Jin Ju of the live court show.

172
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,980
- Hello, Judge.
- Hello.

173
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,320
- Your recent photoshoot was truly amazing.
- Thank you.

174
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,550
Everybody is crazy about you. You should quit being a judge and become a movie star.

175
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,450
Not anyone can be an actor.

176
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,530
Everyone, I am meant to be a public official.

177
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,890
Retirement is a long way away.

178
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,980
Your Honor has great sense of humor.

179
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't you feel a little overwhelmed, Judge?

180
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,990
You work under the eyes of the entire country.

181
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,120
You must be exhausted.

182
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,620
No. How could I be when so many people are rooting for me?

183
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,260
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes.

184
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,690
There are many people who send letters here to the judge's office.

185
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,910
- Shall I show you?
- Yes.

186
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,140
Did you collect them all by yourself?

187
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:54,410
It gives me strength and joy to have people who support and believe in me.

188
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,390
I can feel the sincerity of Judge Oh Jin Ju's feelings

189
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,770
You're the best!

190
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,830
It's over.

191
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,760
You were really amazing, Judge Oh.

192
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
I'm actually kind of cool, you know.

193
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,390
You should have done the interview too. It was a little awkward by myself.

194
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,240
I'm camera-shy.

195
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,770
Is that going to work? In this age of media, we need to communicate more with the citizens.

196
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,830
We need to be doing our next trial at a time like this.

197
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,900
I don't know what our chief is doing.

198
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,180
I have something to show you.

199
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,660
What is it?

200
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,960
- Watch out.
- Don't move!

201
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,680
- Get him too!

202
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,360
Oh my! These guys are crazy! Oh my! How could they?

203
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
What are the cops doing not arresting these guys?

204
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,140
Hey! That's cool. Awesome.

205
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,060
Wait a minute.

206
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,890
We are the power.
Bamboo Spear

207
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,960
Should we

208
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,880
bring him to court?
- To the live court?

209
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,000
Judge Oh agreed.

210
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,060
But the problem is—

211
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,460
How do we get him to court when the cops are protecting him? That problem, right?

212
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,800
Yes. Charges must be filed for the trial to take place.

213
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,160
I don't know if it's possible to get him, with the President watching his back.

214
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,550
Why not? There is a way. The best person to help out with this.

215
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,720
Who are you talking about?

216
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,080
Well... Who would hate things more than anyone going the way Heo Jung Se wants?

217
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,700
Cha Gyeong Hui?

218
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,790
But will Cha Gyeong Hui help you with your plans?

219
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,830
Of course she won't listen to me.

220
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,900
That's why Lawyer Go In Guk leaked it to Cha Gyeong Hui through his connection with the prosecution.

221
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,390
Heo Jung Se's private organization is the Bamboo Spears.

222
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,090
If they catch him, we'll be able to prosecute him.

223
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,530
But they would find it burdensome to arrest him themselves.

224
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,090
But there is one cop who can catch him.

225
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,640
A cop?

226
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,020
Do you mean Su Hyeon?

227
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,280
The commissioner is protecting that yard, so she'll have to go into that yard alone without any backup.

228
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,190
It can't be Su Hyeon.

229
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,800
Isn't she already on the move?

230
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,270
All right, okay. Now that Busan is done, after Busan

231
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,540
then we'll go to Daegu. Then where?

232
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,550
Then Daejeon.

233
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,930
Where are all my Daejeon people? You'll show us what you got, right?

234
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,940
You don't want to lose to those guys.

235
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,500
- Show them how cool and patriotic you are, okay?
- What are you thinking about so seriously?

236
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,960
You startled me. When did you manage to sneak up silently on me?

237
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,770
You want to catch him?

238
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,680
Well...

239
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,480
Fine, you're right.

240
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,510
Since he was caught last time, he's been hiding and live-streaming alone like this.

241
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,630
Then you'll need to track him down. Should I help?

242
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,980
You will?

243
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,340
Give it here.

244
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,120
Really?

245
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,220
Here you go.

246
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,610
Let's see...

247
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,930
Alright, I doubt it's going to be this easy, but first...

248
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,000
Incorrect IP Address

249
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,250
I knew it. They've got tight security.

250
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,530
Computer majors are truly on another level.

251
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,900
Gangster

252
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,180
One second.

253
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,880
- Yeah, Su Hyeon.
- Yeah, Ga On.

254
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,880
- You're not coming home tonight?
- Oh, I've been busy.

255
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,520
Beyond that, are you all right?

256
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,090
That Bamboo Spear bastard edited the video of you pointing a gun at him as it suited him and uploaded it.

257
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,250
Don't even mention it. I had to turn in my gun because of that.

258
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,400
That jerk needs to be caught already.

259
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,850
But the higher-ups won't help and I can't get help from the cyber bureau either.

260
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,340
If even I don't take action, we really don't know how far he will go.

261
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,640
You're already working on it?

262
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,020
Oh, I'm playing a game now.

263
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,160
- A game?
- Yeah.

264
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,580
You probably think all hacking is done by pounding on the keyboard, don't you?

265
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,070
Gosh, all you ordinary people.

266
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,810
A program is working hard in the background, so just wait.

267
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:20,510
It'll probably take a while. Maybe a day, or even a week.

268
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,970
Thank you, Elijah.

269
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,700
What's the matter?

270
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,900
He just clicked on the link I left in the comments section.

271
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,000
I didn't expect he would fall for such a simple trap.

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,610
What was it?

273
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,690
Girl group pictures.

274
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,580
Girl group?

275
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,660
Yeah, Ga On.

276
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,740
What? You found Bamboo Spear's location?

277
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,940
Where is he? I'll go right now.

278
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,100
Calm down first, Su Hyeon.

279
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,740
It's too dangerous to go alone, so let's request an official investigation first.

280
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,050
I told you no one will help anyway.

281
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,690
Plus, catching a coward like him is no big deal.

282
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,500
You don't even have a gun. It's too dangerous to go alone.

283
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,700
Stop worrying, Kim Ga On, and just give me the address.

284
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,710
I'm serious. Send me the address now.

285
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,540
Su Hyeon ... Su ...

286
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,030
Presumed to have murdered Seo Jeong Hak

287
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,910
The story's here, but

288
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,230
the evidence is lacking.

289
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,860
To drag her down in one shot, I need at least more circumstantial evidence.

290
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,480
- Minister Cha.
- What is it?

291
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,360
- The foundation has cut down on funding for the ministry.
- What did you just say?

292
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,970
Since they decided it unilaterally all of a sudden,

293
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,460
we won't have enough funds to run the unofficial organizations.

294
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,160
This wench is really...

295
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,580
Minister Cha, you can't do this without an appointment!

296
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,550
I'm sorry, she insisted on entering.

297
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,580
Damn it.

298
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,910
It's all right. I slept well.

299
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,220
Don't be like that, remember she works for our country.

300
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,090
Long time no see.

301
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,290
Has it been?

302
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,850
I've been a bit distant, haven't I?

303
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,890
Please forgive me.

304
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,480
Being the board chairwoman hasn't been easy.

305
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,430
Why did you cut back on funding for the ministry?

306
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,780
So you've come because of that?

307
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,680
You must've been very upset. Please try to understand.

308
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,670
There are many organizations to help,

309
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,080
and people are getting stingier with their money, so we're getting fewer donations.

310
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,920
But you're increasing funds given to the Blue House?

311
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,200
Well...

312
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,900
That was decided by the working-level employees,

313
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,870
so I don't remember it well.

314
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,230
Shall I refresh your memory?

315
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,880
Do you smell something?

316
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,410
Like what?

317
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,940
For some reason, there's a stink of blood surrounding you.

318
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,690
I wonder why that is.

319
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,850
What are you talking about?

320
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,930
How long has it been since Chairman Seo's death?

321
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,540
Right.

322
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,500
I must have hit a sore spot. I apologize if I did.

323
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,450
You served him for a long time. It must be painful and heartbreaking.

324
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,600
What exactly is it you're trying to say, Minister Cha?

325
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,470
Being in the position that I'm in,

326
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,700
I tend to hear a lot of things going around.

327
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,990
Such as?

328
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,410
Like how a nationally respected elder committed suicide

329
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,560
and it wouldn't have been enough to have a national funeral for him,

330
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,680
yet you rushed to cremate his body.

331
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,220
Why was his suicide note written not by hand but typed on a computer?

332
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,020
Especially for an elder so proficient in calligraphy?

333
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,040
Are you bored these days?

334
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,560
- Should I give you more work to do?
- What?

335
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,000
Why don't you come back when you have more concrete evidence, then we'll talk.

336
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,810
I'm a bit busy... working for the country.

337
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,730
- Jae Hui?
- Yes?

338
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,000
The guest is leaving.

339
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,550
Oh, and Minister Cha ...

340
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:14,450
I'm sorry but the cost of fuel for your car is too high.

341
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,780
The national finances aren't doing so well,

342
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,170
so why don't we change it to something smaller?

343
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,300
The citizens will be touched.

344
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:28,370
They'll say, 'of course, the great elder leading the country is different from others'.

345
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,200
You must be insane.

346
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,850
What on earth have you been doing?

347
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,540
Why is it taking so long to find something on Jeong Seon Ah?

348
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,910
I apologize, Minister. Please give us more time.

349
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,390
You incompetent bastards.

350
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,020
I need to meet Kang Yo Han.

351
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,340
Pardon? Y-You want to meet Kang Yo Han?

352
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,980
What are you so shocked for?

353
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,400
It was just so sudden.

354
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,430
Jeong Seon Ah's file mentioned that she worked as a maid in Kang Yo Han's house.

355
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,940
Kang Yo Han will definitely know something to help us dig into her past.

356
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,430
Set up an meeting with him quickly. Choose a quiet Japanese restaurant or something like that.

357
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,860
Yes, I understand.

358
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,210
Are you sure it's here?

359
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,300
How did you find him anyway?
 Goryeo Real Estate

360
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,200
By the way, why are you here?

361
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,680
I just thought you'd be bored by yourself.

362
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,770
You were that worried about me coming here alone?

363
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,610
- Yes, I was worried.
- What?

364
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,020
Not for you. I was worried you'd end up beating Mr. Bamboo Spear half to death.

365
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,430
It's an electrically powered shutter.

366
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,670
I think it's the only entrance for this building.

367
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,630
- Hey, Elijah.
- It's Elijah?

368
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,300
The entrance is closed by a shutter.

369
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,550
Oh, okay.

370
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:31,250
- Why did she call?
- Elijah's the one who traced the IP address to this building.

371
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,550
Really?

372
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,500
She's a computer genius who received an early admission to Stanford for Computer Science.

373
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,890
Impressive.

374
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,850
I still think this will be hard to open. Let's look for another entrance.

375
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,390
Be careful.

Hey, Elijah.

You're really incredible. How did you manage to hack into this kind of door too?

384
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,830
Don't mention it, just be careful. Both of you.

385
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,730
Thanks.

386
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,520

Hello? I'm inside the Jinheung building right now.

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,530
Oh, really? How are you there at this hour?

391
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,130
I attend Best Math Academy, but I stayed a bit late to study for an exam and...

392
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:30,490
Mister, this place is so scary. What should I do?

393
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,130
Okay, I'll open it for you.

394
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,370
Really? Thank you! Thank you so much!

395
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,930
Do you think it'll be all right? What if there are some guards?

396
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,620
Do you really think a loser who does internet broadcasts like this has guards?

397
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,010
I looked it up and he apparently broadcasts from a small room—

Don't lie, we have 40 minutes left.

Hi. It's been a while.

404
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,630
It's been a while.

405
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,510
Are you here alone?

406
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,640
Let go!

407
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,990
It hurts... Ah, ah...

408
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,820
Let's go.

Ah I'm going. Jeez.

Hyeong!

412
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,780
Ow, it hurts!

413
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,420
Hey, stop right there!

414
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,570
Are you okay, Su Hyeon?

415
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,030
Your dying day.

What the?

417
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,890
Kang Yo Han?

418
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,060
You just focus on getting Bamboo Spear.

419

How are you all doing?

440
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,670
Law, educating young people ... You are doing great work.

441
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,750
It's fine, don't mind me. Continue working.

442
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,600
I said it's fine, keep working.

443
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,800
Well, if something fun comes up, you can show me too.

I can even hear Chairman Min Yong Sik's breathing.

00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,660
What are you doing here?

447
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:21,920
Is this Inwang-dong Team which, it's said, is greater than the National Intelligence Service?

448
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,830
Let's go inside.

449
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,480
Let's talk here. You're all on the same team.

450
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,470
How did you know about this place?

451
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,310
I'm quite interested in the education of the young.

452
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,870
Forget it, I'll just get to the point.

453
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,170
What's your relationship with Jeong Seon Ah?

454
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,210
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

455
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,140
I heard Jeong Seon Ah used to work as a maid in your house, is it true?

456
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,110
I'm not sure. I can't speak about someone else's private life.

457
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,920
There are even rumors that she killed her own parents.

458
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,190
Is that so? That's shocking.

459
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,400
You sound as if you're saying 'nothing's for free'.

460
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,720
What is it you want?

461
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,470
The Bamboo Spear guy.

462
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,920
Bamboo Spear?

463
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,490
Cooperate with me so I can put him on trial.

464
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,260
The prosecution just has to indict him, then you can sit and enjoy the show.

465
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,440
Heo Jung Se will make noise about this.

466
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,360
Why are you being so timid?

467
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,490
I'm the one who will have to deal with the consequences anyway.

468
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,670
I understand.

469
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,430
Thank you.

470
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,550
Oh, by the way

471
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,040
I found this on the way.

472
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,030
Should I give it to you? Or maybe him?

00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,030
Name: Jeong Seon Ah

476
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,920
Autopsy Report

477
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,250
An internet broadcaster...

478
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,850
Isn't this too boring for the Live Court?

479
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,530
He incites violence and causes disorder in the society.

480
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,090
Wouldn't the Blue House be happy about it as well?

481
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:36,730
I think it aligns well with the law and order reinforcement policy the president is pushing.

482
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,400
That could be.

483
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,820
All right. Give it your best shot.

484
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,000
- How did it go?
- Passed.

485
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,550
Then, this time I will set up the plan.

486
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,860
You will?

487
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,420
I know punks like Bamboo Spear the best.

488
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,420
This is a clear challenge against the beloved and respected great citizens of the nation.

489
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,460
How dare they make a patriotic young man,

490
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,860
who bravely tried to protect the country, stand trial?

491
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,280
Are judges that great? Are judges above the people?

492
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,810
This is clearly a judicial coup d'état. Coup d'état.

493
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,300
This isn't it, though.

494
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,920
Didn't all this stem from his pure patriotism that made him try to protect the country?

495
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,890
Right? We should make sure this trial proceeds in a fair manner,

496
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:48,010
so I will closely watch it until the end.
[President expresses displeasure. Judge Kang Yo Han's next move?]

497
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,910
I will rip apart Kang Yo Han, damn.

498
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,890
I am going crazy.

499
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,810
Mr. Attorney, I am a political offender. A revolutionary leader.

500
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,130
I am on a different level from petty criminals. Do you understand?

501
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:14,020
Then, should I not submit materials for mitigating factors? Such as unfortunate childhood.

502
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,980
Just a minute...

503
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:21,160
But wouldn't it be more advantageous to submit them?

504
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,960
Go ahead and submit them. Highlighting the details as much as possible.

505
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,860
Sure, I will do that.

506
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,250
Since we are talking about it,

507
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:36,790
Kang Yo Han and the young judge even threatened me wielding a wooden beam.

508
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,780
How about we let the media know this?

509
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,660
If you are going to claim insanity, you need a doctor's diagnosis.

510
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,450
I am telling you that I saw it.

511
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,420
Do you think I am lying to you, then?

512
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,350
Ah, is that right?

513
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:57,480
Then can you give me a list of people who witnessed the incident at the scene?

514
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,000
I need objective evidence.

515
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,160
Ah, never mind. I was there alone.

516
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,270
But you're really confident, right?

517
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,240
It would be terrible if I were sentenced to prison.

518
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,650
Yes, please don't worry.

519
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,120
I will make sure you get released on probation.

520
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,220
Such devotion. Taking care of the plants at home,

521
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,410
taking care of a prickly girl and strange ajeossi at a strange house.

522
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,760
I am sure that I am not any less strange myself.

523
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,140
That's right. You are a bit strange.

524
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,490
Why? Did the professor say something?

525
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,610
What about the professor? I haven't seen him since I last met him here.

526
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,680
Ah, is that right? I was just wondering if he was nagging at you about me.

527
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,700
You suddenly came to see me at the police agency and asked me how I would feel if you were to do something bad.

528
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,110
Kang Yo Han appeared when I was apprehending Bamboo Spear.

529
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,090
Are you, by chance, going around doing something weird?

530
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,700
Does it seem that way?

531
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,130
No, just... I am jealous. Jealous.

532
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,510
It's strange to see my close friend suddenly hanging around the ultra-rich.

533
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,980
It feels like you are going to a different world.

534
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,950
I see.

535
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:33,230
He's not rich. When you get to know him, Kang Yo Han is very poor.

536
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,090
I am much richer.

537
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,020
I have good memories with my mom and dad.

538
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,440
I have this pretty house that I cared for, and...

539
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,090
I even have my own fan club. OpposeDaOn.
 Milky complexion

540
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,070
I am leaving.

541
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,820
You are leaving already?

542
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,050
I am busy. Do you think the police can be idle?

543
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,480
Get home safely.

544
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,180
I have you,

545
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,450
Su Hyeon.

546
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,140
Hi, Young Master.

547
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,200
Chief Judge Kang Yo Han

548
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:19,010
Although you are the leader of the support team, don't you think it's rude to barge in like this?

549
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,520
So why do you make me keep barging in?

550
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,210
Could it possibly be that you are doing it on purpose because you want to see me?

551
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,680
What is this about?

552
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,250
The live court. Why did you have to pick a troublesome case again?

553
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,080
He's neither a politician, nor a chaebol, so why would it be troublesome?

554
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,400
Isn't he just a petty criminal?

555
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,140
He's one of Heo Jung Se's people.

556
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,560
He went berserk, saying he would get rid the live court. I barely managed to calm him down.

557
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,570
I told you to be patient for just two years.

558
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,660
Why do you keep causing trouble?

559
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,520
Wow, that lunatic is one of president's people?

560
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,080
Interesting.

561
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,690
But that punk attacked my niece.

562
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,510
He did?

563
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,520
Even so, you can't.

564
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,980
You should give in this time. Give him a good scolding and let him go.

565
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,360
What if I tell you I can't do that?

566
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,780
Then it will put me in a difficult position.

567
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:28,080
If I am put in a difficult position, you will also be put in a difficult position.

568
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,740
All right. I will think about it.

569
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:37,440
Young Master, you are so good these days, listening to me.

570
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,850
So don't barge in anymore, all right?

571
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,730
So don't make me barge in.

572
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,540
Young Master, you should invite me.

573
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:57,530
Is your house still pretty?

574
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,960
Same as before?

575
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,320
Are you missing the house you stayed in as a maid?

576
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:24,740
Never, never again say something like that.

577
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,570
I was just a guest who stayed in that house for a little while.

578
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,800
Don't dare insult me.

579
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,890
Fine. I will keep that in mind.

580
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,130
- We are!
- Bamboo Spear!

581
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,500
- We are!
- Bamboo Spear!

582
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,270
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

583
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,030
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

584
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,810
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

585
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,640
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

586
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,910
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

587
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,160
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

588
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,080
As you can see, the Supreme Court here

589
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,320
is hotter than anything because of the heat of today's trial.

590
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,290
Citizens supporting the defendant

591
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,410
continue to protest within the Supreme Court.

592
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,360
The Supreme Court decided that today's trial

593
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,790
will be held behind closed doors, for fear that the high tension here

594
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,260
would cause safety accidents.

595
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,780
Live Court Show

596
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,380
We will begin the trial.

597
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,560
Defendant Kim Chung Sik?

598
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,970
I'm Kim Ju Won. Please call me Kim Ju Won.
Defendant's Seat

599
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,620
The trial has to be held using the name on your resident registration card.

600
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,790
Defendant Kim Chung Sik.

601
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,040
Let me ask you one more time. Defendant Kim Chung Sik?

602
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,600
Yes.

603
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,110
You are in this court for

604
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:19,120
leading and inciting random mass assaults on foreign workers,

605
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,500
women and sexual minorities nationwide.

606
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,330
Your Honor.

607
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,740
- Do you have something to say?
- Yes.

608
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,300
Go ahead.

609
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,640
Before the trial begins, I would like to make a solemn declaration

610
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,570
before history and before the nation.

611
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,280
My patriotic deed

612
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,490
is not something that can be judged in a mere secular court.

613
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,620
Therefore, I would like to read a declaration of salvation.

614
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,100
The court is not the place to instigate, Defendant.

615
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,140
The Japanese judge would have said the same thing when he tried the independence fighters.

616
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,860
What the hell are you afraid of to be blocking the truth, Judge Kang Yo Han?

617
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,070
All right. Fine.

618
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,160
Please, read it.

619
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,120
One man of faith

620
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,920
is equal to the power of a million men who pursue only profit.

621
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,670
I, Kim Ju Won,

622
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,240
am willing to be the devil for the sake of my beloved country.

623
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,200
Citizens, don't be hypocritical and take care of the people of our country first.

624
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,370
Three years of plague, jobs are all gone,
Prosecution Facts: Suspect Kim Chung Sik assaulted 9 people in front of the Sam K Building

625
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:39,600
and foreigners enter the land, swarming with crime.
[in Sinseol-dong, Seokdong-gu, Seoul around 20:30 on June 14, and gave instructions for assault.]

626
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,360
Our women walk around the streets giggling

627
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,510
and linking arms with those foreigners!

628
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,610
That's how the people of other countries are taking our young people's jobs,

629
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,890
taking our women, and even taking our soul!

630
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,570
Fixing these problems in our country

631
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,890
is the only way for us to become the true masters of the Republic of Korea again.

632
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,840
I love this country, so I'm sure of it.

633
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,910
Let's get the foreigners out of this land!

634
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,410
Let's kick out mongrel humans from Korea!

635
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,440
A clean Korea! A safe Republic of Korea!

636
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,180
Let's rebuild it.

637
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,470
That's patriotism!

638
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,070
We are the power.

639
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,820
Power, that's right, Hyeong-nim!
[Bamboo Stick]

640
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,720
Ladies and gentlemen, we support such a man.
[Life is Like a Bamboo Spear]

641

Hurry up and vote now! Now!
[Live Show with Bamboo Stone]

642
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,650
What's going on here? 55, 56, 57!
[60% Innocent, 40% Guilty]

643
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,450
Hey, what is this? Huh? What happened?

644
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,750
It seems his followers are moving in an organized manner.

645
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,220
76% Innocent, 24% Guilty

646
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,230
Have you finished reading?

647
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,280
Yes, well, I'll end it here for now.

648
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,930
Defendant.

649
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:53,960
Yes?

650
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,710
Do you know what kind of work

651
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:59,510
the group of foreign workers you assaulted are engaged in?

652
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,870
I'm not sure. Does a revolutionary even need to know that?

653
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,600
They lost two of their colleagues

654
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,420
in a toxic gas leak at the sewage repair site.

655
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,630
It was a repair work that kept getting delayed because no one wanted to enter the site.

656
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,740
Defendant, who on earth did they take the jobs from?

657
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,210
In a war, there are bound to be innocent victims.

658
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:24,390
Don't diminish the justified anger of the citizens, Your Honor.

659
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,230
Citizens...

660
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,530
Did you just say justified anger?

661
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,590
Ah! What are you doing? Why are you doing this?

662
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,780
Busan Man Bamboo Spears Unit is here! Cleaning Busan

663
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,730
It seems incredibly justified.

664
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,110
Right? Doesn't it seem fair?

665
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,600
Isn't it because people from other countries are taking our women?

666
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,400
Judge, don't you know the purity of a homogeneous race?

667
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,500
Did you say, "our women"?

668
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,360
Women are also citizens of this country.

669
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,860
They are not some objects you left somewhere.

670
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,960
What's this nonsense blabber about pure race, seriously...

671
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,220
I'm sorry. I went a little too far in expressing myself in court.

672
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,140
I can't control myself because I'm so justifiably angry.

673
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,760
That sounded like cursing.

674
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,150
I couldn't hear you because you spoke softly. Come and talk to me.

675
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,840
- Defendant.
- Should I go there then?

676
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,410
Defendant. Please focus.

677
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,280
- Defendant.
- Yes.

678
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,900
Calm down.

679
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,670
Yes.

680
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,820
It's the first time seeing you today, but the more I see you, the worse I feel for you.

681
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,180
Because I wonder how hard life has been for you.

682
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,900
I know you, but you don't seem to remember me.

683
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,770
- Your Honor.
- Yes.

684
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,900
If you allow me, may I go down by the defendant's side

685
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,100
for a while and continue the conversation?

686
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,390
Yes, of course.

687
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,140
Thank you.

688
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,540
Here

689
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,000
is a young man.

690
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,700
He is pretending to be strong like this,

691
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,990
but inside he is a wounded child.

692
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,100
What are you doing now?

693
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,800
I'm talking about the materials that the lawyer submitted

694
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,430
for extenuating circumstances.

695
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,850
Defense Attorney Seat

696
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,530
The defendant has been obsessed with getting attention from others

697
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,470
since he was a kid, isn't that right?

698
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,250
- What did you say?
- Your grandmother said she was really worried.

699
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,040
Let's take a look.

700
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,330
Our Chung Sik wasn't a bad kid.
[Lee Myeong Ja / Kim Chung Sik's grandmother]

701
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:57,270
- Grandma.
- People say he incited some kind of demonstration.

702
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,090
- There is no way he would do such a thing. 
- What is that?

703
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,360
It's just that he's immature, and he's unruly.

704
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,450
Did you talk about that?

705
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,580
Please forgive him.

706
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,170
By the way, Chung Sik! The money you took last time.

707
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:12,520
- Turn it off. I said turn it off!
- That's what your grandmother

708
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,090
- had saved up for the funeral. 
- Please be quiet.
[Park Du Sik / Kim Chung Sik's grandmother's acquaintance]

709
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,310
I don't care about anything else,

710
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,620
but I hope you'll give her back that money. Please!

711
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,000
You're crazy! Why did you say that?

712
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,850
That's how you're going to be able to have a funeral, isn't it?

713
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,700
Oh, my! You're out of your mind! You're crazy!

714
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,840
- Defense Attorney, what were the defendant's school days like?
- Why did you say that?

715
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,020
Yes, well, his homeroom teacher

716
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,720
bravely decided to give a statement. Let's take a look together.

717
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,990
Wh-Wh-What did he —

718
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:44,700
Did he instigate violence for political purposes?
[Kim Yun Gi / Kim Chung Sik's High School Homeroom Teacher]

719
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,460
That's absolutely impossible.

720
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,150
Even when he was in school, he pretended to be a bully,

721
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,230
but in reality, he was a student who admired a bully group and only followed them around

722
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,590
but was not treated as part of the group.

723
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,550
Wow! Wow, this is a waste of time, a waste of money.

724
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,280
You're a loser pretending to be a bully?

725
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,790
It's Chung Sik, right? We went to the same high school.

726
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,760
Do you know what he did when he was in school?

727
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,640
He got busted planting a hidden camera in the girls' bathroom, and he got expelled.
[What is this?]
[The biggest loser]
[You've were pretending to be cool.]

728
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,620
He is absolutely not the kind of person

729
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,940
who would start a revolution or something like that.

730
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,960
Please be lenient.

731
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,350
You're going to make him a loser instead of the devil?

732
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,590
It's going to get all screwed up.

733
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,370
That's what the people who know the defendant say about him,

734
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:32,180
but there's only one thing that bothers me.

735
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,270
The defendant was constantly asking for donations through private broadcasting.

736
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,940
Saying he needs a revolutionary fund to save the country.

737
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,450
A lot of money has been collected.

738
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,130
What on earth did you do with that money?

739
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,410
Why are you avoiding my eyes, defendant?

740
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:54,010
Perhaps, did you buy a bomb or a gun on the black market?

741
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,080
What on earth is revolutionary funding?

742
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,830
No! I don't know anything about that.

743
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,890
I exercise the right to remain silent.

744
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,530
Defendant, if this is true,

745
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,630
this is high treason.

746
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,580
Do you know that a main perpetrator of high treason

747
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,360
is sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or life imprisonment in solitary confinement, Defendant?

748
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,650
No, it's not.

749
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,350
Defense Attorney, do you have something to say?

750
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,370
Yes, the defendant never gathered that money

751
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,590
for committing high treason.

752
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:26,190
This is the defendant's privacy, so I was a little reluctant to reveal it,

753
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,240
but with the situation right now, I can't help it. Shall we take a look together?

754
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,160
- Let's take a look.
- I'm working as a broadcasting jockey (a live streamer).

755
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,000
Kim Chung Sik and another of my fans were competing against each other
[Han Cho Rong / BJ]

756
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,790
and sent so many donation balloons.

757
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,620
Millions of won every day.

758
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,350
- That's not true! I do- don't know that person!
- He said he had financial difficulties so I told him to stop sending.

759
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,220
- What are you doing?
- He asked me to meet him.

760
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,200
- Calm down, Defendant.
- 'Let's meet just once.' He kept begging me.

761
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,380
Oh, my gosh, I felt too pressured.

762
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,060
I really wish he stops doing that.

763
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,050
By chance, did you give your grandma's funeral savings to that person...?

764
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:03,080
You went too far.

765
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,580
Wait a moment. It's all right. It's all right.

766
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:14,190
It's all right. I told you I'd get you on a suspended sentence.

767
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,300
Let's go in. It's all right.

768
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,100
It's all right.

769
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,600
Your Honor and the two judges.

770
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,090
The defendant, as you can see, is not some kind of revolutionary,

771
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,220
nor is he a dangerous person instigating civil war.

772
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,690
To be honest, the matter is not even worth to be brought to justice.

773
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:40,570
- Defense Attorney.
- Although the defendant's fault is by no means small,

774
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:45,230
I would appreciate it if you could give him a chance to reform himself.

775
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,210
I have thought about

776
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,660
what would be the most appropriate punishment for the defendant,

777
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,170
whether it's flogging or jail time,

778
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,330
but the defendant is still young,

779
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,840
and some say we should give the defendant a chance,

780
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,540
so it was decided that the defendant

781
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,470
would be sentenced to three years in prison,

782
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:22,820
with a five year suspended sentence.
96% Agree, 4% Against
3 years in prison

783
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,440
However, considering that the defendant's crime is bad

784
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,320
and the risk of recidivism is very high,

785
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,010
I order the defendant to wear an electronic anklet

786
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:37,490
and be placed on probation.

787
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,760
The location of the defendant will be displayed in the DIKE app

788
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,300
in real time, via the electronic anklet signal.

789
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,650
DIKE
Kim Chung Sik
Defendant location information.

790
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,490
Electronic Anklets! Seriously.

791
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,220
You should know how humiliating it is.

792
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,420
What do you do when it's hot in summer? Can't even wear shorts? Huh?

793
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,750
Starting today, I'm recruiting a squad to go catch Bamboo Spear.
[Guilty]
[Wow, electronic anklets]
[Hey, this is really refreshing.]
[He's screwed now.]
[What do you do, so embarrassing]

794
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,350
Hey Bamboo Spear! Come out of that room, huh?

795
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,650
I'll follow you to the end.

796
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,940
Fellow citizens who are watching this trial,

797
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,320
I ask you to become

798
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,310
probation officers for the defendant.

799
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,680
Don't take your eyes off, even for a second,

800
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,850
of what the defendant is doing or where he is.

801
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,350
The defendant needs your attention.

802
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,130
Isn't that right, Defendant?

803
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,430
I brought him up so carefully, dammit.

804
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,700
It's all screwed.

805
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:38,190
F**k, seriously! Kang Yo Han, Kang Yo Han, Kang Yo Han!

806
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,220
Give him a good scolding in court and let him go.

807
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,980
All right.

808
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,140
I will think about it.

809
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,850
Dammit.

810
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,330
Were you playing with me?

811
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,900
You can see Bamboo Spear over there, right? I will give Bamboo Spear a rod of love*!
(*corporal punishment)

812
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,610
I'll show it to you live until the end.

814
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:54,180
The Kim Chung Sik incident was such a disgrace to the country and should never happen again.

815
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:59,280
It's a complete disgrace to the voluntary movement that's taking place across the country

816
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,460
and the pure patriotism of our beloved and respected citizens.

817
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,010
It is an incident that smells disgusting.

818
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,840
Yes, something smells. I can seriously smell the conspiracy.

819
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,900
Where did he go?

820
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,170
- Hey, for now, let's go.
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly...

821
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,890
But that man, Kim Chung Sik, is he really a Korean? The same kind of Korean as us?

822
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:34,000
A real Korean like us. Not a fake Korean, but a real Korean citizen.

823
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,210
The descendants of the Korean pure-blooded Dangun* wouldn't do anything so fu—
(Mythical founder of the first kingdom of Korea)

824
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:45,700
I'm sorry. They would never do anything so terribly embarrassing.

825
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,500
That is all.

826
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:05,030
Hide well, I might see your hair.*
 (*Hide and seek game catchphrase, like 'ready or not, here I come.')

827
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,950
- Are you going to leave Chung Sik like that?
- Hey, are you crazy?

828
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,630
Don't ever say his name again until you die.

829
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:21,160
Yeon Jeong, I'm so tired. Ah, this Judge Kang!

830
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,650
Hey! Why do you keep running away?

831
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,500
Your location comes all out over here.

832
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,730
Everyone, we will now punish Bamboo Spear.

833
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,990
Hey, Bamboo Spear, get ready.

834
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,330
Hey, is this fun for you guys?

835
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,920
Is it not fun?

836
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,670
Beat him up with the rod of love!

837
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,500

- Butler, can you turn it off now?
 - Yes, Master.

840
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,940
Why, are you uncomfortable?

841
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,110
I feel I've created another monster.

842
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,920
A monster is not created.

843
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,960
A monster that was already there opens its eyes on its own volition.

844
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,510
Whenever a good excuse comes up.

845
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,370
You're working hard.

846
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,290
Minister, what are you doing here?

847
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,080
Why are you so surprised?

848
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,160
It's unlike you, Director Jeong.

849
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:23,480
Did you come to do a search and seizure?

850
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,160
You are a funny woman.

851
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,610
Were you such a great woman?

852
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:36,420
To the point where this country's Minister of Justice would come to personally do a search and seizure?

853
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,780
Then do you have something to ask me?

854
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,600
Oh, you seem to be confused.

855
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,990
I'm here to remind you of your position.

856
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,170
- My position?
- You know.

857
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,040
It suits you better

858
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,660
that you stand quietly with your hands together, behind someone.

859
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,970
If someone doesn't understand their own story,

860
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,230
it won't end well.

861
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:16,890
Minister Cha ... Aren't you the one who is not aware of her position?

862
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,300
Are you still under the delusion that you're the number one presidential candidate?

863
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,370
Even after your son became like that?

864
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:27,010
Aren't you too confident?

865
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,680
Do you think you've completely erased your past?

866
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,500
What do you mean my past?

867
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,850
What the hell are you trying to say?

868
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:44,350
Why do people around you keep dying?

869
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,120
When you were twelve, it was your mom.

870
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,500
When you were twenty, it was your father, who left home abandoning you and your mother.

871
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,600
And recently,

872
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,750
Master Seo, whom you were serving as a secretary.

873
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:05,070
Ah, I didn't know you were into fiction.

874
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:08,100
You're very imaginative.

875
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,770
Do work that suits you.

876
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,260
I heard you were a maid?

877
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,020
Jeez, what a beggar-like...

878
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,720
I'll see you again.

879
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,160
Yes, Eonni?

880
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,130
Kang Yo Han leaked information about me to Cha Gyeong Hui.

881
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:55,010
- What did you say?
- Find out.

882
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:59,240
- Don't tell me Kang Yo Han—
- Shut up and find out right now!

883
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:04,530
If you interfere with my work, you will pay the price.

884
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:07,310
It seems you've been working pretty hard to get where you are.

885
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,210
Will it be all right with you?

886
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,620
I'm going to kill him.

887
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:41,180
Kang Yo Han, I'm going to rip you apart.

888
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:47,560
The Devil Judge
We thank Jeong Eun Pyo and Park Hyeong Su for their special appearances.

889

♫ I can't breathe, I can't breathe ♫

890
01:06:53,300 --> 01:07:00,700
♫ Get me out of this darkness which has lost its light ♫

891
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:06,330
♫ I can't breathe, I can't breathe ♫

892
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:12,210
♫ I cannot stop it anymore, it swallows me whole  ♫

893
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:17,500
♫ Oh save me from myself  ♫

894
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,970
We have no choice but to point the blade at each other.

895
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:22,710
Hi, Young Master.

896
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,140
I think it would be fun to play with you.

897
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,900
Do you think she will hold your hand?

898
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,890
I'll give you a week.

899
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,490
Bring me what I want.

900
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,560
Maybe she'll be on Cha Gyeong Hui's side.

901
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,160
First step. They're going to state that Kang made them give false testimony.

902
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,270
Isn't it too dangerous? You said she was an unpredictable person.

903
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,930
It's life or death even if you risk everything you have.

904
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:49,190
Are you scared of me? That's a shame.

905
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,700
♫ Get me out of this darkness which has lost its light ♫
