This work is set in virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea, All characters, organizations and events are fiction.

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,150
Why did the cops arrest Yo Han?

9
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,790
What on earth is happening?

10
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,200
Why can't you answer? What's on earth going on?

11
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,990
Don't tell me that... Yo Han really did it?

12
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,630
The church...

13
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,600
Did Yo Han kill my parents?

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,700
No, he didn't, Elijah. That's not it.

15
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,470
It's all my fault.

16
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,200
I got tricked like an idiot by those people

17
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,860
and reported Yo Han to the police for killing Su Hyeon.

18
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,470
What?

19
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,590
I will set it right, no matter what it takes.

20
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,580
I will make sure to bring Yo Han back.

21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,760
Even if it costs me my life.

22
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,080
Why—

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,760
Why did you do that?

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,740
Why... Why did you do that?

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,490
I'm sorry, Elijah.

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,060
Why did you do that?

27
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,810
Ajumeoni...

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,900
continue to stay with Elijah. Please do me that favor.

29
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,240
What about you, Young Master Ga On?

30
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,470
[Episode 16]
What's this, coming to see me so late at night?

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,070
So according to what you say,

32
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,190
Judge Kang Yo Han is not connected at all to Yun Su Hyeon's death.

33
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,900
All this was done by the Social Responsibility Foundation Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah?

34
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,450
Yes.

35
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,940
I heard what you had to say.

36
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,050
It's indeed an interesting story,

37
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:35,450
but, as you know, we need sufficient evidence in order to make a move.

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,430
Wait a minute.

39
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm the one who falsely accused Kang Yo Han.

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
Ah, yes.

41
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,520
You're saying you made a false accusation?

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,080
That's right.

43
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,240
I falsely accused him with malicious intent.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,130
I saw him using public opinion to cover up the case of his trial manipulation,

45
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,360
so I thought we should catch him using any means.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,540
That's why I manipulated the evidence and falsely accused him.

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,070
Please arrest me.

48
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,890
Hold on, Mr. Judge.

49
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,030
Don't get so worked up.

50
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,420
First, go back to your place and have a good rest.

51
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,040
Think about it a bit more, all right?

52
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,380
Why do you keep being like this, now that it's all over anyway?

53
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,460
It seems you've already received some orders from higher-ups.

54
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,120
If you keep doing this, I may have to report you for neglecting your duty.

55
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,500
And I'll reveal this to the media.

56
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,330
Do as you please.

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,050
By the way, you know that a national state of emergency has been declared, right?

58
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,620
If the media broadcasts anything without the government's permission,

59
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,900
they'll be in violation of the emergency decree.

60
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,310
Please search carefully for a media outlet

61
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,290
that is crazy enough to broadcast it.

62
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,880
Kang Yo Han!

63
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,150
It's Kang Yo Han!

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,700
I missed you. And here you are, bastard.

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,100
You won't be able to get out of here. Why? Because I'll kill you.

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,780
I will kill you!

67
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,360
This place is going to be your grave.

68
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,020
Shocking news.

69
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,110
Live Court Judge Kang Yo Han was arrested last night

70
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,990
on charge of abetting a murder and is currently in custody at the Jungbu Detention Center.

71
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,350
The investigation has revealed that the victim in Judge Kang Yo Han's case is

72
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,690
Lieutenant Yun Su Hyeon of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit (MIU).

73
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,390
I can't believe it!

74
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,240
Judge Kang Yo Han who was arrested without warrant

75
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,690
had been receiving a lot of love from the citizens of the nation while operating the Live Court.

76
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,110
As a result, Judge Kang Yo Han's charge of abetting a murder i

77
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,440
s expected to lead to public outrage.

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,020
You were the one who put Kang Yo Han in charge of the Live Court Show, Chief Justice.

79
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,600
Someone who manipulated trials and abetted a murder.

80
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,200
My goodness, Supreme Court Justice Min, how could I have known that?

81
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,570
Besides, it wasn't my idea to put him in charge—

82
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,860
Are you going to avoid responsibility too now?

83
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,590
Look here, Justice Min.

84
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Stop bringing shame to the Judiciary

85
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,320
You're here.

86
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,160
Didn't you say you'd resign from the supreme court justice's position?

87
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,440
Someone has to clean up this mess.

88
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,410
I'm not the type to avoid taking responsibility.

89
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,590
How much more shameless are you going to become?

90
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,250
You really had Su Hyeon

91
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,500
killed? Just to entrap Kang Yo Han?!

92
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,100
And you call yourself a human being?!

93
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,200
I didn't know that Su Hyeon would die.

94
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,500
I didn't think Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah would go that far.

95
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,600
1, 2, 3.

96
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,550
[Professor Min Jeong Ho]

97
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,920
You want me to be a justice of the Supreme Court?

98
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,440
I know well that you are not the sort of person who cares about official posts.

99
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,670
But we need people like you at times like this, Professor.

100
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,290
A president like Heo Jung Se does politics.

101
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,300
And a judge like Kang Yo Han conducts trials.

102
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,070
They are all the same bastards.

103
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,410
They're all con artists who incite the public.

104
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,480
That Live Court Show they're planning to run seems very dangerous.

105
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,020
They're turning the court system into a mere busking show on the street.

106
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,200
Though I'm simply assisting Master Seo,

107
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,680
I think that we have to block this move, no matter what.

108
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,970
Can't we quietly accomplish something while doing our parts?

109
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,480
Me at the Foundation, and you at the Supreme Court?

110
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,810
You're quite a brave woman.

111
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,620
Well, someone has to do it.

112
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,910
When you become a Supreme Court justice, the first thing you need to do

113
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,960
is to put someone near Kang Yo Han to keep an eye on him.

114
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,260
Keep an eye on him?

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,600
- Professor.
- Hey.

116
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm sorry, Supreme Court Justice.

117
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,290
Are you ordering me to play the role of Judas Iscariot?

118
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,290
Someone needs to be there.

119
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,130
Someone has to be vigilant and keep his eyes wide open even in this insane wind.

120
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,100
It's a request.

121
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,270
In this world,

122
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,300
there's no easy way to bring justice.

123
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,120
I just wanted to stop Kang Yo Han

124
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,670
from destroying the world.

125
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,540
Kang Yo Han's supporters are terrorising me,

126
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,030
and revealing my family's personal information online.

127
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,660
I can't hold back anymore.

128
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,490
I will do whatever it takes

129
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,160
to drag Kang Yo Han down.

130
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,770
Did you kill Su Hyeon?

131
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,900
We never talked about such a thing!

132
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,160
Su Hyeon was like a daughter to me.

133
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,000
Then, what? Are you going to quit everything now that we have come this far?

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,160
I remember you saying you wanted to stop Kang Yo Han at all costs.

135
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,870
"Whatever it takes"

136
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,870
It's not something that can undone, anyway.

137
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,640
We have only one more step left.

138
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,880
Don't you want to leave you mark in history as

139
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,550
the great chief justice who would took charge and ended a time of chaos?

140
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,320
Don't you?

141
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,290
Supreme Court Chief Justice.

142
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,660
Someone had to become a monster to stop Kang Yo Han.

143
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,240
You can spit at me all you want.

144
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,940
Because, at the end of the day, it is history that will evaluate me.

145
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,470
You dirty hypocrite.

146
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,510
Tell security to come in.

147
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,400
How could you do this? How could you kill Su Hyeon?

148
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
How could you do that to Su Hyeon?! How could you kill Su Hyeon?!

149
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,590
Tell me. Tell me, Min Jeong Ho!

150
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,100
Tell me, Supreme Court Justice!

151
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,560
Tell me!

152
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,000
Let go of me. Let me go! Min Jeong Ho!

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,300
Say it! Say it!

154
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,760
Tell me, how you could do that?!

155
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,080
Min Jeong Ho!

156
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,510
Judge Kim, what was that on the news?

157
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,950
That's not true, uh? Judge Kang didn't do it, right?

158
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,600
No, he didn't. The foundation set up a trap.

159
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,820
That's what I thought.

160
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,200
What do I need to do? I will help.

161
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,640
We have to save our chief.

162
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,930
Wow! Look at whom we have here.

163
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,840
People said you'll run into your worst enemy at the worst place and time.

164
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,830
Do you know how hard it's been for me because of you?

165
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,520
- Has the part with the prison warden been resolved?
- Yes.

166
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,260
I've frightened him properly, so he'll do what he's told.

167
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,900
Is that what the Minister of Justice ordered?
[Nam Si Wu, Warden of Southern Gyeonggi Prison]

168
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,650
It is true, that it was Minister Cha Gyeong Hui's orders.
[Do Yeong Chun was replaced at the instruction of Minister Cha Gyeong Hui.]

169
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,650
Is it true that you were bribed or threatened?

170
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,950
I apologize. I couldn't withstand the minister's threats.

171
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,250
I was demoted and kicked out to here, because of you.

172
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,350
Isn't it a good thing that you're here to take full charge of a suspect of a major case?

173
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,090
How dare you be so arrogant?

174
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,870
Hey, you jerk. Do you think you're still a judge?

175
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,560
You're a rat in my hands now, don't you know?!

176
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,050
Oh my!

177
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,470
Our chairwoman is really amazing.

178
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,310
When you did you turn Min Jeong Ho over to our side?

179
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,990
- You're the best! You're the best!
- You're the best.

180
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,170
Ah, this one ... Yes.

181
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,800
All right. Our Chairwoman Jeong—

182
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,960
Sit.

183
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,060
Chairwoman Jeong is certainly an excellent storyteller.

184
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,380
You know how Jesus loved Judas the most among his disciples

185
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,250
and then Judas stabbed him in the back later and totally betrayed him?

186
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,970
I bet Kang Yo Han

187
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,440
is going crazy in jail right now.

188
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,080
Abetting murder of a cop! Wow!

189
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,420
Kang Yo Han is definitely out of the picture now.

190
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,010
I wonder if Kang Yo Han even needs to go to trial.

191
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,220
What are you talking about?

192
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,920
Since Kang Yo Han's off the stage,

193
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,300
if he disappears quietly and quickly, wouldn't everyone be so happy?

194
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,220
This is what I've been thinking about.

195
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,100
Our president thinks too much.

196
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,940
They say if you think of trivial things, the day you die is not far away.

197
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,060
I'm sure you'll take good care of it, I'm sorry.

199
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,750
I'm going to ... I'm need to go to the bathroom.

200
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,150
Stop right there!

201
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,810
Why are you doing this to someone

202
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,040
who knows what they're doing?!

203
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,930
That's right!

204
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,650
Our Chairwoman Jeong is no ordinary woman.

205
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,280
Ajeossi Heo Jung Se also adapts quickly.

206
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,110
He changed completely as soon as his role changed.

207
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,000
That's right.

208
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,480
But ...

209
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,130
it's too overtly fast.

210
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,760
What do you mean?

211
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,850
Not to mention, those money-hungry old men

212
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,420
are actually being careful around Heo Jung Se, who's practically useless?

213
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,650
I might've been underestimating Heo Jung Se.

214
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,010
Find out. There is definitely something going on there.

215
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,930
Heo Jung Se, that man,

216
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,570
was obsessed with increasing the number of people who were forcefully removed.

217
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,460
Check out the shelters in the Dream Village.

218
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,890
See if there are any missing people or not,

219
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,260
if they are being taken away somewhere else or not.

220
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,030
Thank you for supporting my husband's plan this time.

221
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,050
The weekend farm?

222
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,840
You all did a great job convincing your husbands.

223
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,200
It was a very close call.

224
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,390
Don't worry about it. To be honest, we support anything that makes us money.

225
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,250
While we're on the subject, do you ladies want to visit the weekend farm?

226
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,080
It sounds good. I am curious to see...

227
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,610
whether our crops are growing well.

228
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,450
All right, I'll set it up.

229
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,440
Even if you got tricked, how could you frame Judge Kang for murder?

230
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,560
I know I'm being shameless, but please help me out just this once.

231
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,920
I need to save Chief Kang, but I can't do it without your help.

232
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,390
I'm not sure.

233
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,190
I don't know if we can continue to trust you.

234
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,880
There's no time.

235
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,600
Do you think those people will leave him alone until the trial?

236
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,150
We don't know what they might do to him.

237
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,490
The only way is to expose something big and render them helpless.

238
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,080
If the public's attention falls on them, then they won't be able to do anything for a while.

239
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,000
Wait a minute. What do you mean by something big?

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,880
Inside the Dream village.

241
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,430
It must be dismal like an internment camp. We need to expose that.

242
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,880
That's impossible.

243
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,920
Military men guard the place.

244
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,980
I'll go alone.

245
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,900
Where is the place that has the tightest security?

246
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,700
That place is the one they want to hide most.

247
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,230
Then that would be the Dream Village Medical Center,

248
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,660
but even if you somehow manage to get in, there's no way you can get out of there.

249
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,580
Will you still go?

250
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,500
Yes. You just have to get me in.

251
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,300
All right. Let's say you get lucky enough to get out of there after filming something

252
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,140
but you have no way to reveal it.

253
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Journalists and the media are being careful around the government.

254
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,900
Video platforms and social media have all been shut down.

255
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,120
Now, this country

256
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,800
is no longer a free nation.

257
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,270
About that...

258
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,680
I have an idea.

259
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,530
What's your idea?

260
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,210
Please get me one thing.

261
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,480
Elijah.

262
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,290
There is something I really wanted to tell you.

263
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,910
Not so long ago, I met with the person who used to work at the church.

264
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,040
The electrical wiring was just so old

265
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,120
that a fire erupted from the power distribution board.

266
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,330
A simple accident that was no one's fault.

267
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,810
But Yo Han made you suspect him on purpose.

268
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,230
You said that once you could walk, you'd kill me first.

269
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,820
Do one thing at a time, step by step, hmm?

270
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,060
He made a donation cancellation certificate on purpose just for you to see it,

271
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,170
and kept telling you things to make you irritated.

272
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,180
I don't care about a guy I've already killed

273
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,660
if I actually killed him.

274
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:55,040
Because you struggled with losing your parents.

275
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,220
You didn't eat or sleep, and you got thinner every day.

276
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:07,740
So Yo Han wished that at least the strength of hating him could make you live.

277
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,110
But Elijah, even if you misunderstood him

278
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,840
that's not your fault.

279
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,680
Yo Han did it himself because he wanted to.

280
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,970
You are not to be blamed, Elijah.

281
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,370
Thus, if you see him again, be good to him.

282
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,520
Yo Han will come back to your side for sure.

283
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,530
It won't take long, I promise.

284
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,200
So at least eat a little.

285
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,900
What if you are sick when he comes back?

286
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,380
Yo Han!

287
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,440
You're already on death row, so you can be executed at any time, if that's what you want.

288
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,070
Please spare me.

289
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,360
That's all the strength of your voice?

290
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,870
Please save me. Save me!

291
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,960
Run away now. Hurry.

292
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,790
Stop there!

293
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,700
Dream Village Food

294
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,700
Dream Village Food

295
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:29,090
Phase 3 clinical trial in progress
Restricted Area

296
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,860
Just hold it in a little more.

297
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,390
More, more.

298
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,660
It's done.

299
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,310
Ah, my headache!

300
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,920
Han So Yeon, what happened to you?

301
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,940
It's me, Kim Ga On.

302
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,860
Judge Kim, how did you manage to come here?

303
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,680
Don't worry now.

304
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,850
The president is coming in!

305
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,050
The president is here!

306
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,110
I'll be right back. Just a moment.

307
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,280
Our chosen medical staff.

308
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,560
You really worked hard.

309
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,450
As requested by the EU, we're clinically testing the new vaccine.

310
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,580
The subjects are now 3620 people overall.

311
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,780
Out of those subjects, 182 have passed away due to side effects.

312
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,510
182 people? That's not bad.

313
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:10,880
Share the results with the client and report any countries behind on their payment to me.

314
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,570
Oh, and we've gotten new requests from several other countries, including Russia and Japan,

315
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,470
so I think we need to expand our farm in a hurry.

316
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,400
Since many countries are competing to develop a vaccine first,

317
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,900
the demand for clinical trials is extremely high right now, Mr. President.

318
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,460
Wow, if Seoul residents aren't enough,

319
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,670
then we may need to bring in people from Busan, Daegu, and even Gwangju!

320
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:40,180
Even though our country doesn't produce a drop of oil, we can still make a living with our human resources.

321
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,540
As I've always said, people are the most precious things.

322
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,430
I've been telling you this so many times, right?

323
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,600
Look around, all of this, everything here is money.

324
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,290
Do you know how much each person is worth in clinical trials?

325
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,900
It's no joke.

326
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,300
Not to mention, when they die, we can harvest all their functioning organs.

327
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,550
Even their hair, blood, and all the byproducts...

328
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,700
We collect them all and export them. Nothing—

329
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,030
Nothing goes to waste.

330
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,140
Mr. President, you're quite the businessman!

331
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,600
But you've been pretending you weren't the whole time.

332
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,710
Were you going to hog all the profits to yourself? You were so mean.

333
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,250
I was waiting for the right moment to share it with you.

334
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,920
But does Jeong Seon Ah have to be a part of it too?

335
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,950
I'm not saying we should leave her out though.

336
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,870
We would have bigger shares, it's not a bad thing.

337
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,230
Besides, she's not that useful anymore anyway.

338
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,310
Both Cha Gyeong Hui and her, ugh, I hate aggressive women.

339
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,250
She's too uselessly smart...for a lowly maid.

340
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,660
Right? Now's our opportunity to cut her off.

341
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:42,440
Oh, and send someone to the prison to take care of Kang Yo Han cleanly before he causes any trouble.

342
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,450
Yes, Mr. President!

343
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,000
Why are you being like this?

344
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,270
Do you like it?

345
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,410
- Let's go together.
- We should go too.

346
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,660
Miss So Yeon, let's get out of here.

347
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,020
What are you doing?

348
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,290
I've been ordered to check her vitals.

349
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,660
All right.

350
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,790
Let's go.

351
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,450
Wait a minute.

352
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,060
Why?

353
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,240
Don't be too nervous, Judge.

354
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,020
Honestly, I've been waiting for someone to come help, and I'm not the only one.

355
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,910
We've been all confined here and our phones have been taken away.

356
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,680
There are even sane people in here.

357
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,920
Does it make sense? How can the country do such a thing to its citizens?

358
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,880
This person is dead. The organs have been harvested and we're on our way to the incinerator.

359
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,330
We will help you.

360
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,720
Since we will get you two out of here, please be sure to let the world know

361
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,890
what's happening in here.

362
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,680
Yes, I will do so.

363
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,260
Are you all right, miss So Yeon?

364
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,180
Yes, Judge Kim? Are you all right?

365
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,750
Yes.

366
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,400
I saved Han So Yeon. We got lucky.

367
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,690
Did you get what I asked for?

368
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,150
Is there really no other way?

369
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,190
How about looking for a reporter who is brave enough to report this...?

370
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,790
That's a long shot. We don't have time for that.

371
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,550
All right.

372
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,230
Phase 3 clinical trial in progress | sector 120-27

373
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,190
You look so pretty. How old are you?

374
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,020
I'm 18 years old.

375
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,940
What did I do...

376
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,060
I'm sorry.

377
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,660
Sorry.

378
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,840
Sorry.

379
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm so sorry, really.

380
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,110
Sorry...

381
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,080
Judge Kim. Did you figure out a way?

382
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,680
I have a request for you, Judge Oh.

383
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,560
Just tell me. I'll do anything.

384
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,380
Tomorrow is Supreme Court Chief Justice Min Jeong Ho's inauguration.

385
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,860
That's all I need to do, really?

386
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,270
Yes, I'll ask you this one thing.

387
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,560
All right, but what do you plan to do at his inauguration?

388
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,740
[From Judge Jeong In Seok: We've got a big problem Judge Oh. Turn on the TV quickly.]

389
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,220
Judge Kang who had been arrested for murder is dead.
[Judge Kang Yo Han stabbed to death by an unidentified assailant at the detention center]

390
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,730
Judge Kang Yo Han was held in custody at Jungbu Detention Center

391
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,750
where it seems he was stabbed by an unknown assailant.

392
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,980
Judge Kang Yo Han was the first judge in Korea to...

393
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,890
[Judge Kang Yo Han stabbed to death by an unidentified assailant at the detention center]

394
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,720
Eonni.

395
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,390
It's okay.

396
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,610
It's okay.

397
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,340
I was going to end him with my hands anyway.

398
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,400
It's for the best.

399
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,570
It's really the end now.

400
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,120
"The End" shows up boldly on the screen,

401
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,220
and the ending credits roll up.

402
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,670
Then, finally, the lights come back on.

403
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,990
And the audience claps and leaves.

404
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,460
I guess Kang Yo Han had grown on me a bit.

405
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,910
I think I'll miss him a little, Mr. President.

406
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:07,050
Should we host a memorial for him every year?

407
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,500
Okay, then we'll stick a candle and an incense stick into a cake,

408
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,200
and lay out the meat pancakes and japchae(Noodle dish with vegetables and meat...

409
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,780
Is there something you need to think seriously about? Or any worry?

410
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,300
Pardon?

411
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,730
No way.

412
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,430
I was just... thinking about how much we went through because of him.

413
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,850
It was painfully irritating.

414
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,800
It's was definitely irritating and sickening.

415
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,380
We should say bye-bye to him now.

416
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,280
So I was thinking...

417
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,300
What do you think about hosting something small and meaningful?

418
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,630
Like what?

419
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,690
Something to commemorate Kang Yo Han and celebrate us, how's that?

420
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,810
And Supreme Court Chief Justice Min Jeong Ho will be inaugurated tomorrow too.

421
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,650
So?

422
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,170
Now you'll be able to reign forever.

423
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,220
We should celebrate with all the core members of the Foundation.

424
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,510
In the courtroom where that bastard Kang Yo Han held trials

425
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,740
and dared to challenge you.

426
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,950
What's up with you, Chairman Min? Is it your time to die? Why are you acting out of character?

427
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,200
That's not bad, that's not bad, that's not bad.

428
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,950
Ah, call Jeong Seon Ah and make sure she'll be there.

429
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,800
Even when I sleep, I wake up with my heart pounding.

430
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,260
I really understand you two, but her I really ...

431
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,970
How dare she ...

432
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,670
Why don't we end her as well at one shot, right there in the courtroom

433
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,670
where her lover played court games?

434
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,520
Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah.

435
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,320
Now that it's all over, we should all make a toast.

436
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,280
It's your era now, Chairwoman Jeong!

437
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,940
It's about time we get a female president!

438
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,790
Fine, then. See you at the Supreme Court.

439
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,560
All right.

440
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,220
Jae Hui.

441
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,470
Yes, Eonni?

442
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,900
Get me a pistol.

443
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,400
A cute one that will fit in my purse.

444
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,450
Why this?

445
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,950
I.. think I'll become the president.

446
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,190
I have to protect myself now.

447
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,770
You worked hard, all this time.

448
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,480
These chaotic times are now over.
[Press conference marking Chief Justice Min Jeong Ho's inauguration.]

449
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,000
This is the time to straighten justice, that has fallen apart.

450
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,010
I will become the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,

451
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,230
who will gradually build up the collapsed judiciary system,

452
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,010
step by step from its foundation.

453
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,610
Thank you.

454
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,490
Chief Justice, may I ask why you called a press conference separately

455
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:29,940
without an official inauguration event?

456
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,470
We're in a national state of emergency, aren't we?

457
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,860
I believe this is not the time to prioritize my personal honor.

458
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,960
Please understand. Thank you.

459
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,790
- Way to go!
- What's your next plan?

460
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,940
Supreme Court Chief Justice!

461
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,320
Congratulations.

462
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,100
Thank you Judge Oh.

463
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,680
While you were talking to the press just before,

464
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,060
Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah asked to meet with you privately.

465
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,860
She asked me to deliver the message.

466
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:12,380
- Really?
- She said she'd wait in your old office,

467
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,000
since it's empty.

468
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,260
All right.

469
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,700
Judge Kim, I delivered him the message as you asked.

470
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,930
Thank you Judge Oh.

471
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,850
Get out of the building now.

472
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,060
Out of the building? Why?

473
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,530
I will tell you later. Please listen to what I am saying right now.

474
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,080
All right.

475
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,830
Wow, now that I'm actually here, I can see that the interior is completely custom made.

476
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,630
I am devouring this view.

477
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,990
Everything seems to be beneath me from here.

478
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,360
This is the reason why Kang Yo Han

479
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,070
was so cocky and arrogant.

480
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,260
Chairmwoman Jeong. You just sitting there,

481
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,670
you have an aura almost like a halo behind you.

482
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,150
- It's shining.
- She's right. She's right.

483
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:29,180
Whenever there's an important event for the foundation, let's do it here, Chairwoman.

484
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,500
Without a doubt the stage production is different because the ladies are high-class.

485
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,840
- Of course, it's our specialty.
- You don't know anything.

486
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,620
Honey!

487
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,700
Let's drink to the end.

488
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,630
Ah, really.

489
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,520
Ga On! Ga On! Why are you doing this? Ga On.

490
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,920
Ga On!

491
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,330
Let's go together, Professor.

492
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,900
There's no media outlet with a conscience, that will report the truth.

493
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,270
Still, it would be different if it were some exciting news that could make money.

494
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,790
Like the new chief justice, who blew himself up with his student,

495
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,970
on his inauguration day.

496
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,900
When the bomb explodes

497
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,900
an email in my name will go out at once to all the major media outlets.

498
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,270
It's an email about the reality of the Dream Village business.

499
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,650
They won't be able to ignore it this time.

500
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,170
Think of this

501
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,140
as atonement for ... Su Hyeon.

502
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,880
That is if you still have some conscience left.

503
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,520
No, Ga On.

504
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,750
Am I a bit late?

505
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,290
It took time as I was coming back from hell.

506
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,720
Chief.

507
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,470
You were alive. It's such a relief!

508
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,580
What happened?

509
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:33,420
You're a rat in my hands now, get it?!

510
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,810
But Warden,

511
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,090
how was the weather in the Bahamas?

512
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,550
What are you talking about right now?

513
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,620
You've been committing all sorts of crimes over the last 30 years,

514
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,110
and have tenaciously saved up 12 billion won.

515
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,750
You put it all into your secret Bahamas bank account,

516
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,000
during your vacation there last summer.

517
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,020
How do you know about that?

518
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,980
Sit down.

519
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,690
I said sit down.

520
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,270
Do you think it's sheer coincidence that you have come this far without being fired?

521
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,620
You are my insurance

522
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,720
that I have prepared for emergencies.

523
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,530
Go check it.

524
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,250
That money isn't there anymore.

525
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,550
Please save me, Judge Kang.

526
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:36,450
That money is my life. What do you want?

527
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,120
What do I have to do?

528

- Your specialty.

529

Switching prisoners.

530
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:52,120
But you're too well known. There's no way we won't be caught.

531
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,220
Who said anything about going undetected forever?

532
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,170
Only for 24 hours,

533
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,000
Just endure it for exactly 24 hours.

534
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,360
And I will give you your money back.

535

00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:29,000
They're taking people away with the excuse of a virus that doesn't even exist,

640
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,690
and selling them as the subjects of human experiments.

641
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:37,950
This is an idea that only a creative nutcase can think of.

642
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:40,650
- It's fabricated.
- I respect you, Mr. President.

643
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,590
Falling for a scheme— Wait—

644
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,630
Dear citizens, whom I love and respect!

645
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,250
This video was all fabricated!

646
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,800
This is an anti-national move to overthrow the current government!

647
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,610
- As I've always said, 
- What?!

648
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,650
people are the most precious thing, right?

649
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,000
Look around, all of this, everything here is money.

650
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,800
Do you know how much each person is worth in clinical trials?

651
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,080
It's no joke.

652
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,480
Not to mention, when they die, we can harvest all their functioning organs.

653
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,000
Even their hair, blood, and all the byproducts...

654
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,300
We collect them all and export them.

655
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,630
Nothing goes to waste.

656
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:19,880
I didn't know ...

657
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,910
As expected, you look good on screen, since you were an actor.

658
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:36,710
These are the people who died at the hands of Jeong Seon Ah, the chairwoman of the Social Responsibility Foundation.

659
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:40,030
Because of her ambitions.

660
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,110
And to attack me,

661
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:56,220
she killed innocent people.

662
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,970
Also, Chief Justice Min Jeong Ho, who took office today,

663
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,170
is a hypocrite,
 591,897 viewers
Min Jeong Ho, the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

664
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:09,360
who has been playing the role of Jeong Seon Ah's informant.

665
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,840
Min Jeong Ho betrayed Lieutenant Yun Su Hyeon, who was like a daughter to him,

666
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,180
and worked with Jeong Seon Ah, who had Lieutenant Yun killed.

667
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,830
Isn't that really alarming?

668
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,580
Go and ...

669
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,260
live in hell for the rest of your life.

670
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,570
Your name will go down in history.

671
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,100
Just as you wished.

672
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,300
Dear citizens, are they guilty?

673
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:14,870
[Guilty]
[Your vote is done.]

674
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,940
National Voting Status
936,648
Guilty 99%
Innocent 1%

675
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:24,370
No!

676
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:28,270
I'm innocent. I'm innocent.

677
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,490
In that case, we need a proper punishment.

678
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,460
What is that? What is that?

679
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,560
Is that in here now? That?

680
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,710
What is that, honey? What's going on?

681
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,020
The moment any of you try to get out of here,

682
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,340
this bomb explodes.

683
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,420
What do we do?

684
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,390
- Check it out.
- Honey, what do we do?

685
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,190
Honey.

686
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,220
It's really there!

687
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,830
Citizens, please form the judgment yourself.

688
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:05,660
Our president won ten million votes in the presidential election.

689
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,330
The moment that the number of clicks on the DIKE app reaches that number,

690
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:12,590
you'll be able to see a magnificent firework display.

691
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:15,800
Celebrating the victory of democracy.

692
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,790
I will be going now.

693
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,380
Where do you mean, Judge?

694
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,430
To the stage.

695
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:26,120
Facing the judge's bench, the door on the left...

696
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:33,560
Facing the judge's bench, the door on the left...

697
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,900
- Kang Yo Han, that bastard.
- Honey. Honey.

698
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:47,900
- It doesn't open? It d-doesn't open? It doesn't open?
- It doesn't open.

699
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,980
Damn it!

700
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,540
Oh my! Oh my! Oh my. Oh my.

701
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,300
- Kang Yo Han!
- Oh my!

702
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:09,680
One more step and I will blow this place up right now.

703
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,220
Dear citizens.

704
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,320
The video of the Dream Village hospital I showed you earlier

705
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,410
was taken by Judge Kim Ga On, at the risk of his own life.

706
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,730
After all this is over,

707
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:40,120
Judge Kim will make a statement on all the facts.

708
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:45,650
These villains will go to hell with me.

709
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,210
No!

710
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:02,270
Judge, you have to save my life.

711
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,620
Didn't I do everything you told me to do?

712
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,530
Didn't I bring them all here?!

713
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,090
- Hello?
- It's been a while, Chairman Min.

714
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,290
You — How did you ... ?

715
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,550
We don't have time, so listen to me carefully.

716
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,210
There's something you have to do for me.

717
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:36,010
At Min Jeong Ho's inauguration, make all the foundation members gather at the live court.

718
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,900
What did you say? What kind of crazy shit are you —

719
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,200
If you don't, you will be done for.

720
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:47,530
I have evidence that you tampered with the foundations' slush fund to prevent Minbo Group's bankruptcy.

721
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,010
Don't lie to me!

722
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:54,180
If you don't believe me, open your desk drawer. I put a copy in there.

723
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,170
You daringly stole their money.

724
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,130
Save me. If that's revealed, I'll be dead.

725
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:06,100
If you want to live, do as I tell you right now.

726
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,030
You son of a b*tch.

727
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,900
Hey, you crazy bastard!

728
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,800
Get off me!

729
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,300
How dare you... ? Should I kill you?

730
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,960
You crazy clown bastard.

731
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:26,030
Save me. You have to save me!

732
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,100
Wow. All right.

733
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,030
I will give you a chance because you made a deal with me.

734
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,990
- It's open. The door is open.
- Oh, the door opened.

735
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,030
Isn't this situation ...

736
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:54,370
feel a bit familiar to you?

737
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:00,900
Just like in the catholic church, ten years ago.

738
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:08,560
Run for it. Only one person on a first come first served basis.

739
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:24,690
Only one person on a first come first served basis.

740
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:46,200
No!

741
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:52,090
No!

742
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,960
Yo Han ...

743
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,840
Hyung.

744
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,520
Wait a minute. Wait a ... Wait a ...Wait a minute!

745
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,170
Be quiet! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Kang Yo Han. Wait a minute.

746
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,830
Make ... a deal with me.

747
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,760
Be quiet! Attention!

748
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,230
Kang Yo Han!

749
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,360
All you have to do is save me, really.

750
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,790
I'm the commander-in-chief of the military. We can do a win-win situation.

751
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:00,920
These guys are just businessmen and women.

752
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,650
I'm different from them.

753
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,000
Without me, what would happen to the country?

754
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,200
I'm the Republic of Korea. I'm an artist and a leader.

755
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,200
Please just save me this once.

756
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:16,740
This country ... please! I'm the king!

757
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:23,270
Please, I'm the king! I'm ... I'm the king! I'm the king! I'm the king! I'm the king— !

758

It's okay, Seon Ah. It's okay.

780
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,640
Do you know?

781
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:06,060
I really loved you, Young Master.

782
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,350
Judge Kim.

783
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,830
- Judge Kim!
- Judge Kim, save me.

784
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,300
- Please save me.  - Judge Kim.

785
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,900
- Please.  - Please save me.

786
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,490
I was wrong.

787
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:59,130
Chief ...

788
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,060
Don't move.

789
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,460
What are you doing here?

790
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:15,050
You can't do this.

791
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,930
Are you going to leave Elijah alone?

792
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:24,550
And die together with all those scumbags?

793
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,630
It can't be helped.

794
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:34,330
After the performance is over, the actor has to disappear.

795
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:22,760
I will go with you.

796
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,570
You will be the hero.

797
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:40,530
For the devil ... I'm enough.

798
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,640
Chief! Chief! Chief!

799
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:01,460
Chief! Chief!

800
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,240
- Chief!
- It's dangerous!

801
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,820
Kang Yo Han!

802
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,650
- Judge ... !
- I was wrong.

803
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:32,030
Don't do it! Don't do it!

804
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:13,230
Kang Yo Han!

805
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,780
Judge Kim, are you all right?

806
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,760
The ambulance is here.

807
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,630
Let's go. Can you get up?

808
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:27,350
Elijah?

809
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,850
Elijah?

810
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,110
How about this?

811
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:18,150
Are you all right?

812
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,830
You really thought I'd topple it, didn't you?

813
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,990
Secure an emergency exit passage. Check the amount of time you need. Time required to detonate?

814
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,310
Caution when changing location. 1. Concentrate on dangerous columns. 2. Disguise 3. Distance check required.

815
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,550
The focused areas will easily collapse.

816
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:19,870
After the performance, the magician must disappear.

817
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:28,310
I'm done taking care of things.

818
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,500
Now you have work you must do.

819
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,490
Ajumeoni.

820
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:43,490
Young Master Yo Han has come.

821
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:47,100
What happened? What about Elijah?

822
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:49,480
That was ...

823
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,420
Young Master!

824
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,420
You're alive!

825
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,560
Were you worried, Nanny?

826
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,260
Why wouldn't I be?

827
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,600
Nanny. You're fired, starting today.

828
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,630
Excuse me?

829
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:11,650
Leave this house and live freely now.

830
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:13,710
There won't be anyone living in this house anymore.

831
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:16,570
What do you mean by that?

832
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,240
Huh? Young Master ...

833
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:29,880
Elijah is in her room, right?

834
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,220
Yes.

835
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,460
Y-Young Master ...

836
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,700
Elijah.

837
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:04,780
Yo Han ...

838
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,410
Are you out of jail now?

839
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:21,460
Is everything okay?

840
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:22,610
Yes.

841
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:25,930
You don't have to worry. It's all right.

842
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,500
We're going to go to a safe place now.

843
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:32,030
A safe place?

844
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:34,180
Should I show you where it is?

845
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:42,580
It's a rehabilitation hospital in Switzerland.

846
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:46,630
I've been continuously donating to them,

847
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:49,030
to find a way to get you to walk.

848
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,740
Shall we go there?

849
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,130
Just the two of us?

850
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:05,930
Yo Han ...

851
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,150
Ah, he is alive!

852
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:46,340
That's a relief.

853
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:52,490
But I think I will be even more busier.

854
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:53,570
What do you mean?

855
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:57,550
The young master set up a health food shopping mall for me.

856
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,970
He said it is severance pay.

857
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:05,500
He told me to sell healthy and tasteless things as much as I want.

858
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,300
Is that a curse or what?

859
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,740
- You're really going back to your hometown?
- Yes.

860
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,700
Isn't it too unfair to show this charm only in Seoul?
One month later.

861
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:27,830
- That's true.
- I signed up to volunteer at the juvenile case department.

862
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:31,490
I'm going to scold the young people who messed up and help them too.

863
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,600
Because I think I can do it well.

864
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,080
You will do well, as always.

865
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,730
You've done a great job.

866
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:43,850
You as well, Judge Kim.

867
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,980
Call me if you ever come to the area.

868
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:04,420
Public hearing on judicial reform to overcome the Kang Yo Han incident.

869
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:14,960
Our new ruling party will never repeat the mistakes of the Heo Jung Se administration.

870
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:21,320
We have prepared this hearing today to correct the true rule of law..

871
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:28,060
Let's give a round of applause to Judge Kim Ga On, our national hero.

872
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:46,690
Judge Kim, what great ideas do you have to prevent disgraceful incidents,

873
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:50,150
similar to Kang Yo Han's, from happening again?

874
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,520
Is it disgraceful?

875
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:59,810
Kang Yo Han may not be a hero, but he is also not a criminal.

876
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:03,220
Do you think people were crazy about Kang Yo Han

877
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:06,440
because they are just stupid and easy to be swayed?

878
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:11,450
As expected, he's young, so he's very energetic.

879
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:14,960
I think you're saying we should look for the root cause.

880
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,460
But is that something that could be done soon?

881
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,770
The order is to come up with some impactful measures

882
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:24,120
and try to resolve the public sentiment first.

883
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,950
That's right, Assemblyman.

884
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:29,570
Our prosecution office is considering transferring the authority to select judges

885
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,350
to the Ministry of Justice, so that we can strengthen the process of selecting judges

886
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:35,410
and filter out risk factors like Kang Yo Han—

887
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,710
What kind of nonsense is that?

888
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:39,510
That is a violation of judicial independence.

889
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:46,250
Assemblyman, rather than that, it would be better to bring in Judge Kim Ga On,

890
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,750
who is popular with the citizens, as the presiding judge to form a new live court —

891
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,960
At a time like this ...

892
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,750
Excuse me?

893
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:57,000
Shouldn't we do our job first?

894
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,250
I apologize.

895
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:03,720
I dared to say something arrogant in front of the great seniors.

896
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,960
Please forgive me.

897
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:16,620
We are all people who do the work entrusted to us by the sovereign citizens.

898
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:20,810
Shouldn't we make sure that there are no people who suffer unfair treatment, that there are no people who shed tears of agony,

899
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:27,350
and that those who made them shed those tears, fairly pay for their crimes?

900
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:29,980
Isn't that our job?

901
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:33,320
This is the reason I became a judge.

902
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,110
If we don't do our job, someone will suffer.

903
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:44,170
That suffering is what creates a monster.

904
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:50,050
There is a reason why people get angry.

905
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,420
What you said is great.

906
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,150
Young people should have that determination.

907
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:00,270
I respect you.

908
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,210
I have thoroughly listened to what Judge Kim has said.

909
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:06,090
Now, how about discussing practical measures, Assemblyman?

910
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:11,560
Let's do that. You mentioned the process of selecting judges earlier, the two of you talk more ...

911
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,550
Still, a little more ...

912
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:26,110
It's the same.

913
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,940
Nothing has changed.

914
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:36,590
What should I do now,

915
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:40,050
to help create a world that doesn't need Yo Han?

916
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,620
Do well

917
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,900
or I will be back.

918
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,230
Chief!

919
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:25,020
Kang Yo Han!
