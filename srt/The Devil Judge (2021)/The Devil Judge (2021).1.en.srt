00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,980
Yes.

158
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,790
Cases like this where the emotions of the public and the conclusion reached by the court can easily differ,

159
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,020
- are very difficult, so is there a need to do it so publicly—
- Chief Justice.

160
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,520
The Live Court show is not a kangaroo court*.
(unofficial court held by a group of people in order to try someone regarded, especially without good evidence, as guilty)

161
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,140
It's just a transparent court. In front of all the citizens.

162
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm satisfied with that.

163
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,160
I'll get going first.

164
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,300
All right, see you tomorrow.

165
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,090
We will cross now. Raise your right hands! That's right, stick to this side.

166
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,990
You bastards!

167
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,220
Be ready to shoot.

168
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,150
A bus is speeding towards the front entrance 200 meters away.

169
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,830
The driver's identity is unknown. Please let me know how we should proceed.

170
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,490
Kids, run quickly!

171
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,590
Are you okay?

172
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,590
The guns were provided in order to be used.

173
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm sorry, Judge.

174
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,560
What are you looking at? Stay back!

175
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,270
Are you all right, sir?

176
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,920
Someone is hurt. He needs to go to the hospital! Hospital!

177
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,230
Punish Chairman Ju Il Do!

178
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,900
This morning in front of the Supreme Court, there was an explosion of a preschool bus.

179
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,800
The arrest warrant for Ju Il Do, the chairman of JU Chemical, was rejected.

180
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,520
angering the driver of the preschool bus

181
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,460
- who sped towards the Supreme Court.
- What is this? Was it because Chairman Ju Il Do's warrant was rejected?

182
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,230
It's just a challenge against government authority.

183
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,190
If I may, isn't it a scream of anguish rather than a challenge?

184
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,920
What do you mean by scream?

185
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,060
When you corner and trap a rat and starve it, it will struggles and bang its head on the wall.

186
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,600
Would a human being be any different?

187
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,600
Master Seo, it's an issue regarding life or death. The foundation needs to help.

188
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,160
We were able to control the epidemic, but there are so many unemployed people that we have nobody to collect tax from.

189
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,860
If the drought lasts for a long time, there will be riots.

190
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,950
- Chairman Park.
- Yes?

191
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,320
Preparations for the live court are going well, right?

192
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,050
Yes, don't worry. It'll be a big day.

193
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,120
You must prepare well.

194
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,390
Our Minister Cha has special interest in the case, due to personal circumstances.

195
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,980
Welfare for the needy

196
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,480
The loan of luck - We guarantee complete confidentiality.

197
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,320
Are you trying to grow a jungle?

198
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,460
Hi.

199
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,400
I heard there was a terrorist attack in front of the Supreme Court.

200
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,140
You already know about this? As expected of Inspector Yun Su Hyeon of the MIU. (MIU: Metropolitan Investigation Unit)

201
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,080
You didn't get hurt, right? Don't tell me you acted recklessly again.

202
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,380
Stop it. Don't worry. I was so scared I hid far at the back. As a man should.

203
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,520
Good job. You've finally matured. Let's go upstairs now.

204
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,430
Go ahead. I'll finish with this one first.

205
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,410
Come on, stop this and come up.

206
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,670
- Why are you getting angry?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

207
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Clink.

208
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,530
Won't you treat me to dinner?

209
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,210
- Why should I?
- I heard you'll be on TV.

210
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,230
But if you become a star like Kang Yo Han, it'll be difficult to see you in the future.

211
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,840
Being a star sounds nice.

212
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,690
Why are you being sarcastic?

213
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,250
Clink. Just drink your beer.

214
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,190
You've got nothing to lose being with a star like Kang Yo Han. He has a story.

215
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,550
The heir to an enormous wealth, and the survivor of a tragic accident...

216
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,010
People go crazy over these things.

217
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,220
True. His story is completely different from mine.

218
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,990
What's wrong with yours?

219
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,840
Hey, now that you've become a judge after all that hard work, you should move to a better neighborhood.

220
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,430
- What's wrong with this place?
- It's changed so much.

221
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,780
Compared to before.

222
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,150
This is the only place now.

223
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,720
For what?

224
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,740
To remember my parents.

225
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,230
- I'll make you food. Eat before you go.
- Food?

226
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,230
You've lost weight. You've been starving yourself again, I'm sure.

227
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,100
If you act this way, I might end up confessing to you again.

228
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,980
Even if I've been rejected five times since I was a kid, I figured it's not over until it's over.

229
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,380
- I don't want to loose my childhood friend. Have dinner before you go. You're done with this, right?
- Yes.

230
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,160
Heartless jerk.

231
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,300
I love you!

232
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,500
The key point is to deny that Chairman Ju Il Do knew anything about the details of the company's discharge.

233
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,370
We argue it was a force majeure event.
(an event beyond anyone's control.)

234
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,940
If the people's vote goes toward the panel during the trial, what should our contractors do?

235
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,950
We'll have to emphasize that the sewage treatment facility was damaged because the hill's embankment collapsed.

236
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,300
That it was bound to happen due to the city's negligent management.

237
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,790
Chairman.

238
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,760
Attorney Go, hello.

239
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,170
Look at this. Isn't the public making too much noise?

240
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,000
Ungrateful things.
[ Live Court Show trial scheduled for JU Chemical's toxic wastewater discharge.]

241
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,370
Thousands of those dregs of society are able to scrounge for food today thanks to me.

242
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,930
Anyway in environmental accidents like this one there can never be indisputable evidence,

243
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,640
How can we expect the business owner to know about his factory's wastewater composition?

244
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,960
We'll plead innocent, and even in the worst case, you'll be charged with death and injury by occupational negligence.

245
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,020
Death and injury by occupational negligence...

246
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,000
What is the sentence for that?

247
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,010
- The maximum penalty is five years.
- Five years?

248
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,780
Well, they did make a special law and other things this time,

249
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,010
but the court is so conservative, they won't be able to increase the sentence like that so suddenly.

250
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,980
Don't you know that I can't sleep if my bed doesn't properly support my back?

251
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,470
Chairman. If you spend just one year reading and meditating,

252
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll get you out on parole.

253
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,520
You will even be coming out healthier.

254
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,790
You are sure of that, right?

255
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,220
If you are so anxious about this,

256
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,030
just remember that person is there.

257
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,010
You're right.

258
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,380
Chief.

259
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,560
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

260
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,870
- Don't mention it.
- You shot without hesitation.

261
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,070
Did I?

262
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,870
Were you thinking of killing the driver?

263
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,880
- If there was the need to.
- The need, you say?

264
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,310
It was likely the bus would have kept going straight ahead even if the driver had died instantly.

265
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,220
So you shot to make him turn the steering wheel instinctively.

266
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,450
So that he would be the only one to die if he crashed.

267
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,720
Isn't that basic arithmetic? One is a lesser number than two.

268
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,560
That's right.

269
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,290
How was meeting Kang Yo Han?

270
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm not sure. 
I survived thanks to you.

271
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,670
You're welcome.

272
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,040
I guess I shouldn't become the lesser number when you are involved, Chief.

273
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,420
Don't do that, then.

274
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,680
Why do you think Kang Yo Han chose Chairman Ju Il Do as his first defendant for the live court?

275
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,240
Isn't it because it's the case that's gaining the most attention from the public lately?

276
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,050
That's true. That's right.

277
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,750
But Chairman Ju Il Do is one of the largest donors of the Social Responsibility Foundation.

278
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,110
And Kang Yo Han's judicial reform

279
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:29,550
was possible because Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui and the Social Responsibility Foundation supported it.

280
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:37,310
So he should have avoided that case because it puts him in an awkward position, but instead he insisted on taking it?

281
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,830
I'm wondering if he might have an ulterior motive.

282
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,850
Chief Kang. Regarding the preschool bus driver from yesterday,

283
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,650
what about indicting him without detention for now, and putting him through a trial later?

284
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,590
Why do you want to do so?

285
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,600
The live court is just around the corner.

286
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,190
Is there really a need to receive the public's attention over this shameful matter now?

287
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,020
There's the issue of what you did yesterday as well. First impressions are important, don't you think?

288
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,810
Are you asking me to show compassion toward a terrorist?

289
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,500
It's not about compassion, but about appearance.

290
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,090
In that case, there's nothing bad about it.

291
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,440
The noisier it gets, the more attention it'll garner. We're making noise marketing here.

292
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,290
For a case like this, imprisoning him is the fair thing to do.

293
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,760
Excuse me... May I say something?

294
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,140
The three-year-old daughter of that bus driver is one of the dead victims of the JU Chemical accident.

295
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,180
And her grandmother killed herself over the matter.

296
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,840
So?

297
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,030
I am a little concerned that rejecting Chairman Ju Il Do's arrest warrant while imprisoning the bus driver

298
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,990
might not be fair.

299
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,270
Judge Kim.

300
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,720
Ju Il Do is a defendant whose trial is to decide whether he is guilty or not, while the bus driver was caught in the act.

301
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
Don't you know that much?

302
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,390
But shouldn't we take motive into consideration—

303
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,620
Do you think you obtain the right to harm others if you're a victim yourself?

304
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,910
That's not what I mean, but he is injured and—

305
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,300
There is a doctor at the detention center too.

306
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,370
Let's go by the rules.

307
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:30,540
Yu, the child who had been hospitalized following JU Chemical's waste water discharge accident, died.

308
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,580
In a tragic turn of events, the grandmother took her own life. 
[Victim of JU Chemical waste water discharge makes a drastic decision. ]

309
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,410
With this, the number of deaths due to this accident reaches eleven.
[Where will the aftereffect of the accident end?]

310
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:43,210
Including the ones undergoing treatment, the total number of victims is no less than forty-seven.

311
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,950
Investigation is underway to uncover the full story of the incident,

312
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,190
and Chairman Ju Il Do's trial will later—

313
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,950
Sorry. It's a bit difficult to watch.

314
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,470
It reminds me of where I used to live. I'm a country girl, you see.

315
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,040
Even though I don't look like it.

316
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,370
And I'm from Seoul. As you can see.

317
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,120
From the slums, right?

318
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,650
- Is that obvious?
- Yes.

319
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,170
I guess people who came from poor backgrounds have a way of recognizing each other.

320
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,480
Like a kind of radar?

321
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,350
Then what do you see from Chief Kang?

322
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,440
Our chief Kang?

323
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,680
I'm not sure...
You can do it! Go for it, Oh Jin Ju!!!

324
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,770
I don't see anything.

325
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,410
Fundamentals of your work life:

326
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,420
useless curiosity toward your superior is forbidden.

327
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,840
- Let's get to work.
- Yes.

328
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,320
We have the trial statute. Have a read through it.

329
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,020
- The trial statute?
- Yes.

330
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,810
The trial statute of our live court.

331
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,010
It might make you a bit angry.

332
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,180
You like to play with numbers very much, don't you?

333
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,390
When the viewers press the smartphone's app button, then let's judge after looking at the numbers.

334
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,750
Do you call it playing with numbers? I call it democracy.

335
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,370
If you're going to do such democratic trials, then why do you need us?

336
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,890
- I think you've read the trial statute.
- Is that a trial?

337
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,960
No matter how many opinions the associate judges give, you'll make the final decisions based on the number of votes,

338
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
so why do you really need us?

339
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,190
It's necessary to have emergency measures during an emergency time.

340
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,330
And ... the pictures won't look good.

341
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,720
Pictures?

342
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,320
If there is nothing at my left and right sides, the pictures will feel empty. It's a broadcast after all.

343
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,050
It's me. I need you to do something.

344
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,610
- What is it?
- Find me a spare key for the supreme court record storage room.

345
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,690
You punk, do you think it's easy to get that?

346
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,630
If you can't even do such a small thing, I recommend you quit being a supreme court justice.

347
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,230
Hello?

348
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,800
Who dragged me here...?

349
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,820
You'll go to jail if you damage the records.

350
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,770
I won't tell about my accomplice, Supreme Court Justice.

351
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,320
I found it.

352
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,240
The actual case.

353
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,190
You punk chokes me up! So you searched for the 20-year-old records?

354
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,600
Isn't the love even for the first love the most ardent?

355
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,690
The first love?

356
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,550
When Chairman Ju Il Do expanded his business for the first time and got into trouble,

357
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,930
the person who let him off was an élite prosecutor from Seoul, Prosecutor Cha Gyeong Hui.

358
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,090
Whenever the incident was worth forgetting, she let him off the hook, and she did that three times - so he never got a citation.

359
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,530
Of course, she didn't do it for free, did she?
[Defendant: Ju Il Do, Prosecutor: Cha Gyeong Hui]

360
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,030
When Cha Gyeong Hui ran for assemblywoman for the first time,

361
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,590
which chairman supported her?

362
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,720
Ju Il Do?

363
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,840
To summarize ...

364
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,790
Ju Il Do was the sponsor of Justice Minister Cha Gyeong Hui at the time when she was a prosecutor.

365
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,700
Cha Gyeong Hui has power and influence and has been supporting Kang Yo Han all this time.

366
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,700
Now Kang Yo Han insists on taking Ju Il Do's trial.

367
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,800
And Cha Gyeong Hui is just watching, without any objection to it.

368
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,560
Is this trial for revealing his crime?

369
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,520
Or the opposite?

370
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,720
The problem is that all these theories are just presumption.

371
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,610
I should dig into it, no matter what.

372
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,180
It seems I'm blocking my future with my own hands,

373
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,550
but it's too late to go back.

374
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,830
It is an ardent first love ...

375
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,700
Is Su Hyeon doing well?

376
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes, Ga On. It's okay. Tell me.

377
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,670
Wiretapping device? Why do you need it?

378
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,970
Stay quiet!

379
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,640
Hold on. I'll call you back.

380
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,260
Stop it!

381
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,650
Police!

382
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,260
Stay back!

383
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,100
Save me.

384
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,110
- She is my kid sister.
- Go to the wall.

385
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,960
I told you she is my kid sister.

386
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,400
Are you all right?

387
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,210
It's okay. It's okay.

388
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,280
I'm a policewoman.

389
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,660
Save me.
[You, too, participate in the trials.
Safe Korea comes true now.]

390
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,830
Minister, Director Jeong Seon Ah from the Social Responsibility Foundation (SRF) is here.

391
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,540
- Let her in.
- Yes.

392
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,260
Hello, Minister. I'm here on an errand from Mr. Seo.

393
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,800
What brings you here?

394
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,880
Excuse me. May I have a seat then tell you?

395
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,200
Thank you.

396
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,600
Both Mr. Seo as well as our foundation supporters

397
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,750
are worried a lot about this trial.

398
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,560
What are they worried about?

399
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,700
I'm sorry for saying it this way but let me be direct.

400
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,960
Let's catch these petty criminals so the citizens can release their anger.

401
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,830
Isn't that the reason we're holding this mock trial?

402
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,060
So?

403
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,100
So is it really necessary to put a businessman on trial?

404
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:28,300
If even a moderate sentence is the result, it would set a bad precedent for businessmen.

405
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,250
That's what they're worried about.

406
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,200
- Have you ever seen Kang Yo Han make a mistake?
- I haven't,

407
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,200
but they think it might be better if you choose an easier case for the first trial.

408
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,700
Why are you so adamant on this case?

409
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,360
Did you say I'm being adamant?

410
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,110
I'm sorry, I'm just the messenger.

411
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,080
Why are the people in the business of social welfare,

412
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,930
or rather, to be more exact, the alliance of the wealthy,

413
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,430
so invested in how the country is being run?

414
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,340
I'm pretty sure I said I would take care of it.

415
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,430
How arrogant.

416
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm sorry, Minister Cha.

417
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,030
I've overstepped my boundaries.

418
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,520
May I dare say one more thing that is beyond my boundary?

419
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,200
Did you know that your chair and the desk you sit behind,

420
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,800
the painting on the wall, and even the car you commute with

421
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,640
were all paid for by our foundation.

422
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,210
That's because the ministry's budget came up short this year.

423
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,350
Right now, there aren't enough prisons, so we might have to build a private one ourselves.

424
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,550
I'm curious, Minister.

425
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,420
Who exactly

426
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,250
is serving this country?

427
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,030
What is it?

428
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,460
Why would a judge need a wiretapper?

429
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,580
Do you have a girlfriend who's cheating on you?

430
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,880
If that's easier for you to believe, then let's go with that.

431
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,490
- I can understand it, but I can't forgive it.
- Even if you can't, let's just go with that.

432
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,060
Quit joking around. What are you going to use it for?

433
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,340
You'll get hurt if you try to know too much.

434
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,060
It's not even one or two times you've been so obstinate.

435
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,500
- Let's test it. Go on the roof.
- The roof?

436
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,090
Wear this before you go.

437
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,190
What are looking at? Don't you know how to do it yourself? Just go.

438
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,940
No police brutality for citizens, Detective.

439
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,920
Can you hear me, Judge Kim?

440
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,990
Will you marry me? No, I'm just joking.

441
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,780
I love you.

442
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,970
She has a nice voice.

443
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,180
Did you hear it well?

444
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,880
- Very clearly.
- What's your answer?

445
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,610
Normally, you're not supposed to show that you heard.

446
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,460
So you're not going to answer?

447
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,580
Fine. Go catch your cheating girlfriend.

448
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,890
Hey, I just got called in. I'll call you later.

449
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,740
Again?

450
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,380
See you later.

451
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,240
Take care.

452
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,730
Will you marry me? No, I'm just joking.

453
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,500
I love you.

454
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
Will you marry me? No, I'm just joking.

455
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,330
I love you.

456
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,520
Hey.

457
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,440
Thank you.

458
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,050
Judge Kim?

459
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,850
Chief Judge, you're early.

460
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,080
The trial is right around the corner.

461
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,780
So what brought you here?

462
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,390
The library is closed.

463
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,750
Without turning the light on?

464
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,070
I have good night vision.

465
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,370
Then...

466
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,130
What?

467
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,770
- I heard you live alone.
- Yes.

468
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,320
It must be hard.

469
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,520
Your shirt is so wrinkled.

470
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,020
It's hard to find time to iron.

471
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,490
Right.

472
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,420
Keep up the good work.

473
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,730
He is an interesting guy.

474
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,910
Dead: 11/ Injured:36

475
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,840
Associate Judge: Kim Ga On

476
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,220
Yes, Minister of Justice.

477
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,900
Judge Kang. Regarding the trial,

478
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,270
I trust you, Judge Kang.

479
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:59,260
Don't worry, Minister. Everything will be done according to the law.

480
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,370
I don't think the public is that stupid.

481
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,790
It's me. Everything is ready, right?

482
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,030
You met Doctor, right? So what did you say?

483
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,290
It turned out well. You worked hard.

484
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,360
I'll meet the attorney today.

485
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,890
He's Ju Il Do's attorney.

486
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,690
- What name is your reservation under?
- Kang Yo Han.

487
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,390
Just before the trial, the judge met the defendant's attorney.

488
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:49,430
He spoke on the phone with the minister of justice who seems to be on his side.

489
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,530
And who is "Doctor"?

490
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:58,390
He's suspicious, but we can't prove anything with this.

491
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,790
You know that, right? He could make an excuse that meeting his attorney was to discuss the procedure.

492
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:08,410
And all he said to the minister of justice was everything would be done according to the law.

493
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,460
The trial will be held just tomorrow.

494
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:20,770
I'm just going to watch him carefully with eyes wide open in court.

495
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:25,460
To bring facilities related to new technology such as electricity charging stations into the city,

496
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,200
we need to improve the building structures, use a classification system and share the information of architectural drawings.

497
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,540
We also need to reject the construction of high-rise buildings and promote Building Information Modeling

498
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,440
[From Jeong Seon Ah: It's the show time you're waiting for. You should watch it.]
the building information modeling roadmaps.

499
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,920
By utilizing the construction information through these roadmaps—

500
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,500
Ah yes. Continue please.

501
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,790
I have something I absolutely have to watch today.

502
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,210
Shall we watch our Judge Kang Yo Han's skills?

503
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,680
Father, please forgive them.

504
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,620
They know not what they're doing.

505
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,830
Now 30 seconds left!

506
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,980
- When I say "three, two", get ready.
- Yes.

507
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,940
Now the sound check!

508
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,690
It's very exciting in itself that the general public can participate in the trial.

509
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,270
And I think it's very nice that the public opinions come together as one.

510
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,600
If people commit a crime, getting punished for their crime is a natural course.

511
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,200
They would get voted on equally by the public, regardless of whether they're rich or not.

512
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,870
Now I think we're going to watch proper trials.
- I trust you.

513
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,640
The first trial in the Live Court show will open today.
 [The public's reaction for Live Court Show?]

514
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:31,210
Trust in the judiciary is very low, so can the Live Court Show change this current reality?

515
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:36,280
While the public is waiting for the first trial, full of hope that everybody is equal before the law,

516
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,910
it's interesting to see whether Judge Kang Yo Han and his Live Court Show will fulfill these expectations.

517
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,110
Hello, everyone.

518
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,940
This is a live broadcast from the supreme court at this historical moment!

519
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,720
The live court with public participation is waiting for you, for the first time in judicial history.

520
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,920
The method of participation is simple.

521
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,230
As you see, after you install the Goddess of Justice application,

522
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:25,840
- if you touch Goddess of justice, you can see the progressing trial.
- Mom!

523
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:33,480
- Yes, Gyu Min. Come here and stay quiet.
- And you can see two buttons below.

524
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,860
While watching the trial,

525
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,350
if you think the defendant should get punished,

526
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:46,120
press the red button. But if you don't think so, then press the other one.
[Your Choice?]

527
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:52,230
Your opinions will be collected, graphed, and brought to this court right away.

528
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:59,500
The court will judge, seeing the public's opinions in real time.

529
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:07,100
I introduce the judge who presides at today's trial, Kang Yo Han!

530
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:20,700
Dear citizens! Now, the Live Court Show begins.

531
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,670
[Live Court Show]

532
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:34,480
There will no longer be a court held only among the élite, those who turn a blind eye to the public's common sense.

533
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,260
I'll open every step of trial to the public, make it transparent, and listen to your opinions.

534
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,520
I'll render judgment according to the law, but I won't turn a blind eye to the people's will.

535
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,350
The owners of this court are you who are sovereign.

536
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,880
Ready, ready.

537
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,860
Let's meet together the case we are dealing with today.

538
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,790
Prosecutor, please explain it.

539
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,890
There is a village where all young people left.

540
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:44,600
The population of this village is 47 people. Their average age is 72 years.

541
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,810
Among them, 11 people died and 23 people are still in the intensive care units.

542
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:57,110
Thirteen people were discharged but are suffering breathing difficulties, neuropathy, and many severe side effects.

543
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:02,820
One of the dead was only 3 years old and another is her grandmother.

544
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,180
After she lost her precious granddaughter whom her daughter working in Seoul entrusted to her,

545
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,400
she strangled herself.

546
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,480
Her granddaughter was the only child in this village.

547
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,970
The culprit of this tragedy is sitting right there.

548
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:22,630
JU Chemicals Factory 4, that the defendant operates is only 5 kilometers away from this village.

549
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:28,820
From such a place, they released untreated toxic chemicals into the river.

550
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:33,840
The water that the village residents use for drinking, washing themselves and their clothes, and for farming!

551
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,770
Ladies and Gentlemen!

552
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,040
This is a murder!

553
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:46,810
- What? Already? Hey, broadcast! Broadcast!
- Yes.

554
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,280
[Guilty: 70%]

555
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,870
I listened to the prosecutor's statement carefully.

556
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:08,990
Speaking exactly, it's not a statement but an inciting speech. I enjoyed hearing that.

557
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,600
Watch what you're saying!

558
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:15,600
We just saw the riskiness of the media court clearly.

559
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,050
A trial is not a movie. I's not a show either.

560
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:23,390
A trial is the process where something is proved only with objective evidence.

561
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,460
Just now, he said it's a murder.

562
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,180
What kind of crazy businessman would deliberately murder the residents?

563
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,810
As long as he released the toxic chemicals into the stream even though he knew it could kill people,

564
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:37,850
it's a murder by willful negligence.

565
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,070
Here, would you look at these?

566
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:48,420
As you see, the embankment collapsed at the hill behind the factory so the treatment facility got damaged.

567
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:54,280
Prosecutor, during my studies, I learned that the local government is responsible of managing the embankments.

568
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,410
I'm not sure if my memory is correct.

569
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,010
It's true that some toxic chemicals were discharged.

570
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:03,270
However, since we immediately stopped running the factory and did emergency repair,

571
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,160
the duration of toxic discharge was less than one hour.

572
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,110
Your Honor.

573
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,440
What could we do more than this?

574
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,830
This was beyond our control.

575
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:17,340
Hadn't there been discharge due to old equipment before that?

576
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,300
Do you have evidence?

577
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,710
Under the pretext of emergency repair, you replaced or scrapped all the problematic equipment.

578
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,590
Are you asking if I have evidence?

579
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,580
You mean you don't have evidence. I understand.

580
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:33,760
The only proven fact is a discharge for a short time due to uncontrollable accident.

581
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,060
There is no evidence regarding the situation before that.

582
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,760
According to the forensic institute's presumption, a tragedy of that size couldn't happen because of a spill for only one hour—

583
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,670
Presumption? I think I heard wrong just now.

584
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,980
Is presumption an objective proof?

585
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,550
It's right!

586
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:57,110
Without any proof, how can you accuse this patriotic businessman of murder?

587
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:01,430
Do you know how many people can live in this economic crisis thanks to me?

588
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,130
Our JU Chemicals has as many as 17,400 employees.

589
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,350
If you add their families and affiliates,

590
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,750
it's over 100,000 people who depend on us for their livelihood.

591
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,320
- With this kind of public trial—
- Watch what you say, Defendant!

592
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,160
I also have a right to speak up!

593
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,700
Defendant!

594
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,170
Why doesn't he say anything? Why does he act like that?

595
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:32,030
Damn it. Broadcasting accident! Hey, get ready for advertisement!

596
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,960
- Defense Attorney, please return to your seat.
- Yes.

597
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,230
Wait! H-Hold on.

598
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,060
Defendant.

599
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,290
- Yes.
- Have a seat, please.

600
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,280
Y-yes.

601
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,830
Defense Attorney, have you finished your statement?

602
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,450
Yes, that's it.

603
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:41,320
Then, the court is adjourned for a moment and will continue later. You may go to the bathroom.

604
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,480
Judge, may I ask a question?

605
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,140
Go ahead.

606
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,600
The embankment collapse accident you mentioned earlier ---

607
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:17,600
The collapse happened the very night after the first death occurred.

608
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,000
Is it correct?

609
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,700
Yes, it's correct.

610
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,900
It seems it was quite a coincidence, doesn't it?

611
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,930
As soon as the death occurred,

612
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:29,580
how could such an accident happen and all evidence be gotten rid of?

613
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:33,570
I'm sorry, Judge, but the cause of the first death wasn't clear.

614
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,780
So it's our position that it had nothing to do with this incident.

615
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,900
According to the medical report, the victim showed symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, convulsion, unconsciousness

616
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,070
that aren't different from the symptoms of other victims.

617
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:49,470
That was just an assumption. An autopsy wasn't even performed on the body.

618
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:53,950
There is no proof that the toxic chemicals were detected in him at all, Your Honor.

619
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,520
- Your Honor.
- Go ahead.

620
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,490
In order to hear an objective opinion, I would like to call the leading expert in heavy metal poisoning,

621
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:03,410
Dr. Yu Jung Baek, to the stand.

622
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,840
All right, go ahead.

623
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,250
Everything's ready, right? Did you meet the doctor?

624
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,770
First of all, thank you for making time in your busy schedule to come.

625
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:25,900
Not at all.

626
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,130
A sample of river water, ah, there it is.

627
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:34,800
Did you analyze it? Did you form an opinion as an expert?

628
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,930
Some of the victims have signs of heavy metal poisoning.

629
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:43,630
There is a lot, but I'm somewhat concerned whether the reason was wastewater runoff.

630
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,510
Although it's easy to think of leaking from heavy metals

631
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:51,410
used in a certain environment such as a factory, in reality, it's not so.

632
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,550
It exists in everyday life, wherever we live.

633
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,760
Food ingredients are raised on contaminated land. Well ...

634
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,100
don't we always encounter chemicals in cosmetics?

635
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,150
Particularly, this region is the very first place

636
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,600
to be affected by fine dust containing heavy metals.

637
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,430
It's an agricultural area, so the impact of chemical herbicides and fertilizers is severe.
Guilty 53% Innocent 47%.

638
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:14,680
Compared to all that, the concentration of pollutants mixed into the river was very low.

639
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,570
I doubt it.

640
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:20,730
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yes.

641
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:24,860
- You just said "this low concentration of pollutants in the river."

642
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,430
What is the specific pollutant?

643
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,520
There was a mixture of chemicals.

644
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,440
Among them, which was the worst you detected?

645
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,700
That would be ... it's called potassium cyanide.

646
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,260
Can you make it easier for me to understand?

647
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,880
What is the common name for potassium cyanide?

648
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,350
Doctor?

649
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,410
Its name is cyanide.

650
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,800
Cyanide!

651
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,600
Seven, seven, seven.
Even though JU Chemical Chairman Ju Il Do knew of the discharge of cyanide, he did nothing.

652
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,210
The word may sound frightening but

653
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,610
isn't the chemical cyanide very common in nature?

654
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:10,520
Yes, I know. It's very common.

655
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,600
It's in almonds, apple seeds, apricot kernels, cherry pits, and gingko nuts. It's also in peach stones.

656
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,800
It's not unconditionally dangerous. It's the concentration.

657
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,370
The concentration is the problem.

658
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,680
There was a village in the immediate vicinity where most of the residents were elderly.

659
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,350
Even so, wouldn't the concentration detected really be zero?

660
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,660
- I am sorry but, your honors—
- Umm. Your Honor.

661
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,310
Although Your Honor knows the law,

662
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,080
don't you think I know this field even better?

663
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,940
Science is facts. I'm saying it's not a matter of people's sentiment.

664
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,780
- Witness.
- Judge Kim.

665
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,330
That's enough. Stop.

666
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,420
Thank you, Doctor.

667
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,820
- Yes.
- You may step down.

668
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,590
It must have been difficult to testify for so long. Please have a drink of water.

669
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:02,910
- Chief Judge.
- Give the witness some water.

670
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,830
Thank you.

671
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,530
Wait a minute. That water. Did you change the water from the sample earlier?

672
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,340
What did you do? Seriously.

673
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,600
Your Honor. It's not so. The evidence is kept here.

674
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,760
They look pretty similar to me too. I didn't realize and made a mistake.

675
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,290
I'm sorry, Doctor.

676
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:41,650
He said the water was all right

677
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,340
I'm embarrassed.

678
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,120
If you're done, you may leave, Doctor.

679
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,740
I didn't expect he would do that.

680
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,640
How humiliating.

681
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,690
It's all because of that damned chairman. Really.

682
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,560
What's the matter?

683
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,350
Your Honors, I will proceed with the interrogation of the next witness,

684
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:27,660
Jang Gi Hyeon, field manager of the wastewater purification facility.

685
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,320
Witness, you've worked at the wastewater purification facility for twelve years.

686
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,950
Prior to the embankment collapse, was there ever any problem there?

687
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,670
January 16th statement. "As far as I know, in the time I continuously managed plant 4 there was never any problem."

688
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,900
Witness? Didn't you already state that to the investigating agency?

689
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,680
Why aren't you answering my question?

690
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,950
Well, that is,

691
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,520
I have a lot on my mind.

692
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,440
- Witness—
- Manager Jeong!

693
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,750
- Defendant.
- Yes.

694
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,700
Please remain seated. Now.

695
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,530
I'm sorry.

696
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:08,650
- Please continue.
- Yes, Your Honor.

697
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,820
Actually, there's something I want to tell you.

698
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:17,200
- What is it—
- The wastewater has been leaking for some time now.

699
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,460
I still don't understand why the embankment which was intact for 30 years

700
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,460
suddenly collapsed that night,

701
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,530
but I what I am certain of the fact that wastewater was already leaking before.

702
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:31,530
It was such an important matter that I reported it to the chairman.

703
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,040
- Manager!
- Defendant.

704
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,730
Please return to you seat.

705
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:43,600
Witness, please speak comfortably.

706
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,750
The facility's deterioration due to age is serious.

707
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,920
I told the chairman we would have a major problem if we didn't do something immediately.

708
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,910
But the chairman replied "Why are you making a fuss when we are moving to Southeast Asia next year?"

709
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,100
- "Why are you making a mountain out of a molehill?"
- Manager Jeong!

710
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,890
Yes, what did you say when you heard him say that?

711
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:05,460
What if something happens to the elderly living in the village?

712
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,190
- If that happens—
- If that happens—

713
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,090
The chairman said,

714
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:15,910
"what does it matter for old people who have lived long enough?"

715
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,360
Manager Jeong, when did I ever say that?

716
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:23,250
What do you think about "lived long enough"?

717
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,330
Don't tell me that's what you said.

718
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,590
At the time, I thought,

719
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:36,390
Isn't that murder? Is he living disguised as a human being?

720
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,410
No. I really didn't. Your Honor.

721
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,190
I never said that.

722
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,360
That's murder.

723
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:49,220
My nickname is "Doctor Safety."

724
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:54,010
I've worked my whole life taking care of everything according to the safety manuals without a problem,

725
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,540
so I really want to die, Your Honor.

726
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,850
You were prepared, weren't you? You met the doctor.

727
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,890
I'd like to call Dr. Yu Jung Baek as a witness.

728
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,700
My nickname is Doctor Safety.

729
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,990
Guilty 86% Innocent 14%

730
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,360
- Damn!
- Wow!

731
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,490
Look at that S.O.B. Complete garbage. Don't you agree?

732
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,670
There's nothing more to watch. Sentence him to death.

733
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,330
He's got a lot of nerve.

734
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,760
- Let him off!
- Death penalty. Death penalty. Death Penalty.

735
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,470
Guilty 89%

736
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,840
Your Honor, that's not fair!

737
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,650
It's really, really, not. I never said anything like that.

738
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:38,190
Why would I say something like "those old people lived long enough"?

739
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,600
- You never said anything like that? Then what did you say?
- What?

740
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,060
You don't deny meeting the witness.

741
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,940
What did you say when you met the plant manager?

742
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,530
That is ...

743
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:56,880
Defendant. Please answer.

744
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,770
The whole country is watching.
 Guilty 91%

745
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:05,590
Because I ... I had a lot of work to do,

746
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:09,550
I can't remember the conversation, Your Honor.

747
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,390
No. Really, no. Your Honor.

748
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,690
I never said that.

749
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,300
No. No.

750
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,570
- Are you treating the public like fools now?
- That's not so.

751
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:25,190
What does "What does it matter to people who have lived long enough" mean exactly, Defendant?

752
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,370
No.

753
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,710
I'm blinded by my own money. I don't care if everyone else dies.

754
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:33,150
Do you know that is willful negligent homicide?

755
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,720
Chairman.

756
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,210
Occupational Negligence

757
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,720
I'm going to urge innocence, but if anything should go wrong,

758
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,730
then I will argue for death and injury by occupational negligence.

759
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:47,950
Do you understand, Defendant?

760
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,740
Guilty 95%
Occupational negligence negligence.

761
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,160
Guilty 96% Innocent 4%

762
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,800
I am sorry.

763
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:06,420
It's true I received a briefing.

764
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,230
Do you admit you received a report of the leak?

765
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:11,510
And that you didn't care if people in the vicinity died?

766
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,990
- That's not true.
- If it is.

767
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:18,150
What is this? That bastard Kang Yo Han! What the hell is he doing?

768
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:22,050
Please calm down, Minister. Judge Kang must be thinking of something.

769
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,070
What is he thinking?

770

Chief Judge.

If you plead guilty to murder with one or two lies from a witness,

790
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,420
this trial is a farce.

Don't worry. Parole isn't up to the judge. It's up to the Ministry of Justice.

That's not what I meant but I just meant the citizens are very interested in the trial, Judge.

I'm going to make a ruling.

816
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:55,570
I'm seriously accepting the opinion of the citizens who watched this trial.

817
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:59,160
I contemplated a lot but with the state of the evidence which was admitted

818
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,320
I concluded that it's unreasonable to decide he murdered willfully.

819
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,270
However, the defendant admitted to the indictment charges of death and injury by occupational negligence,

820
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:15,220
for which I pronounce him guilty.

821
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:19,770
The maximum penalty for death and injury by occupational negligence is five years.
