1
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,990
Ji Sung

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,360
Kim Min Jung

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,380
Jin Young

4
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,620
Park Gyu Young

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
NO JUSTICE

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,490
Devil Judge

7
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,560
This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea. All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional.

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,860
Do work that suits you.

9
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,450
I heard you were a maid originally?

10
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,590
Jeez, what a beggar-like...

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,820
Yes, Eonni?

12
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,790
Kang Yo Han leaked information about me to Cha Gyeong Hui.

13
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,600
- What did you say?
- Find out.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,940
Don't tell me Kang Yo Han—

15
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,740
Shut up and find out right now!

16
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,100
If you interfere with my work, you will pay the price.

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,930
It seems you've been working pretty hard to get where you are.

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,680
Will it be all right with you?

19
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,250
I'm going to kill him.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,690
Kang Yo Han, I'm going to rip you apart.

21
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,190
But isn't that too dangerous?
 Episode 11

22
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,360
You said she was an unpredictable person.

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,890
I told you. If the world's rulers are united, there's no way to do it.

24
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,710
We've secured Do Yeong Chun.

25
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,650
We'll use him to catch Cha Gyeong Hui first–

26
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,370
You want me to report it to the prosecution? Or tell the press?

27
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,950
Cha Gyeong Hui has files on the corruption of media owners.

28
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,680
It's impossible to take them down from the outside,

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,000
so we have no choice but to make them point the sword at each other.

30
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,640
And then what if the sword is turned towards you?

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,770
How can I win the game without betting anything on it?

32
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,080
Fortunately, there's at least one place that hurts

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,510
when a human being is stabbed.

34
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,410
For anyone.

35
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,700
Did you eat dinner?

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,470
How's Yeong Min?

37
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,850
Oh, he's the same today.

38
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,790
The wound's almost healed.

39
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,590
Even so...

40
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,190
Mom, let's go to the US.

41
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,380
I don't think I can live here.

42
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,590
Mom, it's because I'm scared.

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,980
Come with me, okay?

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,970
Get up.

45
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,560
- Mom.
- I said get up. Get up.

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,740
Can you not hear me?

47
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,350
Get up!

48
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,750
- You're such a weak bastard!
- Honey.

49
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,360
You didn't think to pay me back, and you want to escape?!

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,910
After you suffered this humiliation, how can you...

51
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,170
How can you be such a loser?

52
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,630
How far does Cha Gyeong Hui's knowledge extend?

53
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,900
I looked into it, but there's no connection between them.

54
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,150
They're like enemies, but did Cha Gyeong Hui hold hands with Kang Yo Han?

55
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,400
It can only be Kang Yo Han.

56
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,870
He put a knife in Cha Gyeong Hui's hands and stabbed me in the back.

57
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,880
There's something he's after.

58
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,390
Minister Cha Gyeong Hui

59
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,070
Yes, Minister?

60
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,920
Investigation report on unnatural death.

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,380
You hid it well. You must have spent a lot of money.

62
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,090
The mother, who beat her daughter when she was drunk,

63
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,010
happened to die after she fell down the stairs in a mountain village.

64
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,730
The security lights were off, and there was only one witness.

65
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,840
That child's tearful acting was so good

66
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,720
that the cops had no doubt she slipped while in a drunken state and the case was closed.

67
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,770
Well, I think that was enough material.

68
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,090
The only evidence that she was drunk was her daughter's statement.

69
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,340
What if a completely contradictory doctor's note pops up?

70
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,880
Saying there was no trace of alcohol in her body.

71
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,840
That it couldn't have happened without someone pushing her from behind.

72
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,670
There was no such note, but–

73
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,380
You still don't understand?

74
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,500
That's the truth. I made it to be the truth.

75
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,900
I just need something to stimulate the public's imagination.

76
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,360
You're definitely an expert.

77
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,350
Fabricated evidence and coercive investigation are the Minister's speciality.

78
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,240
Thank you for the compliment.

79
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,940
What do you want?

80
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,840
Kang You Han. Grab him and restore my son's honor.

81
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,720
Then I'll let you go.

82
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,540
It's a case where the trial is already done. How can I–

83
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,080
That's why I need someone like you.

84
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,560
Someone born and raised in dirty, muddy water, who would do anything to survive.

85
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,920
I'll give you a week. Bring me what I want.

86
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,790
- You're here, Young Master.
- How have you been?

87
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,920
Should I do the usual?

88
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,370
Yes.

89
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,520
Sounds good.

90
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,650
Hi, Young Master.

91
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,130
How did you get here?

92
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,250
What about Ajeossi?

93
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,990
Don't tell me you–

94
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,280
Don't get worked up. He's just sleeping for a moment.

95
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,280
What are you up to?

96
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,550
I just always wanted to do this once.

97
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,850
To make my young master look handsome.

98
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,300
If it's your wish.

99
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,110
By the way,

100
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,190
why did you do that?

101
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,990
What are you talking about?

102
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,460
I'm talking about you leaking my story to Cha Gyeong Hui.

103
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,750
Thanks to you, I'm in a lot of trouble.

104
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,660
Because I need you.

105
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,690
Do you mean it?

106
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,590
I need to catch Cha Gyeong Hui.

107
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm saying I wanted you to do that too.

108
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,090
So you put me in a corner?

109
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:09,000
You are a really bad man.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,220
You're shameless.

111
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,490
Isn't that why you like me? I'm like you.

112
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,460
It's irreversible anyway.

113
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,860
Now, as long as Cha Gyeong Hui is here,

114
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,410
you can't be free.

115
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,790
You should make a choice.

116
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,140
And what if I choose this blade?

117
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,900
There is nothing I can do.

118
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Do as you please.

119
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,790
Do you want to go to my house?

120
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,230
It's been awhile.

121
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,630
It will remind us of the old days and sounds like fun.

122
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,790
What are you thinking about?

123
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,580
Everything is the same.

124
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,400
You've changed.

125
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,520
Is that so?

126
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,810
How have I changed?

127
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,710
Chairwoman.

128
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,880
Welcome. I heard from the chief that he was going to invite you.

129
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,520
- Is that so?
- If you don't mind, let's have dinner together. It's dinner time.

130
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,220
Did Judge Kim really make all of this?

131
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,120
- Since I'm a freeloader here.

132
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,100
Your wounds would have healed by now, no?

133
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,930
I didn't know you had so many talents like this, Judge Kim.

134
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,390
I didn't know either, when I first met you,

135
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,460
that you had so many talents.

136
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,570
- Who is she?
- She's the head of the live court's support team.

137
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,450
But you've never brought a woman to this house. Are you two dating?

138
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,200
- Elijah.
- I'm honored. I guess I'm the first female guest.

139
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,550
You're dating her, right?

140
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,700
Shall we have dinner now?

141
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,890
- I asked if you're dating.
- No we're not.

142
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,730
She's someone who's helping the chief.

143
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,210
Please help him a lot from now on.

144
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,490
I don't know whether I'm capable of helping Judge Kang.

145
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,060
I heard from the chief that you are an essential person.

146
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,740
I'm flattered. Did Judge Kang really say that?

147
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,460
Why are you talking such nonsense, huh?

148
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,290
Let's just have dinner. You too.

149
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,400
Elijah, eat this first.

150
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,500
Judge Kim looks as if he's always been a member of this family.

151
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,250
You fit right in.

152
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,010
Oh, is that so?

153
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,730
You won't be lonely anymore.

154
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,750
I envy you.

155
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,590
Did you two know each other before?

156
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:03,100
We just support and cheer each other from behind, it's that kind of relationship.

157
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,320
Miss Elijah.

158
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,330
How does she know my name?

159
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,720
Shall we make a toast? We have an important guest.

160
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,120
- You can't.
- Then what shall I toast with?

161
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,130
You have juice.

162
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,210
Thank you. Here!

163
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,620
Wait a minute. It's time for someone to come.

164
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,930
What's the reason you asked me to come in the evening?

165
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,700
Oh, you had a guest.

166
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:47,160
To Chairman Jeong Seon Ah, who has returned to our home after a long time.

167
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,220
If it's Seo... Seon Ah...

168
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,820
Are you playing with me right now?!

169
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,330
Didn't you like it? I'm sorry to hear that.

170
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,730
I'm playing with you. You're fun.

171
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,790
You're smart, relentless, and as broken as I am.

172
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,870
That's very uncommon.

173
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,510
I was thinking it would be fun to play with you.

174
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,980
You suggested it first.

175
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,420
You told me to go to the top of the world,

176
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,190
with you.

177
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,610
Smile,

178
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,590
you fit pretty well in this house.

179
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,190
Will Jeong Seon Ah really take your hand?

180
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,510
Maybe she'll be on Cha Gyeong Hui's side. She's so unpredictable.

181
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,080
That's ridiculous. It's obvious it's a trick.

182
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,950
Right?

183
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Kang Yo Han, who does he think you are? He's messing with you like this?

184
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,150
- I can't believe it.
- Yes.

185
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,710
I know it's a trick, but

186
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,490
he doesn't even try to hide it.

187
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,730
So?

188
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,560
It's weird.

189
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,410
I want to be fooled.

190
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,450
Even if it's just for a short time.

191
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,710
Eonni!

192
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,850
I shouldn't, right? I knew it.

193
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,830
Oh Jin Ju

194
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,870
Yes, this is Judge Oh Jin Ju.

195
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,920
Yes, I know.

196
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,770
My name is Park Du Man, President of Saram Media Group.

197
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,190
Ah, hello.

198
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,980
I'm sorry to call you out of the blue.

199
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,920
I wanted to meet with you once at our Social Responsibility Foundation.

200
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,800
Do you mean all of us from the live court?

201
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,460
No, no. Judge Oh Jin Ju is the only one we want to meet.

202
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,960
Sure.

203
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,950
Is something wrong?

204
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,590
It's nothing.

205
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,910
Judge Oh, here you are.

206
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,860
Have a seat over there.

207
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,000
It's nice to meet you. I'm Oh Jin Ju.

208
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,360
I enjoyed the promotional video for the live trial.

209
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,440
You were meant for it. You did a great job.

210
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,960
- Thank you.
- Please help us with our foundation.

211
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,030
- If it's a foundation job–
- It's all work for the nation.

212
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,220
I need a face to deliver it to the public with confidence.

213
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,350
You are so great,

214
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:42,220
but there are a few things that are bothering me, so I asked you to come.

215
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm not sure I understand.

216
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,690
When you were in a trial in the province, you put the owner of a business under court custody.

217
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,260
Isn't a suspended sentence reasonable if someone spends some money from their own company?

218
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,750
Why were you do hard on him?

219
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,430
Do you have any anti-corporate sentiments?

220
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,520
Is this, by any chance, a job interview?

221
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,390
I don't think you're picking a model.

222
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,730
Is this an interview for the post of the presiding judge of the live court?

223
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,790
You're quick to understand too.

224
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,830
I would like to make you a national star,

225
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,730
but shouldn't we find out what the risks are?

226
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,390
Did you also put Judge Kang Yo Han through this?

227
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,460
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has also been here.

228
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,420
Don't you think this is the proper distance to hold a conversation?

229
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,720
What questions do you have about me?

230
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,590
- I'm really skilled–
- It's falling down. It's falling down. Oh! It's falling down. It's falling down.

231
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,290
Elijah, eat this.

232
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,880
Fall down. Fall down. Fall down. Fall down. Fall down.

233
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,690
Now it's Elijah's turn.

234
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,130
Oh, my! How are you going to do this?

235
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,220
I think it's going to fall.

236
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,640
You got it. You got it.
- It's.. fall...ing Eli... Ah!

237
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,970
Yes!

238
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,670
Chief, play with us... Chie... Chief.

239
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,920
Forget it. Yo Han doesn't play games like this.

240
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,160
Chief, you had something to say, didn't you?

241
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,650
Huh?

242
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,600
I was just passing by.

243
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,260
There's been something frightening about Kang Yo Han since then.

244
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,630
Is that so?

245
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,050
One time, I was playing with my friends and he was watching me in secret while mimicking me.

246
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,050
Someone win!

247
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,980
Someone win!

248
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,420
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Yeah!

249
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,690
Hey, don't you know how to put out paper? You idiot.

250
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,550
- Why are you so bad at this?
- Ah, try to do better.

251
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,530
I'm sorry.

252
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,130
Seriously. Do it right the next round.

253
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,840
It really creeped me out...

254
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,440
But Father ...

255
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,430
Yes?

256
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,220
Couldn't it be he actually wanted to hang out with friends?

257
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,530
Someone win!

258
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,830
Someone win!

259
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,970
What do you mean?

260
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,230
In fact,

261
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,510
wasn't that child very lonely?

262
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,430
- Chief.
- Yes?

263
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,120
Oh, did you make me sacrifice my reading time to do this?

264
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,820
I also have to do my assignments.

265
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,460
Then do them.

266
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,330
Come on, come on. Don't be like that and play some games with your family.

267
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,610
I have dishes left to do.

268
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,360
Ajumeoni, together–

269
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,000
It's not a good idea to have those two compete.

270
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,370
- Why not?
- I don't have enough time to read books as it is. Such a time waste.

271
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,720
Have you ever sat face to face with Elijah for more than five minutes? Without fighting?

272
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,240
Let's do it. Move over.

273
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,360
Try it.

274
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,380
Come on.

275
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,320
Do it. Hurry up and do it.

276
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,100
- Do I just do it?
- Can't you tell by looking at it?

277
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
What a idiot.

278
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,520
Hurry up and do it.

279
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,920
- Any of them?
- Just do it!

280
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,720
Then I'll take this.

281
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,960
Okay. Nice!

282
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,630
Elijah, what about stopping now...

283
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,170
It's shaking. It's shaking. It's shaking. It's shaking.

284
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,500
You need to know structural mechanics, all right?

285
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,160
They've been like that for two hours. Is it all right?

286
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,640
I told you to think about it twice, didn't I?

287
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,760
Thirty one.

288
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,830
Yes!

289
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,060
Yo Han.

290
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,200
Give me your hand.

291
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,290
Let's do it again, quickly. Stack it up, quickly. Quickly. Quickly.

292
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,670
Did something good happen to you recently?

293
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,510
You seem a bit different.

294
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,100
Of course something good is up. I'm with you.

295
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,770
You're scaring me. You're joking, right?

296
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,710
I'm not joking.

297
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,570
What is it, really?

298
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,940
Last time you rode your bike, but wanted to go on a walk.

299
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,950
And then you wanted to eat ice cream.

300
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,320
Do you have a terminal disease? Is it serious?

301
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,750
I'm not going to die. So let's just eat.

302
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,460
Yes sir!

303
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,370
Once this is over, I'll definitely...

304
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,480
This place is known to have great food.

305
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,030
Did you bring me the answer that I wanted to hear?

306
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,940
- The first button.
- The first button.

307
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,010
In your son's case, there are over 20 people who have testified as victims.

308
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,080
It will be hard to turn things around.

309
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,030
- It will be too noticeable too.
- So?

310
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,480
However, what if this case had the first button misaligned from the beginning?

311
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,440
If that happens then it'll make an overall bad impression. It's not pretty.

312
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,210
If, from that scenario

313
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,040
one or two more suspicious aspects are found,

314
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,870
what do you think will happen?

315
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:27,340
What was the intention of the judge, who passed a sentence for public flogging in a hasty trial?

316
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,880
That's not a bad title for an article.

317
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,060
So what's the first button*?

318
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,510
*Fasten the first button on the shirt wrongly = have a bad start

319
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,080
I'm sure you remember her.

320
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,280
The first button that changed the course of the trial.

321
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,700
That man is a total psycho.

322
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,750
He came out of the car, screaming that there was a traffic jam in the parking lot.

323
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:02,210
I was so startled that I went there. He slapped my face asking me who I was.

324
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,620
I was very angry and resentful.

325
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,950
Hey! You f**king cra...

326
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,530
You're the young lady who was very excited.

327
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,150
So what can she do for us?

328
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,730
I'll do everything. Please just help my mom.

329
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,810
She will state that Kang Yo Han gave her money to give a false testimony.

330
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,180
Is that true?

331
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,480
Is that important?

332
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:34,160
What's important is that we can make up the truth.

333
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,680
My mom's safe, right?

334
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,950
My mom has angina.

335
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,420
I let you hear her voice earlier.

336
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:52,520
That's not a bad story. Kang Yo Han bribed a witness.

337
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,290
There was also the case of Jang Gi Hyeon, but he got away with it.

338
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,820
If the same thing happens again, it'll turn the tides completely.

339
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,190
But will Kang Yo Han just quietly let it happen?

340
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:11,010
Don't give him time to respond, just pop it out of the blue in front of the whole nation.

341
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,550
Our Minister is very camera-friendly.

342
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,780
There was a critical tip that made me question

343
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,430
whether the live trial was being conducted fairly.

344
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,410
- What is it?
- Please tell us.

345
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,980
There is a risk of being unnecessarily misunderstood

346
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,010
as to whether I am revealing this because of my child.

347
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,270
I propose an immediate public hearing to Judge Kang Yo Han.

348
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,130
I will reveal everything in front of the citizens,

349
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,050
so if you can, give an explanation yourself,

350
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,140
at the live court show premises.

351
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,190
What do you mean by "explanation"?

352
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,080
Does it really have nothing to do with Lee Yeong Min?

353
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,030
Judge Kang Yo Han.

354
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,340
Live Court Judge Kang Yo Han's Public Hearing

355
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,270
You're well-known for being the heir to a great fortune.

356
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,590
Is that right?

357
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,350
Were you especially curious about that?

358
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,810
Yes, that's right.

359
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,000
Is that why you think everything in this world can be bought with money?

360
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,710
Please ask a more specific question.

361
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,410
It's the truth, Your Honor.

362
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,700
In the first trial, you gave

363
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,590
money to the Ju Chemical witness, right?

364
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,500
The matter has already been fully explained.

365
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,340
And then in the very next case, you gave money to the witness.

366
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,490
Doesn't that seem strange?

367
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,840
You were also demanding false testimony.

368
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,340
What you're saying is interesting.

369
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,600
On what grounds do you say that?

370
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,160
JU Chemical

371
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,200
Do you remember this person?

372
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,850
Live Court Judge Kang Yo Han's Public Hearing

373
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:29,980
I think you have a lot to say. Muster up the courage to say it.

374
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,790
Here, in front of the citizens of this country.

375
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,010
I am Han So Yeon,

376
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,970
who testified that I was assaulted by Lee Yeong Min.

377
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,360
I...

378
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,620
I was forced to make a false statement.

379
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,670
forced to make a false statement.

380
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,560
What on earth...

381
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,620
What?

382
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,600
Incredible!

383
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,100
There you go! That's it!

384
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,350
I told you your mom would do it.

385
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,490
Don't worry about anything. It's going to be all right.

386
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,200
[Lee Yeong Min' assault victim Miss Han, "I was forced to make a false statement.]

387
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,470
That's the truth.

388
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,580
I made it to be the truth.

389
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,780
I just need something to stimulate the public's imagination.

390
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,910
Live Court Judge Kang Yo Han's Public Hearing

391
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,330
Minister Cha Gyeong Hui over there, threatened me.

392
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,440
That if I don't say I received money from the judge to lie...

393
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,190
That if I don't say that here,

394
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,640
she said she'd put me in jail

395
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,300
for drug trafficking that I never did.

396
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,010
She said it's the easiest thing to make me into a criminal.

397
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,390
What are you talking about? How dare you lie like that!

398
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,150
That's what you did!

399
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,610
Is that true?

400
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,170
Yes. Last week in the Minister of Justice's office,

401
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,120
she personally said that to me.

402
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,660
If you look at the Ministry of Justice's visitor log, you'll find my name.

403
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,780
The first button

404
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,930
that changed the course of the trial.

405
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,460
There is no need to worry so much. I'll protect you.

406
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,200
Please wipe your tears with this.

407
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,940
We can make up the truth.

408
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,870
Don't give him time to respond, just pop it out of the blue in front of the whole nation.

409
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,810
This is fabricated testimony! This is a conspiracy to slander me.

410
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,780
Minister, you are the one who brought her here!

411
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:43,080
♫ I need something stronger ♫

412
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,910
Ms. Han says, "Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui ordered me to give a false statement"

413
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,420
Judge! Judge!

414
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,310
What exactly is going on?

415
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,390
Don't worry.

416
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,950
Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah told me to cooperate as much as possible,

417
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,990
but is that all right with the Minister?

418
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,670
It's going to be all right, isn't it?

419
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,500
There is something that I want to ask you too, Minister.

420
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,010
Do you remember this person? Let's take a look.

421
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:18,150
Do Yeong Chun, one of the greatest pyramid scheme con artists, is finally sentenced to 17 years in prison.

422
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,690
He's a con man who's been sentenced to 17 years in prison.

423
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,260
He must now be paying for his crime in prison, right, Minister?

424
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,820
Why are you asking me that?

425
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,100
Of course, he must be.

426
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,840
Is that so?

427
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,160
Why is someone who's supposed to be in prison here?

428
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,670
Is there something you know?

429
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,620
I'm not sure what kind of joke this is,

430
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,950
but this has nothing to do with me.

431
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,820
Is that so?

432
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,170
Please talk.

433
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,250
Minister, it's been a long time.

434
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:30,890
Cha Gyeong Hui received a large sum of money and took me out of prison.

435
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:36,630
No way!
Right now, someone random is serving the prison sentence instead of me.

436
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,580
Do Yeong Chun?

437
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,200
How is that man there?

438
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,160
- When did we ever meet?
- I knew this would happen!

439
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,620
Do you not remember?

440
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,950
What about Mom? What will happen to Mom?

441
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,020
- It'll be all right. It's all right.
- M-m-mom.

442
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,090
How dare you frame me with the words

443
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,310
of such a con artist?

444
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,200
This is a political attack on me!

445
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,640
The Prosecution will reveal the truth through an investigation!

446
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,010
Minister.

447
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,320
- Minister.
- Minister, is it true that you were censured?
- I'm sorry Minister but ...

448
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,060
- Please say something.
- Did someone order you to do this?

449
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,080
Minister, who is behind this?

450
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,020
Minister!

451
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,810
- Minister, who is behind this?
- Minister, please say something.

452
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:43,180
- Minister, can you say something?
- Minister, please say something.

453
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,840
Contact Kang Yo Han to set up a discrete meeting.

454
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,480
Yes.

455
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,780
And get me a pistol.

456
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,500
- What?
- Say it's for security measures, and find one.

457
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,470
Yes, I understand.

458
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,470
Minister, please say something.

459
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,370
Yes, Minister?

460
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,950
You're out of your mind. You dare stab me in the back?

461
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:29,140
That's right. It's going in smoothly.

462
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,160
You think I'll stand back like that? You just wait.

463
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,370
I'll reveal every single detail of your crimes.

464
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:41,680
I wonder... Do you think anyone will believe anything you say?

465
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,520
It seems as though you've become an icon of fabrications.

466
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,700
- What?
- That's why...

467
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:55,480
You should have treated her nicely. That petty secretary.

468
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,290
This crazy bitch!

469
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,030
Good job, thank you!

470
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,510
Su Hyeon.

471
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,690
Oh, Ga On. You saw Kang Yo Han caught Do Yeong Chun, right?

472
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,790
Yea, I just saw it being broadcasted.

473
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,690
Hey, but how can you be so nonchalant?

474
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,700
It's such a relief! Such good news.

475
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,630
Thinking about how much you went through.

476
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:27,540
I mean, but how the hell did Kang Yo Han know? How did he find Do Yeong Chun?

477
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,950
It all worked out in the end.

478
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,980
- It's all over, so let's forget about it, Su Hyeon.
- What are you talking about? It's just the beginning.

479
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:40,080
Ga On. I'll bring that woman Cha Gyeong Hui to court with my own hands.

480
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,690
No, well. I said it can't be done. Right now she's not here.

481
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,060
Goodbye.

482
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,240
Oh, Minister.

483
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,460
One of the detectives from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit keeps trying to force her way in.

484
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,120
Did you get what I asked for?

485
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,000
Yes. I'll bring it over.

486
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,480
Wow, in such a neighborhood, even if someone is killed,

487
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,550
no one would even know. Huh? It's also raining a lot.

488
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,500
What's this about?

489
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,020
Why the hell are you doing this to me?

490
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,820
Did I do anything wrong to you, Judge Kang?

491
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,780
Is it that old fire incident?

492
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,490
I'm a victim of that, too. What did I do so wrong? Huh?

493
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,850
Or is it the assemblyman you talked about before, the one who killed himself?

494
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,140
I did that because I was told to from above.

495
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,940
I was just trying to survive in the organization.

496
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,890
With no one having my back or supporting me!

497
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,620
Do you think I could have come all the way here without doing that?

498
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,340
All I have done is

499
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,080
fight to survive.

500
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,720
The self-pity of the powerful

501
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,190
is really hard to watch.

502
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,650
It makes me sick.

503
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,940
What did you say?

504
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:42,110
Fine. Do as you please.

505
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:45,560
You think you can catch me with one surprise show like that?

506
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,190
It won't be easy.

507
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:53,400
A formal investigation takes time. Somehow you'll find a scapegoat who deserves it, and frame him.

508
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,580
You'll say it's a frame up and a political battle.

509
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,610
That's your expertise.

510
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,890
Why did you start when you knew?

511
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,850
You know how to block an arrow or two, but

512
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,850
how can you block it if you have multiple shots flying at the same time?

513
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,350
It won't be easy.

514
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,360
We're just getting started.

515
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,090
Tell me what you want from me!

516
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,390
You set up a task force and

517
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,100
did a background check on Heo Jung Se and the Foundation directors, right?

518
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,900
Hand over these files to me.

519
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,210
If you do that, I'll at least let you live.

520
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,230
At least let me live?

521
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,830
Do you think I'm going to stand back and watch?

522
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,920
How dare you.

523
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,860
Is that so?

524
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,570
All right.

525
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,330
If you change your mind, let me know.

526
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,180
Honey, are you all right?

527
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,460
What do we do about this?

528
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,850
You're all over the news.

529
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,230
I'm sorry, Mom.

530
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,420
It's because of me.

531
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,120
I'm sorry I did this.

532
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,370
Both of you listen carefully.

533
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,240
Don't ever show weakness.

534
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,810
Only the weak will suffer.

535
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:06,770
I will clench my teeth and hang on till the end

536
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,540
and make them end up on their knees.

537
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,960
How did I get here?

538
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,400
That's right, Honey, you will get through this.

539
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,880
You are a strong person.

540
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,450
Sorry.

541
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,290
I know how hard you worked to get where you are.

542
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,280
I'm sorry.

543
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,700
Don't give her a break and push through.

544
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,990
She's someone that will abandon her child for her ambitions.

545
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,420
She won't give up easily.

546
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,520
Well, I'm glad I went through Cha Gyeong Hui's old investigation records.

547
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,560
Thank you, Judge Kim.

548
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,370
No. You had a hard time looking for each and every victim.

549
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:59,890
It's not over yet. Don't waste time on idle talk.

550
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,800
What about the prison warden of the prison? Is it settled?

551
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,820
Yes, I've scared him enough to do anything he's told.

552
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,360
I've also gave orders to Cha Gyeong Hui's secretary.

553
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,620
So that you can handle it quietly.

554
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:14,480
If this goes according to plan, she will end up falling apart.

555
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,750
At that moment, you have to reach out

556
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,280
so that she clings on to you to do anything to survive.

557
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,690
The Minister is here!

558
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,200
Minister, did you really switch out Do Yeong Chun?

559
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,800
What about coercing the false statement?

560
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,250
Minister, about Do Yeong Chun–

561
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,880
The truth will be revealed through the prosecution.

562
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,360
Minister, tell us the reason.

563
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,430
Minister, please say something!

564
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,740
- Minister!
- Minister!

565
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,310
Tell us the reason.

566
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,480
Please tell us the reason, Minister.

567
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,470
Minister, tell us the reason.

568
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,310
Your broadcast station is biting me the most relentlessly. Are you out of your mind?

569
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:12,560
Oh my, Minister. Do young reporters listen to their superiors these days?

570
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,840
I don't know if it's journalism or anything. It's killing me. Us too.

571
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,830
You son of a bitch.

572
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,480
Minister, we are in trouble.

573
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,520
What is it now?

574
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,600
Just a moment ago, the head of the Gyeongi Nambu Prison, began a declaration of conscience, in front of reporters,

575
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,260
regarding the replacement of Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui's infamous scammer.

576
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,860
Is it true that it was an order from the Minister of Justice?

577
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,610
It's true that it was an order from Minister Cha Gyeong Hui.

578
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,770
Is it true that you were bribed and threatened?

579
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,700
I'm sorry. I could not stand her threats.

580
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:53,810
That bastard. He said he'd do anything if I could get him promoted.

581
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,360
Minister, this is the Central District Attorney's call.

582
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,990
I think you need to show up at the District Attorney's Office.

583
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,360
- What is it?
- There have been twelve complaints filed.

584
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,430
The defendants of the cases you investigated and their families.

585
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,270
Threatening, coercion, consequential damages, abuse of authority.

586
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,870
It's not just one or two counts.

587
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:29,020
Chief Prosecutor Kim, have you forgotten who put you in that position? Huh?

588
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,420
I'm sorry, Minister.

589
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,010
I don't think this will be easily covered up.

590
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,500
Why don't you let matters run their course?

591
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,180
- Get the car ready.
- Where do you want to go?

592
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,570
To the Blue House.

593
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,530
Eat some. Don't you like snacks?

594
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,500
But how did this happen?

595
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,070
You're someone who was set to be moving into this house two years from now.

596
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:10,220
How the hell did you end up here?

597
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,520
My wife and I were very careful with the furniture and things like that,

598
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,650
keeping them without a scratch thinking of handing it to you.

599
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,400
I'll just get to the point.

600
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,380
No, no, no. Introduction, main point, conclusion, verse 1, verse 2, verse 3.

601
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,220
You can tell me everything. We're not going to see each other again anyway.

602
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:33,440
There's a file I have been collecting.

603
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,430
- File?
- Secret funds from the last presidential election.

604
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,710
As well as why the Gwanghwamun protests suddenly grew into a riot.

605
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:55,090
Wow, wow this is just... you're breaking the game, aren't you?

606
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:00,240
You think that someone who's going to be arrested right now can make such a big deal?

607
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,320
- I'm not saying I'll do it.
- Then?

608
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,730
I'm going to hand it over to Kang Yo Han.

609
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:18,030
If you don't like that, stop all this at any cost.

610
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,990
Whether it's mobilizing the National Intelligence Service, the military, or anything!

611
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,560
Wait a minute. All right, all right. Wow, our Cha Gyeong Hui is coming on strong.

612
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:30,120
But I have this weird handicap of being unable to make important decisions on my own.

613
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,790
Wait a minute. Honey! Hey, honey!

614
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,150
We have a guest.

615
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:45,550
Yeong Min's mom, what's going on between us?

616
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,970
What is this supposed to do?

617
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:51,480
So let's talk as parents from now on.

618
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,830
Yeong Min and our Jun Hui, they've been best friends since they were kids.

619
00:54:55,830 --> 00:55:00,630
Yes, Jun Hui was really worried about Yeong Min,

620
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,250
because he was so lonely and sensitive.

621
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,960
What are you trying to say?

622
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,750
Yeong Min's mother, did you know

623
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,910
that he's been on drugs since high school?

624
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,860
Drugs are hard to stop once you touch them, right?

625
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,320
I found that there isn't a single drug that Yeong Min hasn't taken.

626
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,790
He's been taking a ton.

627
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:42,330
Isn't that why he keeps going around doing crazy shit?

628
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,710
So what are you going to do with Yeong Min? Huh?

629
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,650
What do you mean what?

630
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:52,180
The Republic of Korea is a country of rule of law, so we must follow that. You know the law, don't you?

631
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,850
If he goes to prison, I think he'll be there for a long time. Will he be all right?

632
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:01,590
From since he was young, wasn't he a weak kid from head to toe?

633
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,710
I'm worried.

634
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,750
And since getting flogged thanks to his mom,

635
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,390
I heard he's become even more of a wimp.

636
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,180
All moms would feel the same.

637
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,850
One's self is the most important, isn't it?

638
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,800
Think about it carefully, Yeong Min's Mom.

639
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,040
Honey, look at this. The cup is about to break.

640
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,680
Let go. It's about to break.

641
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:37,230
Minister Cha, think rationally.

642
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,260
For your child's sake.

643
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,580
The conversation must not have gone well.

644
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,460
Who are you? Where's Secretary Kim?

645
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,480
Secretary Kim has quit.

646
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,930
Who the hell are you to be in my car?

647
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,490
I'm helping Judge Kang Yo Han.

648
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,900
This is your last chance, Minister.

649
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,360
Have you made up your mind?

650
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:35,220
Judge Kang Yo Han is the only one who can stop all of this.

651
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:47,170
But ... have I ever met you?

652
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,320
You look quite familiar.

653
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,470
You investigated Assemblyman Jo San.

654
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,000
Do you remember?

655
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,450
The one that committed suicide after being framed by you.

656
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,430
I was in middle school at that time.

657
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,470
Were you? Did he have a son?

658
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:38,620
You look a lot like your father.

659
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,120
Who is there?

660
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:15,170
I thought you might want to see me by now. Or not?

661
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:24,510
Because of Do Yeong Chun, the man you switched out,

662
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,550
I lost my parents.

663
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,750
I don't expect something like an apology or remorse.

664
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:41,210
Please cooperate so that we can capture the bigger criminals.

665
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:57,190
Are you saying you'll pardon me if I become a whistle-blower?

666
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,170
Is there any other way for you?

667
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:47,730
I want to consider it while I smoke this.

668
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:52,370
Could you step out for a moment?

669
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,500
Ministry of Justice

670
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,990
Let me check your ID.

671
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:34,510
I am Lieutenant Yun Su Hyeon of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

672
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,390
It's confirmed.

673
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,100
2nd Floor: Minister's Office

674
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,200
Under construction

675
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,620
Yeong Min,

676
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,330
come here.

677
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,300
Come on.

678
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:42,500
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry.

679
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,510
Yeong Min ...

680
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,780
Minister ...

681
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:44,330
We must hurry to find the files first.

682
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,980
Put your hands up and back away.

683
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,010
Kang Yo Han?

684
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:24,600
Just back away.

685
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,740
You, get up from there. Quickly get up.

686
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,830
S-Su Hyeon.

687
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,650
Devil Judge Preview
We thank actor Jeong Eun Pyo for his special appearence.

688
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:42,470
I want you to be lonely like me.

689
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,880
The lengths I am going to help you!

690
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,410
Please leave Ga On alone.

691
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:49,410
Please cut Yun Su Hyeon out of your life.

692
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:52,360
There still is a threat to the foundation.

693
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,030
As a Supreme Court Justice I am calling for disbanding of the people's court.

694
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,470
Let's move on with it.

695
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:59,170
He's attempting something big.

696
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,800
- Are you afraid?
- Does the fight right now feel like a joke?!

697
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,040
What are you doing?

698
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,140
You also have to go to rescue Judge Kim Ga On.

699
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,880
You can't!
