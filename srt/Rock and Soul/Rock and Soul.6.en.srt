1
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,000
Your mission is

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,360
to help free wandering spirits.

3
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,000
<i>He must still be worried about me</i>

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,160
<i>and wants someone to take care of me.</i>

5
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,800
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>I love you both so much.</i>

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,800
Hey, guys, look at this.

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,280
Huh?

9
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,680
Oh, I've seen that clip already.

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,800
No, look closely.

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,480
Someone took

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,720
all our social media clips
and edited them into a music video.

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,080
Let me see.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,960
Holy crap, that's amazing.

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,920
- Whoa, it actually is.
- Wow.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
So, does this mean
we actually have fans now?

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,440
- Of course we do, tons of them.
- Whoa.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,360
People keep messaging us,
asking when our next show is.

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
They missed the last one

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,840
but saw our clips online,

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,880
and now they really want to watch us live.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,880
- Yeah.
- Hey.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,720
So next time,
I'll get to perform too, right?

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,160
Definitely.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,600
Definitely?

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,320
What now? You're talking to…

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Alice? Or do you know other ghosts too?

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,040
It's Alice.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
It really is Alice!

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,360
- You're crazy.
- Oh.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,960
- Sorry.
- You scared me.

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,800
Stop freaking out about Alice.
I told you, she's not a ghost.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,480
Alice is just…

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,120
something wandering in between,

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,280
trying to find her way back.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
- Ah.
- Mm.

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
She hasn't gone back yet,
but she's still trying.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,880
Mm.

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,600
So you mean

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,560
Alice is here right now?

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,240
Yeah.

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,320
Hey, Alice,

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,440
what are the next lottery numbers?

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,360
Bam.

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,840
Take that.

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,680
What… what happened?

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Alice just flicked me?

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,600
She did. You were teasing her.

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,920
- Huh? Are you pranking me?
- What?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Try it. See for yourself.

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,080
- Seriously?
- Yeah, try it.

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,920
Hi, Alice.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,640
I just wanna ask

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,600
if the person I've been flirting with
will realize I like them?

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,040
Whoa, you're right.
I actually felt something.

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,600
Let's hit the practice room.
Exams are done. We should celebrate.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Celebrate again?

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,240
Yeah. Come on,
we need to blow off some steam. Let's go.

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>Another year's come around</i>
<i>My birthday without you</i>

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
<i>I go out and see people</i>
<i>But it's all the same</i>

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,480
<i>No one's like you</i>

62
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,120
<i>Back in my room, one-pound cake</i>

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,680
<i>Lighting the candles, making a wish</i>

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,240
<i>Like you taught me</i>

65
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,200
<i>Back then</i>

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,880
<i>There's only one wish I wanted to ask for</i>

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,520
<i>And it's the same one I'm still waiting on</i>

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,320
<i>I just want you here with me, like before</i>

69
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,120
<i>On my birthday this year</i>

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,360
<i>Could you come back to me?</i>

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,240
<i>Please hold me again</i>

72
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,200
<i>Like the days when we were in love</i>

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,360
<i>I'll keep waiting right here</i>

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,280
<i>Even though I know</i>
<i>You're never coming back</i>

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,560
I'm hungry.

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,800
Hey.

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,560
Who ate this?

78
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,080
You're the only one eating from that box.

79
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,440
I didn't touch it.

80
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,200
- Wow.
- And I even hid it behind this.

81
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
Behind the couch?

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
Nana, why'd you eat his food?
That was Bombay's.

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,400
Hey, stop fooling me.
I know you're just blaming Nana.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Quit whining, you stingy dude.

85
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Hey.

86
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,040
I get it now. You always joke about Alice.

87
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,160
I've got a way to prove

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,600
where Alice is.

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Ah.

90
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,120
Come on then.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
Alright.

92
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,040
Hey there, Bombay.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,120
Damn it. Look at him.

94
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,720
Punn keeps pranking me with ghost stuff.

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey. Bro.

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,360
Where's Alice?

97
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
I don't know.

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,960
- Maybe behind you?
- What?

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,440
- I didn't see her.
- Hey, I gotta go.

100
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,560
- Leaving already?
- Yeah, see you later.

101
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,480
- What?
- See you.

102
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
What the hell? Just gonna leave?

103
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,120
Anyway, should we head home too?

104
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,000
It's late already.

105
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,240
I'm tired now. I worked all day
then came here to practice.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are you alright?

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,360
Whoa, bro. Of course I'm alright.

108
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,760
And you? Are you alright?

109
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
No.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
- Are you alright, Bombay?
- Let's go… Hey!

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,480
Let's go home, go home, go home.

112
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,920
What are you doing, Alice?

113
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,800
Editing together
the behind-the-scenes rehearsal clips.

114
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,640
Oh, nice.

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,920
You can shoot with your phone too.

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Next time, just set up the tripod with it.

117
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,360
Good idea. Once the band gets popular,

118
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,200
we'll have clips ready to send to pages.

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,360
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,600
Aren't you sleepy, though?

121
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,200
I wanted to sleep,

122
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,840
but every time I closed my eyes,
I kept waking up.

123
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,680
It must be nice
having more than 24 hours in a day.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
Not really. I want to rest too.

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,760
Well, the other Alice
is sleeping for you already.

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,960
But this Alice wants to sleep too.

127
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,160
So… don't you wanna go home sometimes?

128
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,640
I'd like to,

129
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,160
but maybe not too often.

130
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,400
Whenever I go back and see Mom sad,
it just makes me sad too.

131
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,440
Honestly, I used to think

132
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,680
she didn't love me

133
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,880
because she was always pressuring me.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
But I finally realized

135
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,560
how much she really loved me.

136
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,400
She probably just forgot that

137
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
I have my own life too.

138
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,400
- I'm sleepy, I'll go to bed now.
- Wait.

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,040
You asked if I wanted to go home.

140
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Did I annoy you?

141
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,720
You did.

142
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,160
Maybe a little. I'm going to bed.

143
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,800
No.

144
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,440
You're lying.

145
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,120
Your favorite shirt is now clean again.

146
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,200
I'll keep your shirt with me, Mom.

147
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,080
<i>On my birthday this year</i>

148
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,840
<i>Could you come back to me?</i>

149
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,760
<i>Please hold me again</i>

150
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,800
<i>Ha…</i>

151
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,120
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

152
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,360
<i>I'll keep waiting right here</i>

153
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,720
<i>Even though I know</i>
<i>You're never coming back</i>

154
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,320
Let's go. I'm hungry.

155
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,720
There's a noodle shop down the street.

156
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Wanna go eat there? What?

157
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
Joe.

158
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,040
Nana, let's go get noodles.

159
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,240
ALICE'S SONG

160
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
- Then hurry up and pack your stuff.
- Alright, let's go.

161
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
What about you, Punn?

162
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
What?

163
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,440
- Noodles. You coming?
- I don't know, maybe.

164
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,360
What was that?

165
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,960
Then…

166
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,680
- I'll head home.
- Hey, Nana!

167
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,800
- Well…
- What's wrong, Alice?

168
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,120
- What did you run from?
- I…

169
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,520
I followed Joey

170
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,160
and I found out where he's been going

171
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,160
and why he's been acting so strange.

172
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,480
So Joey might have been
attacked by a spirit?

173
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,840
That's what I think because
it doesn't seem like a good spirit.

174
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,840
Look at him lately. He's changed so much.

175
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,440
He's quieter, sadder.

176
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,560
And he wears black every day.

177
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,080
He used to love wearing bright colors.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,800
So how do we help Joey?

179
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,120
What's with him?

180
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,080
- Come on, Punn, let's go.
- What's with him?

181
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Where did Joey go?

182
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,120
Yeah. But

183
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,400
- this is the right place, isn't it?
- Of course.

184
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,440
How could I forget?
The sign says "Cake Me."

185
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,320
Hey, Punn's talking to Alice, right?

186
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,760
Probably.

187
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
Then that means

188
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,800
the one who's been
following Joey every night

189
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,960
must be Alice.

190
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,520
Hey, where are you two going?!

191
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
We haven't even found Joey yet!

192
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,280
Punn.

193
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,960
I think they just saw me.

194
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,840
What do you mean?

195
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,160
I mean they both

196
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,560
saw me through the glass.

197
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,920
So…

198
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,160
everyone can see me
through the reflection, right?

199
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,120
Seems like it.

200
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,840
- Hey, what are you waiting for?
- What are you doing?

201
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
Waiting for us to bully you?

202
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,440
Huh?

203
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,680
- Hey.
- Take this.

204
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,360
Ha, missed me. Take that.

205
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,280
- Hey.
- If you don't want this, buy us snacks.

206
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,800
- Hurry up. Come on
- Alright.

207
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
Hey, stop.

208
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,280
If you don't quit it, you'll regret it.
I'll punch every single one of you.

209
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,680
Then I'll tell the teacher too.

210
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,640
And I'll call all your parents

211
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,200
and tell them everything. Go.

212
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,400
- Fine, we're out.
- Go.

213
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't worry about them.

214
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,040
Drink lots of milk.

215
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,600
Exercise every day, run often.

216
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,480
You'll grow taller soon
and no one will bully you again

217
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,200
If they do, come tell me.

218
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm in Grade Seven.
I'll handle them for you.

219
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,560
Don't be scared
and don't forget what I told you.

220
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
Thank you.

221
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,520
Will Nike remember me?

222
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,640
And why does he go
to that café every night?

223
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,320
Could it be that
Bombay and Nana have both had encounters

224
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
with ghosts or spirits before?

225
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,440
So they have a sort of link
to the other side.

226
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,600
That's why they can see you.

227
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,960
So basically

228
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,840
because Bombay and Nana

229
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,800
have seen ghosts, they can see me?

230
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,760
But I'm a spirit. I'm not dead yet.

231
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,360
Sorry. But still,

232
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,200
I've been able to see ghosts
for a long time and I can see you too.

233
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,520
That's true.

234
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,880
Let's test it with Joey then.

235
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I'll message him
to rehearse early tomorrow.

236
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,600
Let's talk to him directly.

237
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,960
But what if it's like with Bombay?

238
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,600
Back then,

239
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,960
we couldn't talk to him properly either.

240
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,840
He was possessed.

241
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,480
The more we talked,
the less sense he made.

242
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,920
We have to try anyway.
Well, I'll text him first.

243
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,080
He hasn't read any messages.

244
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,240
He's been like that since last night.
Where's Joey?

245
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,480
- You tell him.
- No, you.

246
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,000
Who brought this mirror?

247
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,920
- You.
- You.

248
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
What?

249
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,880
Tell me who brought this mirror in.

250
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,920
Nana and I bought it together.

251
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah, we decided

252
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,960
since we can see Alice through mirrors,

253
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,520
when we have meetings here,

254
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,200
we should be able to see

255
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,600
where she is, what face she's making,
what she's thinking.

256
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,160
You think it's a good idea?

257
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,520
Yeah, that's good.

258
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,480
Mm.

259
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,280
Even if we can't hear Alice,

260
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,320
at least we'll know
another member's here with us.

261
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
And you know what?

262
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,320
Even if we can't hear her comments,

263
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,560
her expressions don't lie.

264
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,160
Yes. Alice, now we can all see you.

265
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,000
I talked to Alice last night too.

266
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,440
We were wondering why you guys
can see her through reflections.

267
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,160
And we figured that

268
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
maybe because you've both
experienced spirits before.

269
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,480
That's why you can see her now.

270
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,720
I did some research too.

271
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,000
From where? Tell them.

272
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,320
A comic book.

273
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,560
I read it. It says

274
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
mirrors can act

275
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,760
as gateways to another dimension.
That's how we can see Alice.

276
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,400
There's Thai folklore too, you know.

277
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,200
When I was a kid, my grandma told me

278
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,560
if you want to see your soulmate,

279
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,640
look into a mirror on the full moon night

280
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,920
and light a candle while calling for them.

281
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
Turns out my grandma saw…

282
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,400
Her soulmate?

283
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,720
A ghost!

284
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,720
What was that?

285
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,680
That was scary.
If it were me, I wouldn't tell this story.

286
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,040
What the heck?

287
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,560
Alice.

288
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

289
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,400
Hello, Alice.

290
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
Hey, no!

291
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,880
Damn it, how do I open this?

292
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,680
Hey.

293
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,480
- Punn.
- Punn.

294
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,520
- Punn.
- Punn.

295
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
Hey, Punn.

296
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,680
- Punn. Punn.
- Punn.

297
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,880
- Punn. Punn.
- Punn.

298
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,240
- Hey, Punn.
- Punn.

299
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,960
- Wake up.
- Hey.

300
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,240
What did you do to me?

301
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,080
Get up.

302
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,720
Joey…

303
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,160
- Joe. Joey!
- Let her go.

304
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,560
- Hey, Joey.
- Let her go!

305
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,240
- Let go.
- Joe, let go.

306
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,280
- Joe!
- Joe.

307
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Let her go.

308
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,560
Karn!

309
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,080
Well…

310
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,360
I think with this mission you gave me,

311
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,960
I might actually end up dying.

312
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,280
And who forced you?

313
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,400
You all chose this yourselves.

314
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,160
Yeah, but

315
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,560
if something really bad happens,

316
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,200
and I'm not supposed to die yet,

317
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,720
how do I survive that?

318
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Then I'll help you.

319
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,400
But only this once, okay?

320
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,480
How?

321
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,040
Call my name.

322
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
<i>Karn!</i>

323
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,400
Who are you?

324
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,040
What are you going to do to him?

325
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
Then tell me.

326
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,760
Why is this spirit

327
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,200
still lingering here
and not going anywhere?

328
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,160
He's waiting for someone.

329
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,600
That's why he's not ready to leave.

330
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,240
I've looked into it.

331
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,240
And every time
his spiritual energy starts fading,

332
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,800
he has to find another source
of energy to replace it

333
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,920
so he can stay long enough
to see that person.

334
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
What?

335
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I'VE BEEN WAITING

336
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,120
What?

337
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
ARE YOU ALMOST HERE?

338
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,200
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA TAKE?

339
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,360
Damn it.

340
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,080
- Is it good, dear? Still hot.
- It's good.

341
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,120
Nike?

342
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,080
Where are you off to?
Eat some porridge first.

343
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,680
It's your favorite, still warm.

344
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,680
Come.

345
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,840
Eat first, then go where you need to.

346
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,680
Nike, what's wrong, son?

347
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,520
You look restless. Did something happen?

348
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,760
He has an appointment with a friend, dear.

349
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,480
A friend?

350
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,120
And who's more important?
Your dad or your friends?

351
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,320
I barely come home.
You might not even see me again.

352
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,200
Hey, don't say things like that.

353
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,040
Nike.

354
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,160
Eat it. Your dad went out of his way
to buy this porridge.

355
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,160
- Yes, Mom.
- Alright.

356
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,160
Hm, this porridge.

357
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,560
Where's it from, dear? It's good.

358
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,400
The same old guy.

359
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,240
The one who sells all night
at the corner near our alley.

360
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
- He's still there?
- Yes.

361
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
- Wow.
- It's still good.

362
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,160
- His cooking never disappoints.
- So,

363
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,040
since I've been working upcountry,
you haven't bought from him at all?

364
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,240
It's not on my way.

365
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
- Dear. Nike.
- Hm?

366
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,240
I have something important to tell you.

367
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,680
- What is it?
- Uh.

368
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,040
It's about work. Next month,

369
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,000
I won't be stationed upcountry anymore.

370
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
I'm moving back to Bangkok.

371
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,720
Looks like

372
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,240
I'll be staying here long term this time.

373
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

374
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,840
If you'd moved back to Bangkok

375
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
when I was still a kid,
that would've been nice.

376
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,640
Hey, Nike.

377
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,800
Why would you say that?

378
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,240
You're meeting Peem, right?

379
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,000
Hm?

380
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
- Go on then.
- Ah.

381
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,920
I'll get going now, I've finished eating.

382
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,400
- Alright.
- Why are you always in such a rush?

383
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,520
Ah.

384
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,240
Come on, dear.

385
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,200
He's eaten already. Let him go.
It's his birthday today.

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,680
Birthday, huh? Nice.

387
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,160
Instead of spending it with his parents,
he'd rather be celebrating with friends.

388
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,960
If I'd known you were coming home tonight,
I wouldn't have made plans with my friend.

389
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,880
You never even remember
my birthday anyway.

390
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,520
Nike. Nike.

391
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,840
- Uh.
- Hey, this boy…

392
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,920
Let him be, he's just a teenager.

393
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,800
You always spoil him.

394
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,640
- Oh?
- He's spoiled.

395
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
And why would he think
I forgot his birthday?

396
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,040
Here.

397
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,200
I actually bought this to surprise him.

398
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,960
I rushed back as fast as I could.

399
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,120
I didn't want to miss midnight
in case he went to bed early.

400
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,600
Alright.

401
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,160
I'll give you all time to sort this out

402
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,560
until the day after tomorrow.

403
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,320
Did you find anything?

404
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,200
I found his old Facebook account.
Now I'm checking his Instagram.

405
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,000
There should be a photo of his partner.

406
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,240
Found it. This must be the one.

407
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,400
Mm.

408
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,040
Let's go tomorrow morning.

409
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,480
Mm.

410
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,600
Uh, hello.

411
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,880
The studio just opened,

412
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,040
so we haven't finished
setting things up yet.

413
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,880
You're Peem, right?

414
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,440
Yeah, that's me.

415
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,000
How do you know my name?

416
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,000
Do we know each other?

417
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,600
No, but…

418
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,480
I know Nike.

419
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,920
Peem.

420
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,560
Could you please go
see Nike one more time?

421
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,800
He really wants to see you.

422
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,720
He's so sorry.

423
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,760
Could you give him a chance
to apologize to you again?

424
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,600
Are you crazy?

425
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,240
He's been dead for years.

426
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,760
Stop saying that name.

427
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,320
I don't want to hear it again.

428
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,280
And more importantly,

429
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,800
he's been dead to me for a long time.

430
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,080
Even though he's dead,

431
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,280
he hasn't gone anywhere.

432
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,400
Peem.

433
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,040
Did you ever love Nike?

434
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
If you did,

435
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,360
could you go see him?

436
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,920
His birthday's coming soon.

437
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,960
He's waiting for you
to blow out the candles with him

438
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,880
at the same café as four years ago.

439
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,760
The night he had that accident

440
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,200
and died.

441
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,720
Get out of here, you mental kids!

442
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,800
Get out!

443
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,400
Do you even know

444
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,840
how much Nike loved you?

445
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,520
He went to that same café
every single day,

446
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,159
until the place went out of business.

447
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,679
Joey.

448
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,800
Hey.

449
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,320
Tomorrow's Nike's birthday.

450
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,960
Please don't forget to come.

451
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,760
He's still waiting for you.

452
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,280
What's wrong, Alice?

453
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,960
Nothing.

454
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,760
Come on, I can tell. What's up?

455
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,640
Punn, when did you meet Karn?

456
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,320
Why didn't I know anything about it?

457
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,960
Why? What are you wondering about?

458
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,160
We're together almost all the time.

459
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,560
When did you two get close? And besides,

460
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,720
you said something that day that sounded
like you were working for him,

461
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,080
like you were
his subordinate or something.

462
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,800
I met him in a dream.
You don't sleep, so you wouldn't know.

463
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,880
Stop joking. I'm serious.

464
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm not joking.

465
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,800
Let's change the subject.

466
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,160
Do you think Peem will come
for Nike's birthday.

467
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,120
Maybe. I saw him crying.

468
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,080
Strange, isn't it?

469
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,360
It happens to be the day we're
performing on the main stage at Siam.

470
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,600
Do you think Joey will be able to focus?

471
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,800
Yeah…

472
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,920
<i>Too bad we didn't have</i>
<i>a chance to meet again.</i>

473
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,200
<i>But when we finally did,</i>
<i>you were already gone.</i>

474
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,000
<i>There's so much I wanted to thank you for.</i>

475
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,520
<i>Another year's come around</i>
<i>My birthday without you</i>

476
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,080
<i>I go out and see people</i>
<i>But it's all the same, no one's like you</i>

477
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,640
<i>Back in my room, one-pound cake</i>

478
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,000
<i>Lighting the candles, making a wish</i>

479
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,000
<i>Like you taught me</i>

480
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,680
<i>Back then</i>

481
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,560
<i>There's only one wish I wanted to ask for</i>

482
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,480
<i>And it's the same one I'm still waiting on</i>

483
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,720
<i>I just want you here with me, like before</i>

484
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,560
<i>On my birthday this year</i>

485
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,600
<i>Could you come back to me?</i>

486
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,680
<i>Please hold me again</i>

487
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,560
<i>Like the days when we were in love</i>

488
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,600
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

489
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,280
- <i>I'll keep waiting right here…</i>
- Aren't you scared standing close to me?

490
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,600
<i>Even though</i>

491
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,560
<i>- I know…</i>
- Do I have to be?

492
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,960
<i>You're never coming back</i>

493
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,360
How do you think tonight's story will end?

494
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,400
Happy birthday.

495
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,560
I'm sorry.

496
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,080
I'm really sorry.

497
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,200
I was such an idiot,

498
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,640
doing something
so meaningless on my birthday,

499
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,080
while the person
who matters most was waiting.

500
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Uh,

501
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,360
you did actually come that day,

502
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,200
just a little too late.

503
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,880
I miss you.

504
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,240
I miss you too.

505
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,720
I miss you so much.

506
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,840
I've been waiting for years
to celebrate this with you.

507
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,760
From now on,

508
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,760
we can celebrate together forever.

509
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,840
- Hey, check out this news.
- Huh?

510
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,240
- There was a car accident, one dead.
- Huh?

511
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,080
Does it say who died?

512
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,640
You know who, right?

513
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,600
Maybe it wasn't an accident after all.

514
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,720
Wanna grab a late-night coffee?

515
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,360
<i>There's a junior band</i>
<i>coming from out of town.</i>

516
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,920
But I don't want him to come.

517
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,520
Why not?

518
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,720
Because if he comes,

519
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,400
he might die.

520
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,120
You don't have the right to decide
who's good enough or not.

521
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,280
You're not the one making the selection.

522
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,320
Fine, I'm leaving.

523
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,400
Stop!

524
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,240
