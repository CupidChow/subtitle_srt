1
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,800
Wut,

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,360
your girlfriend's here.

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,000
Jinny.

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,560
Wut,

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,240
stop.

6
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,640
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,960
I slept with another man.

8
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,319
I'm carrying his child.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
Jinny!

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,440
Jinny!

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,880
Wut!

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,920
That's not true.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
That's not true.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,440
That's not true!

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,440
Wut, stop.

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Stop right now. What are you doing?

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
Don't hurt my child.

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,480
If you're upset with me,

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,360
then take it out on me.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No.

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't hurt him.

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,840
It's not his fault.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,280
He's innocent.

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't hurt him. He's your son.

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,640
No.

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,680
You said you cheated on me.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,240
So how could he be mine? Stop lying.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,160
Because you're like this.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
When you lose your temper,

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
you hurt me.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,800
I endured it all because I loved you.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,640
But back then, I couldn't take it anymore.

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
I wanted to end things,
but you wouldn't let me.

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,760
The only way you'd ever let me go

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,040
was if I told you I was pregnant,

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,000
if I told you I cheated, so I made it up.

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,880
But I actually got pregnant
with your child. Do you understand now?

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Then why didn't you come back to me?

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,240
Why did you leave me? Why?!

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Because I didn't know if you could
take care of me and our child.

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,280
I came back secretly to check on you.

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,960
All I saw was you
getting drunk all the time,

43
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,240
<i>no job, no direction.</i>

44
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,680
<i>So why would I ever come back to you?!</i>

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,120
And how do I know that's really my child?

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,760
What if you're lying?

47
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,760
If you don't believe me,

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,640
just look at his face.

49
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,040
Look closely and
you'll see how much he looks like you.

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,920
Look.

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,040
Then you'll know whether I'm lying or not.

52
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,320
He's really my child?

53
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,720
Do you know

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
how hard it's been

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,920
to carry and raise a child alone?

56
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
But I made my choice.

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,880
No matter how hard it got,

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,720
I decided never to go back to you.

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,480
Have you even looked at yourself,

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,800
at how terrible you were?

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,600
I couldn't let my child grow up
with a father like that.

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,640
So I promised myself
I'd raise her the best I could

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,760
on my own.

64
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm a mess.

65
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm a failure. I'm sorry.

66
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm sorry I wasn't a good boyfriend.

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm sorry I wasn't a good father.
I'm sorry I…

68
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,560
I'm sorry too.

69
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Sorry I never gave you
a chance to make things right.

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,760
Sorry I never told you honestly
what I really wanted.

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
It's my fault too.

72
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm sorry, Wut.

73
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,680
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

74
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,240
Maybe I really didn't deserve you.

75
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Please…

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
forgive me for everything.

77
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,480
Dad.

78
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,800
Go to Mom.

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,440
Alright?

80
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,400
Have a safe journey, Wut.

81
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
Goodbye.

82
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,800
Hearing their story,

83
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,040
it's hard not to feel sad, right?

84
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
Mm.

85
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
If he could really turn back time,

86
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I think Wut would've tried to be better,

87
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,240
studied harder, worked harder.

88
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,640
And if Jinny had seen that,

89
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,880
maybe she'd have gone back to him.

90
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,720
They could've been a family again.

91
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,120
True. If things had gone differently,
Wut would probably be happy by now.

92
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,840
But it's between the two of them.

93
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,880
We're outsiders.

94
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
We can't ever
really understand everything.

95
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,280
- Wow.
- No matter what,

96
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,520
we have no right to judge them anyway.

97
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,400
Look at you, talking like an old man.

98
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,360
An old wise man who's been through a lot.

99
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm not old.

100
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,840
So, that means

101
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
the mission

102
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,760
is complete?

103
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,400
I think so. Right?

104
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,799
Then that means you will wake up, right?

105
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,520
I don't know.

106
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,720
But I really want to.

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,520
Yeah, me too.

108
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm starting to get hungry.

109
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,640
Wanna grab something to eat?

110
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Mm.

111
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,080
That place over there's still open.

112
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Let's check it out.

113
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,200
Do they only sell coffee?

114
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
But at night?

115
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,600
They probably serve food too.

116
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
Let's look at the menu.

117
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,520
Let's see.

118
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,000
Uh, excuse me?

119
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
Anyone here?

120
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,840
No.

121
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,760
Only coffee here.

122
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Have a seat.

123
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
So,

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
how was your first mission? Fun?

125
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,280
Did you learn anything

126
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,440
from what I made you do?

127
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,440
Well…

128
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
not really.

129
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
I hope their story

130
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,160
helps you understand
what life really means.

131
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Everything that happens

132
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,760
has its reasons.

133
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,080
So whatever decisions you make,

134
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,040
you must be ready
to face the consequences.

135
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,880
And remember, a second chance

136
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
never comes easily.

137
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,040
But,

138
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,040
we completed the mission.

139
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,320
That means Alice can
go back to her body now, right?

140
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,120
Not yet.

141
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,480
Why are you sitting here?

142
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
Why not?

143
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,640
There are plenty of other tables.

144
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
Or you want me to sit even closer?

145
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,640
Hey, what's this?

146
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
- Even closer?
- Nana.

147
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
- Nana, move away.
- What?

148
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,400
- Hey.
- This close?

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,800
- What's this, Nana?
- No, no.

150
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,160
- Hey.
- Why? Are you shy?

151
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,120
- I'm not.
- What?

152
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,520
- Shy much?
- She leans in out of nowhere.

153
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,520
Nana.

154
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,760
- What?
- Back off.

155
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,000
- Why?
- He's blushing.

156
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
He can't even eat now.

157
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,400
- Aw, blushing, huh?
- Hm.

158
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,640
- Nana, seriously. Let's not do this.
- He's broken.

159
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,960
Are you actually blushing?

160
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,400
- Nana, seriously.
- Shy?

161
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
No. Back off.

162
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Get off me.

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,400
- He's shy.
- Yeah, Punn likes it

164
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,520
- What?
- this way.

165
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,760
- You ruined the fun.
- Is this PunnNana couple?

166
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,160
Aah.

167
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,200
Want a bite?

168
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,120
Can I eat it instead?

169
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,200
Nana, no.

170
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
- Come on.
- Hey.

171
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
- Why?
- I feel like

172
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
the wind passes through my arm.

173
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,440
<i>I think of it every day</i>

174
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,640
<i>Every night</i>

175
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,440
<i>Wondering if someday</i>

176
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,440
<i>I'll be forgotten</i>

177
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,040
<i>We talk less</i>

178
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,280
<i>And less each day</i>

179
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
<i>Why have you</i>

180
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,720
<i>Changed so much?</i>

181
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,680
<i>I think, but I can't reach you</i>

182
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,240
<i>Think, think, but never reach you</i>

183
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,320
<i>I think, but I can't reach you</i>

184
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,280
<i>Think, think, but never reach you</i>

185
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,320
<i>Do you even know</i>

186
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,480
<i>Someone's suffering over you?</i>

187
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,760
<i>I just want to know</i>

188
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,600
<i>If our longing</i>

189
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,640
<i>Feels the same</i>

190
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,200
<i>Tell me truly</i>

191
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,560
<i>Has your heart changed?</i>

192
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,240
<i>It's not just me imagining</i>

193
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,520
<i>Right?</i>

194
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,640
<i>All the feelings I've been</i>

195
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,680
<i>Sending your way</i>

196
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,480
<i>They never reached you at all…</i>

197
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,160
Are you hungry?

198
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
Here.

199
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,960
Who'd you make that for?

200
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
Just

201
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,800
for someone passing by.

202
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,440
- Punn.
- Hm?

203
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,800
I'll show you something.

204
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,280
What is it?

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,640
How did you do that?

206
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,200
I just tried things.

207
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,320
Remember the other day

208
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
when I managed to push Joey?

209
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,960
Whoa, that's awesome.

210
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,480
Here you go.

211
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
So can you eat food now?

212
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,280
No, I can't. Just eat spiritually.

213
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,280
But when you cook for me,
it feels like I've eaten already.

214
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,520
Perfect. You've eaten,

215
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,680
so you can do the dishes, right?
I cooked for you.

216
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,440
Just kidding.

217
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,520
I'm full now.

218
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
Already?

219
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,280
<i>It's been so long since we met</i>
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

220
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,160
<i>It's been so long since we met</i>
<i>Do you still think of me?</i>

221
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,240
<i>Whoa-oh-oh, how much I miss you</i>

222
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,240
<i>I don't know what's on your mind</i>

223
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,040
<i>But I miss you like crazy</i>

224
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
It's not working.

225
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Hm.

226
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
<i>Where's Nana gone?</i>

227
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,120
She's skipped practice for days.

228
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,680
I've messaged her a bunch,

229
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,040
no reply, not read.

230
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,840
You think we'll even be ready?
The show's coming up soon.

231
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,120
And you. You're the band leader.

232
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
Don't you care about your members?

233
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,920
We'll ask her

234
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,600
when we see her at school.

235
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,880
She didn't come today either.

236
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,720
- How do you know?
- Well.

237
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,600
She always eats with us.

238
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,000
Maybe she went with other friends.
You think she doesn't have any?

239
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,480
Don't know.
I've never seen her with anyone.

240
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,319
When she auditioned for our band,

241
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,040
that was the first time
I saw her at school.

242
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,880
Maybe she just transferred recently.

243
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,520
Ugh.

244
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,520
Stop arguing back and forth.

245
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,240
What's with you, Joey?

246
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,160
You're always talking to Nana.

247
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,480
You don't know what's going on with her?

248
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,200
No idea.

249
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,040
Hm.

250
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,640
BOMBAY: DOES ANYONE KNOW NANA?

251
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,240
What? This is mine now.

252
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,440
You're just eating too slowly. I got it.

253
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
- It's good.
- You care more about food.

254
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,640
Can you help me check her posts instead?

255
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,160
- What?
- Here.

256
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,720
Alright.

257
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,040
You're just not popular.

258
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,880
Fine,

259
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,480
- you do it then.
- I can't.

260
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,240
All my girls will misunderstand.

261
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,640
Nonsense.

262
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,880
BAS: SHE'S ALWAYS WITH YOU GUYS.
ISN'T SHE YOUR FRIEND?

263
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,920
- Isn't it weird?
- I don't know.

264
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,320
<i>Hello.</i>

265
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

266
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,080
Um, I came to ask about a student.

267
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,080
She hasn't come to class for several days.

268
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
- Mm.
- Can we know her address?

269
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,040
Her name's Nana.

270
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,960
We'll need her full name,
class, and grade, please.

271
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,360
You know that?

272
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,080
What class is she in?

273
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
Hey, have you seen her before?

274
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,800
- No, doesn't look familiar.
- Not at all?

275
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Not familiar at all?

276
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,800
I've never seen her.

277
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,960
No.

278
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,400
We've got her ID now.

279
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,920
Punn.

280
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,000
How did you get that?

281
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,800
I went to find this copy.

282
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,200
Where did you even get it from?

283
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,080
I'll tell you later.

284
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,840
There's no record
of this student in our school.

285
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,480
<i>I told you.</i>

286
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,040
I guarantee

287
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,920
she's a ghost who loves music.

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
She disguised herself to join us.

289
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,600
What the hell?

290
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
Alright, this evening,

291
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,880
let's go find her.

292
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,480
You know where she lives?

293
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,960
Of course.

294
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,920
- Oh.
- Here.

295
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,400
IDENTIFICATION CARD

296
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,320
This is the place.

297
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,400
- Let's ring the bell.
- Mm.

298
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
Nana!

299
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,320
- Nana!
- Why are you yelling?

300
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,680
Then how's she gonna come out?

301
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,240
She didn't even respond to the doorbell.

302
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,120
You're too loud.

303
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,600
What are you guys doing here?

304
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,440
How did you know this is my house?

305
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,320
Can you drop the attitude?
We're worried about you.

306
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,680
What are you talking about?

307
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,080
You guys wouldn't understand my life.
Just go.

308
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,320
If you weren't serious about the band,

309
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,760
why audition in the first place?

310
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,320
You wanted in so badly,

311
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,320
and now that you got in,

312
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,040
you're acting like this?

313
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,880
If you wanna quit, fine,

314
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,720
but at least tell us why.

315
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,720
Hey, what the hell?

316
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,960
She can't quit now.
The show's in a few days.

317
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,120
And if she leaves, who'll replace her?

318
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,960
We'll make it work with whoever's left.

319
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,760
We just want to know

320
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,680
what happened.

321
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,600
Maybe we can help.

322
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,600
Nana.

323
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,600
We're worried about you.

324
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,920
Even if we might've been harsh sometimes,

325
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
we all genuinely care about you.

326
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,000
If there's something wrong,

327
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,840
something bothering you,

328
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,760
can you tell us?

329
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,840
Well…

330
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,400
My mom's really sick.
Her condition's gotten worse.

331
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,680
And I don't have any money.

332
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,680
I've been working to pay for rent

333
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,800
and all the other expenses.

334
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,440
Should we talk inside
if it's gonna take a while?

335
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,560
You're in the way.

336
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,720
Just go home.
I need to take care of my mom.

337
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
Wait, wait. Hey.

338
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,280
Are you free tomorrow?
Or are you working somewhere?

339
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,560
We can come talk with you there.

340
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,520
Is that okay?

341
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
Yeah, I'll send you the address.

342
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,040
Mom, I'm home.

343
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
I bought congee for you today.

344
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,920
Do you want to eat now?
I'll put it in a bowl.

345
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,520
If you're not hungry yet,
you can rest first.

346
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,560
When we went to Nana's house,

347
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,080
did you see anyone?

348
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Yeah.

349
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,200
I saw an old, skinny woman

350
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,960
walking slowly in the kitchen.

351
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,680
I think Nana's hiding something.

352
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,800
Let's ask her tomorrow.

353
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,920
But go easy on her, okay?

354
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
I think…

355
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,200
for some people,

356
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,200
some things are really hard to talk about.

357
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,680
Why kitchen though?

358
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,200
<i>So?</i>

359
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,760
Are you quitting the band?

360
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,760
Don't quit.

361
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,560
You can't. There's no time left.

362
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,640
Well…

363
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,280
My mom's been in the last stage of cancer
for a while now.

364
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,240
All our savings

365
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,000
are used for her treatments.

366
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,600
I've had to work to pay the rent,

367
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
because there's no way
I can move her out anymore.

368
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,920
Wait, let me ask you this first.

369
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,680
You're not a student from our school?

370
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,640
Mm.

371
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,720
That's right.

372
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,280
I dropped out a year ago.

373
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,320
I had to work to earn money.

374
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,920
I take any job I can find,

375
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,680
then go home and care for my mom,
back and forth like that.

376
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
If she's hospitalized,

377
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,360
I have to take time off.

378
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,080
<i>I saw your audition poster</i>
<i>on the practice room board.</i>

379
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,560
<i>I really wanted to join.</i>

380
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
<i>But it seemed more convenient</i>
<i>if I applied as your school's student,</i>

381
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,640
<i>so I applied anyway.</i>

382
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,880
<i>That day, we didn't need uniforms.</i>

383
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,760
<i>But before I could even play,</i>
<i>the event got canceled.</i>

384
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,920
I used to rent this studio sometimes,
back when I could still afford it.

385
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,280
But lately,

386
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,880
I haven't come at all.

387
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,160
So I figured I might as well quit.

388
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,920
There's one way, though.

389
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240
We could still play and earn money.

390
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,120
If we find a café that hires us,

391
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,360
we'd still get to play together

392
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,680
and get paid too.

393
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,520
But would they even take us?

394
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,840
We're just newbies.
Our skills are barely okay.

395
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,680
Wait.

396
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
I just remembered.
My friend sent me a post yesterday.

397
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,440
There's this café
looking for school bands to play.

398
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,640
- Here.
- Let me see.

399
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,840
BAND WANTED AT DREAM CAFE
A CHANCE TO SHOWCASE AND GET PAID

400
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,640
<i>It's been so long since we met</i>
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

401
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,760
<i>It's been so long since we met</i>

402
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,040
<i>Do you still think of me?</i>

403
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,400
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

404
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,240
<i>How much I miss you</i>

405
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,520
<i>I'll show you just how much</i>

406
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,480
<i>Hug you tight, kiss your cheek</i>

407
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,600
<i>So you'll know how much I've missed you</i>

408
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,120
<i>I'll shout out loud</i>

409
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,800
<i>Just how much I miss you</i>

410
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,520
<i>Whoa-oh-oh, I miss you so bad</i>

411
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,280
<i>I don't know what's on your mind</i>

412
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,040
<i>But I miss you like crazy</i>

413
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,040
I told you we'd pass.

414
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,760
- See? Cheers!
- Cheers!

415
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,240
Hey, we won't need
my studio anymore, right?

416
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,840
- We'll still need it.
- Oh.

417
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
Hey, I should head home.

418
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,440
- Hm, wait.
- Wait.

419
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,360
Let's talk first.

420
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Mm.

421
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,160
So,

422
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,680
the payment for playing at the café

423
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,200
isn't much, but

424
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,600
it's something.

425
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,200
I thought…

426
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,600
I'll give all the money from this gig

427
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,960
to you, Nana.

428
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,040
It won't be a lot, I know.

429
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,880
So I'm adding some of my own savings too.

430
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,360
At least it'll help
with your rent for now.

431
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,720
Don't worry about it. I'm the band leader.

432
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,520
If anyone's struggling,
I've gotta support them.

433
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,920
Once I pick our members,
it's my job to keep them.

434
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Here.

435
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,960
Thank you.

436
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,280
- Come on, eat first, eat first.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

437
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,760
Why didn't he transfer the money?

438
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,400
Let's keep eating.

439
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,200
I gotta go now.

440
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,960
Now?

441
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,200
See you later.

442
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,000
Hey, wait.

443
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,600
She didn't even finish hers.

444
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,920
You want it?

445
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,080
What, you'll eat it?

446
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,600
Here's your take-home.

447
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,840
Thank you.

448
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,160
- What's so funny?
- So good.

449
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,680
- It's delicious.
- Yeah.

450
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,400
I brought wontons for you.

451
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,560
I'm sorry I'm home late tonight.

452
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,400
Punn.

453
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,640
Punn.

454
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh!

455
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,960
Whoa.

456
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,560
What's wrong? Why are you in such a rush?

457
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,120
Well…

458
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,680
Nana's mom's dead.

459
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
What?

460
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,480
How's Nana?

461
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,800
I'll text everyone.

462
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,680
No. It's…

463
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,000
Nana's mom

464
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,160
didn't just die.

465
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,440
Her body's decomposing.

466
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,200
I don't think

467
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,960
Nana's okay.

468
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,440
What do we do?

469
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,280
I don't know

470
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,000
what she's thinking, how she's feeling.

471
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,400
But if you guys
try to go into her house again,

472
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,560
it might not be good.

473
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,240
So what's our plan?

474
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,800
Should we call rescue services, secretly?

475
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,440
I don't think that's a good idea.

476
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,600
We should talk to her.
Help her understand.

477
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,240
She's probably

478
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,320
really fragile right now.

479
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,880
Let's talk it through together tomorrow.

480
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,040
I didn't think about that.

481
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,480
That Nana.

482
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,960
She's such a liar.

483
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,840
Hey.

484
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,720
Don't be too hard on her.

485
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,360
I think she still has things
she hasn't told us yet.

486
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,960
But keeping a corpse in the house,

487
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,880
that's serious.

488
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
Anyway, how did you even find out?

489
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,280
I just did, okay?

490
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,800
You always do this.

491
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,760
Like when you got Nana's ID.
How did you even get it?

492
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,640
You haven't told us.

493
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,600
Right, I forgot to explain.

494
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,760
I once saw Nana going into a bookstore,

495
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,520
so I figured she might be a member there.

496
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,480
I had to make up this whole story

497
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,480
before the owner
finally gave me that copy.

498
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,840
So, when are you going to
meet and talk again?

499
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,800
Or should we wait
until after the café performance?

500
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,480
But…

501
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,080
by then, I think

502
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,400
her mom's body might already be rotting.

503
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,520
Let's just act normal

504
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
for tonight,

505
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,840
- okay?
- Okay.

506
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,120
Okay.

507
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,800
- One dry noodle and one wonton soup to go.
- Sure thing.

508
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,840
Nana, how's your mom?

509
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,400
Still the same.
I don't know how many days she's got left.

510
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,199
Oh.

511
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,440
Then, can I come visit her sometime?

512
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,960
After the competition's over, okay?

513
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,199
It's only three days away.

514
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,760
Let's finish the competition first.

515
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,680
Mm.

516
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,320
Then I'll go now.

517
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,920
Wait.

518
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,760
Didn't you order noodles to go?

519
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,080
Oh.

520
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
Right.

521
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,920
Mom,

522
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,280
come eat the wontons, okay?

523
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,720
Are you bored of them?

524
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,720
It's the same as yesterday.

525
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,520
Come eat with me.

526
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,040
It's okay. I already ate.

527
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,800
Sit here, then.

528
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,960
Nana's a good girl, isn't she?

529
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,880
Yes.

530
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,400
She's a wonderful daughter
and a good friend too.

531
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,880
I don't want to go.

532
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,160
I don't want to leave her alone.

533
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,680
Ma'am.

534
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,040
Nana has to report this now.

535
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,240
If she keeps your body at home any longer,

536
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,800
she could get into trouble.

537
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
If no one comes in,

538
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,240
no one will know.

539
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
You have to let her go.

540
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,200
Don't you want to see her graduate?

541
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Right now, Nana had to drop out

542
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,840
to work and pay
all the household expenses.

543
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,280
Can you let her go?

544
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,200
We've been doing fine

545
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,240
together like this.

546
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,520
You know, don't you,

547
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,440
that Nana's dream is to be a musician?

548
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Of course I know.

549
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,440
I know.

550
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,680
That's why I supported her.

551
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,280
She's just like me when I was young.

552
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,200
I wanted to be a singer too.

553
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,960
I wanted to sing,

554
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,720
to be in a band with my friends,

555
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,040
to play music together.

556
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,120
I wanted to release an album.

557
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,320
That's why I always supported her. Right?

558
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,800
Yes.

559
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,480
But ever since I got sick,

560
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,040
everything changed.

561
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,720
I understand.

562
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,400
But right now, Nana's chasing her dream.

563
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,280
She's fighting her way toward it.

564
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,880
Also,

565
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,480
the world's changed so much now.

566
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,880
There are so many platforms and stages
for people to show their talent.

567
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,680
Nana's one of them.

568
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,920
She's so talented,

569
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,360
and she's strong too.

570
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,120
So please,

571
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,320
don't worry about her anymore.

572
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,600
And what about you?

573
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,880
What are you?

574
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,480
I don't really know either.

575
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm trying to find my way back too.

576
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,040
Will you help Nana?

577
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,360
Not just me.

578
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,320
Nana's got so many friends

579
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,000
who support her.

580
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,360
So,

581
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
please don't worry.

582
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
And,

583
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,840
if you can,

584
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,120
could you tell Nana

585
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,000
that she can stop worrying about you now?

586
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,960
Tell her it's okay to go live her dream.

587
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't know

588
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,960
if she'll understand it like I do.

589
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,040
Because the two of us,

590
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,840
we've been holding on to each other too.

591
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,280
We only have each other, after all.

592
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,440
What? She was staring right at me.

593
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,320
I didn't say anything.

594
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,400
Hey, stop fighting.

595
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,040
- What?
- Here.

596
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,040
Look.

597
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
- Hm?
- What is it?

598
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,440
I think

599
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,560
we're blowing up.

600
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,760
- Whoa.
- Let me see.

601
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,680
Here.

602
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,920
- Damn.
- See?

603
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,920
- Tens of thousands of views!
- Yeah.

604
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,360
Five thousand likes already. That's nice.

605
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,080
- Check the comments.
- You read them.

606
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,720
"This band's playing at Siam this Friday."

607
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,000
"Let's go see them." Whoa.

608
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,840
- We're famous!
- They're gonna come watch us.

609
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,200
We're killing it.

610
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,800
- Good job, everyone.
- Sorry, no photos.

611
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,720
Celebrity moment here.

612
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,080
The artists are having lunch

613
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,400
- right now, everyone.
- Yes.

614
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,920
See you all on stage.

615
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,600
<i>Do you still remember</i>

616
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,120
<i>That last day?</i>

617
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,400
<i>It's been so long since we drifted apart</i>

618
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,280
<i>I'm about to see you again</i>

619
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,240
<i>And my heart trembles</i>

620
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,920
<i>I don't know</i>

621
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,840
<i>If you're still the same</i>
<i>Or you've changed</i>

622
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,160
<i>I'm scared</i>

623
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,160
<i>Your heart's not the same anymore</i>

624
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,160
<i>I don't want to think</i>

625
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,000
<i>If I guess wrong, it'll hurt too much</i>

626
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,280
<i>I don't know what you feel inside</i>

627
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,800
<i>It's been so long since we met</i>
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

628
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,080
<i>It's been so long since we met</i>
<i>Do you still think of me?</i>

629
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,880
<i>Whoa-oh-oh, how much I miss you</i>

630
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,720
<i>I'll show you just how much</i>

631
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,440
<i>Hug you tight, kiss your cheek</i>

632
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,640
<i>So you'll know how much I've missed you</i>

633
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,960
<i>I'll shout out loud</i>
<i>Just how much I miss you</i>

634
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,400
<i>Whoa-oh-oh, I miss you so bad</i>

635
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,720
<i>I don't know what's on your mind</i>

636
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,160
<i>But I miss you like crazy</i>

637
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,040
<i>Hello, I'd like to report</i>
<i>A deceased person.</i>

638
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,960
SERVE SOCIETY SELFLESSLY

639
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,640
<i>Please send rescue to this address.</i>

640
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,120
I'll be fine.

641
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,320
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

642
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,280
I'm just thinking
about that day we performed.

643
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,160
<i>I saw a ghost clinging onto Bombay's back.</i>

644
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,000
Bombay! Bombay!

645
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,240
