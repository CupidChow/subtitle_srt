1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,480
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,840
Hey, where are you two going?!

3
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,480
They both

4
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,840
saw me through the glass.

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,519
Joey…

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,960
- Joe. Joey!
- Let her go.

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,840
- Karn!
- If something really bad happens,

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,440
and I'm not supposed to die yet,

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,040
how do I survive that?

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,560
Then I'll help you.

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,720
But only this once, okay?

12
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,200
Who are you?

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,160
Do you even know

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,840
how much Nike loved you?

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,360
He went to that same café
every single day.

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,960
From now on,

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,120
<i>we can celebrate together forever.</i>

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,840
- Hey, check out this news.
- Huh?

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
- There was a car accident, one dead.
- Huh?

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Maybe it wasn't an accident after all.

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
Hey!

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,560
Hey! Hey!

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Punn, I'm writing a song.

24
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,760
The one you were working on the other day?

25
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,680
How did you know?

26
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
I'm the one who saved it.
You ran after Joey that day.

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,400
Right.

28
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,920
How's Joey doing

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
with…

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,920
Well, he's okay.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,680
It's like he unlocked something
inside him. He really did love Nike.

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,440
You know, back then
Joey was this skinny little guy.

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,880
I never knew it was Nike
who kept cheering him on,

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,480
and that's why he started working out
until he got this muscly.

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,760
I can't even picture how he used to look.

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,320
And what about Nana?

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,520
I heard she's done packing,
just waiting to move out.

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,920
Yeah, luckily Joey's dad

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,280
let her stay upstairs above the studio.

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
Joey just needs to finish clearing
the storage room and she can move in.

41
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
That's good.

42
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,120
She won't have to
arrive home late after work,

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,720
and she can just stay and practice.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Mm.

45
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
And we're trying to convince her

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,360
to go back and finish school too.

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,760
I've been telling her
to apply for a student loan

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
so she can return to school,

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,680
have friends, a social life,

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,360
the kind of teenage years
you can't get back once they're gone.

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,560
Once you start working,
the world becomes something else entirely.

52
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,640
That's true. Even as a spirit,

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,800
free and drifting like this,

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,720
sometimes I still miss going to school.

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,360
I miss

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,760
having plenty of rules,

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,600
teachers telling you what to do,
a mom nagging me.

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,680
She wants out,
but you wanna get back in, huh?

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
It's good though.

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,920
When Nana goes back,
she won't feel lonely.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,800
There's no one
waiting for her at home anyway.

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,040
Mm.

63
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,920
Yeah.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,120
It must be sad
coming home to an empty house.

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm lucky to have you here, Alice.

66
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,400
Mm.

67
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,920
This is strange. Everyone's early today.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,760
I came to set up the camera,
like you told me last time.

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,240
Damn.

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,160
And you know, this is Alice's idea.

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,440
- Really?
- That's awesome, Alice.

72
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,160
You're amazing.

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,200
- Yeah.
- If it wasn't for you reminding us,

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
we wouldn't have
these videos to show our future kids.

75
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
That's true.

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Well,

77
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
when Alice comes back,

78
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,880
we'll have even more footage like this.

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
It will be

80
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,920
the original members, the current ones,
and every moment we share in between.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,560
- Mm.
- Wow.

82
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
That's right.

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,640
We'll make an album.

84
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,800
Hey, Punn. Did you see
the message from Phukan yet?

85
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,240
What message?

86
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,240
Here, look.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
HELLO, PUNN. HOW ARE YOU?

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,440
MY BAND GETS TO PERFORM AT SIAM.

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,040
I'M SO HAPPY. SEE YOU IN BANGKOK.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
Punn, why that face?

91
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,320
Punn, what's wrong?

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560
I'll be right back.

93
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,040
Wow.

94
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,840
She's too giddy.

95
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,400
So annoying.

96
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
What?

97
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Look at her.
She still hasn't come down to the studio.

98
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,160
NANA

99
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,280
You'll see.

100
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,520
What are you gonna do?

101
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,120
JOEY: MAYBE YOU'LL HEAR
SOMETHING FROM THE DOOR.

102
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,280
NANA: I'M NOT AFRAID. DON'T TRY ME.

103
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,600
I think she's scared.

104
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Of course.

105
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,400
She's going to get it.

106
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Why doesn't this door have a peephole?

107
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
It's still daytime.

108
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,799
Ghosts are showing up now?

109
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,760
NANA: ANYONE, COME UP AND HELP ME.

110
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
Help!

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,040
Help!

112
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,280
Help! Help me!

113
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,040
Didn't you say you weren't scared?!

114
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,440
Are you scared of geckos?

115
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,800
You really came to scare me.

116
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,560
It's okay, don't be afraid.

117
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
If you're this scared,

118
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,720
how are you going to stay here?

119
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,840
If you don't scare me, I won't be scared.

120
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,800
- Oh, okay.
- Wow.

121
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
I thought you were tough.

122
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,200
- You're actually--
- A sweet girl?

123
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,280
- Aw.
- There, there.

124
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,960
- Ugh.
- Don't be scared.

125
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,720
- I'm not scared.
- Okay, you're not scared.

126
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,240
I was wondering where you were.

127
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,520
Here you are.

128
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,200
Why didn't you call?

129
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,800
I wanted to,

130
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
but do I have a phone?

131
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,680
I was checking the lineup
for the stage at Siam,

132
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,200
seeing which band plays on which day.

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,720
There's a junior band
coming from out of town.

134
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
Which band? From where?

135
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,840
They're called

136
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,720
"Twilight Zone."

137
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,920
Cool name.

138
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,760
They're from

139
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
Udon Thani.

140
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,520
The lead singer

141
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,800
used to study at me and Joey's old school.

142
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,920
We were close,
even formed a band together,

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,880
but he had to move back
to Udon Thani with his parents.

144
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,680
We never saw each other again.

145
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,040
I missed him a lot.

146
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
That's good then.

147
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,120
You'll finally meet again.

148
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,320
I don't want him to come.

149
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
Why not?

150
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,000
Because if he comes,

151
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
he might die.

152
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
And how do you know that?

153
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,080
Because he might be our mission, Alice.

154
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,760
I really don't want to go.

155
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,320
Yeah. I don't want you to leave either.

156
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,680
It's okay.

157
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,760
We'll miss you for sure.

158
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,680
When you're older, come live in Bangkok.

159
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,800
We can form a band later.

160
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,760
I'll come visit you both whenever I can.

161
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,720
Oh.

162
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Keep this as a severe.

163
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
- A souvenir.
- A souvenir.

164
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,880
Yeah, that's what I meant.

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,920
I said it wrong on purpose,
to make it funny.

166
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
Oh, wow.

167
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
What's this? Chopsticks?

168
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,200
Open it and see.

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,480
Wait. But I play the guitar.

170
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,120
Maybe you'll switch to drums someday.

171
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,880
I'm giving it to you, since Punn

172
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,920
already bought you a pick.

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,640
I couldn't get the same thing.

174
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,560
No way. I had to be cooler.

175
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,600
Mark my words.

176
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,800
You'll be a drummer one day.

177
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,760
Thanks so much, boys.

178
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,080
I mean, big bros. I really love you.

179
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,200
If he hadn't moved back to Udon Thani,

180
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,840
and had stayed in our school,

181
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,880
he'd still be in our band.

182
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,960
But I don't want you to overthink it.

183
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,800
Sometimes the things you see in dreams

184
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,240
are just dreams.

185
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,600
Alice.

186
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I always dream about things
before they happen.

187
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,840
I've had that kind of sense
since I was a kid.

188
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,080
So what will you do next?

189
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,120
PUNN: DON'T COME, PHUKAN.
COME BACK NEXT YEAR. YOU'RE NOT READY YET.

190
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Oh, Punn.

191
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,840
- Let's practice.
- Punn.

192
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,720
Why did you say to Phukan "Don't come."

193
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
"Come back next year. You're not
ready yet." What's that about?

194
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,680
What was I supposed to say?

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,800
You don't have the right to decide
who's good enough or not.

196
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,000
You're not the one making the selection.

197
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,880
- Hey, calm down.
- This stage

198
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,800
is open for everyone.

199
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,080
Kids from upcountry
deserve the same chance.

200
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,840
The less skilled they are,

201
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,040
the more powerful it is
for them to be here.

202
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,760
I'm just afraid if he comes,
he won't make it back home.

203
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,920
- What are you even talking about?!
- Hey.

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,360
- Huh?
- You pushed me?!

205
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
- Hey, stop!
- What?!

206
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Look at how you're talking to him!

207
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,400
- If you don't understand, just keep quiet.
- What kind of big brother are you?

208
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,600
- Shut up, Joey.
- Understand what?

209
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,120
- He's your brother.
- Stop! Hey, calm down.

210
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
- What? I am calm.
- Stop.

211
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,240
Look at what he said.
Wouldn't you be mad too?

212
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,280
- Calm down, man.
- I was just worried about him!

213
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,200
- Punn, stop.
- Worried what?

214
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
- You won't stop, huh?
- Hey, stop.

215
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,520
- I won't stop.
- Stop, both of you.

216
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
- Hey, stop!
- I won't!

217
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,280
- What are you saying to him?
- Hey.

218
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,840
- Calm down.
- Forget it. I'm out of here.

219
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,640
I'm gonna tell him

220
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,240
his big brother's full of himself.

221
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,960
Punn.

222
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
Go home.

223
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,080
Let's skip practice today.

224
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
You're kicking me out?

225
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,160
Fine, I'm leaving.

226
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,600
What's with those two?

227
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,280
No idea.

228
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,480
They don't usually
lose their minds that easily.

229
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,880
Punn's normally reasonable.

230
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,320
People can lose it too.

231
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,080
Maybe they've got
some history with that kid's band.

232
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,360
They told us before.

233
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,480
Or maybe…

234
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,560
they're on their period.

235
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,720
You're still joking? Didn't you see Joey?

236
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm serious.

237
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,560
What do we do, Alice?

238
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,360
Should I contact the event organizers

239
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,760
saying Twilight Zone is doing drugs

240
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
and ask them to remove them.

241
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,720
Punn, that's slander.

242
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,400
That's a terrible plan.
I can't think of anything now.

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,880
What should I do?

244
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,880
What if nothing really happens?

245
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,880
Then your plan

246
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,080
will make you feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

247
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,240
You're not that kind of person.

248
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't know what else to do.

249
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,520
Help me think.

250
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,160
Or should we ask Karn for help?

251
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,040
Can we really change someone's fate?

252
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,040
Changing my own is hard enough.

253
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,040
We won't know unless we try.

254
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
All I know is, if we don't fight,

255
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,800
you might never wake up again, Alice.

256
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,080
You think it'll work?

257
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,080
It has to.

258
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,400
JOEY: I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.
I'M LEAVING THE BAND.

259
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,920
Oh, you're staying home today?

260
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,640
Not going to the studio?

261
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,160
What are you doing?

262
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,320
Talking to someone?

263
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,800
- No, just playing a game.
- Oh.

264
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,760
There's no practice today, Dad.

265
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,760
And that friend of yours
who lives upstairs from the studio,

266
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,520
she's okay there, right?

267
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,400
Well…

268
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
Is she your friend

269
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,440
or your girlfriend?

270
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,320
Mom, come on. Who'd like her?

271
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,440
Alright, just a friend.
Why are you blushing?

272
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm not blushing.

273
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,600
- Sure you're not.
- Who'd like her anyway?

274
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,640
Hey!

275
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,040
Hey!

276
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,400
Hey!

277
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,640
Hey!

278
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,240
Hey!

279
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,720
KHLONG HOK SUB-DISTRICT
1H 4M

280
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,160
KHLONG HOK SUB-DISTRICT
1H 4M

281
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,360
PRACTICE STUDIO

282
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,880
Phukan.

283
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,720
When we get to Bangkok,

284
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,840
where are you taking us to?

285
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,320
No idea.

286
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Probably wherever the big bros bring us.

287
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,840
I left when I was little.

288
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,560
I have no clue
how much Bangkok has changed now.

289
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
It's not hard. We'll just ask social media

290
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
where to check in when you're in Bangkok.

291
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,920
- Yeah.
- You're right.

292
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,840
But we're staying near Siam too.

293
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,200
Let's go to Pratunam.
They say it's close to Siam.

294
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,640
I heard they've got tons
of nice clothes there.

295
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,880
I really want to go
get something nice to wear.

296
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,200
Hey, which of you kids

297
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,160
hasn't packed yet?

298
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,960
- Me.
- Me too.

299
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,480
- Me.
- Me.

300
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,160
None of you? Seriously?

301
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,400
Alright, then eat up.

302
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,040
We're leaving tonight.

303
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,960
- Huh?
- Mm.

304
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,360
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

305
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,280
That's great.

306
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,160
- Let's go.
- I want to go early.

307
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,880
- No more practice today.
- Really, teacher?

308
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
- Eat your food. Finish it all.
- Yes.

309
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,600
- Awesome.
- Come on, Pruek. Hurry up.

310
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,360
- Chop it.
- Hurry up.

311
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,360
- Come on.
- No one's helping me.

312
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,280
Hello, Phukan.

313
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,360
Yes, Punn? See you tomorrow.

314
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,320
You're coming a day early?

315
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,920
<i>Yeah. The school gave us a budget.</i>

316
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,920
<i>They rented a bus for us too.</i>

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,960
They told us to arrive a night
before the show, so we'll be fresh.

318
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,600
<i>They're afraid</i>
<i>we won't be able to perform.</i>

319
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,760
<i>Honestly, I know</i>

320
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,080
the teachers just wanted
an excuse to take a trip to Bangkok.

321
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,560
<i>Punn, was that the only reason you called?</i>

322
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,240
Did you and Joey

323
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,080
have a fight?

324
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,200
Why?

325
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,720
What did he tell you?

326
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,520
He said you didn't want me to go.

327
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
<i>That's not true, right?</i>

328
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,480
<i>You want to see me, right?</i>

329
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,040
Of course.

330
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
Of course I want to see you.

331
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,480
I miss you, man.

332
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,680
<i>Then,</i>

333
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,200
<i>why did you send me</i>
<i>that message the other day?</i>

334
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,680
<i>The one that said</i>
<i>I wasn't good enough yet.</i>

335
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,080
Honestly,

336
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm the best in the province. Don't worry.

337
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,240
<i>I know you're worried</i>
<i>and don't want me to be disappointed.</i>

338
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,640
<i>That's why you said that.</i>

339
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,640
Anyway, I missed you.

340
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,360
And I believe you'll do really well.

341
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
You know I've always believed in you.

342
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,120
You're talented,
hardworking, and determined.

343
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
But…

344
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,360
I don't even know
why I sent you that message.

345
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm sorry, okay?

346
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,800
<i>You're not upset, are you?</i>

347
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,240
It's fine.

348
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,280
I know you guys. You always mean well.

349
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,360
Someday, maybe we'll play together again
like when we were kids.

350
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,960
<i>I still use the pick you gave me.</i>

351
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,840
It's not broken yet?

352
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,320
Hey.

353
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,480
You gave me a whole box of them.
They'll last me till I'm old.

354
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,480
Hey, I gotta go now. The bus is here.

355
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,400
ROUTE

356
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,000
KHLONG HOK SUB-DISTRICT
1H 4M

357
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,880
- Hey, hey!
- <i>Maybe sweet talk would sound better?</i>

358
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,920
<i>That’d be cute</i>
<i>But if it’s nagging, I’ll walk away</i>

359
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,240
- What's up? What's up?
- <i>Don’t nag me too much</i>

360
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,160
<i>You’ll drive me crazy</i>
<i>A small thing could turn into a big fight</i>

361
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,560
Hey, you asleep in the back?

362
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,600
<i>Maybe sweet talk would sound better?</i>
<i>That’d be cute</i>

363
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,440
- <i>But if it’s nagging, I’ll walk away</i>
- One more time, one more time.

364
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,560
<i>Don’t nag me too much</i>
<i>You’ll drive me crazy</i>

365
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,600
<i>A small thing could turn into a big fight</i>

366
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,960
<i>Maybe sweet talk would sound better?</i>
<i>That’d be cute…</i>

367
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,680
Shit. I think…

368
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
- Hey. You…
- Shit.

369
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,160
What was that? A ghost?

370
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
Alice.

371
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,120
Oh.

372
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,320
You scared me.

373
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,680
What?

374
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,680
Lap… Laptop.

375
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,880
There?

376
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
Laptop.

377
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,720
- Why?
- Let's go and see.

378
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,880
There?

379
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,440
Laptop?

380
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,320
Hey, kid.

381
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,120
What are you doing here?

382
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,400
Hey, where have you been?

383
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,920
I've been looking for you everywhere.

384
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,680
Why didn't you go to the café?

385
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,920
I sit there every night.

386
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,240
What are you doing here?

387
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,760
I'm helping a junior.
Making sure he doesn't die.

388
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,720
Be careful.

389
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,480
When you change fate,

390
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,640
you risk being affected yourself.

391
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,240
What?

392
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,840
<i>Hello, Phukan.</i>

393
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,320
Where are you?

394
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,680
- What road are you on?
- Hello, Punn.

395
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,040
The signal's bad, I can barely hear you.

396
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,920
Hello? Phukan.

397
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,560
PUNN: WHERE ARE YOU? WHICH ROAD?
WHAT'S THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER?

398
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,440
PHUKAN: I DON'T KNOW.

399
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,560
Hey, wake up!

400
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,040
Stop!

401
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,760
Stop!

402
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,080
Stop!

403
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,640
Stop!

404
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
Open the door.

405
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,840
Punn, what are you doing here?

406
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,560
I'm just glad you're okay.

407
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,760
Lap… Laptop.

408
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,920
There?

409
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,240
Laptop.

410
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,600
HELP PUNN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S THINKING

411
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,880
HE'S TRYING TO STOP A BUS
OF HIS JUNIOR FROM AN ACCIDENT

412
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,040
Where's Punn now?

413
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
I think we should tell Joey first.

414
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,360
I'll call Punn.

415
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,400
He's not answering.

416
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,040
I KNOW WHO TO ASK

417
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,600
Huh?

418
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,000
- Alice.
- Hey.

419
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,120
Where's Alice?

420
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,560
So, you came after all.

421
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,000
Where's Punn?

422
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,200
Sir?

423
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,680
Good.

424
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,400
You finally know how to be polite.

425
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,160
So,

426
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,720
you know where he is, don't you?

427
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,680
Of course.

428
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
I just saw him
at the intersection a moment ago.

429
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,280
Which intersection?

430
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,160
Will you make it in time?

431
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,360
If you make it, good.

432
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
If you don't, also good.

433
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,400
So, where is Punn?

434
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,040
Whoa.

435
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,480
Hey, Alice is here.

436
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,680
If Phukan hadn't moved out of town,

437
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,000
our band wouldn't have Nana

438
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,960
and Bombay here.

439
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,320
Wait, did you forget someone?

440
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,320
- Alice.
- Oh, right.

441
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,800
Alice too.

442
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,440
Honestly, just us three, Joey,

443
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,040
Punn, and Phukan,

444
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,080
this band is already solid.

445
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,760
Alright. Okay.

446
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,320
Hey, should we give them a little show?

447
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,920
Come on, bro. Show them what we've got.

448
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,880
- Please do.
- Let's do it, bro.

449
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,200
- Come on.
- Please.

450
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,240
Come on.

451
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,880
Let's relive the old days.

452
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,320
- Alright.
- Come on.

453
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,240
Are you ready?

454
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,640
- Yes.
- Ready.

455
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,960
- Let's go.
- I'm ready.

456
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,600
<i>I'm here begging you, please don't go</i>

457
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,800
<i>I'm falling to my knees</i>
<i>Holding on to your legs</i>

458
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,000
<i>With both hands together</i>
<i>I bow and plead, please don't go</i>

459
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,880
<i>It's useless, I know, when love has faded</i>

460
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,480
<i>But if you still care and love me</i>

461
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,360
<i>If our past still means something</i>

462
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,800
<i>Please don't leave me</i>

463
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,400
<i>Please don't hurt me</i>

464
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,240
<i>I'm here begging you, please don't go</i>

465
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,160
<i>I'm falling to my knees</i>
<i>Holding on to your legs</i>

466
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,040
<i>With both hands together</i>
<i>I bow and plead, please don't go</i>

467
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>It's useless, I know, when love has faded</i>

468
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,240
<i>But if you still care and love me</i>
<i>If our past still means something</i>

469
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,520
<i>Please don't leave me</i>

470
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,040
<i>Please don't hurt me</i>

471
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,760
- That was insane.
- Great job.

472
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,400
<i>The moon is bright tonight</i>

473
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,360
<i>But my heart feels empty</i>

474
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,840
<i>You who once stood by my side</i>

475
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,320
<i>Are now so far away</i>

476
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,160
<i>Under that moonlight one night</i>

477
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,760
<i>We made a promise</i>

478
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,520
<i>You'd be the moon in my heart</i>

479
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,160
<i>Guiding me through the dark</i>

480
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,280
<i>When we're apart</i>

481
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,360
<i>My heart still cares</i>

482
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,400
<i>Never drifts away</i>

483
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,600
<i>When we're apart</i>

484
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,640
<i>I'm lonely</i>

485
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,560
<i>I still have only you</i>

486
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,240
<i>I miss you</i>

487
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,240
<i>I just want to tell you</i>

488
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,480
<i>I wonder how you are</i>

489
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,960
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

490
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,680
<i>I miss you</i>

491
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,680
<i>I whisper to this silent night</i>

492
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,680
<i>Asking the sky and the stars</i>

493
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,760
<i>To hold you in my place</i>

494
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,640
<i>I miss you every day, I haven't forgotten</i>

495
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,640
<i>Our promise</i>

496
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,680
<i>I'll come back to find you</i>

497
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,400
<i>Soon</i>

498
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,320
<i>I still care for you like before</i>

499
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,400
<i>Still waiting patiently</i>

500
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,760
<i>I miss you so much</i>

501
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
You're the best, my little bro.

502
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,880
- Twilight Zone!
- Phukan from Twilight Zone!

503
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,640
- Perfect score. Ten out of ten.
- Ten out of ten.

504
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,000
<i>From the moment I saw you walking in</i>
<i>Time froze like a stun</i>

505
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,880
<i>Lights flashed, I was lost in a dream</i>
<i>As if you lit fireworks inside my heart</i>

506
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,760
<i>From this night on,</i>
<i>There’s only us under the lights</i>

507
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,160
<i>As if time itself has stopped so I can</i>
<i>Remember your face before it’s gone</i>

508
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,880
<i>Life brought us together</i>

509
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,480
<i>Just to remind me</i>
<i>That we can't love each other</i>

510
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,480
<i>Such a pity</i>

511
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,040
Alice!

512
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,120
Punn, are you okay?

513
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,120
<i>Alice.</i>

514
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,000
Alice.

515
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,560
Where are you?

516
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,280
Bring Alice back.

517
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,840
Alice.

518
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,600
Are you here?

519
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,600
<i>I don't know. It's all dark.</i>

520
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,720
<i>Punn, I'm scared.</i>

521
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,440
<i>I don't think I can come back this time.</i>

522
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
<i>Take care of yourself, okay?</i>

523
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,720
No, Alice.

524
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,760
Karn.

525
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,960
Bring Alice back.

526
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,960
Karn.

527
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,920
Please give us one more chance.

528
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,160
Take anything in exchange.

529
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,640
Take my life.

530
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,320
Make me your servant,

531
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,480
I don't care.

532
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,800
<i>No, Punn, don't do that.</i>

533
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,400
<i>You've already done enough for me.</i>

534
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,960
Alice!

535
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,080
Alice!

536
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,640
Alice!

537
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,040
Alice!

538
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,000
We've completed all the missions.

539
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,680
Why hasn't Alice woken up?

540
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,920
<i>Your duty</i>

541
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,920
<i>was to free wandering souls.</i>

542
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,240
But that day,

543
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,080
you and Alice

544
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
changed fate.

545
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
What does that mean?

546
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,720
If you save Paeng,

547
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,160
you might die again, Alice.

548
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,000
Alice only has five days left

549
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,760
before she dies for real.

550
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,520
- Huh?
- Huh?

551
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,320
What are you all doing here?

552
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,200
We came to pick up something for Alice.

553
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,320
What do you mean? I don't understand.

554
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,360
Dad, is that you?

555
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
