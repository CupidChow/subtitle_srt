1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,280
Your duty, along with Alice,

2
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,560
was to free wandering spirits.

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,080
But that day,

4
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,880
you and Alice

5
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,720
changed fate.

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,920
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,200
<i>He said we failed the mission.</i>

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,640
<i>That what we did was change fate,</i>

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,200
not free spirits.

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,000
That means
the mission automatically failed.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,640
What's this?

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,280
You're giving us a chance?

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,800
I thought about it.
It'll be far more entertaining this way.

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,480
<i>In the end, you made the same choice.</i>

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,560
<i>Then why am I even trying to save you?</i>

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,560
Sorry, Punn.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,000
But…

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,400
I made my decision and I stand by it.

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,720
If she really has only five days left,

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,040
and nothing else can be done,

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,240
then maybe we find something
we want to do with the time that's left.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,400
<i>Let's make it meaningful.</i>

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,240
Ma'am.

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,560
I think you should
spend more time with Alice than before.

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
<i>If I ever get another chance to go back,</i>

26
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,440
<i>I'll make both your dreams come true.</i>

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,520
Alice!

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Alice!

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,480
<i>Don't forget</i>

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,640
<i>the promise you made to me.</i>

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,800
What promise?!

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,680
<i>The promise to give me your life.</i>

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,080
That day, what did you promise me?

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,480
Do you remember?

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Of course I do.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,080
Are you ready?

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Always.

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,680
Whatever happens, happens.

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,000
<i>What's coming next</i>

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,760
<i>is a world of endless boredom.</i>

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,240
<i>A long time ago,</i>

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,280
<i>I was just a student,</i>

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,400
<i>no different from you.</i>

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,800
25 YEARS AGO

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,320
- Rock with energy, you know?
- Potato doesn't do rock, man.

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,520
- Lock? Then you can't get in.
- Hey.

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,920
- There's one.
- Hey.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,280
You talk too much.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,800
- Why don't we get something like this too?
- Whoa.

50
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
He's the real deal.

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,480
Hey.

52
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,400
Wow.

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,640
I told you not to buy a drink.
Someone would get one for you anyway.

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Next time, don't buy food either.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,360
You'll eat for free every day.

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,360
<i>She was a girl</i>

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,400
<i>I'd never seen before.</i>

58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
<i>I didn't know if she'd been here a while</i>

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,440
<i>or if she was new to the school.</i>

60
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,400
- So good.
- Wow, I like it.

61
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,920
He's my boyfriend.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,360
<i>I didn't know why,</i>

63
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>but she caught my eye right away.</i>

64
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,960
Hi.

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,280
I'm Maggie. Can I sit here?

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
Sure, go ahead. I'm Nampla.

67
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,400
What's with that fake name?

68
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,200
- Where were you, man?
- This nosy one is Maggie.

69
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,960
She's my friend. You know each other yet?

70
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,800
I already introduced myself.

71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Maggie wants to join our band.

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,840
She can play the keyboard. Can she join?

73
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
Oh my.

74
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,640
<i>Excuse me,</i>

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,840
do you have the new volume of <i>H2</i> yet?

76
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,160
Yeah, there's one left.

77
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
I'll grab it for you.

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,480
Oh?

79
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
Where'd it go?

80
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,920
It was right here.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,840
Excuse me, could you ring me up?

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,720
Oh.

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,080
The last copy in the store is here.

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,200
Well, I got it first.

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,520
And I've already paid for it.

86
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Oh?

87
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,200
Did you follow me?

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
No. I didn't follow you.

89
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,720
Then why are you walking behind me?

90
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,400
What do you want?

91
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I really wasn't following you. You…

92
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
You cut in front of me, actually,

93
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,960
back at the alley.

94
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,000
You wanted <i>H2,</i> right?

95
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,960
Yeah, I did.

96
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,400
I've been looking everywhere for it.

97
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,440
The one you got
is probably the last copy in the store.

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Here.

99
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,680
You can read it first.

100
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,800
Just return it to me after.

101
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,960
Why are you still following me?

102
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm not.

103
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,240
I'm not following you.
My dad's picking me up here.

104
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
You study here too?

105
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
Yeah.

106
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,840
I come here for tutoring.

107
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,320
I attend tutoring classes here too.

108
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,200
And my dad picks me up here as well.

109
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
I see.

110
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,640
What a coincidence.

111
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,600
Well,

112
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,880
since both our parents are late,

113
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,200
why don't we finish reading it now?

114
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,120
Then I can return it back to you.

115
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,040
Only two pages left.

116
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
I kind of don't want it to end so soon.

117
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,920
Traffic's going to be bad tonight.
It's Friday evening.

118
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,480
No wonder my dad's late.

119
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,880
It's kind of nice, though.

120
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,240
Nice how?

121
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
Well…

122
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,040
We get to sit here and talk.

123
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
How about this?

124
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,720
We can share comic books.

125
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
Save some money.

126
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,560
Don't get mad,

127
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,360
but I love collecting books too.

128
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,200
But,

129
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,640
if you don't want to buy one,

130
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
you can just borrow it from me.

131
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,720
Oh, really?

132
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,240
Mm.

133
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
Then I'll take good care of them, promise.

134
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,840
You sure?

135
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
Yeah.

136
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,240
- Um…
- Can I have the plastic wrap of <i>H2</i>?

137
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,600
Eh?

138
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,960
I don't know where it is.

139
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
There.

140
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,600
Give me.

141
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,640
- I'm not giving it to you.
- Hey!

142
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,520
Get up.

143
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,360
- No!
- Quit faking it.

144
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
It hurts?

145
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
What should we do with her, Jenny?

146
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,000
Keep beating her up,

147
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
but not in the face.

148
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,080
Just the body.

149
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,560
Beat her up real good.

150
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,920
FEMALE RESTROOM

151
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
Bass. Bass.

152
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,200
Are you okay, Bass?

153
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,280
If something's wrong, you can tell me.

154
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,920
<i>So what exactly were they doing?</i>

155
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,760
They must have been having sex, Jenny.

156
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,680
Are you sure?

157
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,360
Well, they were together,
just the two of them.

158
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,560
Hiding behind the classroom,
sitting close, shoulders touching.

159
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
She just got beaten up by me

160
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
and she still has the nerve
to flirt with a guy?

161
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,040
Or maybe she knows you like him, Jenny.

162
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,200
So she teases you on purpose.

163
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,840
Should we tell the teacher?

164
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,240
No.

165
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,120
I think we should handle this ourselves.

166
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
If she gets expelled,

167
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,360
who will we have left to bully?

168
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,920
That's true.

169
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
Enough for today.

170
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm not in the mood to practice.

171
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,320
What's with you being all moody today?

172
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,720
Come on, our band
finally got a new female member.

173
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,880
- We should be practicing more.
- Yeah.

174
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,200
Fine.

175
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,120
He doesn't want to play basketball lately.

176
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,600
And he wants to practice alone.

177
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,880
I think something's bothering him.

178
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Hey.

179
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,960
I actually overheard something.

180
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,880
What?

181
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,840
Hey, I'll tell you.

182
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,320
I heard some girls gossiping about it.

183
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,920
Hey kid,

184
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,960
aren't you buying anything today?

185
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,400
You've been walking around for a while.

186
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,840
Um,

187
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,440
probably not today.

188
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,640
I'm just waiting for a friend.

189
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,960
That girl?

190
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,440
She already bought something earlier.

191
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,760
You're not from the same school?

192
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,840
We are. Why?

193
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,240
<i>She bought the new</i> H2 <i>volume</i>

194
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,040
<i>and went that way.</i>

195
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,000
Where have you been?

196
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,240
I couldn't find you at school.

197
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,720
I don't want to go to school.

198
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,400
But I don't know what to do.

199
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,080
Did something happen?

200
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,360
You can talk to me.

201
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,800
Well…

202
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,720
I just transferred here
this semester, right?

203
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
And I got to see Jenny here.

204
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,240
But you know what?

205
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,000
We used to be childhood friends.

206
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,280
We were really close.

207
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,120
But for some reason,
when she saw me again,

208
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,120
she looked shocked.

209
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,200
I was happy to see her, but she wasn't.

210
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,160
Back then, Jenny's parents

211
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
worked with my family.

212
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,120
One day,

213
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,800
my mom found out Jenny's mom

214
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
was taking under-the-table money
from clients.

215
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,320
Jenny's mom said

216
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,280
she needed it to pay debts, to start over.

217
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,599
So my mom fired her.

218
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
After that,

219
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
we never saw each other again.

220
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,560
I don't know why…

221
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,720
but when we met again,
it became like this.

222
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Maybe…

223
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,240
Jenny's afraid
you'll expose her family's secret.

224
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,360
Or she's afraid you'll gossip
about them pretending to be rich.

225
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,840
I never told anyone.
And I never planned to.

226
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,480
You're the first person I've told.

227
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,680
So…

228
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,360
Jenny's been bullying you this whole time?

229
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,920
That day must've been the worst, right?

230
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,560
Mm.

231
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,560
And it just got worse every day.

232
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
That's why I don't want to go to school.

233
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,440
I don't know what will happen each day

234
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,240
if I go.

235
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,720
You should go to school.

236
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,320
I'll tell the teacher.

237
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,560
I think they can handle it.

238
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,120
Don't.

239
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,120
If we tell the teacher,

240
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
they'll make my life even worse.

241
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,520
So you're just
going to let it be like this?

242
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,440
It's only a few months until graduation.

243
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,320
I think

244
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,720
if I just endure it

245
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,120
until then,

246
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,000
that might be the best way.

247
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,280
Just be careful.

248
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,440
If anything happens,

249
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,320
you can always come to me.

250
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,520
Thanks.

251
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,000
I finished reading it.

252
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,080
By the way,
I'm entering the Hot Wave contest.

253
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,680
I want you

254
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,120
to come practice with our band.

255
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,200
<i>Don’t be mad at me</i>

256
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,960
<i>Forgive me if I was wrong</i>

257
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,880
<i>Don’t blame me</i>

258
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,760
<i>I just wanted you to understand</i>

259
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,960
<i>Please tell me what you need</i>

260
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,840
<i>Tell me, I’ll give you everything</i>

261
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,760
- <i>Please tell me</i>
- <i>Please tell me</i>

262
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,160
- <i>Please tell me</i>
- <i>But don’t nag me too much</i>

263
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,120
<i>You’ll drive me crazy</i>

264
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,600
<i>A small thing could turn into a big fight</i>

265
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,880
<i>Maybe sweet talk would sound better?</i>

266
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,360
<i>That’d be cute</i>
<i>But if it’s nagging, I’ll walk away</i>

267
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,200
You sing really well.

268
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,440
She's quite something.

269
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,640
Should've asked you to join sooner.

270
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,800
- Hey, wait.
- True.

271
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,080
Stop teasing.

272
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,880
Show some respect for the old vocalist.

273
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,840
- Respect? You don't deserve it.
- Oh, come on.

274
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,720
Wow.

275
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,920
I don't feel like
going to class this afternoon.

276
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,280
What class?

277
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,320
Math.

278
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,840
Nothing.

279
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,760
Forget studying for now.

280
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
- Music first.
- Mm.

281
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,680
- Yes.
- Wanna eat this?

282
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,840
Is it good?

283
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,480
Yeah. Pork sausage? Who wants some?

284
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,880
- You eat.
- I have one too.

285
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,520
Afraid you won't get full. I have one too.

286
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,840
Drinks are the best here.

287
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,360
Look at him these days.

288
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,920
Hey, can you put it in my bag for me?

289
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
DAILY MOTTO

290
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,720
Bass, can you also mop the floor?
I have to head home early.

291
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Mm.

292
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,920
STUDENT STATISTICS

293
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,680
Bass! Bass!

294
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
Do you know the owner of this book?

295
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,320
He's getting attacked by a dog
behind the building.

296
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
- Huh?
- He told me to come get you.

297
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,320
- Huh?
- Let's go.

298
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
Wait!

299
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,480
Basketball guy. Basketball guy.

300
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,920
Where is he?

301
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,280
Over there.

302
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,280
Hurry. I'm scared of dogs.
I'm not going with you.

303
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,720
Basketball guy!

304
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,720
Basketball guy?

305
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,320
Get up.

306
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,440
I said get up!

307
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,760
Where are you going? Wash your face first.

308
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,760
Let go!

309
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,000
- Come here.
- Let go of me! Let go!

310
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,600
Let go!

311
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,960
Ugh.

312
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,240
I'm going home.

313
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,760
Let's go.

314
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,560
Damn it!

315
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,720
- Huh?
- What?

316
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,160
My comic book's gone.

317
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,640
Ugh.

318
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
Ugh.

319
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,120
- What should we do?
- Forget it.

320
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,120
Let's go home. We're all exhausted today.
Just look for it tomorrow.

321
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,680
- What?
- Let's go.

322
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,600
- Let's go home.
- Wait.

323
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,240
You hear that? The siren sound?

324
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,280
- Yeah.
- Let's go check, maybe someone's hurt.

325
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,240
- Yeah, go.
- Hurry.

326
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,440
- Come on. We'll look tomorrow.
- Go.

327
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,720
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's go.

328
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,240
Hey, look.

329
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,160
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

330
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,200
- What is that?
- Let's see.

331
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,520
What happened? A fire?

332
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,920
They say a girl got injured.

333
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Do you know
which hospital they took her to?

334
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,440
No idea, but the ambulance went that way.

335
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,040
Doctor, doctor.

336
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,160
How's the patient inside?
Is she doing better?

337
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,600
She's stable now.
We've already treated the wounds.

338
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,960
Doctor, was it serious?

339
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,120
What are you to her?

340
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,720
I…

341
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,560
I'm her brother.

342
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,040
Then you should
call your parents immediately.

343
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,320
Your sister

344
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
has been through a lot.

345
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,960
Anyway,

346
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,600
let your family know as soon as possible.

347
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,080
Karn.

348
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,360
I heard about Bass.

349
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,280
What do you guys know?

350
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,520
I don't know anything yet.

351
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
We found out.

352
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,600
Jenny was behind everything.

353
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,880
Jenny tricked Bass
into going behind the school.

354
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,400
And then what? What did Jenny do?

355
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,800
I talked to a junior.

356
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,560
They said Jenny used a comic book
to lure Bass to the back of the building.

357
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,360
They told her the owner
of the comic got bitten by a dog.

358
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,560
And…

359
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,880
And then what?!

360
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,240
- Tell me!
- Karn.

361
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,200
- Tell me everything!
- Karn.

362
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,440
- Calm down. You hurt her.
- Calm down.

363
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,560
Calm down.

364
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,920
Why?

365
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,760
Why?

366
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,760
Why did you do it?! Huh?!

367
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,200
Answer me! Why?!

368
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,640
Why?!

369
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,240
Why are you all looking down?

370
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,960
Look at me!

371
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,840
2 MONTHS LATER

372
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,080
Bass.

373
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,920
Where are you?

374
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm waiting for you
at the basketball court like always.

375
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,440
Bass.

376
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
Are you okay?

377
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,160
If something's wrong, you can tell me.

378
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,680
Whatever it is,

379
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,760
please call me back.

380
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,120
Hey.

381
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,880
You finally got it today.

382
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,320
Oh, your friend came by earlier.

383
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,520
But she didn't buy anything.

384
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,640
She looked kind of sad.

385
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
She didn't seem well.

386
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
When did you see her?

387
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,320
About ten minutes ago.

388
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,200
Thank you.

389
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,600
Bass! Bass!

390
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,440
Bass! No, Bass!

391
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,560
I'm sorry.

392
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,800
I was never there in time to help you.

393
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,280
A new volume just came out.

394
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,280
I'm still waiting

395
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,040
for you to come read it with me.

396
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,120
You're going to wake up, right, Bass?

397
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,440
I'm sorry.

398
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,960
You're going to wake up, right, Bass?

399
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,960
Why…

400
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,440
Why didn't I get there sooner?

401
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,719
Bass.

402
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,400
Bass.

403
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,400
Wake up, Bass.

404
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,440
Bass! I said wake up!

405
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,760
Was it because of me?!

406
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,840
I was too late, wasn't I, Bass?

407
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,520
I'm sorry.

408
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,400
What should I do?

409
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
I'm sorry. Can you hear me?

410
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,840
She's not asleep.

411
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,320
She's just closing her eyes.

412
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,520
How do you know?

413
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,120
I know everything,

414
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,840
including your story,

415
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,800
and the one you came here for.

416
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,600
So what?

417
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,680
Does knowing help?

418
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,520
At least,

419
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,240
I can help this girl

420
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,280
wake up again.

421
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,160
Who are you?

422
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,920
A doctor?

423
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,400
I have no name.

424
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
People call me many things.

425
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
But one of them is…

426
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,120
the Reaper.

427
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,440
And what do I have to do?

428
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
Exchange your life for hers,

429
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,280
so you can take my place

430
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,920
on this train.

431
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,800
Hello, everyone.

432
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,840
For today's show, we have

433
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
a very special performance for you.

434
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,400
Please give a big round of applause
to our favorite band,

435
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,440
BandShi, performing

436
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,240
"<i>Khon Tee Took Rak,</i> The one who's loved"

437
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,800
<i>I don't know how long it'll take</i>

438
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,920
<i>To find someone's heart</i>

439
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,560
<i>I want to be the one who's loved</i>

440
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,160
<i>I want to be the one</i>
<i>Someone truly understands</i>

441
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,440
<i>To fill the emptiness inside</i>

442
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,600
<i>To bring me love</i>

443
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,680
<i>Please, let there be someone</i>

444
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,680
Let's keep it going. Give it up
for Rock and Soul with the song "Kneel."

445
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,040
<i>I'm here begging you, please don't go</i>

446
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,760
<i>I'm falling to my knees</i>
<i>Holding on to your legs</i>

447
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,800
<i>With both hands together</i>
<i>I bow and plead, please don't go</i>

448
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,200
<i>It's useless, I know, when love has faded</i>

449
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,200
<i>But if you still care for and love me</i>

450
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,760
<i>If our past still means something</i>

451
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,240
<i>Please don't leave me</i>

452
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,320
<i>Please don't hurt me</i>

453
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,120
Come on, give it up for Joey!

454
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,440
Alright, everyone, sing along!

455
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,360
- I'm here begging you…
- <i>I'm here begging you, please don't go</i>

456
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,040
<i>I'm falling to my knees</i>
<i>Holding on to your legs</i>

457
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,880
<i>With both hands together</i>
<i>I bow and plead, please don't go</i>

458
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,560
- <i>It's useless, I know, when love has faded</i>
- It's useless, one, two…

459
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,920
<i>But if you still care for and love me</i>

460
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,600
<i>If our past still means something</i>

461
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,160
<i>Please don't leave me</i>

462
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,120
<i>Please don't hurt me</i>

463
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,120
Yeah! Make some noise for Rock and Soul!

464
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Wow.

465
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,600
Woohoo!

466
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,680
That was amazing.

467
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,560
They're like
professional musicians up here.

468
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
And today, we're also

469
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,480
honored by the presence
of a very special guest,

470
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,200
who's opened this space

471
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,360
for young people
to share their talents in music.

472
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,200
Please welcome the university president

473
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,920
to the stage for a congratulatory speech

474
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,400
and to present certificates of recognition
to all the performers.

475
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
Please.

476
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,960
Hello. Hello.

477
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,880
Hello, everyone. Today,

478
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,240
I'd like to congratulate
all the young performers.

479
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,960
Siam Square
has opened its space for Thai youth,

480
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,480
and it's a place
where dreams are made possible.

481
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm truly delighted to witness

482
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,720
the talent and success
of these young people.

483
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,680
Yay! Please give him
a big round of applause!

484
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,720
And now,

485
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,120
the president

486
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,440
will present the certificates
to all participants

487
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,800
- who performed today.
- Yes.

488
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,520
Starting with our first band,

489
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,920
make some noise for Rock and Soul!

490
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,240
Hello.

491
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,200
<i>If we met again someday, I'd ask</i>

492
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,200
<i>Do you still remember me?</i>

493
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,720
<i>Would you smile at me again?</i>

494
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,920
<i>If we met again someday, I'd ask</i>

495
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,680
<i>To hold you close, like before</i>

496
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,440
<i>Let everything between us</i>

497
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,640
<i>Stay the same</i>

498
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,560
<i>Where did you go, Alice?</i>

499
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,920
<i>Are you really not coming back this time?</i>

500
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,360
No matter what happens,
I'll always feel the same about you.

501
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,560
Feel what?

502
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,840
Feel…

503
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,880
She…

504
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,800
might not make it through tonight.

505
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
You broke our promise, didn't you?

506
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,600
You lied to me?

507
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,080
