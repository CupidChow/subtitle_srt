1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,080
So, where is Punn?

2
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,280
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,120
HELP PUNN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S THINKING

4
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,400
Stop!

5
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,480
Stop!

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,960
Stop!

7
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,960
Alice.

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,640
Alice?

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,200
Alice, are you here?

10
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,920
Alice.

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Alice. Are you here?

12
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Alice.

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,360
Alice.

14
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,720
Have a drink.

15
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,520
You made Alice disappear, didn't you?

16
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,720
I haven't done anything.

17
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,960
Then why did you look at her today,

18
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,760
right before she vanished like that?

19
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,920
What was that?

20
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,760
We've completed all the missions.

21
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,120
Why hasn't Alice woken up?

22
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,400
How do you know

23
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
the mission is over?

24
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,360
What do you mean?

25
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,600
Did anyone die that day?

26
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,560
Hm?

27
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Your duty,

28
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
along with Alice,

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,880
was to free wandering spirits.

30
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
But that day,

31
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,680
you and Alice

32
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,560
changed fate.

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,240
What does that mean?

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,480
It means…

35
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
mission failed.

36
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm sorry.

37
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm sorry, Alice.

38
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,280
Was that a dream or was it real?

39
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,120
What did you dream about?

40
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Where were you?

41
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,520
I didn't go anywhere.

42
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
I've been here the whole time.

43
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,160
So that means

44
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,640
it was a dream, right?

45
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,840
Am I awake now? Or still asleep?
Or maybe sleepwalking, or…

46
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,480
You're awake now.

47
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,960
But last night, I saw you sleepwalking.

48
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,880
<i>You were wandering around,</i>
<i>completely blank.</i>

49
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,760
<i>I called you, but you didn't respond.</i>

50
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
<i>So I followed you quietly.</i>

51
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
<i>You walked around for a while,</i>

52
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,960
<i>then went back to your room.</i>

53
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,160
Is something wrong?

54
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,480
Yeah.

55
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,240
I was going to tell you.

56
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
Last night, I went looking for you.

57
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,240
I went to the hospital.

58
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,480
And I met Karn.

59
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,680
Maybe it was a dream,

60
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
but it felt so real.

61
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,520
He told me something.

62
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
What did he say?

63
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
He said we failed the mission.

64
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,280
That what we did was changing fate,

65
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,880
not freeing spirits.

66
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,480
That means
the mission automatically failed.

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
That means…

68
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,240
I can't come back to life, right?

69
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,920
No, no, no.

70
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
He didn't say that clearly.

71
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Let's go ask him again tonight.

72
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,400
Does it have to be at night?

73
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,440
Can we go now?

74
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
Maybe. Let's go.

75
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,520
Wait, get changed first.

76
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,840
Wait a moment.

77
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,440
I was just looking for you.

78
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,200
We need to talk.

79
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,880
P… Punn.

80
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,000
I…

81
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,720
I don't know… what's happening to me…

82
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Alice.

83
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,040
Alice.

84
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,840
Where are you?

85
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Alice!

86
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
Bring Alice back.

87
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,560
<i>I can lock you in here forever.</i>

88
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm not afraid.

89
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,320
<i>Punn. Punn.</i>

90
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,160
<i>Alice. Are you in here?</i>

91
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,080
<i>I don't know. It's completely dark.</i>

92
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,200
<i>Punn, I'm scared.</i>

93
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,920
<i>I don't think I can come back.</i>

94
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,920
<i>Please take care of yourself.</i>

95
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
No, Alice.

96
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,160
Karn.

97
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
Bring Alice back.

98
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,360
I'll do anything. Anything you want.

99
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,240
Just bring her back.

100
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,880
<i>This isn't a game</i>

101
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,400
<i>where you can restart after losing.</i>

102
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,760
<i>This is an agreement between us.</i>

103
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,600
<i>And you and Alice failed.</i>

104
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
Karn.

105
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Please, give us one more chance.

106
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,880
I'll exchange it with anything.

107
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Take my life.

108
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,960
Make me your servant.

109
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,160
I don't care.

110
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,640
<i>No, Punn, don't do that.</i>

111
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,040
<i>You've done enough for me.</i>

112
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,680
Then why didn't you tell me?

113
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,080
Why didn't you stop me?

114
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,200
I warned you.

115
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,520
Your duty

116
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,680
wasn't to stop people from dying.

117
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,480
Everyone on that bus was supposed to die.

118
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,560
But now they've all survived.

119
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,080
The action already happened.

120
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
How could I just let Phukan die?!

121
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,960
You.

122
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,920
That means

123
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,440
you've made your choice.

124
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,920
Alice!

125
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,120
Alice!

126
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,280
Alice!

127
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Alice.

128
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,800
What's happening?

129
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,880
Did he do what I asked?

130
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,920
I don't know.

131
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,480
Punn.

132
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,120
Look.

133
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,560
What's this?

134
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,160
You're giving us a chance?

135
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,040
I thought about it.
It'll be far more entertaining this way.

136
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
It's just like that day.

137
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,640
What day?

138
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,960
The day I drowned.

139
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,160
I'll give you both one more chance.

140
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,840
If you want to survive,

141
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,000
save yourselves,

142
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,880
not others.

143
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,200
Punn.

144
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,640
the time I drowned

145
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,200
was around four in the afternoon.

146
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,840
But now it's only a little after three.

147
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,480
So what do we do?

148
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,320
Does he want us to just watch

149
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,440
Paeng drown right before our eyes?

150
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,720
No, we can't.

151
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,720
Wait. If…

152
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,160
- it's 3:30 now,
- Mm.

153
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,400
That means

154
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,680
we're in the audition room, right?

155
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
Mm.

156
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,080
Hey, Nui. I'm swimming right now.

157
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,640
<i>Are you ready?</i>

158
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm so ready.
I've been preparing for this,

159
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,480
eating well,
sleeping enough, swimming hard

160
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,440
to get my lungs in the best shape
for the singing contest.

161
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
<i>You'll definitely win.</i>

162
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
<i>I did some digging.</i>

163
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,440
<i>I secretly watched</i>
<i>the other contestants' videos.</i>

164
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
<i>Well, it's not a secret.</i>

165
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,480
<i>They're all on YouTube.</i>

166
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,520
<i>And after comparing,</i>
<i>I can say for sure you're the best one.</i>

167
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,440
Thanks.

168
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,880
Let's go.

169
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,800
Maybe there's still a way

170
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,800
to save both Paeng and me.

171
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,480
If you save Paeng,

172
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,040
you might die again, Alice.

173
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,440
<i>But love commands me</i>

174
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,840
<i>To climb up there</i>

175
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,400
<i>- Since I was born to meet you…</i>
- Do you think

176
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,920
if we find someone else to help Paeng?

177
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,080
<i>…No matter what</i>

178
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,280
<i>- I'll try someday…</i>
- Would that be against the rules?

179
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,440
<i>To love is to risk</i>
<i>I don’t want you to be just…</i>

180
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,720
You already know, don't you?

181
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,600
It's impossible.

182
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,480
We were given
the chance to go back in time

183
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,240
to change what had already happened.

184
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,680
And this is the last chance, Alice.

185
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,800
We've already used up all the chances.

186
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,800
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Why?

187
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,240
It's because of you. Stay out of this.
Let's go, Alice.

188
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,400
- Ma'am, please calm down.
- Let's go.

189
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,119
- Ma'am.
- Stay out of this.

190
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,760
- Alice has the right to play music!
- Mom, let me go.

191
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,200
Right?

192
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,720
It's my right to decide her life.
Stay out of it!

193
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,040
- Go.
- Mom, let go of me.

194
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,360
Alice.

195
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,120
Alice, come back.

196
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,520
You have to make your choice carefully.

197
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,240
Don't tell me

198
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
that day, you came to the pool

199
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
because you were trying to…

200
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,120
Help!

201
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,120
Help me!

202
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Alice.

203
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,760
You only have one last chance.

204
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
Help!

205
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,920
Help!

206
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,880
Help!

207
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,120
Hold on.

208
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
Easy.

209
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,160
Almost there.

210
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
Hold on a bit longer!

211
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,200
<i>Alice!</i>

212
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
- Alice!
- Hey.

213
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,320
- What happened?!
- Ma'am, please step back.

214
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,840
- Alice, dear!
- Please step back.

215
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,000
- How did this happen?!
- Teacher.

216
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,240
- Hold her back.
- Did someone

217
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
- call an ambulance?
- I did.

218
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,120
- What happened?
- It's on the way.

219
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,880
- On the way.
- Two, three…

220
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,120
- What happened? What happened?
- Please, calm down.

221
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,360
- Ma'am, please.
- Calm down, please.

222
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,280
- Alice tried to help Paeng.
- I'm sorry…

223
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,560
- What's wrong?
- Ma'am.

224
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,080
One, two, three…

225
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,720
- The ambulance is coming.
- In the end, you made the same choice.

226
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,200
The ambulance is coming.

227
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
- Please, help her.
- Then why am I even trying to save you?

228
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,000
Teacher, has Teacher Phai arrived?

229
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,960
- Alice, my dear.
- He's here, just a moment.

230
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,960
- He's on the way.
- Sorry, Punn.

231
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,600
- Please hurry.
- Alice!

232
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,320
- But…
- Alice!

233
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,240
- One, two, three.
- Alice!

234
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,520
I made my decision and I stand by it.

235
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,560
Honestly, I'm not even sure that

236
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,440
if I had woken up that day,

237
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,920
my dream would've come true.

238
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,160
In the end,

239
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,560
my mom probably
would've done the same thing.

240
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,120
But at least, Paeng's dream

241
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,240
might be more achievable than mine.

242
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,320
Because she has a chance.

243
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
So, how does it feel

244
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,760
getting to revisit your choices

245
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,200
and your past?

246
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,120
Do you understand the world
a bit more now?

247
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,360
Fine. I'll say it for you.

248
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Humans are like this.

249
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,160
They are

250
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,520
what they are.

251
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,480
They can't change.

252
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,160
It's not that fate can't be changed.

253
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,520
It's people who don't change.

254
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,680
Alice.

255
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,800
The reason you made that choice

256
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,800
wasn't because

257
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,840
you were kind

258
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,880
or selfless, not because you wanted
someone else to live instead of you.

259
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,400
Not at all.

260
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,320
You were afraid.

261
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,600
You were so weak.

262
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,880
You didn't fight for your own life.

263
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,760
You gave up from the start.

264
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,160
Stop it.

265
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,480
That's enough.

266
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,040
No, Punn.

267
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,400
Everything he said

268
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,160
is true.

269
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,080
Well.

270
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,600
Alright then.

271
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,280
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

272
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,920
Alice will remain

273
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,640
in her wandering spirit form

274
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,040
for only five more days.

275
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,120
After that, you will be gone

276
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,120
along with the very breath

277
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
that keeps your body alive.

278
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,560
Both will end together.

279
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,480
Five days.

280
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,440
And don't forget the promise

281
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
you made to me, boy.

282
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,120
What promise, Punn?

283
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,360
Where the hell is Punn?

284
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,640
Is he okay?

285
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,840
Should we go check at his house?

286
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,400
Why?

287
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,640
You think he's dead at home or something?

288
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,480
You never know.

289
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,800
Oh.

290
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,720
Punn.

291
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,320
Where have you been?

292
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,480
And Alice? Is she with you?

293
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
What? Hey.

294
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,680
Is something wrong?

295
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,880
Yes.

296
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
What is it?

297
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,920
Tell us now. Spill it.

298
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
We've been waiting
for you and Alice forever.

299
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,920
Alice only has five days left…

300
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,520
before she dies for real.

301
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,880
- Huh?
- Huh?

302
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,840
So what do we do now?

303
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,440
So,

304
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,160
what about that mission you mentioned?

305
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,360
You said if you completed it,
Alice would come back.

306
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
It's over.

307
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,800
If she really has only five days left,

308
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,240
and nothing else can be done,

309
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,520
then maybe we find something
we want to do with the time that's left.

310
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,160
Let's make it meaningful.

311
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,440
Yes.

312
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,600
If I knew I was going to die soon,

313
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,600
and I secretly liked someone,
I'd just tell them straight out.

314
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,360
I think

315
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,720
we should all help think about it.

316
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,240
If we had only five days left to live,

317
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,720
what would we do?

318
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Okay then.

319
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,080
Let's ask Alice.

320
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,160
- That's a good idea.
- Mm.

321
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Alice, tell us what you want to do.
We'll help you.

322
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,880
I…

323
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,480
I want to finish the song.

324
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,960
It's in my laptop.

325
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,040
Good afternoon, ma'am.

326
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,000
What are you all doing here?

327
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,440
Uh…

328
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,120
We came to pick up something for Alice.

329
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,520
Something for Alice?

330
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,480
What do you mean? I don't understand.

331
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,680
Uh, well,

332
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,200
we'd like to get Alice's laptop.

333
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,920
There's a song she was working on,

334
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,840
and I want to help finish it.

335
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,880
So when she wakes up,

336
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,440
she'll be happy
to know her song is complete.

337
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,160
Why are you looking around like that?

338
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,840
Are you thinking my room's messy?

339
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,120
No, not at all.

340
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,240
Wow.

341
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,720
My room never feels this girly.

342
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,360
It smells really nice and clean.

343
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,240
Maybe I should
change her clothes tomorrow.

344
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,720
What's the password, Alice?
You want me to type it?

345
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,520
No, I'll do it.

346
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,480
Alright.

347
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,520
- Do you want me to find the file?
- No.

348
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll look for it myself.

349
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,600
Alice?

350
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,800
Alice? Is she around here?

351
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,040
Um…

352
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,600
We often talk about Alice,

353
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,960
pretend she's still here with us.

354
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
That's right.

355
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
You're talking as if Alice is dead.

356
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
But you said it like that first, ma'am.

357
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,720
How could Alice be right here?

358
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Anyway…

359
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
if there's anything I don't know

360
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,920
about Alice,

361
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,640
please tell me.

362
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
I want to know everything about her.

363
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,400
Mom.

364
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,520
We'll get going now, ma'am.

365
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,640
Please visit her sometimes
if you have time.

366
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,040
She's all alone there. She must be lonely.

367
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,360
- We will.
- Yes.

368
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,280
Sure.

369
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,200
Mm.

370
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,040
Mom.

371
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Alice.

372
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,800
I feel like Alice's here somewhere.

373
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm right here.

374
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,840
Mom.

375
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,920
I love you.

376
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,120
Ma'am.

377
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,600
I think you should

378
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,240
spend more time with Alice than before.

379
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,600
She might be lonely being alone there.

380
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,520
We'll also

381
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,840
try to visit her at the hospital

382
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,560
as often as we can.

383
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,360
Alice.

384
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,120
Let's go.

385
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,360
You guys go ahead.

386
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,160
I want to stay here a bit longer.

387
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,160
Let's go.

388
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,800
Okay. Let's go.

389
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,000
We'll go ahead.

390
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,639
Dad, is that you?

391
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Alice. You're finally home, sweetheart?

392
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,440
You've been here this whole time?

393
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,160
Where else would I go?

394
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,160
I have to stay with you.

395
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,040
If I'd known you were here,
I never would've gone anywhere.

396
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,240
I've always been here,
watching over you and your mom.

397
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,120
Alice.

398
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,320
Don't be angry at Mom.

399
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,960
She only wanted
to make my dream come true.

400
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,080
She wanted you to become a doctor,

401
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,640
to fulfill what I never achieved.

402
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,320
But that wasn't fair to you.

403
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,720
It's okay.

404
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,760
I'm happy to do it for both of you.

405
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
I just want to make you proud.

406
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,200
You have to have your own dreams.

407
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
Don't live someone else's dream.

408
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,360
I always told you.

409
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,200
Don't study so hard
that you forget to live.

410
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
Life has many sides.

411
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,400
But Mom

412
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
probably just missed me too much,

413
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,520
and wanted you to give everything up.

414
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,760
I miss you too, Dad.

415
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,040
If I ever get another chance to go back,

416
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,960
I'll make both your dreams come true.

417
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,680
Alice.

418
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,840
Don't forget your own dream.

419
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,360
I never forced you.

420
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,600
And now,

421
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,720
I think your mom finally understands you.

422
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,080
Come here.

423
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,240
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,960
- I'm sorry.
- No, dear.

425
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,040
It's not your fault.

426
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,760
I missed you so much, Dad.

427
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,400
When we're done studying,
let's go wait for Alice at the studio.

428
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,880
Alright, all set.

429
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,040
THE THINGS I MUST FACE

430
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,000
THE THINGS I MUST ENDURE

431
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,920
THE DARKNESS THAT DEVOURS MY HEART

432
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,080
Do whatever you want, Alice. Finish it.

433
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,200
Yeah, I have to hurry.

434
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,960
It's a rush job, deadline work, you know.

435
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,920
Otherwise, I won't make it.

436
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,280
What's with you, Punn?

437
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,640
Nothing.

438
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,720
I'm hungry. What should we eat tonight?

439
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,400
Duck noodles at Samyan again?

440
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,600
No way. I'm sick of that.

441
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,480
Wanna go to my place?

442
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,280
I'll cook.

443
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,920
Alright.

444
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
You don't want to?

445
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,560
Fine, let's go.

446
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,080
- Here you go.
- <i>On my birthday this year</i>

447
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,080
<i>Could you come back to me?</i>

448
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,360
- <i>Please hold me again…</i>
- It's gonna be good.

449
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,520
Whoa, that's a lot.

450
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,280
<i>…Like the days when we were in love</i>

451
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,080
<i>I'll keep waiting right here…</i>

452
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,440
- Those two are not helping at all.
- They're chilling.

453
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,920
- <i>…Even though I know…</i>
- You know how to do it?

454
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,560
- It's easy.
- <i>…You're never coming back…</i>

455
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,080
- Of course I can do it.
- Okay.

456
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,760
Here are the vegetables.

457
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
Come on, let's make it fun.

458
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,520
<i>Could you come back…</i>

459
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,960
Can I request a song?

460
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,760
- You're not helping anyway.
- Hey.

461
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,520
- I'm focusing here.
<i>- Happy birthday to me</i>

462
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,760
- You're even louder.
- <i>I'll keep waiting right here</i>

463
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,920
<i>Even though…</i>

464
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
I'm starving.

465
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,320
I misunderstood.

466
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,840
I saw you guys buy all that ingredients

467
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,440
and thought I'd get to taste
something fancy

468
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,400
from our master chef, Chef Punn.

469
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,320
I heard he's really good at cooking.
He cooks for himself every day.

470
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,920
Turns out

471
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,520
it's BBQ.

472
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,920
Oh, come on.

473
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,640
BBQ is not that simple.

474
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,440
I had to prep the meat, the veggies,
and everything for you guys.

475
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,240
Nana had to help chop the veggies too.

476
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,520
Not that easy, you know.

477
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,760
- Okay.
- But still, it's great.

478
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,080
I was actually craving this.

479
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,880
Yeah, I'm gonna crash here tonight.
I'm too lazy to go home.

480
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,360
Who's even going home tonight?

481
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,960
- We're all sleeping here.
- Oh?

482
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,360
I'll take the sofa downstairs.

483
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,760
When did you guys plan that?

484
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,240
Wait, wait, wait.

485
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,400
I'm the only girl here.
Where am I supposed to sleep?

486
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,520
With Alice, of course.

487
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,440
And where does Alice usually sleep?

488
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,720
Hey.

489
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,600
I'll ask Alice for you.

490
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
So, usually,

491
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,440
where is Alice at night?

492
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,200
Well.

493
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,000
Some nights she's with me, I guess.

494
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,520
Whoa.

495
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,560
- Wow.
- Some nights?

496
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,280
Not every night?

497
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,840
You crazy?

498
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,960
You're dodging the question.
So mysterious.

499
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,880
Come on.

500
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,000
After we eat, let's play a game.

501
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,880
I think I'll just sleep after this meal.

502
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,120
Wait, it's only early evening.
What's the rush?

503
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,160
You think this is
a one-and-a-half-hour buffet?

504
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,560
This is all-you-can-eat
with no time limit.

505
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,920
You'll be stuffing yourselves
until midnight.

506
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,520
Yeah, and talking, arguing,
roasting each other.

507
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,800
We'll probably stay
until five in the morning.

508
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,320
I can stay until 7 a.m.

509
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,640
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

510
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,440
- You can stay alone.
- Please sleep.

511
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,160
<i>It's a shame</i>

512
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,920
<i>I didn't get to know you all sooner</i>

513
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,280
<i>when I was still alive.</i>

514
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,200
<i>I regret so many things</i>
<i>I didn't get to do in life.</i>

515
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,840
<i>But I don't have</i>
<i>any more chances to do that.</i>

516
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,440
<i>I regret not playing</i>
<i>in the same band as you.</i>

517
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,520
<i>I regret not traveling together,</i>

518
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,680
<i>not sharing adventures,</i>

519
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,040
<i>tears, excitement,</i>

520
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,120
<i>and success with you all.</i>

521
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,040
<i>And…</i>

522
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,720
<i>I regret that</i>

523
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,120
<i>I'll never have the chance to love again.</i>

524
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,920
<i>Alice.</i>

525
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,720
Alice.

526
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Alice!

527
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Alice!

528
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,200
<i>Don't forget the promise you made to me.</i>

529
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,320
What promise?!

530
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,120
<i>The promise to give me your life.</i>

531
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,040
<i>What's coming next</i>

532
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,080
<i>is a world of endless boredom.</i>

533
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,880
<i>Here.</i>

534
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,240
You can read it first.

535
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,800
Just return it to me after.

536
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,680
If something's wrong, you can tell me.

537
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,040
Basketball guy?

538
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,920
<i>Bass! Bass!</i>

539
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,760
<i>Bass! No, Bass!</i>
